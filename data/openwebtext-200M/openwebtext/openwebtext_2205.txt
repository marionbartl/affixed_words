Rawstory —
An Ohio Democratic lawmaker and former presidential candidate has presented articles of impeachment against President George W. Bush to Congress .
Thirty - five articles were presented by Rep. Dennis Kucinich to the House of Representatives late Monday evening , airing live on C - SPAN .
“ The House is not in order , ” said Kucinich to Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) , upon which Pelosi pounded her gavel .
“ Resolved , ” Kucinich then began , “ that President George W. Bush be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors , and that the following articles of impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate . …
“ In his conduct while President of the United States , George W. Bush , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of president of the United States , and to the best of his ability preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , has committed the following abuses of power … ”
The first article Kucinich presented , and many that followed , regarded the war in Iraq : “ Article 1 – Creating a secret propaganda campaign to manufacture a false case for war against Iraq . ”
On several occasions , Kucinich referenced RAW STORY and its noted investigative news chief , Larisa Alexandrovna , as source material for the articles .
Kucinich , a 2004 and 2008 Democratic candidate for the White House , abandoned a prior attempt to begin impeachment proceedings against Bush in January of this year .
In April of 2007 , Kucinich presented impeachment articles against Vice President Dick Cheney , but the effort went nowhere .
Kucinich exclaimed that “ impeachment may well be the only remedy which remains to stop a war of aggression against Iran . ”
Before leaving office in January 2007 , Rep. Cynthia McKinney–currently a Green Party presidential candidate –introduced articles of impeachment against President Bush as her last act in Congress , but that effort also was fruitless .
Congressman Kucinich has laid out an extensive indictment of the president .

Anne Robinson has presented the Weakest Link since 2000
The BBC has received complaints after Anne Robinson asked a contestant to feel her breasts during a celebrity charity version of The Weakest Link .
TV wine - taster Olly Smith felt Robinson 's breasts after referring to the 63 - year - old presenter as a " full - bodied , expensive red " .
The BBC stressed it was a " playful and light - hearted " exchange .
But 16 people complained about the incident , which was broadcast at teatime on Saturday .
Hit show
The programme was watched by 5.5 million people , the BBC said .
It featured 10 contestants from the world of food and wine , including TV chefs Sophie Grigson and the Hairy Bikers .
The exchange came after Robinson told Smith - who appears on Saturday Kitchen and Richard and Judy 's Wine Club on Channel 4 - that she did not like being called " full bodied " .
She then invited Smith to feel her breasts , who declared them to be " absolutely fantastic " .
The Weakest Link has been a hit around the world since it first aired in 2000 .
It moved to BBC One in February to fill the slot left by long - running soap Neighbours , which moved to Five .
Oregon : the land of volcanoes , beautiful coastline , forests … and trash ?
Unfortunately , that might be the case if Hawaii gets its way .
According to the Portland Tribune , Honolulu is quickly running out of space in their main landfill .
In order to prevent overflow , the city has hatched a plan to send ships full of garbage up the Columbia River in Oregon , where trash will be put on trucks and trains headed to the Columbia Ridge Landfill .
It may seem strange that Hawaii wants to send its trash to a state known for being so environmentally conscious .
Interestingly enough , that ’s exactly why they want to do it .
Oregonians recycle over 50 percent of their waste , so the state has plenty of excess space .
And Hawaii is n’t the only state taking advantage of this generosity .
Oregon is the fifth largest importer of garbage in the country , and nearby Seattle sends over 2 million tons of trash a year to the Columbia Ridge Landfill .
Is this how we want to treat states that recycle ?
It is certainly true that other states have to put their trash somewhere , but it is a shame that we are rewarding Oregon for environmental awareness by giving them excess trash .

Shoes designed by Mimura , officially known as wet - grip soles , were on the feet of Mizuki Noguchi of Japan when she ran through the sometimes marbled and wet streets of Athens to win the women ’s marathon at the 2004 Summer Olympics .
He also made the footwear for Stefano Baldini of Italy , the 2004 men ’s Olympic marathon champion , and the racing shoes  without rice husks  for Naoko Takahashi of Japan , who won the women ’s marathon at the 2000 Sydney Olympics .
Noguchi was quoted in a Japanese news report as saying that she slept with the rice - husk shoes next to her pillow the night before the 2004 Olympic victory .
At the finish line in Athens , she took off one of her racing flats and kissed it .
Later , she called Mimura the “ god of shoes . ”
Last fall , Noguchi said that she would wear an updated version of her “ magic shoes ” to defend her title in Beijing .
Hall , the American , read a news - agency account of her remarks and became intrigued .
This spring , running in a different model of Asics shoes , he finished fifth at the London Marathon and joined the list of marathon medal contenders at the Summer Games .
“ I ’m looking for a shoe to get excited about , ” Hall said .
“ If you ’ve got a shoe that somebody wants to sleep in the bed with , that ’s a pretty good shoe . ”
( Actually , Noguchi kept the shoes in her bedroom , but not next to her pillow , Mimura said with a laugh by telephone , speaking through an interpreter from Asics ’s headquarters in Kobe , Japan . )
Hall and Kastor said they planned to give the rice - husk shoes a thorough test drive to measure cushioning and stability .
If they are not satisfied , they will run the Olympic marathon in more generic Asics models .
Even under the best of circumstances , marathon runners face sore and swollen feet , blisters and the occasional wandering toenail .
Nike and Adidas say they have their own grip technologies involving the use and placement of certain rubber compounds on the soles of shoes .

“ It ’s kind of like when you ’re dating a girl , ” Hall said .
“ For some , it takes two days for them to know that ’s the person they ’re going to marry .
For some , it takes four years .
You ’ve got to believe in your shoes .
I ’m as curious as everyone else about what makes this shoe so special . ”
It was around this time last year that The U.S. Attorney Mess really started to give in earnest .
From that point , it just kept on giving right through the spring and summer -- from the April resignation of Monica Goodling , who played a role in the controversial firings of eight U.S. attorneys , to the resignation of her boss , former AG Alberto Gonzales in August .
Lo and behold , it continues to give .
Now , according to a recent report from NPR , the DOJ 's inspector general , Glenn Fine , during the course of his investigation into the U.S. Attorney mess began investigating a related topic :
Whether a career attorney in the department , Leslie Hagen , was dismissed from her job because of rumors that she 's a lesbian .
According to the NPR report , people interviewed by the inspector general 's staff say they came away with the impression that the AG 's office decided not to renew Hagen 's contract because of the talk about her sexual orientation .
A former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota , Tom Heffelfinger , recruited Hagen in October 2005 to come to Washington from Michigan , where she 'd been a federal prosecutor .
The job Hagen filled at Justice comes up for renewal every year .
According to NPR 's DOJ sources , she 'd hoped to stay in the position rather than return to Michigan as a prosecutor .
Hagen received the highest possible ratings for her work as liaison between the Department and the U.S. attorneys ' committee on Native American issues , and her superiors wanted her to stay on , according to the NPR report .
But in October 2006 , the AG 's office notified Hagen that her contract would n't be renewed .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates took action Monday to dramatically reorient the leadership of the Air Force , calling for the nomination of the first non-fighter or bomber pilot to lead the service since its inception after World War II .
His recommendation that Gen. Norton A. Schwartz , who began his military career as a cargo pilot , be nominated by President Bush as Air Force chief of staff marks a significant shift in Air Force leadership .
Over time , the move could lead the service to give more emphasis to missions that support ground wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan , such as cargo flights and in - air refueling , over more traditional roles like air dogfights .
Schwartz is head of U.S. Transportation Command , which coordinates the Pentagon ’s worldwide transportation operations and manages military logistics .

Last week , after receiving a classified report critical of the service ’s oversight of the U.S. nuclear arsenal , Gates fired the civilian and military heads of the Air Force .
In recent months , he and other Defense Department officials have been critical of Air Force leadership on a range of issues , including concerns that the service had not done enough to shift its spending priorities to unmanned reconnaissance drones and was lobbying too hard for advanced fighter jets .
In a speech here Monday , Gates said the Air Force ’s failure to properly oversee America ’s nuclear weapons was the only reason he felt he needed to change the service ’s leadership .
He admitted to disagreements with Air Force leaders , but said such friction was normal .
Still , there is little doubt that Schwartz ’s nomination , expected shortly , will be seen as ushering in a new era .
After Gen. T. Michael “ Buzz ” Moseley was fired as chief of staff last week , many had expected that Gen. John Corley , a fighter pilot and head of Air Combat Command , would replace him .

But senior defense officials said that Gates wanted to make a dramatic move to signal a clear break with the past .
One official said Gates was looking for an Air Force chief who did not come with a fighter pilot ’s “ call sign ” nickname .
Officials said that in bypassing the “ fighter mafia ” for the chief of staff position , Gates is sending a message that the Air Force needs to focus more on Iraq and Afghanistan , where he has struggled to get the service to provide more unmanned reconnaissance drones .
Schwartz does have experience in combat aircraft .
He participated in the 1975 evacuation of Saigon and has piloted the heavily armed AC - 130 gunships , the workhorse of special forces .
On Monday , Gates cited Schwartz ’s long list of assignments in so - called joint commands -- positions where senior officials work in units made up of officers from all four military services .
Among other postings , he was deputy commander of the Special Operations Command and director of the Joint Staff , which supports the Joint Chiefs .

Gates said he chose Schwartz because of his intelligence and attention to detail .
As the new chief , Schwartz will be charged with improving nuclear oversight , modernizing the aging fleet of tankers and figuring out what kind of fighter planes to build .
“ I just felt that Gen. Schwartz brings fresh eyes to these issues , ” Gates said in a news conference on a plane en route to Colorado Springs , Colo .
“ He is very smart , he is very process - oriented . ”
But it clearly was not lost on Gates that the appointment would break the fighter and bomber communities ’ long lock on Air Force leadership .
“ This is about the transitioning Air Force , ” Gates said .
A retired Air Force general praised Gates ’ action , arguing that improving airlift and tanker operations , as well as aerial reconnaissance , should be the service ’s top priority .

“ To tell you the truth , I think they needed to get away from an Air Force fighter guy , ” the retired officer said .
Many officials and former officers interviewed requested anonymity , wary of speaking publicly about the nominations because they were unsure whether Gates intended to make more changes .
In Gates said he was trying to instill a deeper ethic of accountability in all the military services .
The services must be “ willing to admit mistakes when they are made , ” he said .
“ That is the only way to fix them -- and it is the only way to ensure that they do n’t recur in the future .
. . .

“ I have noticed that none of the services easily accept honest criticism from outside their branch , or scrutiny that exposes institutional shortcomings , ” he said .
“ This is something I believe must change across the military -- for these critiques are often the most valuable . ”
Despite Gates ’ comments , both senior and mid-level Air Force officers think that Moseley was ousted , at least in part , because of his aggressive support for purchasing additional F - 22 fighter planes .
Some of Gates ’ advisors see the plane as expensive and of limited value in fighting unconventional wars like those in Iraq or Afghanistan .
But many in the Air Force ’s fighter community think it is crucial because of the proliferation of sophisticated anti-aircraft systems in countries such as Iran and China .
The controversy surrounding Moseley ’s leadership has divided the Air Force , with some current and former officers lamenting his demise and fretting that his departure could spell the end of the F - 22 .
Its production contract runs out next year .

On the other hand , an increasing number of Air Force officers have begun to argue for sacrificing the F - 22 , saying the fight has weakened the service in the eyes of the Pentagon ’s civilian leadership .
To this group , the Joint Strike Fighter , a smaller and cheaper fighter under development , will provide adequate air superiority and allow the dispute to end .
In his remarks Monday , Gates said he was trying to minimize the anxiety the firings had caused .
He praised the efforts of airmen in Iraq and Afghanistan , and said that although their role got little attention , it was deeply valued .
“ Put simply , without your contributions in the skies , and in many cases on the ground , America ’s war effort would grind to a halt , ” Gates said .
Gates also said he would end further cuts in the size of the Air Force , which is in the middle of eliminating 40,000 positions .
Halting the cuts would leave the Air Force with about 330,000 personnel , down from 356,000 in 2006 .

Schwartz ’s new role is seen as the key move in a broader shuffle that Gates announced Monday .
He also recommended that a veteran Pentagon official , Michael B. Donley , replace Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne , who is leaving at the end of the month .
The White House said that Bush intended to nominate Donley and to designate him acting secretary until he is confirmed .
In addition , Gates said he recommended that Bush nominate Lt. Gen. William M. Fraser III as the Air Force ’s vice chief of staff and Gen. Duncan J. McNabb , the current vice chief , as Schwartz ’s replacement at U.S. Transportation Command .
All of the nominations require Senate confirmation .

The confirmations of Schwartz and Fraser , a veteran of the service ’s bomber community , would mean that no officer with a fighter background would be in either of the Air Force ’s top two spots .

Barnes reported from Langley Air Force Base and Spiegel from Washington .
WHEN Sue Gordon was four , in the late 1940s , the authorities took her from her aboriginal community in outback Western Australia , put her on a train to Perth and handed her over to a Christian charity home .
As a mixed - race child , she grew up as one of Australia 's “ stolen generations ” ordered to obliterate her aboriginal heritage .
Now 64 , and a juvenile - court judge , Ms Gordon has just finished assessing an equally controversial government takeover of aboriginal lives .
And she is surprisingly impressed .
After a report in June last year revealed widespread aboriginal violence and child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory , John Howard , the former conservative prime minister , ordered police and the army to take control of 60 remote indigenous communities .
Aborigines make up 29 % of the federal territory 's population , compared with 2 % nationally .
Mr Howard 's measures included compulsory health checks on children , confining the spending of welfare money to food and clothes , and the suspension of the communities ' rights to grant permits to visitors .
Critics at the time blasted the “ emergency intervention ” , as it was called , as a draconian return to the white paternalism that aborigines had fought for generations .
But after visiting more than half the 73 communities eventually involved , Ms Gordon has found good progress in cutting violence and sexual abuse : alcohol and pornography have been banned , more children are going to school and police patrols have left more women feeling safer .
After Ms Gordon 's report , Kevin Rudd , the Labor leader who succeeded Mr Howard in November , has undertaken to continue the A$ 900 m ( $ 864 m ) intervention exercise with another A$ 300 m — but not indefinitely , as Mr Howard had planned .
Since Mr Rudd 's formal apology in February for past injustices , there is now pressure on aborigines to take advantage of the big - brother approach and secure self - reliant futures free from government .
Most of the Northern Territory communities stemmed from the land - rights movement of the 1970s , which allowed white Australia to absolve its guilt for kicking the original inhabitants off those lands .
Government services did not follow the award of land , but alcohol , unemployment and social breakdown did .
Ms Gordon is “ aghast ” at arguments that the communities should now be closed altogether and their people shipped out , just as in the bad old days .
She accepts , though , that their survival can come only from developing their own economies with help from the private sector .
This is starting to happen already in resource - rich regions such as Western Australia .
Andrew Forrest , whose company , Fortescue Metals , is making a fortune from that state 's iron ore , has formed a trust to help mainly indigenous children .
Mr Forrest told a recent forum in Kalgoorlie , a gold - mining city , that mining firms could eradicate aboriginal poverty by helping to create 250,000 jobs in the next decade .
That may be optimistic .
But Ms Gordon herself has set the example .
She has raised almost half of the A$ 5 m needed to buy the land where she lived in a charity home 60 years ago .
She plans to build a place where she and other surviving inmates can care for each other in retirement .
Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee
The title of this post is purely fiction at this point , but is what this writer believes should happen .
Undoubtedly you ’ve heard by now that the General Motors factory in my hometown of Janesville is closing .
What many ( politicians and residents alike ) are not considering is the massive trickle down effect this is going to have on the rest of Janesville as a large source literally abandons the city .
Sure the UAW has ensured that many of the employees at General Motors are not going to feel any financial pain for a long - time , but thousands of others are not as fortunate .
Employees of Janesville - based GM part suppliers ( of which there are many ) are going to receive next to nothing as they lose their jobs in coming years .
And that ’s just the start
This massive unemployment will have the effect of putting the hurt on numerous other local companies and institutions .
The School District of Janesville will be faced to downsize in the face of falling property tax values ( despite just having passed the largest referendum in Wisconsin history ) .
Mercy Health System will certainly feel some pain as the number of patients remains largely steady , but their ability to pay diminishes .
Oh , and the massive number of chain food choices ( both fast and sit - down ) that exist along Milton Avenue , look for their numbers to greatly diminish .
Assuming nothing drastic happens ( read : no large employers opens shop in town or there is no mass migration from the city )
Janesville residents are largely looking at a future of under - and - un- employment .
Many of the GM employees will be offered jobs at other plants , but that does n’t include suppliers and those who relied on serving them ( the service industry the city seems to want to tout now ) .
To make matters worse , long - time Janesville employer Gilman ( now split into two companies ThyssenKrupp Krause Inc. and ThyssenKrupp Drauz Nothelfer ) announced they were closing and eliminating all 140 jobs .
This was a local employer that at one time not too long ago employed nearly 500 people in Janesville , my father included .
Politicians , including Janesville - natives Senator Russ Feingold and Representative Paul Ryan , are already calling for aid packages or more money to be sunk into the city to encourage new employers in Janesville .
Most of the companies that have recently opened ( or considered opening ) shop in Janesville are in the warehousing and distribution industry , an industry highly susceptible to losses from rising fuel costs ( much like the SUV ’s made in Janesville are ) .
Spending money on tax breaks and credits to attract industry to Janesville seems like a losing battle does it not ?
Especially since they did just that a few years ago , and now are asking General Motors to pay the state back .
The fact is that companies will either consistently search for the best tax deal ( leading to a long - term losing game for cities ) or for the best existing environment .
Beloit largely has Janesville beat on location in the wake of soaring fuel costs .
Beloit is located at the intersection of Interstate ’s 43 and 39/90 and is closer to Milwaukee , Rockford , and Chicago .
Why would the state look to continue to pour money into Janesville then ?
Good question .
The state should instead take a radical approach .
Jim Doyle and company should largely encourage the unemployed in Janesville to move to Milwaukee ( or Madison ) .
Why ?
There are more jobs in the Milwaukee area , and Milwaukee certainly has the capacity to create more jobs ( look no further than the redevelopment occurring Menomonee Valley and soon the 30th Street Corridor ) .
The old adage of “ it takes money to make money ” holds true in the globalization era .
The big cities like Chicago are getting bigger and stronger , while the stagnant towns like Janesville and many other manufacturing towns are getting smaller .
The ironic fact is that a migration of residents to Milwaukee could actually reduce the unemployment in Milwaukee .
Creating a larger base of skilled / trained individuals for jobs should only attract more companies to the region , or to expand operations in the case of existing ones .
How do we achieve this migration ?
Create marketing plans for Milwaukee , bring in relocation specialists to help the unemployed find work in Milwaukee , and offer tax incentives for relocating families .
While Wisconsin politicians for obvious reasons can not advocate residents to move to Chicago , the Windy City offers a substantial number of opportunities , arguably more than Milwaukee .
How do we preserve home values in Janesville and help Janesville adjust structurally ?
Implement an aggressive urban growth boundary that prevents building outside of designated areas to preserve the value of existing homes .
This will not only limit of the dilution of home values , but encourage urban infill ( through the redevelopment of existing properties ) and encourage Janesville to kick to structurally kick its oil habit through reduced drive distances .
The City Council of Janesville must also actively seek to make opening businesses in Janesville as easy a process as possible .
They should also seek to improve the efficiency of existing employers .
Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Department of Highways ( formerly Transportation ) should also implement a legitimate mass - transit from Janesville to Milwaukee .
While Van Galder / Coach USA provides a route to Madison , and Chicago , there is not a mass - transit to Milwaukee .
In fact when I go to visit my parent ’s house , I must first take a bus to Madison , then transfer to another to Janesville .
Janesville has a substantial agricultural base on which it can seek to orient itself around in the “ ethanol era ” where food prices currently only go up .
The most difficult thing that must be done in Janesville is to redevelop the Delevan Drive Industrial Corridor , for as it turns out Gilman and General Motors were not only in the same city , but next - door neighbors .
This will likely mean dividing those properties into smaller units so businesses can locate there .
Wisconsin needs to do everything in its power to avoid Janesville becoming like Flint and so many other towns that have lost their largest employer .
That starts with not pouring money into Janesville to give residents false hope .

Ein schönheitschirurgischer Eingriff in der modernsten Schönheitsklinik Europas muss nicht zwangsläufig teuer sein .
Billig und teuer sind ohnehin relative Begriffe .
Denn gespart werden kann überall – doch bedenken Sie , im medizinischen Bereich geht dies auf Kosten ihrer Gesundheit .
Der Begriff “ preiswert “ scheint uns bei chirurgischen Eingriffen eher angebracht .
Mangelnde Einhaltung der internationalen Hygienevorschriften , veraltetes Instrumentarium , keine Originalmedikamente sondern billige Imitate ( sogenannte Generika ) .
Diese schwarze Liste könnte noch beliebig fortgesetzt werden , um mögliche Sparpotenziale aufzuzeigen .
Erwähnt sei an dieser Stelle der PIP - Skandal .
Es handelt sich dabei um gefährliche Brustimplantate , die hauptsächlich von Billiganbietern verwendet wurden und im Verdacht stehen Krebs verursacht zu haben .
Ein Austausch von hunderttausenden Implantaten ist notwendig .
Man ist es gewohnt , skeptisch zu werden , wenn einem ein Luxusauto um wenige tausend Euro angeboten wird .
Sollte diese gesunde Skepsis nicht auch geweckt werden , wenn hochqualitative Dienstleistungen wie eine Brustvergrößerung , Facelift oder Fettabsaugung deutlich unter Marktwert angeboten werden ?
Ja – so eine günstige Operation kann auch gut gehen .
Aber anhand unserer zahlreichen Korrekturoperationen sehen wir , dass es zumeist doch nicht gut geht .
Auf einmal sind sie doppelt belastet : Zusätzliches
Geld für die Nachkorrektur muss ausgegeben werden und zwar für ein Ergebnis , welches besser hätte sein können , wenn sie anfangs die richtige Wahl getroffen hätten .

The Borders site says self - published authors can even arrange readings in local Borders stores , but the kinks still need to be worked out .
“ It is not possible to purchase a place on shelves or an author event today , ” a spokeswoman for Borders said .
Borders lists its self - publishing program under the rubric “ Borders Lifestyles , ” as if writing were a hobby , like golf , rather than a calling or a craft .
But for those seeking formal training , there are hundreds of creative writing programs offering M.F.A. ’s and other credentialing .
The Association of Writers and Writing Programs represented 13 programs when it was founded in 1967 .
Now it includes 465 full - fledged courses of study , and creative writing classes are offered at most of the 2,400 college English departments in North America .
Since the ’60s , creative writing programs have helped “ democratize ” the talent pool , providing “ the encouragement to women and a lot of different people of different classes and ethnicities to tell their stories and write their poems , ” said David Fenza , the organization ’s executive director .
He disagrees with those who think an oversupply of books is pushing readers away .
“ Some have argued that all this new literary activity is displacing the Great Works and therefore estranging the great audience for literature , ” Fenza said .
“ Writing programs have their faults , but they still work as advocates for the mind that reads . ”
Mark McGurl , an associate professor of English at the University of California , Los Angeles , and the author of a forthcoming book on the impact of creative writing programs on postwar American literature , agrees that writing programs have helped expand the literary universe .
“ American literature has never been deeper and stronger and more various than it is now , ” McGurl said in an e-mail message .
Still , he added , “ one could put that more pessimistically : given the manifold distractions of modern life , we now have more great writers working in the United States than anyone has the time or inclination to read . ”
Self - publishing companies may produce books for less than $ 5 , but how much does all this production cost readers ?
In “ So Many Books , ” Zaid playfully writes that “ if a mass - market paperback costs $ 10 and takes two hours to read , for a minimum - wage earner the time spent is worth as much as the book . ”
But for someone earning around $ 50 to $ 500 an hour , “ the cost of buying and reading the book is $ 100 to $ 1,000 ”  not including the time it takes to find out about the book and track it down .
On the whole , Zaid is unworried about the proliferation of books , though he does n’t think everyone should set pen to paper .
“ About would - be writers , André Gide used to say : ‘ Découragez ! Découragez !’” ( discourage ! ) , Zaid said in an e-mail message .
“ The implication was that real writers would not be discouraged , and the rest would save a lot of time .
Of course , some mediocrities are never discouraged , and some potential real writers would be lost .
But there is so much talent around that we can afford it . ”
Indeed .
There ’s a lot of noise out there , and some of it is music .
On June 12 , United announced it will add a $ 15 fee for first checked bags .
United ’s policy applies to tickets purchased on or after June 13 for travel on or after August 18 — yes , the fee takes effect one day after its announcement .
Ever since American broke from the pack and added the fee a few weeks ago , it has seemed a foregone conclusion that similarly cash - strapped airlines would follow suit .
United ’s new fee , then , comes as little surprise , even though passengers were furious with American and will likely have choice words for United as well .
But the airlines know most passengers need to check bags , and the financial benefit from charging for this “ service ” is apparently too appealing to resist .
So the question becomes : Will other airlines follow suit ?
We may get an answer very soon .
According to The Arizona Republic , US Airways is strongly considering a first - checked - bag charge , and may announce the fee as early as today .
The airline may also begin charging for soft drinks .
Soft drinks !
We ’ll have more on the US Airways story as it develops , and keep an eye on other carriers as well .
If US Airways does add a fee for first checked bags , it ’s hard to imagine the remaining legacy lines wo n’t do the same .
Editor ’s note :
As you probably know , US Airways did in fact add a $ 15 first - checked - bag fee and a beverage charge .

A recent working paper finds that we call the same decision immoral when it leads to a bad outcome , but moral when it leads to a good outcome :
Two studies investigated the influence of outcome information on ethical judgment .
Participants read a series of vignettes describing ethically - questionable behaviors .
We manipulated whether those behaviors were followed by a negative or positive consequence .
As hypothesized , participants judged behavior as less ethical when it was followed by a negative consequence .
In addition , they judged the behavior as more blameworthy and to be punished more harshly .
Participants ’ ethical judgments mediated their judgments of both blame and punishment .
The results of the second experiment showed again that participants rated behavior as less ethical when it led to undesirable consequences , even if they saw that behavior as acceptable before they knew its consequences .
Implications for both research and practice are discussed . …
We show that outcomes of decisions lead people to see the decisions themselves in a different light , and that this effect does not depend on misremembering their prior state of mind .
In other words , people will see it as entirely appropriate to allow a decision ’s outcome to determine their assessment of the decision ’s quality . …
The tendency demonstrated in our studies might lead people to blame others too harshly for making sensible decisions that have unlucky outcomes . …
Too often , we let ethically - questionable decisions slide for a long time until they result in negative outcomes , even in cases in which such outcomes are easily predictable .
The religious right group American Family Association ’s OneNewsNow site seems to have an automatic filter that replaces the word “ gay ” with “ homosexual . ”
Because they want to use the more harsh sounding term , perhaps ?
So when runner Tyson Gay won the 100 meter race at the U.S. Olympic track and field trials over the weekend , here ’s what the news site wrote :
The article has since been corrected .
However , this article mentioning basketball player Rudy Gay , still needs some fixing …

Austria 's governing coalition collapsed today and a snap election looked set for September after conservatives declared they could no longer work with the Social Democrats of Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer .
Accused of poor leadership and unpopular within his own ranks , Mr Gusenbauer said he would not seek re-election as chancellor and recommended acting party chairman Werner Faymann for the job , a shuffle expected to be approved .
Dr Gusenbauer was stripped of his party leadership position last month after a series of regional election setbacks .
The conservative People 's Party demanded an early election for the sake of " clarity " in government .
" Enough is enough .
Good work in this government is no longer possible , " party chief Wilhelm Molterer , who is also vice chancellor and finance minister , told a news conference .
" The Social Democrats are without orientation or leadership .
We ca n't let the Social Democratic crisis become an Austrian crisis . "
Should the conservatives win the next election , as polls now suggest , Austria could resume privatisations of state - owned firms including Telekom Austria and Austrian Airlines .
Shares in both companies firmed today .
A conservative - led government is also likely to continue pension and tax reforms it started during its previous reign .
As I was reading through some of my favorite movie sites this morning , I came across a great little article over at Cinematical where they listed what they thought were some of the best Superhero casting decisions in film ( you can check their article out over here .
I did n’t agree with much of it , so I thought instead of critiquing their list , I ’d just give my own .
DON ’T FORGET … THIS LIST IS NOT ABOUT THE BEST MOVIES … nor is it about who ended up doing the best job .
That ’s all 20 /20 hindsight .
The list for for who was the best casting choices going INTO the movies in question .
Feel free to add your own picks in the comments section below :
1 ) PATRICK STEWART ( Professor X )
This is hands down , without question and without any doubt the single most “ perfect ” casting decisions in comic book movie history .
Patrick Stewart was genetically bread to play professor Charles Xavier .
Long before they even thought about doing an X - Men movie , for over 10 years whenever any discussion came up about “ dream casting for an X - Men movie ” , Patrick Stewart was ALWAYS at the top of the lists .
No question , Patrick Stewart as X is the best casting in a Comic Book movie of all time .
2 ) ROBERT DOWNEY JR ( Tony Stark / Iron Man )
There was a lot of speculation floating around regarding who would play Iron Man once they announced they were moving ahead with the movie ( as there always is with these Comic Book films ) , but one name that no one really thought about was Robert Downey Jr. until they announced that he would indeed play Tony Stark .
It caught everyone by surprise … but once his name was announced everyone stood up and said “ Holy crap that ’s PERFECT ! ”
And indeed it was perfect .
The key to pulling off Iron Man was pulling off Tony Stark … and if Tony Stark really was alive in the real world … his name would be Robert Downey Jr .
3 ) RON PERLMAN ( Hellboy )
Not a lot of people in the mainstream movie going audience were familiar with who or what Hellboy was before the movie version came out .
But for those who DID know who and what Hellboy was , the announcement of Ron Perlman as big Red seemed as obvious as the answer to the question “ excuse me sir , would you like a blow job ? ” YES !
The voice , the mannerisms and to some degree even the physical stature all screamed Hellboy .
Brilliant casting .
4 ) GENE HACKMAN ( Lex Luthor )
Really , what can be said about Gene Hackman that has n’t been said a thousand times before ?
Already a world renowned actor having won the Oscar for best actor in 1972 , Hackman brought credibility to a very risky film in 1978 … Superman .
he made being the bad guy in a comic book movie a cool thing .
Well … let ’s be honest … anything that Gene Hackman does automatically becomes “ the cool thing ” .
The guy could masturbate in a children ’s playground and it would suddenly become socially acceptable .
5 ) CHRISTIAN BALE ( Bruce Wayne / Batman )
There is no more coveted role in the comic book genre than that of the Batman .
However , the role also became one of the biggest risks ever since it had been practically ruined by the George Clooney effort and to some degree the Val Kilmer one too ( Do n’t get me wrong , I thought they were both good castings too … but the last movie was SOOOO bad it almost single andedly killed the comic book genre of movies all together until X - Men resurrected it ) .
Again , like Downey , Bale ’s name was not one of the top one ’s being thrown around at all … but when they announced him , people who knew Bale ’s work stood and cheered .
It was a bit of a gamble , but we knew it was a great choice .
6 ) EDWARD NORTON ( Bruce Banner / The Hulk )
Ok , so we ’ve got this character … he ’s an almost middle aged , skinny but cerebral and intense character … any ideas ?
Yeah … how about Edward god damn Norton ! in casting the lead character for The Incredible Hulk , you do n’t cast for the Hulk … you cast for Dr. David Banner , and if you can make it one of the best actors in the business today , then that ’s a bonus .
Getting Edward Norton on board brought some instant and much needed credibility to the new Hulk film that so many people thought was a bad idea .
An excellent choice and a bold risk for Norton to take .
7 ) KEVIN SPACEY ( Lex Luthor )
Lex makes a second appearance on this list .
No one , and I mean no one was n’t excited and pumped when the word came out that Kevin Spacey was going to play Lex Luthor .
But unlike Robert Downey Jr in Iron Man… Spacey ’s casting came as no surprise .
People had been calling out for Spacey to play the iconic villain for years ever since they saw him as the fake Dr. Evil in Austin Powers 2 ( how weird is that ? ) .
Getting him on board to play the antagonist was a no brainer .
8 ) THOMAS JANE ( Frank Castle / The Punisher )
This was one of those situations where I really could n’t properly see anyone playing the main character … until they said it was going to be Thomas Jane .
The dude ( in my opinion ) was the perfect guy to bring The Punisher to flash and bone life .
No offense intended to Dolph Lungren fans ( hehe ) .
Great decision for a not so familiar comic book character to main stream audiences .
9 ) TOBEY MAGUIRE ( Peter Parker / Spider - Man )
This one falls much into the same category as the Hulk casting .
When getting your guy , you do n’t think about Spider - Man per se .
You focus on getting your Peter Parker .
Someone who could still pull off a screen presence and could act … but he has to be Peter Parker .
Getting Tobey Maguire in the role fulfilled that mission VERY well .
Maguire brought name recognition with him as well to the part which is always something studios want with their multi-million dollar investments in a comic franchise if they can get it .
10 ) JENNIFER GARNER ( Elektra )
What ’s that you say ?
You need an absolutely beautiful and stunning woman who will look great in tight leather , but can also kick insane amounts of ass ?
Hmmmm … sounds like a job for Sydney Bristow from Alias , Jennifer Garner became famous for traveling around the world as Bristow , beating the living hell out of evil agents and super spies … and holy crap he ’s in INSANE shape too .
She also was a big name at the time which helped .
You may not like how Daredevil turned out ( personally I liked it ) but you ’ve got to admit she was THE choice to play that role .
BitTorrent is used by many to download missed TV shows Bill Thompson believes Virgin Media has decided it likes record companies more than its customers .
The chances are that I 'll be getting a letter from my internet service provider ( ISP ) in the next few weeks telling me that they 've been watching my network activity closely and think I 've been breaking the law .
Virgin Media , who used to be called NTL before they acquired Virgin Mobile and turned themselves into a " four - play " media company , has announced that it is working with record industry lobby group , the British Phonographic Industry , to write to customers whose network connection seems to have been used to download unlicensed content .
Like almost every technically - competent internet user of my acquaintance I 've used BitTorrent to get my hands on a copy of a TV show that I missed , taking advantage of the kindness of strangers who bothered to record and upload the shows for fans because the companies that make and broadcast them choose not to .
However I also go out and buy the DVD box sets as soon as I can .
And I do n't feel like a criminal , because I do n't see why downloading a copy of a show that someone else has recorded should be seen as a breach of copyright while recording it myself onto a DVD is not .
According to the BPI 's press release the letters are part of a " new education campaign to help Virgin Media 's broadband customers safely download music from the internet and avoid the risk of legal action " .
At the moment it 's hard to use BitTorrent anonymously , although since the service itself is entirely legal and legitimate there should be no need to do so
Bill Thompson
But from the outside it seems more like a softening up move to get Virgin customers used to the fact that they are being observed by their ISP .
And I predict Virgin will be happy to help the BPI identify individual account holders so that they can be threatened with prosecution over their downloading activities later on .
The move follows a campaign by the BPI to persuade UK ISPs to adopt a " three strikes and you 're out " approach to downloaders , where they would have their network connection terminated if they were found to be downloading unlicensed material after two warnings .
This has n't happened , not least because the two sides can't agree who would pay the costs of monitoring or sending letters , or who would be liable for the inevitable lawsuits when innocent users decided that arbitrary disconnection without due process was likely to prove unpopular in the courts .
They should be careful who they sue .
Researchers at the University of Washington recently announced that they had managed to fool US film industry body the MPAA into sending formal legal notices to three laser printers , claiming that they had been downloading copies of Iron Man and Indiana Jones .
Fake IP addresses
They had set up their network to fake the relevant internet addresses and the software used by the MPAA was unable to spot this .
Virgin will be on slightly firmer ground because it's their network , and although some users may claim that they have open wireless networks that could have been used by anyone the buck will stop with the account holder .
There continues to be concerted pressure from established content providers in film , television and music , hoping that aggressive enforcement of copyright law will ensure that their 20th Century business models survive against the onslaught of the network society .
I believe it 's a doomed enterprise , as the growth of a fast internet coupled with the ability to make perfect copies of digital content means that all of the assumptions that underpin film studios , TV broadcasters and record companies have been stripped away , leaving them flailing around , threatening and suing the people who should be their best customers and hoping to persuade politicians to pass new laws to give them special privileges online .
As more licensed download services become available , many offering songs without usage restrictions enforced by digital rights management technologies , the wholesale copying of unlicensed copies becomes a lot less defensible .
But the habits that grew up when the music industry was simply unwilling to accept that downloading was the way forward - and the technologies that support those habits - will be hard to break .
Heavy downloaders
Evidence that heavy downloaders are also heavy music purchasers does n't seem to have made any difference to the BPI 's approach either , and instead of finding new business models they hold on to the old ways of working .
It gets more complicated because the larger ISPs in the UK , Virgin , Sky and BT , are also content providers with their own interests in shoring up the current copyright regime .
Virgin do n't want programmes they have paid to distribute ending up on the internet for people like me to download , but by acting in concert with trade bodies they can appear socially responsible rather than simply serving their own broader interests .
The spaces within which we can live unobserved are constantly diminishing , as both public and private sector agencies link their databases together or co-operate to ensure that nothing we do goes unremarked .
We need a space for experimentation , where we can test the limits of old laws and explore how they might be altered in future , but once ISPs decide that they are no longer neutral carriers of bits and choose to ally themselves with the content industry then we lose another sliver of freedom .
At the moment it 's hard to use BitTorrent anonymously , although since the service itself is entirely legal and legitimate there should be no need to do so .
The moves by Virgin and other ISPs will simply spur the development of new ways of sharing files , just as the clampdown on Napster lead directly to the development of the current generation of peer to peer networks .
Virgin has just given its thousands of users an incentive to explore these new tools in order to confuse their administrators .
After all , we pay them to move my bits around , not to go running to the record company if they suspect us of downloading unlicensed music .

A French court has refused citizenship to a Moroccan woman , ruling that her practice of Islam is too " radical " and she is too submissive to be compatible with basic French values .
The Conseil d'Etat , France 's highest court , said her religious practices were " incompatible with essential values of the French community , particularly the principle of equality of the sexes " .
Until now , the court had rejected only Muslim applicants deemed sympathetic to fundamentalist groups .
The 32 - year - old Moroccan woman , named as Faiza M , lives with her French husband and their three children , all born in France .
The family practise Salafism , which involves a strict interpretation of Islamic dress - codes and personal status law , and as such Mme M wears a black burqa that covers her body except her eyes .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mme M , who has lived in France since 2000 , had asked the court to overturn her failed 2005 citizenship application , which was rejected because of " non-integration " .
But the court upheld the decision , citing her strict dress code and private life as reasons .
Emmanuelle Prada - Bordenave , the government commissioner who delivered the ruling , said Mme M had presented herself for interviews with immigration officials " attired from head to toe in the clothing of women from the Arabian peninsula , with a veil covering her hair , forehead and chin and a piece of cloth over her face .
Her eyes could only be seen through a small slit .
She lives virtually as a recluse , disconnected from French society .
She has no concept of laïcité [ the French doctrine of religious neutrality ] nor the right to vote .
She lives in total subservience to the men in her family . "
Legal experts say Mme M can reapply for nationality if she can prove that " she has assimilated the values of the Republic " .

TOKYO , June 2 ( Reuters ) - Japan has bought a partial 25,000 tonne cargo of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) from trading house Itochu Corp 8001.
T to store in its national reserves , an industry source said on Monday .
State - run Japan Oil , Gas and Metals National Corp ( JOGMEC ) bought about 14,500 tonnes of propane and about 10,500 tonnes of butane at a premium of $ 43 a tonne to Saudi Aramco ’s June contract prices , the source said .
JOGMEC said last month it was seeking 15,800 tonnes of LPG for the Nanao storage facility in Ishikawa Prefecture and the remaining 9,200 tonnes for the Fukushima storage facility in Nagasaki Prefecture .
The two facilities , which were built in 2005 , will be at near - capacity after the purchases .
The cargo will be delivered between July 1 and Aug. 10 , the source said .
State - run Saudi Aramco has set its
June contract price for propane at a record - high $ 895 a tonne , up $ 50 from May .
The company also raised its June butane price by $ 60 from May to an all - time high of $ 920 a tonne .

Dependency Injection in C++
My apologies on the double post – I accidentally clicked “ create new page ” :0 )
A really valuable technique birthed in the Java world is the idea of dependency injection .
That is , instead of a class having to create it ’s own object :
class Foo {
public Foo( ) {
bar = new Bar ( ) ;
}
private Bar bar ;
}
( forgive my Java , it ’s been awhile . )
You pass in the object in its constructor , like this :
…
public Foo( Bar newBar ) { bar = newBar ; }
…
Of course , then , someone else has to be responsible for creating the bar object , so really , you end up just passing in object factories , or having a factory do all your setup for you .
( The passing in of object factories case ) :
interface BarFactory {
public Bar BuildBar ( ) ;
}
class NormalBarFactor implements BarFactory {
public Bar BuildBar ( ) { return new Bar ( ) ; }
}
class TestBarFactory implements BarFactory {
public TestBar BuildBar ( ) { return new TestBar ( ) ; } //where TestBar inherits from Bar …
}
class Foo {
public Foo( BarFactory barFactory ) { bar = barFactory .
BuildBar ( ) }
}
( And in the object configuration factory way … )
class Foo {
public Foo( Bar newBar ) { bar = newBar ; }
}
class FooBuilder {
public Foo BuildFoo( ) { return Foo(new Bar( ) ) } ;
}
class TestFooBuilder {
public Foo BuildFoo( ) { return Foo(new TestBar ( ) ) ; }
}
As you can see , either of these approaches is really just variations on a theme .
The idea is that Foo , until runtime , does not know what kind of Bar it is using .
This provides two major benefits , one , as you can see above , it eases testing .
We can create test versions of objects , called “ Mock Objects ” to pass into the class we want to test .
These mock objects are simplified versions of objects that the tester controls very closely , making it easier to test Foo in isolation .
Additionally , with our mock objects being an example of this , this approach also allows infinitely configurable objects .
This greatly increases reusablility of anything we build , and instead of going the old way of creating yet another object per configurable item , we instead just create the basic underlying class generically and plug in it ’s dependencies when we need one .
For instance , if we needed a single threaded Foo and a multithreaded Foo , pure object inheritance and old style object oriented design might tell us to have both types of Foo inherit from some interface , and we differ their threading behavior based on the two implementations .
But now what if we have another variation in Foo ’s , maybe we have one that is designed to deal with a certain protocol – say , deal with information coming in from the web , while another Foo is designed to deal with information coming in from a local database .
Now , really , we have to build 4 foos , a single threaded internet one , a single threaded database one , a multithreaded internet one , and a multithreaded database one .
Vary security policies , memory management issues , and other things , and you can see how object hierarchies can explode with what might be called “ cross- cutting concerns . ”
Using dependency injection solves this , by creating only one Foo object and allowing the caller to vary the threading policy or data sink independently , as needed .
This is also called the “ Bridge Pattern ” , among other things .
If you belong to the camp that claims patterns are simply proof of missing language features , then the Bridge Pattern might be seen as an object - oriented ‘ solution ’ to the problems solved by what ’s called Aspect Oriented Programming , however , we ’re not going to get into that right now .
There are some minor downsides to this approach , as it incurs a runtime penalty as all these polymorphic objects are created , and the caller must also know a little more about the object its creating – breaking encapsulation , to a degree .
Additionally , more overhead is required as a bunch of boilerplate factory objects need to be created .
For C++ , you can use the exact same solution – pass in factory objects to another object ’s constructor and then use the factory to configure the constructed object at runtime .
The same upsides and downsides exist .
However , luckily , with the use of templates , there is a better way .
The “ factory ” pattern used in dependency injection , if again , you belong to the camp that believes patterns are proof of missing language features , could be seen as an object - oriented solution to treating classes and types as first class objects .
That is , to say , in some languages , you cannot directly pass Types around by themselves , as arguments .
In languages that you can , such as via C++’s templates , the factory pattern disappears .
How does this affect dependency injection ?
Well , since dependency injection , and the bridge pattern , make very heavy use of the factory pattern , it simplifies these two approaches a great deal .
And while pure aspect - oriented programming is still beyond C++’s reach , clever use of templates brings you very close .
I guess you could say that using templates to solve the bridge pattern is providing a generic solution to an aspect problem , rather than an object solution to an aspect problem .
To do “ generic dependency injection ” ( GDI ) , which I ’ll differentiate from “ object dependency injection ” ( ODI ) from here on out , in C++ , you still go through the same mental processes in ODI to find the classes that you think may vary , or in the case of testing , you want to isolate your object from to test for .
class Foo {
public :
Foo( ) { bar = new Bar ( ) }
private :
Bar * bar ;
} ;
In the above , like our Java example , this class is still the Bar class .
We do n’t want the Bar class to be coupled with our Foo class , which it currently is , but we do n’t want the overhead of building all those object factories either .
And before anyone complains – yes , I know I left out the freeing of bar in the destructor , and moreover , it would have probably been easier just to make bar a value instead of a pointer , or used boost : : shared_ptr .
We ’ll be leaving out those details for simplicity .
Once we ’ve recognized that Bar and Foo are coupled , we ’ll pull out the Bar type into a template , rather than having Foo know about it .
template < typename BarType >
class Foo {
public :
Foo( ) { bar = new BarType ( ) }
private :
BarType * bar ;
}
Voila , now in our release code , we simply create
Foo like this :
Foo < Bar > …
and in our test code , we create Foo like this :
Foo<TestBar > …
Our Foo object is completely decoupled from the type of Bar it ’s using , at compile - time .
This increases runtime efficiency but maintains strict typechecking .
If you ’re a fan of “ Modern C++ Design ” , you ’ll see that we ’re co-opting “ Policy based design ” for testing purposes .
Policy Based design is the proper name for using templating to solve the bridge pattern in general , of which GDI for testing is a specific application .
I ’ll be talking more about this subject in the future , some of its drawbacks and some potential solutions .
Namely , what happens now for the object that needs to create a Foo ?
Does it now need to know which Bar it wants
Foo to use ?
It used to simply be able to create a Foo( ) , now it has to fulfill a template argument .
Luckily , with some template tricks , we can use functional techniques to make this not the case .
I ’d also like to discuss the strengths GDI has over ODI , namely , that it ’s use of types falls far closer to “ Duck Typing ” found in languages like Python , but unlike Python , we still keep strict typechecking .
Finally , I ’d also like to talk about some specific C++ strengths that good templating and use of RAII have in the relm of unit testing .

The Democrats are n't the ones falling apart , the Republicans are .
The Democrats can see daylight ahead .
For all their fractious fighting , they 're finally resolving their central drama .

In what could be a breakthrough in cancer therapy , researchers report in The New England Journal of Medicine today that they succeeded in bolstering a patient 's immune system enough to wipe out late - stage malignant tumors on its own .
The scientists say the successful experiment could pave the way for new treatments of advanced cancer that spare patients the side effects of chemotherapy , which kills healthy as well as malignant cells .
This is not the first time that researchers attempted to use immunotherapy — or a patient 's own infection - fighting cells — to try to destroy tumors .
But researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle say this is the first time such a therapy worked on its own , without combining it with drugs or chemotherapy .
Lead study author Cassian
Yee , an immunologist , says that he and his team removed so - called CD4 +
T cells ( a type of infection - fighting white blood cell ) from a 52 - year - old man with stage IV ( the most advanced ) melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer ; it had spread to a lung and a groin lymph node .
The researchers grew T cells ( that target a specific protein , or antigen , on the tumor cells ) in the lab until they had a population they believed was large enough to destroy the cancer .
They infused five billion of the cloned cells into the patient .
Two months later , PET ( positron emission tomography ) and CT ( computed tomography ) scans did not reveal any tumors — and the patient has remained disease - free for two years , Yee says .
" This is the first example that I can think of where someone actually grew CD4 +
T cells outside the body and gave [ them ] back and got results , " says Willem Overwijk , an immunologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , who was not involved in this study .
Both Yee and Overwijk describe the CD4 +
T cells as " helper " T cells , because they are known to trigger other T cells in the body to grow .
Among the cells they affect are so - called killer T cells ( or CD8 + T cells ) that attack tumor cells .
Yee says the injected T cells remained active in the patient 's body for at least 80 days — and that the tumors vanished even though only 50 to 75 percent of their own cells released the targeted protein or antigen ( known as NY - ESO - 1 ) .
" This shows that we were able to broaden the immune response to other tumor [ proteins ] , possibly by harnessing the [ T cells ] already present in the patient , " Yee says .
Although pleased with the results ,
Yee cautions that the approach thus far has only been tested in one patient .
He plans to conduct a larger trial on 10 to 20 patients over the next year or so .
If that trial — and subsequent ones are successful — he says the therapy could be a viable treatment option within five years .

Perl Mongers
HackOff 2008 is all over
On July 15th Wellington Perl Mongers hosted a ' HackOff ' event - and it was fun !
Even if you missed the event , you can still join in the fun by solving the problems listed below .
What was it all about ?
From the original email announcement ...
HackOff 2008 is a fun evening for teams of hackers to compete at solving programming problems .
Remember when coding was fun ?
Before you got bogged down with UML diagrams , architecture planning meetings , spec documents , units tests and user documentation ?
For one evening , we 'll take you back to how coding was meant to be - see a problem , solve it , move on .
The first team to solve all the problems will be declared the winners and will receive the adulation of their peers .
Plus there was beer and pizza .
How did it work ?
We ended up with 5 teams on the night ( a sixth team had to withdraw due to illness ) .
Each team comprised 2 - 4 people , with one or more laptops connected over wireless to the competition web server .
Once the teams were all logged in to the web server , the first question was made available .
The teams downloaded a data file from the server and set to work ' decoding ' ( and I use that term very loosely ) the file to reveal a ' token ' .
Here 's an example of a token :
ETGJXSFH
When a team successfully revealed a token , they would type it into the web server , which would validate the token and then make the next question available .
The web application also gave teams the opportunity to show their work - upload program files or shell command histories etc , for later analysis .
It 's important to note that although this was billed as a programming competition , there was no requirement that teams use only their own code .
All teams had full internet access for using search engines , downloading software packages and submitting files to web services .
The only thing that mattered was finding the right answer as quickly as possible .

The results
The official start time was 6:30 pm although it was a few minutes after that when the first question became available .
The chart below shows the progress of all the teams as recorded by the web server in minutes from 6:30 ...
As you can see , Team Amorphous took an early lead .
Team Cabbage caught up by question two , moved into the lead with question three and maintained the lead through to the end .
After 8:00 pm , when Team Cabbage were declared the winners , Team Orange and The Terminators packed up and moved on to socialising .
However Starsky and Hutch kept plugging away and eventually completed the third question at around 9:30 ( not shown on the chart ) .
The problems
Even if you missed the event , you can still join in the fun .
Listed below are the same 5 questions that were used on the night .
For each question there is a data file and a ' hint ' .
The correct solution ( token ) is also listed but this is largely redundant because in each case it 's pretty obvious when you 've solved it .

WASHINGTON  Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign has gone through its second shake - up in a year .
Responding to Republican concerns that his candidacy was faltering , Mr. McCain put a veteran of President Bush ’s 2004 campaign in charge of day - to - day operations , and stepped away from a plan to have the campaign run by 11 regional managers , Mr. McCain ’s aides said Wednesday .
The elevation of Steve Schmidt  who worked closely with Karl Rove  at Mr. McCain ’s headquarters represented a sharp diminishment of the responsibilities of Rick Davis , who has been Mr. McCain ’s campaign manager since the last shake - up nearly a year ago .
The shift was approved by Mr. McCain after several of his aides , including Mr. Schmidt , went to him about 10 days ago and warned him that he was in danger of losing the presidential election unless he revamped his campaign operation , two officials close to the campaign said .
The move of Mr. Schmidt is the latest sign of increasing influence of veterans of Mr. Rove ’s shop in the McCain operation .
Nicolle Wallace , communications director for Mr. Bush in the 2004 campaign ( and in his White House ) , has joined the campaign as a senior adviser , and will travel with Mr. McCain every other week .
We 're still a bit unconvinced about this whole " using our own energy to induce motion " thing , but if you got restless leg or some other siren call to the bicycle , the Lithium Vivi RX - 10S seems the way to go .
Panasonic is launching the bike in Japan this August , and stuffed in some fancy hybrid car - style regenerative braking to set it apart from the pack ( though Sanyo does have something similar ) .
There are four levels of assistance electric motor assistance , which means you 're probably going to end up peddling now and then , but the bike 's range with regenerative braking to power a secondary battery is almost 78 miles , compared to 56 miles without it .
You 'll obviously benefit more if you have a lot of hills and " stop and go " type stuff on your commute , but that 's certainly nothing to scoff at .
The brilliant inventor Ray Kurzweil creates a computer avatar named Ramona ( Pauley Perrette ) .
He raises her like a modern - day Pinocchio , and she gradually acquires consciousness .
Ramona detects a secret attempt by microscopic robots to destroy the world , but her warnings are ignored by everyone because she is not recognized as a person .
Her computerized nature lets her stop the robot attack but lands her in trouble with the law .

Another great video catch by Jed :
When McCain was asked last year at a Candidates@Google event how his GPA compared to President Bush 's C average at Yale , McCain offered up some straight talk , my friends :
McCain : My GPA earned me fifth from the bottom of my class at the Naval Academy status .
So , the GPA was based -- since that was in the Coolidge administration it was a different measurement , but I can assure you in today 's standards it would be barely passing .
For good measure , Jed adds to that a clip from a January interview with Politico 's Mike Allen where McCain admits that he's " an illiterate " who lacks the ability to utilize decades - old technology .
At least Bush knows how to use " the Google . "
One note , if the McCain campaign is going to rely so heavily on his military service to make the case that he 's more fit to be commander - in - chief , why wo n't the media actually take a look at his military record , especially considering he freely admits he placed 894th out of 899 in his class ?
Oh , that 's right .
Apparently it 's a secret .
When John Kerry refused to release all of his military records before the election in 2004 , which he subsequently did , the press relentlessly pushed him to do so .
So why is McCain getting a complete pass ?
Are there any real journalists left in the U.S. who are n't part of McCain 's base ?
Apparently not .

I ’ve killed a lot of aliens in my day .
Short ones , fat ones , creepy ones and obnoxious ones , but I ’ve reached a point where they all look the same .
What I have n’t gotten over yet is that no matter how advanced an invading race may be , they never seem to evolve past humanoid forms of weaponry and architecture .
Sure the little buggers can bend the space - time continuum and travel faster than the speed of light , but they still have to wander endless fluorescent - lit hallways and wait for pneumatic doors to open .
Video game aliens are interesting , but there ’s seldom anything alien about them .
Not the case for Prey .
As an escaped abductee in an alien environment , you have to relearn almost everything about , you know , hallways , doors , and killing people .
The first hour of your escape feels senseless and arbitrary , but is n’t that how it should feel ?
You ’ve been abducted by aliens , for Christ ’s sake !
Questions arise like how did this inter-dimensional portal get in the air duct ?
Why am I walking upside down on the ceiling ?
When did I become so tiny , and start orbiting a tiny planet encased in glass ?
Who makes a shotgun that fires acid ?
And is that fleshy blastopore a door , or a corrosive - expelling anus ?
He could not understand the silverware on the ceiling .
Unfortunately , the second hour brings more familiar questions like will I ever not get ambushed after taking four steps on an upside - down sticky wall walk ?
What do you call an in - game puzzle after being asked to solve it for the tenth time ?
Why must all immortal game heroes have the same awful stringy black hairdo ?
If I ca n’t die why are you offering me different difficulty levels ?
Why even give me health at all ?
And what was this game about , again ?
Sooner or later , we all visit the shooting gallery of death ... for a couple seconds before respawning right where we left off ...
Something tells me we wo n’t have answers to these questions until humanity has evolved enough to go abducting some of their own off - world species .
The Physicist 's Bill of Rights
We hold these postulates to be intuitively obvious , that all physicists are born equal , to a first approximation , and are endowed by their creator with certain discrete privileges , among them a mean rest life , n degrees of freedom , and the following rights which are invariant under all linear transformations :
In the contentious political debate over embryo stem ( ES ) cell research , both proponents and opponents begin with the premise that " embryos are destroyed for their cells , " as President Bush claims and non-partisan journalists repeat frequently in stem cell news stories .
It 's only when partisans get beyond this premise that opinions diverge .
Proponents of ES cell research argue that embryo destruction is justified based on the promise of extraordinary medical advances .
In contrast , the President and his supporters describe ES cell derivation as " the taking of innocent human life , " which is " always immoral . "
And yet , in strictly biological terms , the conventional wisdom is wrong .
No life is being " taken " or destroyed when embryos are transformed into ES cells .
To understand the relationship between embryos and ES cells , it is critical to understand the process of development that is initiated by fertilization .
The single - cell embryo undergoes multiple rounds of division giving rise to about 100 cells after five to six days .
At this stage , the cells along the surface undergo biochemical changes that eliminate their potential to differentiate into anything other than the placenta .
And in the center of the embryo , only about two dozen cells retain the ability to develop into every tissue and organ that makes up the human body proper .
These central cells are , by definition , embryonic stem cells .
They -- and they alone -- will divide and morph into the entire fetus and child .
These cells are also the ones that can be retrieved and grown in a Petri dish .
If you and I and every other human being emerged entirely from a group of ES cells in the embryo , and ES cells in a Petri dish are biologically equivalent to ES cells in an embryo , then what is destroyed in the process of growing ES cells ?
According to conventional wisdom , ES cells do not have the potential to become a mature organism because they can't produce the placenta , which is required to nourish the fetus to term .
( In fact , human ES cells -- unlike mouse ES cells -- have been tweaked into producing placental tissue . )
And yet , over a decade ago , the Canadian embryologists Andras Nagy and Janet Rossant invented an experimental trick to overcome this deficiency .
The trick is to sandwich a dozen or so ES cells in - between two freshly created embryos manipulated so that each of their cells contains double the normal diploid ( 2X ) number of chromosomes .
The tetraploid ( 4X ) embryonic cells are entirely incompetent in regards to fetal tissue development , but they retain the capacity to form a normal placenta .
In the presence of this placenta , ES cells take over full responsibility for developing all the tissues of the fetus .
With this protocol , Nagy and Rossant succeeded in creating viable , fertile animals that were -- in their words -- " completely ES - cell derived . "
Based on the standard definition of an embryo as " a group of cells arising from the egg that has the potential to develop into a complete organism " ( according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences ) , a bunch of ES cells could be referred to as an embryo .
But this logic could complicate the current political battle to allow federal funding of the research .
Simply put , if one believes that a human embryo is sacred , one must hold ES cells to be sacred as well .
Still , is n't it true that human embryos must be ripped apart to obtain their internal ES cells ?
The answer is " no . "
Two years ago , in a feat hailed by Nature magazine , the Chicago embryologist Yury Verlinsky coaxed whole four - day old human embryos into becoming ES cells under a specified set of culture conditions .
No biological life was destroyed in the process .
Instead , the embryos were transformed directly into a living stage defined by the capacity to divide indefinitely without differentiating .
If neither biological life nor developmental potential need be " destroyed " in the process of deriving ES cells , why do so many people insist otherwise ?
The answer comes from the common non-scientific interpretation of the word " life " as a vitalistic entity rather than a biological one .
In the view of many fundamentalist Christians and Catholics , a single - cell embryo is a human being , while human ES cells are not even forms of human life .
The disconnect between public and scientific spheres of thought is aptly illustrated by open discussions occurring among scientists who work with non-contentious mouse ES cells .
This past summer , the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) initiated a $ 50 million program to create a centralized resource of 10,000 mouse strains , each containing a mutation in a different disease - causing gene .
NIH wants to make these special animals freely available to researchers , but as Science magazine explained , " it would be most economical to avoid trafficking in live mice . "
The proposed alternative is " to maintain the [ mutant animals ] as embryonic stem ( ES ) cells : clumps of tissue that can be frozen down and later grown up into full - fledged mice . "
The feasibility of this goal increased dramatically with the December 2006 Nature Biotechnology report of a highly efficient method for generating " mice fully derived from gene - targeted embryonic stem
cells " that eliminates the requirement for tetraploidization .
To mouse geneticists , ES cells are a convenient method for " maintaining " embryos , not destroying them .
But scientists who work with human cells have been less than forthcoming about these pesky details of biology .
It 's not that they think ES cells per se are deserving of greater respect .
On the contrary , most cell biologists think that embryo progenitors are deserving of no more respect than the ES cells they grow into .
But voicing such an opinion is politically unwise in America where the meaning of life -- from beginning to end -- is still defined by religion , not biology .
Nevertheless , in today's " flat world " ( to use Thomas Freidman 's term ) , the research wo n't be held back .
It will simply blossom in societies more enlightened than our own .
April 14 , 2008  -- Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , seemed to give a thumbs down to bipartisan legislation that would greatly expand educational benefits for members of the military returning from Iraq and Afghanistan under the GI Bill .
McCain indicated he would offer some sort of alternative to the legislation to address concerns that expanding the GI Bill could lead more members of the military to get out of the service .
Both Democratic presidential candidates — Sens. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , and Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , — have signed on as co-sponsors , and the bill has gained bipartisan support from 54 senators on Capitol Hill in addition to Webb .
A vote on the proposal is expected before the summer .
But the bill , which would dramatically increase educational compensation for American troops , has run into some unexpected resistance , both at the Pentagon and now from McCain , who has remained silent on the issue , saying he had not studied the bill close enough .
Pressure had mounted on McCain to support the bill — a veterans group , which backs the legislation , delivered a petition to McCain 's Senate office , signed by 30,000 veterans .
Officials in charge of Pentagon personnel worry that a more generous and expansive GI Bill would create an incentive for troops to get out of the military and go to college .
And while that might be great for the individual troop , it could be bad for the military , which is already under stress after more than five years fighting two wars .
On his campaign plane this afternoon , McCain said he and allies in the Senate are working on an alternative to the bill , but would only support something that included incentives to stay in the military .
" We are working on proposals of our own — I 'm a consistent supporter of educational benefits for the men and women of the military , " McCain said .
" I want to make sure that we have incentives for people to remain in the military as well as for people to join the military .
... I 've talked a lot about veterans ' health care , so we 'll continue to talk about those issues and how to care for vets .
I know I can do that , having been one . "
That is unlikely to sit well with Virginia Democrat Jim Webb , like McCain , a Vietnam vet , who has made the GI Bill legislation his personal crusade .
It was the first legislation Webb introduced after arriving on Capitol Hill after the 2006 elections .
When he was a decorated war veteran , just back from Vietnam , in exchange for his service , U.S. taxpayers gave Webb a full ride tuition , housing and living expenses all covered under a different program in place for wounded veterans that was distinct from the GI Bill .
Webb received his law degree at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s .
The schooling , courtesy of Uncle Sam , led to Webb 's career as Navy secretary , novelist and now senator .
The schooling led to Webb 's career as Navy secretary , novelist and now senator .
It 's a different story for Matt Flavin , a first - year Georgetown law student today .
He might go on to great things , but he 'll have a bigger tab to pay when he does it .
The government paid for all of Webb 's law school , but for Flavin , who got out of the military in August and enrolled at Georgetown , the check that arrives every month at the run- down group house where he lives , is for a little over $ 1,100 — about 6 percent of what it costs in tuition , books and living expenses at the private school .
The benefit is smaller for members of the National Guard and Reserve .
It is a big disparity , and one of the first things Webb pledged to do when he was elected to the Senate in 2006 was push for a more generous GI Bill to give soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines the same kind of benefit that put him through law school .
Since arriving on Capitol Hill , Webb has drummed up support from 54 senators , including Republicans like John Warner of Virginia , and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska , both beneficiaries of the GI Bill .
Another co-sponsor is Sen. Joe Lieberman , I - Conn. , who usually sides with McCain where it comes to the war and the military .
Webb is not suggesting that the government pay for everyone in the military to go to private college .
He would more than double the GI Bill benefit for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , offering a living stipend of about $ 1,000 depending on where the veteran lives , and pay the equivalent in tuition of the most expensive state school in the veteran 's home state .
It would also give benefits to members of the National Guard and Reserve , who , while they are often deployed overseas , do not enjoy the same benefits as regular troops .
The annual cost would be , according to Webb , somewhere between $ 2.5 billion and $ 4 billion annually .
Flavin joined the military out of patriotism shortly after 9/11 , went to Officer Candidate School and , over the next five years , served tours in Bosnia , Afghanistan and with Naval special forces in Iraq .
While he did not join the military specifically to get benefits from the GI Bill and does not think most troops do , Flavin supports the legislation .
" We owe them something , " Flavin said of his comrades .
" They 've given life , limb , everything there is to give .
The people who bore the most pain and suffering are the people who could use these benefits . "
At Georgetown , where tuition alone is $ 39,390 per year for a full - time student , the GI Bill makes a dent , but not a very big one .
Figures compiled by Webb 's office say the GI Bill covers about 11 percent of the more than $ 55,000 it costs to attend Georgetown Law School , buy books and live .
President Bush , in his State of the Union address this year , suggested not expanding the GI Bill benefit for current soldiers , but making it easier for them to transfer the current benefits to family members .
The original GI Bill provided a college education to the wave of veterans returning from World War II .
It was scaled back in 1956 after nearly 8 million World War II veterans had benefited from it .
Since then , the GI Bill has changed several times .
The current Montgomery GI Bill was enacted in 1985 and , according to Bush and Gilroy should remain distinct from the World War II version because the military is now an all volunteer force and the GI Bill is a tool used both for the recruitment and retention of qualified troops .

MONTECITO , Calif . 
" Smile and turn to your left , " Jeff Bridges says , holding an antique camera to his face .
" Now turn the other way … frown … and freeze ! "
PHOTOS : See more ' Pictures ' through Jeff Bridges ' viewfinder
He 's showing off his Widelux , a panoramic camera whose shutter moves so slowly it can capture its subject twice and snaps wide - angle shots of nearly 180 degrees .
Bridges carries it everywhere .
To movie sets .
To weddings .
To the Lebowski Fest , an annual pot- and bowling - filled celebration dedicated to his slacker king character the Dude in The Big Lebowski .
" This is my baby , " Bridges says , packing the camera into a weathered case .
" It has seen just about everything . "
So , too , has Bridges .
Born into one of Hollywood 's venerable acting families , Bridges , 58 , has spent most of his life watching the movie business evolve from both sides of the lens .
He was 6 months old when father Lloyd handed him to director John Cromwell , who needed a crying infant for his 1951 drama The Company She Keeps .
The elder Bridges suggested someone pinch his son to get the tears flowing .
By the time he was in high school , Jeff Bridges became obsessed with getting behind the viewfinder , chronicling family life on and off the set , clicking away with his dad 's old Nikon .
And since playing a photographer in 1976's King Kong , Bridges has become a bona fide shooter .
He has been the unofficial behind - the - scenes photographer of 53 movies , creating photo albums for cast and crew and publishing a 2003 book , Pictures , of that odyssey .
Still , despite four Oscar nominations and 72 movies and television shows , Bridges has flown relatively low on the Hollywood radar .
He rarely plays the leading man .
He does n't command eight - figure salaries .
In a film career spanning nearly half a century , he has been in one blockbuster , 2003 's Seabiscuit .
That last statistic probably will change when Iron Man opens Friday .
He stars as Obadiah Stane in the comic - book adaptation , playing a slimy corporate warmonger — another stretch for an actor better known for his laid - back ( and occasionally stoned ) characters .
" I think he could be the most underrated actor working , " says Susan Sarandon , a longtime friend of the Bridges family .
" His real self disappears when he's in character , which might be why he's not as high - profile as he deserves .
You do n't get the feeling it 's important for him to be front and center . "
If anything , Bridges says , it 's the opposite .
" It gets boring doing one thing , " he says .
" And I get restless .
I like to jump from acting to music to the camera .
If I 'm not creating something , I get tired of myself . "
Non-Hollywood life Walking through his palatial home about 80 miles north of Los Angeles , where French doors and stone pillars extend 20 feet to wood - beamed ceilings , it 's hard to picture Bridges getting bored .
His paintings dot the walls of the house , which he bought from Kenny Loggins .
He drinks from handmade ceramic mugs .
He turned one room into a sound studio , where he plays guitar , sings with a Tom Petty twang and mixes music for his independent label , Ramp .
( He released an album , Be Here Soon , in 2000 . )
It 's easy to see why Bridges initially flinched at the idea of following in his father 's footsteps , even with Lloyd Bridges urging Jeff and brother Beau to step through the doors the old man would happily open for them .
" Dad loved every part of the business , " Jeff Bridges says .
" He thought it was the best job on earth .
But I was ambivalent about acting , even after I got nominated for an Oscar . "
( That would be at age 22 , for supporting actor in 1971's The Last Picture Show . )
" There were just a lot of things I thought I could do instead , " he says .
" I was n't as keen on the ' Hollywood ' life . "
So he does n't live one .
He has been married to the same woman , Susan Geston , for 30 years .
He has three daughters , Isabelle , 27 , Jessica , 25 , and Hayley , 21 , none of whom he has pushed into acting .
And good luck finding his house :
There 's no sign — or even address — on the mailbox or imposing gated entry , which allows him to wander the acres of woodlands without Dude fanatics asking him to chat .
He was n't even sure he'd stick with acting until reluctantly taking a role in 1973's The Iceman Cometh .
" I figured you should treat it like any job , and some days you just have to go in .
And it was a blast .
When I dive into it , I 'm in it , 1,000 % . "
He wears the role
It has made him a critical darling , if not Hollywood A - lister .
Pauline Kael once wrote that Bridges " may be the most natural and least self - conscious screen actor who ever lived ; physically , it 's as if he had spent his life in the occupation of each character .
Jeff Bridges just moves into a role and lives in it . "
Perhaps that 's because much of Bridges ' roles are inspired by his bedroom closet .
When he does accept a role , his first step is to rifle through his clothes , looking for attire his character might wear and donning them for weeks before shooting begins .
If he 's a president , as he was in 2000 's The Contender , it 's suits and ties .
If he 's an alien inhabiting the body of a dead man , as he was in 1984 's Starman , it 's flannels and khakis .
His reckless bank robber in 1974's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot demanded open shirts and tight jeans .
All earned him Oscar nominations .
And if it 's a pot-smoking , White Russian - swilling , jobless , slacker bowling junkie , as he played in the Coen brothers ' 1998 comedy The Big Lebowski , it 's time to pull out his ratty T - shirt , thrift - shop shorts and Jellies sandals .
Nearly all of the Dude 's wardrobe came from Bridges ' personal stash .
" That role was pretty easy to get into , " he says , grinning and easing into a couch after some herbal tea and a croissant .
" Really , I 'm a pretty lazy guy .
It 's a lot easier for me to turn down a role than take it .
"
He even nearly passed on the part that has become his most enduring .
Bridges was worried about sending the wrong message about drug use to his daughters .
" I was a little nervous about broadcasting that kind of behavior to the world .
I mean , Dude was a major pothead . "
And was Bridges ?
" Oh , yeah , " he says .
" Big time .
That part of my life was in the past , but I could relate to the Dude . "
And still can .
When he's not in character , he prefers an untucked shirt and unkempt hair .
He can quote lines verbatim ( " I 'm the Dude .
So that 's what you call me .
That or His Dudeness … Duder … or El Duderino , if , you know , you 're not into the whole brevity thing " ) .
He wrote the foreword to the New York Times best seller I'm a Lebowski , You 're a Lebowski : Life , The Big Lebowski , and What Have You , a trivia book for fans .
The book , he says , was a melding of his passions .
" Besides taking photos of these people you come to love , that 's the great thing about being in the movies , " he says .
" These films can take on a life of their own .
They connect in a way you never expect with fans . "
And filmmakers .
" The thing you do n't see in every comic - book movie is a real acting pedigree , " says Jon Favreau , who directed Iron Man .
" There are n't many actors with a better pedigree than Jeff .
I do n't care what you have him play , he becomes that guy . "
Try telling that to John Goodman , Bridges ' friend and Lebowski co-star .
" Next time you see him , tell him I want to go to Lebowski Fest , " Goodman says .
" But I 'm only going if it 's with the Dude .
Can you imagine us there ? "
Now that would make a picture .

Such a device could be powered by the same chain of chemical reactions that propel sperm toward an egg , according to researchers at Cornell University .
The researchers are trying to reproduce ( pardon the pun ) the steps whereby a sperm 's whiplike tail generates energy .
( Sperm also generate energy using the mitochondria in their midsection . )
Running the length of the tail is a fibrous sheath with 10 enzymes attached to it .
These enzymes act in series to break down glucose into ATP , the energy source for cells , in a process known as glycolysis .
So far , the Cornell researchers have managed to attach three of the 10 enzymes to a computer chip and confirm that the enzymes still work .
If they can attach all 10 enzymes , they 'll have a working version of a sperm engine , which could then be attached to nano - devices .
The researchers presented their findings at the American Society for Cell Biology 's annual meeting today .

Bug Description
Additional annoying usability bugs were discovered in ubiquity and were unable to be fixed in time for 8.04 .
These proposed changes should improve the experience of selecting a timezone location on the map for all users with minor risk of regression .
TEST CASE :
Run ubiquity and navigate to the time zone page .
Check to see if the following problems occur :
- the zoom starts too quickly , it 's not easy to move the mouse pointer over a country in less than one second which means it zoom on the wrong area while you are still moving .
- the zoom out effect needs a delay too , it 's too easy to get the mouse pointer out of the widget while scrolling .
- the zoom is not correctly centered , putting the mouse pointer over the France make it zoom in the north of England for example .
The proposed patch as uploaded as part of ubiquity 1.8.8 can be found here :

When entering the map area to select a city , the map zooms in very quickly and jerkily .
Combined with the high zoom level , this can make it difficult to see where you are in the map .
I suggest that the map ( a ) pause for one second after you enter , before it starts zooming in ; ( b ) takes one second ( or maybe even two ) to zoom in ; ( c ) pauses for one second after you exit , before it starts moving out ; and ( d ) takes one second ( or maybe even two ) to zoom out .
( AP ) General Motors Corp. is considering a new Chevrolet mini car for the United States as it reworks its product lineup to cope with a dramatic shift from trucks to cars linked to high gas prices , a spokesman said Thursday .
GM spokesman Dee Allen said bringing the Chevrolet Beat , which is about the size of a Honda Motor Co. Fit or Toyota Motor Co. Yaris mini car , to the U.S. is among the options the company is studying .
" It is certainly one of the things that is being looked at from a portfolio perspective , " Allen said .
The Beat , to be built in South Korea , will be rolled out in other global markets faster than it would be in the U.S. , Allen said .
He did not know when the car might be sold elsewhere or in the U.S .
The car still must be engineered to meet U.S. safety and emissions standards , he said .
GM unveiled the Beat with two other ultra-small cars as concepts at auto shows last year , saying the trio was designed to attract young buyers in urban markets around the globe .
GM currently produces the Chevrolet Aveo sedan and five - door subcompact to compete in the growing mini car market .
The Beat is a front - wheel - drive three - door hatchback powered by a 1.2 - liter turbocharged gasoline engine .
The company has declined to put a price tag on the Beat , but Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said last year that GM mini cars ideally would start about $ 10,000 in the U.S. market .
U.S. mini car sales are up nearly 31 percent for the first half of the year , even though the total U.S. auto market is down more than 18 percent , according to Autodata Corp .
Readers have been shocked to learn that California has about 1 million citizens who are literally above the law .
Members of this group , as a Register front - page article April 6 detailed , can drive their cars as fast as they choose .
They can drink a six - pack of beer at a bar and then get behind the wheel and weave their way home .
They can zoom in and out of traffic , run traffic lights , roll through stop signs and ignore school crossing zones .
They can ride on toll roads for free , park in illegal spots and drive on High Occupancy Vehicle lanes even if they have no passengers in the car with them .
Chances are they will never have to pay a fine or get a traffic citation .
They are a special class of people , basically exempt from the laws the rest of us must follow .
This is n’t a small number , either .
Drivers of one of every 22 California cars and light trucks on the road have this special immunity , which should cause our government leaders and law enforcement authorities — always eager to protect us from any perceived problem — to demand a fix to this real public safety threat .
Think about what this means : a million drivers who can endanger our lives with near impunity .
I can hear it now : “ There ought to be a law ! ”
But instead of pushing for a fix , most legislators are trying to expand the program so that even more people can have the special “ we ’re above the law ” license plates .
What gives ?
The answer is sickeningly obvious .
The Special People are those who work for law enforcement or other government agencies or are their family members .
Now you get it .
Government officials are zealous about dealing with problems caused by average citizens , but they are far less interested in dealing with the excesses of fellow members of the privileged , government elite .
There are rules for “ us ” and rules for “ them ” — us being the subjects and them being the rulers .
Feel free to pound the table in anger now !
How did we get to this sorry place ?
In 1978 , the state started a program to protect the confidentiality of peace officers so members of the public could n’t find their addresses on Department of Motor Vehicle databases .
Over the years , the program has been expanded from one set of government workers to another .
It now applies to corrections employees , social workers , nonsworn personnel who work in juvenile halls , parole officers , parking enforcement employees and on and on .
Even county supervisors , city attorneys and city council members can be exempt from the state ’s traffic laws .
Even after the Register article exposed this outrageous situation , an Assembly committee voted to expand this special privilege to firefighters , animal control officers and veterinarians .
Assemblyman Mike Duvall , R - Yorba Linda , explained his vote to the Register in this way : “ I do n’t want to say no to the firefighters and veterinarians that are doing these things that need to be protected . ”
That attitude explains why our society is moving in this direction .
No one — not even a self - proclaimed believer in limited government — will stand up to groups of workers who have become as demanding , self - righteous and arrogant as those found in the French bureaucracy .
Americans used to be better schooled in the views of our nation ’s founders , who believed that government should be strictly limited and highly accountable .
The Constitution , after all , is designed to protect the People from their rulers .
These days , and especially after 9/11 , Americans have become compliant and dangerously obedient to the authorities .
Hence , they keep getting rolled .
You know something ’s amiss when museum security guards , court workers , DMV employees and retired parking officers are part of the special - license caste .
The special - plate program works this way :
The addresses are kept secret , so toll - road operators and parking enforcement cannot easily track down violators .
The Transportation Corridor Agencies , which runs the toll roads , does not legally have access to the confidential addresses .
The Orange County Transportation Authority has to go through additional hoops to get the addresses and admittedly does n’t pursue toll violations too zealously .
In one instance reported by the Register , one couple had racked up almost $ 35,000 in penalties from OCTA for driving on toll roads without paying .
Regarding moving violations , when police see these special plates they either do n’t pull the drivers over or they do n’t ticket them if they do .
The cops call this “ professional courtesy . ”
Officers know that those with the special plates are “ their own , ” and officers are quite open about refusing to ticket other members of the Brotherhood .
They scratch each other ’s back .
“ It ’s a courtesy , law enforcement to law enforcement , ” Sgt. Tom Lee of the San Francisco Police Department , told the Register .
“ We let it go . ”
Well , such “ courtesies ” are functions of police states , not free societies .
In a free society , the government serves the people .
No one is supposed to be above the law , not even animal control officers and their spouses .
Assemblyman Todd Spitzer , R - Orange , calls the situation immoral , unfair and unethical .
He has proposed legislation that would limit the practice .
Spitzer deserves kudos for this effort , but I would n’t expect the legislation to go far given the deference afforded public - sector union members and law enforcement in the state Capitol .
The whole thing is a scam .
This confidentiality of plates is defended on grounds of safety — even though there ’s no example of anyone ’s safety having been jeopardized and even though so many of the workers who receive the protections are not in even remotely dangerous professions .
Plus , the original rationale for the protection has evaporated .
As the Register noted , “ updated laws have made all DMV information confidential to the public . ”
Pound that table again !
Would n’t it be nice if the government , for once , put the public ’s safety above the concerns of its own workers and its own bureaucratic prerogatives ?
These days , the focus always seems to be on the safety of the government workers ( FYI , no government job is in the top 10 list of most - dangerous occupations ) , even though the government ’s entire raison d’être ( hey , French is appropriate , given the subject matter ) is to protect us .
Public - choice theory is correct — government workers function mainly to promote their own self - interest , and not to promote what some navely believe to be the public good .
Sadly , as the government expands , America is becoming a society where the public “ servants ” are now the masters .
Government workers earn higher salaries than their cohorts in the private sector and far higher benefits — with a massive public unfunded liability ( debt ) as a result .
The taxpayer eventually will be forced to clean up the fiscal mess .
These same government employees have special protections from accountability .
There ’s the Peace Officers ’ Bill of Rights , civil service protections and government unions , the last of which instill fear and trepidation into the hearts of politicians .
And now we learn that members of this coddled and powerful group ( and their family members ) do n’t even need to follow the basic traffic laws that apply to the rest of us .
If you ’re not angry , then you must be a member of the special caste .

Visit www.furtherconfusion.org for information on the next convention .
The San Jose Doubletree is already sold out for Further Confusion 2009 .
“ If I told you things I did before / Told you how I used to be / Would you go along with someone like me ? ”
Peter , Bjorn and John ’s “ Young Folks ” blasts over the JBL speakers lined along the front of the hotel ballroom .
Underneath the dimmed lights , a giant gray rabbit , a dark red fox and a spotted floppy dog bop back and forth to the beat , their massive fur - covered feet plopping heavily on the portable wooden dance floor .
To the left of them , a cheetah and puma grasp each other ’s paws as they sway together in time to the music .
The dance floor is crowded with dozens of tall furry creatures : cats , raccoons , possums , skunks , bears and bulls , all gyrating their giant bodies to the music spun by a live deejay .
These are n’t actual animals dancing together , of course .
They ’re full - grown adults in full - body “ fursuits ” : intricate , colorful , mascotlike costumes of mammals , reptiles and fantasy creatures .
It is the Friday night dance at the Further Confusion convention , a yearly West Coast gathering of the furry fandom , the all - encompassing name for an international community of anthropomorphic art lovers .
They call themselves “ furries ” for short .
Over five days at the end of January , thousands of registered conference - goers , including about 35 from the Sacramento region , descended on the Doubletree Hotel in San Jose to dance , drink , eat , buy and sell art and merchandise , party and hang out with their fellow furry friends .
Furries attended workshops and panels , played video games , wandered the hallways of the hotel and drank into the early morning hours , only to wake up the next morning and do it all again .
It was like an annual convention of plumbers , only with slightly more back hair .
Many television - viewing Americans first learned of furries from a 2003 episode of CSI : Crime Scene Investigation , titled “ Fur and Loathing , ” a play on Hunter S. Thompson ’s classic drug - induced novel .
The episode painted furries as perverted fetishists ; cultlike , social outcasts bonded together through anonymous , fursuit - clad sex acts .
Furries fume that it is the most well - known in a string of negative media and pop-culture images of fandom , perpetuating a fear and loathing of the media by furries in general .
But that still begs the question : Just how accurate are those media portrayals that the furries deem disturbing ?
Can a person of sound mental health take on the spiritual identity of , say , a badger ?
Do conferences like Further Confusion fill hotel ballrooms with writhing , pawing “ furverts ” ?
And , if so , what ’s the best fabric cleaner to use on a fluid - stained fursuit ?
There was only one way to find out : I had to talk to the furries , learn their languages .
That led me to the Internet and Sacramento - area furries headed to the conference .
Although my attempts to get interviews were met with skepticism and predictions of bad outcomes — one “ Sacfur ” permanently logged off the online group in protest after moderators gave me permission to post on their forum — a few stuck around in hopes of setting the record straight .
But to really understand this subculture , I was told I needed to go to FurCon .
And so , I spent a weekend in San Jose weighing what was seeing against the media portrayals .
A few times , I identified myself as a writer for SN&R , but mostly , I stayed undercover ( the FurCon press policy keeps journalists on a short leash , requiring all media to be escorted by conference staff at all times . ) .
I attended the workshops and panels , drank at the parties and danced my ass off as though I was one of them .
And while hanging out in street clothes with the furries was a good way to get involved with the fandom , something seemed missing .
I was n’t getting the entire experience .
I needed to go deep .
So I acquired my very own bear suit .

First things first :
What exactly are furries ?
“ A group of people who are into anthropomorphic literature and artwork , ” explained Ian Brossard , who had driven from Sacramento to work as a convention staff member .
Furries will often identify with a certain animal species and then create their own cartoonlike character based on that species .
Furries incorporate their animal characters into artwork , stories and , as Brossard explained , “ Occasionally , they dress up to look like their characters . ”
If his answer seems a bit generic , a bit unfetishist , it ’s because he has to keep the definition loose .
I would discover that like many cultural groups , the fandom claims members with varying levels of affiliation .
Some wear suits , some wear a tail and ears ; most wear street clothes .
One furry greeted his friends with a quick , “ Arf ! ” Another woman introduced her partner as “ my mate . ”
Many just show up for the parties .
Like one panel moderator said , “ There are many flavors of furry . ”
She was dressed as an evil Pippi Longstocking clown .
For Brossard , his involvement began with character - based story writing to work through a personal tragedy .
Two years ago , his boyfriend was hit by a car .
“ Basically , I just started writing recently on the events that happened , ” he said .
“ True stuff that I ’ve actually been through , but I will write it through the eyes of my character . ”
Elaki , a Sacfur who asked to be identified only by his character ’s name , chose a lion so he could take on that animal ’s traits .
“ The lion , for me , is a big role model , ” he said .
“ It ’s a bit of who I am and also who I want to be . ”
The lion exhibits loyalty , bravery , courage and leadership , Elaki said , all characteristics that he strives to cultivate in his own life .
There is a long tradition of anthropomorphic art and literature in human history .
Egyptian hieroglyphs record the story of the sky god Horus , who has the body of a man and the head of a falcon .
Ganesh , revered as Hinduism ’s remover of obstacles , is easily recognized by his elephant head .
Christ is called the “ Lamb of God ” to symbolize his purity and humility .
( A moderator at FurCon ’s “ Animals in Deity ” panel noted that when ancient humans depended on nature for their survival , their gods were usually animal - like .
As agriculture developed and our ancestors were able to rely on their own work for survival , the gods in turn became more like humans . )
In our modern marketing culture , animal names and forms are used to imbue their traits onto man-made objects .
Car manufacturers give animal names — Mustang , Cougar , Firebird — to their vehicles to convey strength and speed .
The Sacramento River Cats should be agile and quick - footed , the Sac State Hornets intimidating and aggressive .
As some furries will point out , sporting events are one spot in American culture where fursuits are openly welcomed .
What would a Sacramento Kings game be without Slamson the lion ?
Who better to launch hot dogs to the crowds at River Cats games than the feline mascot Dinger ?
In fact , a few furries at FurCon said their affiliation with the fandom began as mascots at sporting events or as characters at private parties .
They loved being in character so much that they do it not only for a living , but for fun at furry conventions and parties .
Friday morning , the convention hosted a meet - and - greet for fursuiters , giving them a chance to see the faces behind the elaborate suits .
Both longtime and brand - new suiters attending their first convention admired one another ’s creations .
The veterans shared tips on how to enjoy the weekend .
Some advice given to the new suiters : Stay hydrated by drinking room - temperature water , avoid soda and take the head off from time to time to cool off .

“ If you pass out , the EMTs will cut you out of your suit , ” warned one veteran fursuiter .
“ And you will end up on YouTube . ”
People in fursuits were in the minority .
Of the more than 4,100 registered conference attendees , fewer than 700 suiters marched in the Saturday afternoon fursuit parade .
Besides adults in fursuits , other sights at the convention were pretty weird .
Inside the Dealer Den , which was restricted to adults 18 and over , scores of artists sold their skilled work and made themselves available for commissioned pieces .
Most artwork in plain view was of cartoonlike anthropomorphic animals in everything from ancient Japanese to futuristic sci- fi settings .
One piece near the entrance to the den showed a family of black cobras : father , mother and daughter .
The daughter ’s form - fitting T - shirt read “ Daddy ’s Little Girl . ”
And then there ’s the porn .
Lots of porn .
Just about every single table had a black three - ring binder with the words “ Adults Only ” written across the cover .
Inside these binders were drawings of humanlike animals , some posed like centerfolds in various stages of undress .
Others were engaged in every sex act you can imagine , and more than a few that you can ’t .
( Think orca - on - fox or squid - thing - on - raccoon to get an idea . )
A couple of artists sold DVDs and CDs of boy - on - boy , girl - on - boy or girl - on - girl images .
A horrifying thought hit me as I browsed wide - eyed at the unending creativity on display :
Do people get off to this stuff ?
Another room , the Art Show Auction , was open to all ages , but an adults - only section displayed large , full - color , anatomically correct drawings , paintings and sculptures , all of them going to the highest bidder .
Not all furries , though , are into the erotic art scene .
A group of guys perused the art up for auction , snickering at piece titled “ Collage ” that showed more than 20 wolves gathered for an orgy .
At least one artist had a sense of humor about all the oversexed artwork :
One piece showed a buxom female fox and cat in skimpy superhero outfits , tugging in vain to cover themselves with the sparse material .
“ Who the hell designed these @& !* outfits ? ” cried the fox .
“ I ’m supposed to conceal a weapon in this ? ”
One explanation for all that porn might be that furries are overwhelmingly young men .
In a 2007 study conducted by UC Davis psychologist Dr. Cynthia Pickett , 600 self - identified furries responded to a questionnaire revealing a clearer picture of the fandom demographic .
Most furries are white ( 89 percent ) American ( 83 percent ) males ( 81 percent ) averaging 24.6 years of age .
Most are students ( 38 percent ) earning less than $ 50,000 per year ( 90 percent ) .
Eighty - two percent do n’t own a fursuit .
And 37.3 percent are bisexual , 32.7 percent are heterosexual , 25.5 percent are homosexual and 8 percent define their sexual orientation as “ other . ”
Many furries
I spoke with mentioned having seen the infamous CSI “ Fur and Loathing ” episode .
The season - five installment had two of the show ’s intrepid detectives solving the mysterious death of a man in a raccoon suit ; he had been shot by a rancher on a deserted rural road just before being run over by a car .
The rancher , fearing for the safety of the dogs he breeds , had mistook the furry for a coyote and shot him with a rifle from the top of a ridge .
In the course of their investigation , the detectives ’ top - notch sleuthing led them to the fictional Las Vegas PathCon , where one investigator , upon seeing scores of people in fursuits , quipped , “ I think I ’m having Hunter Thompson ’s flashbacks . ”
The discovery of a semen stain on the raccoon suit brings the investigation to one of the most infamous scenes in the CSI franchise history :
The detectives enter a hotel room right in the middle of a “ furpile , ” where a half - dozen fursuiters paw and rub each other in a purring mass of fur and sweat .
The scene seared itself into the mass consciousness of television - viewing Americans , forever associating furry fandom with masses of fur - clad conference - goers in dark , steamy rooms of groping , anonymous , genderless sexual contact .
Real - life furries I spoke with admitted that , yes , furpiles do happen , but they insisted only a very small minority of furries participate in the invite - only parties .
The logistics of a fursuit alone make sex acts difficult , if not impossible .
Like attendees of any convention , Further Confusion participants spent downtime next to the hosting resort ’s pool .
Sunscreen was not required .

“ Basically , you ’re wearing a couch , ” said the evil Pippi Longstocking clown .
And they point out that with fursuits selling for as much as $ 3,000 each , most furries would never dream of getting their fur crusted with bodily fluids .
What the CSI episode missed is that furry conventions are not merely a group of misfits in fursuits , ears and tails meeting up for drinks and noisy parties .
Produced by Anthropomorphic Arts and Education , 2008 marked FurCon ’s 10th year , and attendees sold out the 505 - room Doubletree Hotel .
According to one convention staff member , conference - goers filled three nearby hotels as well , with one inter - hotel shuttle running 24 hours a day .
For $ 50 , guests 18 and up received access to all five days of convention events , including art , writing and “ species ” panels , guest speakers , live musical guests , entrance to the Dealer Den and Art Show , a spot in board , video - and card - game tournaments and more .
And consider that FurCon is just one part of the international furry - fandom culture .
Fliers advertising upcoming conferences littered tables all over the hotel .
Furry Weekend Atlanta and the All Fur Fun Pajama Party in Spokane , Wash . ; happened in February and April , respectively .
Scheduled for the rest of this year alone are the Midwest FurFest in Wheeling , Ill. ; Eurofurence 14 in Suhl , Germany ; and MidFur X in Melbourne , Australia .
Besides the usual convention listings of events and guest biographies , the glossy , 56 - page , full - color FurCon guidebook included the “ Attendee Code of Conduct , ” which may have sounded intimidating to some first - timers .
Among the rules the FurCon board felt compelled to put in writing : A non -thong bathing suit must be worn as a minimum , and anatomically correct costumes must be strategically covered when those wearers are in public areas of the hotel .
Most displays of affection by members of all sexual orientations are fine according to the code , but “ groping , tongue battles , and nudity are not . ”
Collars and leashes may be worn “ discreetly , ” but public BDSM play can get conference - goers in trouble with Flare , the convention ’s volunteer security guards .
Flare staff , which provides security to several conventions around the Bay Area , wandered every part of the hotel ’s public areas during the day and had access to the rooms on the party floor at night .
These were n’t the beefy , tight - shirted bouncers who work security at the local singles bar ; most looked like the other convention attendees : geeky , lanky , bespectacled guys in jeans and T - shirts .
Besides a small identifying plastic badge and a black headset radio , it was hard to tell them apart from everyone else .
At a party on a cold and wet Friday night , I asked “ Bob , ” an experienced Flare guard , why security was even necessary when everybody I had met was so damn nice .
Bob looked down through his thick glasses and twitched his mustache before pulling me aside to a quiet part of the patio .
“ Drama , ” answered Bob , after moving out of earshot of the other guests .
“ Everyone here knows each other . ”
He described most of the trouble as the Valley - girlish , “ oh - my - God - look - who - showed - up ” kind .
The Friday and Saturday night parties seemed to be the biggest draw for the convention .
FurCon designated the second floor of the Doubletree as the party floor , and for good reason .
The north - facing sliding - glass doors of the hotel rooms all opened to the same massive concrete patio .
During the day , party hosts plastered fliers advertising their parties around the hotel lobby and conference announcement boards .
The rooms were decorated to fit the theme of the party , and most of the furniture was pushed aside ( or into an unused area at the end of the floor hallway ) to accommodate as many people as possible .
Convention rules required that one person check the ID of every single person ordering a drink , a rule that was enforced at every party I attended .
The Society of Evil Geniuses decorated their walls floor - to - ceiling with the portraits of evildoers throughout history .
Guests old enough to drink were given a black ribbon identifying them as a “ Minion . ”
Volunteering to try the mystery drink , which tasted like chilled sake , would earn a Minion a black “ Lab Rat ribbon . ”
Another room down the hall , fully lit with the hotel furniture all in place , simply had two hookahs sitting on the floor .
Anyone could walk in through the sliding - glass doors , take a puff of fruit - flavored tobacco and strike up conversations with others standing in the circle around the pipes .

People at the parties , like everyone else at the convention , were friendly , nice and welcoming , though they did seem wary of new people , especially a guy who showed up by himself .
When I asked one of three fellows where they were from , he answered vaguely , “ Two of us are within driving distance , ” and I knew not to press the question .
Later , outside on the patio , as I was speaking with a group of three friends , we got a whiff of marijuana .
One of them , who was either a guy in drag , a transsexual or just a guy in a female costume ( and just how do you ask someone that question , anyhow ? ) , whacked my right ankle with his ( her ? ) cane before asking me if I wanted to come along and “ find the skunk . ” I asked why he hit my ankle .
“ I had to make sure you ’re not a cop , ” he said .
“ I was checking for an ankle holster . ”
OK .
So why did n’t he check my left ankle as well ?
“ Because you ’re left - handed , ” he answered .
“ I could tell by how loosely you ’re holding your drink . ”
Most FurCon goers did n’t seem too attached the furry fandom .
Very few wore head - to - toe fursuits ; the vast majority dressed in street clothes .
Instead , they were predominantly parts of larger groups of mostly young people affiliated with anime , costuming , video - game and comic - book conventions .
These fans crisscross the nation to attend conferences at various times throughout the year .
FurCon felt more like a four - day costume party than anything else .
For many costumers , the convention provided a place to become their character , a new persona distinct from who they are in real life .
“ When I am in a fursuit , it makes me more open , ” said Sacfur Lilleah West , while dressed as Purrsnickitty the cat .
“ When I ’m in a costume , I just open up .
It ’s more fun .
Nobody can see my face .
Nobody knows what I ’m thinking . ”
Dan Rather had cops shoot him up with heroin to understand the drug culture .
Geraldo Rivera quickly switched from journalist to rescuer when he assisted a woman in a wheelchair in Katrina - ravaged New Orleans .
Age 20 - something reporters who can pull it off have gone back to high school over the years to try and figure out the youth of that day .
So how could I call myself a journalist and really understand where Purrsnickitty was coming from without slipping into a fursuit myself ?
Early Friday morning of the convention , I walked into a hotel restroom and commandeered the handicap stall .
I opened my red backpack and pulled out my bear suit : a pair of fuzzy , light brown pants with a stubby tail , matching oversized fuzzy gloves , a head covering that left my face exposed and black - and - white checkered suspenders .
( Special thanks go to the friends that donated the material and offered to sew the costume free of charge .
You have n’t lived until you explain to somebody why exactly she ’s sewing a bear suit for you . )
I took several deep breaths and cautiously left the bathroom .
I felt ridiculous .
I looked ridiculous .
But those feelings lasted only a few minutes .
Right away , I saw other fursuiters plodding along happily down the hotel hallways .
Some people wore tails or pairs of animal ears .
Others were dressed like anime and video - game characters .
This is probably the only place on Earth where I could wear a bear suit and somehow manage to blend right in .
Hell , looking at the full - body suits at the meet - and - greet that morning made me feel strangely underdressed .
I was in the Dealer Den when what I had been dreading finally happened : I recognized the person walking straight toward me .
We lived in the same apartment complex , and I had passed her a couple times earlier at the convention without making eye contact .
But in the narrow rows between the artist tables , a face - to - face encounter was impossible .
“ Hey , we live in the same building , ” I started .
Even though she was in jeans and a hoodie , she was embarrassed to have been caught at the convention .
“ I was worried about running into somebody I knew , ” she said before hurriedly looking away at the artwork in front of her .
“ Do n’t worry too much , ” I reassured her .
“ You ’re not the one in the bear suit . ”
As I walked around FurCon , people smiled and waved , and I started waving back with those floppy bear hands .
A couple of the fursuiters approached with wide open arms to give me enthusiastic , well , bear hugs .
The fursuiters do n’t usually speak when in their suits .
Instead they rely on playful , exaggerated gestures to communicate .
When two suiters met in the hallways , they touched and hugged and rubbed each other ’s fur - covered bellies .
It seemed whenever three or more fursuiters playfully romped around together , some convention - goers started taking pictures as though they were watching two girls making out at a frat party .
Simply walking around in all that fur got me sweating profusely .
Once , I had to wander up to the fursuiter ’s lounge on the second floor to sit in front of the air - conditioned fans that ran all hours of the day .
The thought of engaging in vigorous coitus while dressed that way seemed unbearable .
( Sorry , I could n’t resist . )
I could only stand being in the suit for a few hours at a time .
And I suddenly gained new respect for all those sports mascots dancing around for hours on end while trying to keep stadiums full of screaming fans entertained .
No fursuiters ever whisked me away to secret furpile parties .
No paws ever groped my nether regions .
Acting on a tip as to where I could find furpiles , I checked out the 10th floor of the hotel , which turned out to be dead quiet .
I went up there three separate times .
You know , just to be sure .
On Sunday evening , many of the furries were packing their things and heading to the airport .
They said their goodbyes to friends and made plans to meet up at the next furry convention .
I was heading out the hotel doors when I remembered that I promised to visit a merchant near the Dealer Den .
She had served as moderator on a panel discussing furries and the media .
After I thanked her in the hallway for the informative discussion , she told me to stop by her table when I had a chance .
At her table , she remembered me and handed me a pin , which she wanted me to have free of charge .
I thanked her and left .
As I walked through the parking lot , my mind began what would be several days of processing what I had experienced .
I had spent nearly four days with some of the most welcoming , open - minded and yes , sometimes the weirdest people I had ever met .
And so I was left wondering , with all these nice furries running around and having fun for a weekend , how many other harmless groups have been demonized in popular culture for the sake of selling ad space ?
I pinned the button to my backpack , where it is still attached today .
It reads :
“ My subculture was exploited by the media , and all I got was this lousy button . ”

Seymour Hersh has been writing about the Bush administration 's aggressive stance against Iran for years now .
His latest article for The New Yorker , " Preparing the Battlefield " , Hersh claims that the Bush administration has been carrying out clandestine operations in Iran for some time now , with the funding and cooperation of the Democratic leadership in Congress .
HERSH : I think this is another example of putting an awful lot of pressure on the Iranian government .
There 's been a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos inside of Iran .
Almost every other day , there 's another story in the Iranian press -- I write about this in the article , too -- about things blowing up , et cetera , et cetera .
It looks like things are falling apart , a little bit .
And the central government certainly has more trouble .
And I think the goal of this operation , this incredible operation , with all this money -- and , by the way , it 's the Democrats in Congress who basically looked the other way and said , take the money and run .
They did not stop this money , the leadership that I 'm talking about , the Democratic leadership .
So , basically , my guess is that -- I do n't think we can safely say that any military action is off the table , no matter what happens .
And that 's -- as I say , I wish I 'm going to be wrong about all that , but this is really , sort of , an amazing development .
CROWLEY : Absolutely .
I want to read a graph out of your book because it goes to the oversight of the Democrats you just mentioned .
[ snip ]
" ' The oversight process has not kept pace -- it 's been co-opted by the administration , ' the person familiar with the contents of the findings said .
' The process is broken and this is dangerous stuff we 're authorizing . ' "
Tell me , first , what your sources say is so dangerous about this ?
HERSH : The president has to give a finding on covert action , any action that 's covert .
In other words , when CIA goes in some place , if they get caught , there could be spies .
So he has to tell the Congress about it .
And the military simply is -- the president , since 9/11 , has decided anything we do militarily , we do n't have to tell anybody in Congress about .
Guest host Candy Crowley brings on Iraq Ambassador Ryan Crocker to officially deny that any cross border operations have taken place , but Hersh points out that Crocker may not be in the loop -- plausible deniability being the operative word .
That is simply a reality , that when you run secret operations , if you 're not telling the commander , the military commander of the Central Command , who is supposedly running the country -- you may not tell the ambassador everything .
Sometimes it 's better not to have the ambassador know .
Full transcripts below the fold :
CROWLEY : While the Bush administration has been emphasizing tough diplomacy with Iran , it 's also been escalating covert U.S. military actions against the country .
That 's according to investigative journalist Seymour Hersh , who reveals the details in a new article for the New Yorker magazine , titled " Preparing the Battlefield . "
He joins us now .
That sounds a little ominous .
Let me ask you first , if you -- what is the headline that readers will take away from this article ?
HERSH : Well , one of the basic points is that , no matter what we say about diplomacy , you know , carrot and stick , the stick is working pretty hard and the stick is working overtime .
This president did escalate the covert war , the secret war inside Iran .
We 've been doing stuff inside Iran since '05 pretty much , pretty heavily , you know , looking at the nuclear facilities , collecting intelligence , trying to undermine the regime , et cetera , et cetera .
But there was a significant escalation this year .
First of all , they got a great deal of authorization to spend up to $ 400 million .
That does n't mean he 's spent it all yet , but he 's got that kind of authorization from one of the secret committees .
Anybody who saw " Charlie Wilson 's War " -- you know , Charlie Wilson was able to generate a lot of money secretly .
That 's what happens in Congress .
And the other major thing is , we 've sent in a special task force that operates out of Afghanistan into Iran .
I give notice what Ambassador Crocker said about not cross -border .
And I have a lot of respect for him and I do n't want to challenge him .
But the fact is , we 're inside ; we 're not necessary cross - border .
We have teams inside Iran .
And these include joint special operation forces , our most elite commando unit .
And basically , they 're guys that go after high - value targets around the world .
You know , they capture them or kill them .
So it 's a significant increase in American potential for damage inside Iran .
CROWLEY : I do want to let our audience hear from Ambassador Crocker , and then I want to ask you the difference between what he 's denying and what you 're saying .
Here he is .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
CROCKER : I have n't read the article , Candy , but I can tell you flatly that U.S. forces are not operating across the Iraqi border into Iran , in the south or anywhere else .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
CROWLEY : So they 're not -- I mean , is he denying something you did n't say ?
I can't quite get the difference here .
HERSH : Well , you know , it 's complicated .
Because one of the things in the article -- it 's a long article in the New Yorker -- one of the things I described is that one of the problems Admiral Fallon , the former commander of CENTCOM , who ran into trouble because he spoke about not wanting to bomb Iran .
Another factor in Fallon 's problems with the White House , particularly with Mr. Cheney , the vice president , was that Fallon was n't able to learn what was going on , all he wanted to know , about covert operations , CIA operations inside Iran and Afghanistan .
That is simply a reality , that when you run secret operations , if you 're not telling the commander , the military commander of the Central Command , who is supposedly running the country -- you may not tell the ambassador everything .
Sometimes it 's better not to have the ambassador know .
But the other point is , we certainly are going cross- border , on short forays , grabbing Al Quds members , bringing them back .
We 've been doing that for a long time .
He may not know the extent to which we 're operating deeply with commandos or -- not so much -- with our special forces inside Iran .
So it 's possible .
Because he 's not somebody -- he 'll spin it , but he 's not somebody who wo n't say something he does n't believe .
CROWLEY : So what 's the end game here ?
What are they trying to accomplish ?
Is it to end the war in Iraq ?
Is it to overturn the government in Iran ?
Is it greasing the skids for a preemptive strike ?
What are they doing there ?
HERSH : That 's a great question because I do n't know .
And , boy , do I wish -- I 've been writing about Iran for about three years , almost constantly , in the New Yorker , sort of , this , you know , " Chicken Little , the sky is falling . "
And I sure wish I could be wrong about it .
But the end game is , as far as -- and I do have some access into some of the thinking , particularly in the vice president 's office .
They do not want -- Bush and Cheney do not want to leave Iran in place with a nuclear program , with , they believe , a nuclear weapons program .
They simply do n't believe the national intelligence estimate that came out late last year that said they have n't done anything in nuclear weapons since ' 03 .
They just do n't believe it .
So they believe that their mission is to make sure that , before they get out of office next year , either Iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program .
I do believe that .
I think this is another example of putting an awful lot of pressure on the Iranian government .
There 's been a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos inside of Iran .
Almost every other day , there 's another story in the Iranian press -- I write about this in the article , too -- about things blowing up , et cetera , et cetera .
It looks like things are falling apart , a little bit .
And the central government certainly has more trouble .
And I think the goal of this operation , this incredible operation , with all this money -- and , by the way , it 's the Democrats in Congress who basically looked the other way and said , take the money and run .
They did not stop this money , the leadership that I 'm talking about , the Democratic leadership .
So , basically , my guess is that -- I do n't think we can safely say that any military action is off the table , no matter what happens .
And that 's -- as I say , I wish I 'm going to be wrong about all that , but this is really , sort of , an amazing development .
CROWLEY : Absolutely .
I want to read a graph out of your book because it goes to the oversight of the Democrats you just mentioned .
HERSH : Sure .
CROWLEY : This is from your book -- sorry -- from your article .
" ' The oversight process has not kept pace -- it 's been co-opted by the administration , ' the person familiar with the contents of the findings said .
' The process is broken and this is dangerous stuff we 're authorizing . ' "
Tell me , first , what your sources say is so dangerous about this ?
HERSH : The president has to give a finding on covert action , any action that 's covert .
In other words , when CIA goes in some place , if they get caught , there could be spies .
So he has to tell the Congress about it .
And the military simply is -- the president , since 9/11 , has decided anything we do militarily , we do n't have to tell anybody in Congress about .
That 's all preparing the battlefield .
That 's the title of the piece .
And so what Congress gets told is something about CIA operations , and that 's why they had a finding , but nothing about what the military is doing on the ground inside Iran .
And so the people in the Senate -- the House , particularly , the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee , Charlie Wilson 's old subcommittee , we 're talking about Congressman Obey , Congressman Murtha , some of the others are really concerned because they 're approving programs about which they do n't have the whole story , and they know it .
And they do n't know what to do about it .
And it 's a source of enormous tension .
The problem is it 's also secret .
Nobody wants to talk about it .
Nobody can talk about it .
It 's a world that the White House controls because it 's very top secret .
The presidential finding that I 'm writing about is a document you do n't discuss on CNN .
If you 're the ambassador , you do n't talk about it .
I understand Senator McConnell was here .
And the senators are able to say -- those who know can say , " I ca n't talk about it . "
So we in the public do n't get much of a look .
And for me , as a journalist , to write about this is difficult because , often , a lot of other journalists wo n't be able to make heads or tails of what I 'm doing , because they can't simply find the people that will talk about .
CROWLEY : Right , absolutely .
I 've got about 15 seconds .
Can you give me , in a nutshell , why it 's so dangerous ?
Is it because it could prompt a war with Iran if they were to find these special - ops people ?
HERSH : We have the special operations people , and they 're great people .
They 're very loyal soldiers .
They do what they 're told , going around , killing people around the world without ambassadors knowing it , without the CIA station chiefs knowing it , without Congress knowing .
If that does n't sound like -- you know , with this president , if that does n't make people nervous , I do n't know what else would , I can just tell you .
CROWLEY : Seymour Hersh , another blockbuster story , the New Yorker .
Thank you so much .
You all ought to go out and get a copy .
We will be right back .
Bush may claim “ we do not torture ” yet the New York Times ( July 2 ) reports otherwise in an article titled : “ China Inspired / Interrogations / At Guantanamo . ”
There is now , the Times reports , “ vivid evidence of the way Communist interrogation methods that the United States long described as torture became the basis for interrogations both by the military at Guantanamo and by the Central Intelligence Agency . ”
( Translation : when they did it , we called it “ torture . ” )
That evidence is in the form of a chart carried by Pentagon trainers to Guantanamo prison , Cuba , in Dec. , 2002 , outlining the use of “ sleep deprivation , ” “ prolonged constraint ” and “ exposure , ” etc .
Seems this chart was copied word for word from a 1957 Air Force study of Red Chinese techniques used during the Korean War to coerce confessions from captured GIs !
And some of its methods , the Times said , have been used on men arrested in the Middle East .
One tactic was to deny prisoners their sleep .
As McClatchy News Service ’s Warren Strobel reported last month , retired Lt. Col.
Diane Beaver , a military lawyer , appeared to confirm U.S. officials at Afghanistan ’s Bagram prison used “ sleep deprivation on detainees ” even before then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approved the technique .
( “ Sleep deprivation , ” by the way , was used by the Soviet KGB under dictator Joseph Stalin .
Only in Moscow ’s Lubyanka prison it was known bluntly as “ the conveyor belt ” as exhausted captives got mauled by one handler after another . )
To torment GIs captured in Korea , the Chinese Reds used “ complete solitary confinement , ” “ complete isolation , ” “ barren environment , ” “ restricted movement , ” “ monotonous food , ” and so on --- tactics the Bush military has widely adopted against Arab and Muslim captives .
Confined to solitary ( “ complete isolation ” as the Chinese called it ) by itself is a maddening experience , even for hardened criminals .
It ’s particularly devastating for those that are innocent , as so many captives are , when no charges are brought against them , when they have been arrested and dumped half way around the world away from family and friends , when they are not allowed to receive visits or mail , when they are denied due process of law and lawyers , and when they are entombed alive in a tiny cubicle ( “ restricted movement ” ) with a slab bed , toilet , and sink , and only a vertical sliver of a window about six inches wide and 18 inches high to admit light .
According to Amnesty International ( AI ) , prisoner Lakhdar Boumediene , was not captured on any battlefield but seized in Bosnia , flown to Guantanamo , and never charged with a crime .
Although ordered released by the Bosnian Supreme Court in 2002 , Bush has now kept him in Gitmo for seven years .
His experience is commonplace .
Boumediene appears to be one of the many the U.S. McClatchy News Service reports “ were arrested on the basis of flimsy or fabricated evidence . ”
The Bush motto might well be , “ Torture first , trial later . ”
The photographs accompanying this column show Amnesty International 's Zeke Johnson ( Zjohnson@AIUSA.org ) at a replica Guantanamo cell the human rights group exhibited recently at Miami ’s Bayfront Park as part of its anti-torture campaign .
Johnson says prisoners are confined in such cells 22 hours a day .
Despite Bush ’s denials , the International Red Cross has concluded U.S. methods are “ tantamount to torture . ”
And it gets worse : by some accounts , hundreds of Muslim prisoners have perished in Bush jails .
Holding tens of thousands of captives , many , if not most , illegally , and some concealed in secret dungeons hidden from Red Cross scrutiny , George Bush has shamed America with the title of “ the world ’s jailer . ”
And just when enlightened humanity thought communist totalitarianism was dying out , President Bush revives its tortures .
If Bush is what America stands for , we have to ask : “ Has America gone nuts ? ” # ( The author formerly reported for the Chicago Daily News and wire services .

LOS ANGELES  Google is experimenting with a new method of distributing original material on the Web , and some Hollywood film financiers are betting millions that the company will succeed .
In September , Seth MacFarlane , creator of “ Family Guy ” on television , will unveil a carefully guarded new project called “ Seth MacFarlane ’s Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy . ”
Unlike “ Family Guy , ” which is broadcast on Fox , this animation series will appear exclusively on the Internet .
The innovative part involves the distribution plan .
Google will syndicate the program using its AdSense advertising system to thousands of Web sites that are predetermined to be gathering spots for Mr. MacFarlane ’s target audience , typically young men .
Instead of placing a static ad on a Web page , Google will place a “ Cavalcade ” video clip .
The content will also be distributed via YouTube .
Advertising will be incorporated into the clips in varying ways .
In some cases , there will be “ preroll ” ads , which ask viewers to sit through a TV - style commercial before getting to the video .
Some advertisers may opt for a banner to be placed at the bottom of the video clip or a simple “ brought to you by ” note at the beginning .

A Harris County grand jury on Monday ended the rancorous seven - month debate over Pasadena resident Joe Horn 's decision to gun down two illegal immigrant burglars in his front yard , concluding the act was a justifiable use of deadly force and not murder .
The grand jury heard two weeks of testimony from witnesses , including Horn .
They likely also heard his breathless 911 call , during which the increasingly frustrated retiree ignored a dispatcher 's pleas to stay inside and out of harm 's way .
The Nov. 14 call ended with the sound of Horn racking a shell into his 12 - gauge shotgun 's chamber followed by three gunshots that killed Colombians Diego Ortiz , 30 , and Hernando Riascos Torres , 38 .
Each man was shot in the back .
They had taken about $ 2,000 in the burglary .
Horn 's defense hinged on his assertion that he fired out of fear for his life , making the shooting justifiable under Texas law .
The law also permits the use of deadly force to protect property under some circumstances .
District Attorney Ken Magidson said he could n't comment on the grand jury 's secret proceedings .
" In Texas , a person has a right to use deadly force in certain circumstances to protect property ... and that 's basically what the grand jurors had to deal with , " Magidson said .
After the announcement , Horn 's attorney said his 62 - year - old client was no vigilante .
" Joe was not some sort of wild cowboy , " Tom Lambright said .
" He was trying to help police .
He was put in a situation where he did n't have any choice . "
Lambright said Horn was " relieved " the investigation was over and he was cleared .
" When I talked to him on the telephone I could hear it in his voice — not giddy , just relieved . "
Others decried the decision as a miscarriage of justice .
Frank Ortiz , a member of the local League of United Latin American Citizens chapter , said he hopes federal authorities investigate the case further .
" That 's amazing that they would no - bill him with so much evidence against him , " Ortiz said .
" It 's amazing to me that anyone with a Hispanic surname can not get justice .
This was no more than a vigilante . "
In his 911 call , Horn cited a newly enacted Texas law , the " castle doctrine , " which authorizes the use of deadly force during a home invasion .
But Sen. Jeff Wentworth , who wrote the law , said it did not apply to Horn 's case .
" It was not an issue in this case other than him saying incorrectly that he understood it to mean he could protect his neighbor 's property , " said Wentworth , R - San Antonio .
He said the castle doctrine simply did n't apply because , although the burglars were running across Horn 's lawn , Horn 's home was n't under siege — his neighbor 's home was .
" It comes from the saying ' A man 's home is his castle , ' " Wentworth said .
" But this was n't his castle . "
Lambright said even though many people , including Horn 's neighbors , have called him a hero , Horn does n't believe he is .
The attorney said Torres , who was on parole for a drug conviction , and Diego Ortiz were near the front door when Horn stepped outside .
" They were attacking , " Lambright said .
" It scared him to death . "
Police guard neighborhood
At Horn 's home , boards formed a makeshift barricade on the front walk , supporting a red " No Trespassing " sign .
Police patrolled in force — by car , motorcycle and bicycle — and stood guard at the subdivision 's entrances .
They said they were there to keep the peace in case protesters showed up .
No protesters had arrived by late Monday .
Some of Horn 's neighbors on Timberline Drive greeted news that he wo n't face criminal charges with enthusiasm ; others hung " no comment " signs on their front doors .
" I just praise God that he was not indicted , that our country is still behind our good , honest people , " said Velma Cabello , 61 .
" He is a hero in my book . "
She lives in Humble , but was house - sitting Monday a few doors down from Horn 's home .
" I would love for him to be my neighbor , for someone to watch over me like that , " Cabello said .
" I 'm glad he 's not going to jail , but it 's a bad thing , killing a couple people , " said John White , 51 , who lives half a block away from Horn .
" It 's sad for everyone , him and the victims . "
Horn was alone inside the home he shares with his daughter 's family around 2 p.m. on Nov. 14 when he was heard glass shattering next door , spotted Ortiz and Torres crawling through a window and called 911 to report the break - in .
The operator repeatedly urged him to stay in his house , but Horn said he did not believe it would be right to let the burglars get away .
" Well , here it goes , buddy , " Horn told the operator .
" You hear the shotgun clicking and I 'm going . "
The operator replied : " Do n't go outside . "
Then the tape recorded Horn warning : " Move and you 're dead ! "
Two quick shots can be heard on the tape , followed by a pause and then a third shot .
Detective was on scene
Pasadena police have said a detective in plainclothes had parked in front of Horn 's house in response to the 911 call , and saw the two men before they crossed into Horn 's front yard .
Police believe that neither Horn nor the burglars knew an officer was present .
When Horn confronted the men in his yard , he raised his shotgun to his shoulder , police have said .
However , the men ignored his order to freeze .
Authorities have said one man ran toward Horn but had angled away toward the street when he was shot in the back just before reaching the curb .
Ortiz and Torres died a short distance from Horn 's house .
A news release from the city of Pasadena read , in part , " We hope that the decision of the grand jury , while difficult for some to accept , will be respected as the product of a careful weighing of all the facts by an impartial panel of citizens . "

I 've been calling Étoilé ' a pragmatic Smalltalk ' for a long time ( although Nicolas , I believe , was the one to coin the expression ) .
Smalltalk is a really great language , but it has two disadvantage :
1 ) It tends to be bytecode - interpreted , which is not very fast .
2 ) Implementations tend to be all - or - nothing .
The first is less of a problem now that CPUs are so fast they spend 90 % of their time idle in a typical desktop workload .
The second is much more of a problem .
Smalltalk - 80 includes a complete GUI and common implementations , such as Squeak adopt this model .
This means that Squeak applications and ' native ' applications are entirely separate .
If there is one thing that Squeak does n't have that you need , then using Squeak is not easy .
This week , I committed the first version of the Smalltalk compiler I have been working on to Étoilé svn .
Unlike other Smalltalk implementations , this is designed from the ground up for interoperability .
Smalltalk objects are compiled ( to native code ) as Objective - C objects .
This means that they can subclass Objective - C objects , and can even implement categories on Objective - C objects .
There is no C function interface - if you want to call C functions then call them from Objective -C .
The compiler is in three components .
Smalltalk Kit contains everything required to take a string containing Smalltalk code and compile it to a set of Objective - C objects .
The Support library contains things needed by Smalltalk but not Objective - C . The most important class here is the BlockClosure class , which implements a Smalltalk block as an Objective - C object with a function pointer as an instance variable and pointers to bound variables and space for promoting other variables ( eliminating the need for garbage collected stack frames ) .
There are also a few categories , such as map : and related methods on NSArray which take blocks as arguments .
Note that these are implemented in Objective - C even though they are used by Smalltalk - they could , in most cases , easily be implemented in Smalltalk instead .
The final part is a tool which compiles a Smalltalk file , instantiates a specified class , and send the instance a run message .
This is very small and shows how the compiler can be used , and will serve as the framework for writing complete applications in Smalltalk .
The parsing is done in Objective - C , using the Lemon parser generator from SQLite .
The abstract syntax tree ( AST ) is constructed out of Objective - C objects , which means it 's exposed to Smalltalk .
As a result , Smalltalk programs can generate code easily by constructing the AST and invoking its compileWith : method , or by instantiating a parser and giving it a string .
Currently , the compiler only works in - process .
It uses runtime introspection when constructing the AST .
Code generation , however , is done via LLVM , and involves generating an LLVM intermediate representation ( IR ) version of the AST , running LLVM optimisation passes on this , and then compiling it to native code .
With minor modifications , it is possible to emit the LLVM IR as bitcode and then run extra optimisations on it or compile and link it as a native library .
Whether this is interesting depends on how long it takes to run the compiler .
For the simple test I 've done so far , program startup has taken much longer than parsing and code generation ( and I 'm using a debug build of LLVM , which is about 10 % the speed of a release build ) .
For larger programs , it might be worth statically - compiling .
If parsing is a major overhead , it might be worth caching the bitcode for each Smalltalk input class .
So far , it is a fairly naive implementation .
Lots more optimisations are possible ( some are very easy ) than are currently done .
My aim , however , is to move as many as possible into LLVM passes , so that they can be used when compiling other dynamic languages .
The code representing the Objective - C object model is taken from code I wrote for clang , the new C language family front end for LLVM , and so is also used for compiling Objective - C with LLVM .
Home » Twenty - Three Moves Suffice Submitted by rokicki on Tue , 04/29/2008 - 13:45 .
After solving more than 200,000 cosets , we have been able to show that every position of Rubik 's cube can be solved in 23 or fewer face turns .
The key contribution for this new result was 7.8 core - years of CPU time contributed by John Welborn and Sony Pictures Imageworks , using idle time on the render farm that was used for pictures such as Spider - Man 3 and Surf 's Up .
No distance 21 positions were found in this search , despite solving a total of more than four million billion cube positions .
The same techniques for the proof of twenty - five moves were used , just on many more computers .
To prove 22 would require , using this technique , solving somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million cosets .
We are investigating refinements to our techniques to reduce the CPU time required .

Last week all eyes were on the Short Squeeze In Financials , triggered by a SEC Order To Protect Those Most Responsible For Naked Shorting , and fueled by nearly everyone going ga - ga over fabricated earning reports at Wells Fargo and Citigroup .
However , most missed the quiet but extremely important action in the corporate bond market .
Please consider Bond Sales Slow to $ 5.3 Billion as Spreads Approach March Highs
Corporate bond sales fell to $ 5.3 billion this week as the yield over benchmark rates that investors demand to own the debt approached the highest levels of the year .
Sales compare with $ 11.7 billion last week , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Issuance slowed as the average spread on investment - grade bonds climbed to 7 basis points shy of its 2008 high and junk - bond spreads surpassed 800 basis points for the first time since March .
Overall corporate sales compare with a weekly average this year of $ 21.2 billion .
The extra yield investors demand to own investment - grade bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries climbed 9 basis points to 297 basis points as of yesterday , compared with 305 basis points reached on March 20 , according to Merrill Lynch & Co.'s U.S. Corporate Master index .

ウェブ華鑑賞 : Procol Buffer 編
Protocol Buffer の話題は一部で熱く語られた ... というより炎上していた .
ようやく炎がおさまってきたから , 野次馬として現場にかけつけてみたい. 火事と喧嘩はウェブの華 .
火元から見ていこう . 熱心な Google ウォッチャーである MS の Dare Obasanjo が , protobuf 公開に合わせ すかさ ず " The Revenge of RPC : Google Protocol Buffers and Facebook Thrift " という記事を書いた .
記事の主張自体は穏当なもの .
「 最近一部で バイナリエンコードな RPC が流行ってるみたいだけど , 時代は XML と REST で疎結合じゃなかったの？ 」と修辞的な疑問を示しつつ , " いや基本的 に Web は XML で REST な時代なんだけど , Web に出ない会社の内部ならバージョンやらツールを揃えられるでしょ.
それならバイナリと RPC で密結合しちゃって効率を稼いでもいいんだよ . " とフォローする内容だった .
Steve Vinoski 登場
ところが obasanjo が記事の中でそれとなく引用した , Steve Vinoski ( stevevin ) の " Convenience Over Correctness " から火が出た .
Steve Vinoski は CORBA ベンダである IONA の元社員で , RPC や分散オブジェクトでは相当痛い目に当ったらしい .
彼の書いた blog や雑誌記事では RPC をボロクソに叩いている . この " Convenience Over Correctness " もその流れを汲む内容 .
" プログラマは目先の便利さに釣られて関数呼びだしっぽく使える
RPC を好むけど , 関数呼びだしじゃないことに気がついた時には手遅れだぜアホどもめ " と戒めている . ( 誇張あり . )
その stevevin が obasanjo のリンクへ呼応するようにエントリを書いた .
これが炎上の現場となる .
" Protocol Buffers : Leaky RPC " と題された記事は , まず Protocol Buffer の公開にはしゃぐ Google 社員 Mark Pilgrim を指してこういう .
" 彼のいうとおり protobuf はバイナリで小さくて良いかもしれない .
でも良くみるとこれ RPC が付いてるよ . ダメじゃん ! "
先に見たとおり , OSS protobuf に RPC の実装は含まれていない .
stevevin もそれは承知している .
しかし元 CORBA 関係者にとって , protobuf に含まれるインターフェイスは 十分批判の材料になる .
( もともと stevevin は " RPC のメタファは完全にウンコ " と主張してるからね . ) こんあインターフェイスじゃ , ろくなエラー処理も書けない .
関数の idempotency ( 冪等性. HTTP の GET みたいなもの ) も示せない .
キャンセルの API があるけど下回りがキャンセル不能なインフラだったらどうする ... と 散々にこき下ろし , protobuf RPC は " leaky abstraction " だと結論する .
そして " Google は RPC 部分を消しちゃった方がよくね？ " と記事を締め括っている .
挑発的な内容にさっそくコメント欄が引火する.
" 偉大なる Google 様は社内で protobuf を常用してらっしゃる .
貴様のような輩が検索語をタイプする裏では protobuf のメッセージが飛び交っているというに 何たる狼藉であるか馬鹿者! 主は COM も知らんのか ? " と煽ったり ( CORBA に私怨があるとしか思えない相手へ COM を引き合いに出す辺りに煽りの素質を感じる . )
" 完全にウンコってなんですか ? よくわかりません＞＜ " とからかったり , " RPC だって非同期くらいあるからね .
Thrift とか Rabbit AMQP とかを読むと良いと思うよ？ " と無邪気に提案してみたり .
( stevevin は CORBA を始めとする通信ミドルウェアの専門家で , AMQP の標準化と実装にも噛んでいる . )
stevevin も大人気なくいちいち返事をしていく .
" Google のどこで RPC が使われてるんですかー ?おしてくださーい " " 何年も前から証拠は上がっているのに , お前こそ RPC がウンコ < でない > と思うなんて正気 ? " " 素人はこのサイトを全部読んでから出直してこい. AMQP くらい知ってるわアホ " という具合 .
( 誇張あり. ) 典型的な炎上のシナリオだ .
社員参戦
stevevin のベタな対応に薄笑いを浮べながら読み進める読者は , しかしここで彼の真の実力 -- 釣り能力 -- の高さを思い知ることになる .
なんと Google の OSS protobuf 担当 Kenton Varda が 現れたのだ .
" protobuf の RPC は社内でめっちゃ使ってますよ .
RPC の実装はリリースに入れられなかったけど , あるにはあるんすよ .
依存しちゃってるんで消すのは無理っすwww エラーも戻り値で返せは大丈夫です. たとえば... " と わざわざサンプルコードを示してくれる . さすが社員. そして idempotency は特に役に立つ場面が見当らない .
シンプルさのためにマイナー機能は入れないようにしている , 例外もそう .
キャンセルの実装はクライアントローカルに閉じたもので , 下回りは関係ない ... などと実情を明かし , " RPC が万能じゃないのは認めるけど , 使い所はけっこうありますよ. そんじゃ " とまっとうな感じで締める .
これに対し , stevevin は " idempotent は CORBA より昔からある重要な概念でしょうよ " とか , 呼び出し先の例外じゃなくてシステムの例外もあるでしょうと反論.
外野も再び騒ぎだし , 混迷は深まっていく .
" RFC707 読んだけど RPC がよくわかりません＞＜ " " たしかに他所のミドルウェアに は idempotent あるねえ . "
" CORBA 標準化委員から飛んで来ました .
idempotent はトランザクションの実装が必須になるので , 標準からは drop したはずです . "
" いやトランザクション要らないでしょ " " 書いたもの全部読めって横柄じゃね?
Google 社員は親切だったのに ... " " 15 年の経験を一言で言えって方が横柄だ よ " " RFC 難しいってのは確かだけど , みんな使ってるんだから有用性は明らかじゃん " " いや深い考えなしにテクノロジーを採用するなんてよくあることじゃん "
( 元ミドルウェア屋が言うと身も蓋もないなー... )
そして stevevin が , " そもそも Google の RPC 実装は見られないんだから , 出ている範囲で判断するしかないじゃん .
そりゃ非公開の API があって上で言ったような問題を解決できるかもしれないけど... " と 愚痴たところで , ふたたび 社員 kenton が登場 .
役目をわきまえている .
" protobuf の API にあるのは最低限の必須インターフェイスだけで , 各実装は独自の API があるんすよ .
たとえば timeout を指定するなら SetTimeout ( ) があればいいけど , 実際あります .
そんなかんじで色々実装すれば OK . "
stevevin はすかさず idempotent の問題に噛み付く .
それがプログラマへのヒントならドキュメントに書いとけばいいじゃんと kenton .
盛り上る外野 , 脱線する野次馬 .
インピーダンスミスマッチだ , REST だって RPC みたいなもんじゃね？ いやちがう , DCOM じゃなくて COM ならそこそこ使われてるよ .
それ言ったら CORBA だって使われまくってるけど別に出来が良いからじゃないよ( 言っちゃった... ) , RFC707 によると ... , Fielding の thesis 読め , ORB子と SOA 太 と REST 男 の三角関係が ...
再開そして決 闘
話が収束しないまま疲労がたまり , 議論が行き詰まってきたところで火花は飛び火する.
ZeroC の CTO , Michi Henning が 参戦してきたのだ .
おお , 俄然盛り上がってきた ! ( 野次馬的には . )
stevevin と同じく , michi も元 CORBA ベンダのエンジニアだ .
CORBA 屋をやめてミドルウェアと無関係のスタートアップに移った stevevin に対し , michi は ( これも小さな企業である ) ZeroC で , 打倒 CORBA を目指す 高速な分散オブジェクトシステム ICE を開発している .
michi は " The Rise and Fall of CORBA " という記事を書くようなアンチ CORBA 派. しかし ICE を見ればわかるように , 分散オブジェクト自体を諦めてはいない .
対する stevevin は " RPC はウンコ " と罵り , 分散オブジェクト自体を捨てている .
( ちなみに今は REST がお気に入りらしい . )
ところでこの二人 , まったくの他人ではない .
まだ CORBA の世界にいたところ , 彼らは Advanced CORBA Programming with C++ という CORBA の専門書を共著している .
いわば僚友だ . しかし時は流れた .
理想論を捨てられない michi の青さに苛立つ stevevin と , ダークサイトに堕ちた stevevin に憤る michi .
michi : " なぜだ ? なぜ裏切ったスティーブ!?
分散透過の原則をあれほど愛した君が... 確かに CORBA は失敗した !
でもたった...たったそれだけで諦めたのか?
RFC707 を踏み躙るとは ! 僕は君を許さない !! " stevevin : " わかってないのはお前の方だよミッチー ...
CORBA だけじゃない , EJB , SOAP , あらゆる分散オブジェクトが現れては消えていった .
参照透過こそが幻想なんだよ. さあ , 剣を抜け ! 決着を付けてやる !! "
というかんじで , 袂をわけた二人がいま対峙している! ( 誇張あり . ) 野次馬としては勝手に盛り上がらざるを得ない.
ただ話の内容は地味だ .
michi は RFC707 を引用し , そこには RPC の定義がないと指摘する .
その上で他の資料から RPC の定義を推測し , Ice を始めとするモダンな実装はかつての制限を打破してるから , 30 年前の RFC ( RFC707 は 1976 年 1 月更新 ) を元にダメと言われても困ると主張する .
すかさず反論する stevevin .
RFC707 の 4 b 節を引き , " The procedure call model " が RFC の定義なのだと反論する .
そしてこの定義こそがまさにダメだとした上で , たしかに 30 年たったおかげで RPC < ではない > 技術も色々登場したからよかったよと吐き捨てる.
性格わるい .
michi のターン .
いま HTTP の GET を RPC だと思う人はいないけれど , RFC707 の定義で GET と他の RPC invocation を区別することはできないと主張し , やはり RFC707 は古過ぎて , 今時の分散システムを議論する論拠には不適切だと反撃する .
stevevin のターン .
WS -* みたいのを置いておけば HTTP と関数呼びだしは全然違う .
RPC の元々のアイデアは , 言語機 能 ( 関数 ) を拡張して通信を扱うことだけれど , これが本当に一番良い抽象なのかという疑問が RPC ダメ論なのだと語る .
REST はもっとシンプルなのだと .
( このへんの主張は 冒頭にあらわれた RPC 批判 " Convenience Over Correctness " や REST 礼賛 " Serendipitous Reuse " に詳しい . )
michi のターン .
python で httplib を使ったコードを示し , いやほら , 関数呼び出しっぽいべ？ と主張 .
なんか急にしょぼい話に...
stevevin のターン .
REST の thesis を引用し , Fielding 自身が REST と RPC は違うと言ってんだろ , と主張 .
まあこれは michi の REST 理解が甘く , stevevin は正しい気がする .
そのあと外野が乱入し , いや RPC も便利な場面あるよ仕事で使ってるけど , と横槍 .
そういう場面があるのは知ってる.
ちなみに組み込みで REST も悪くないよと stevevin .
せっかく盛り上っていたのに尻すぼみしてしまった.
あーあ. 野次馬は家に帰ろう ...
なお , Michi はこの話題について続きを書くと宣言している .
興味のある人は blog を参照のこと .
あとがき
話が野次馬ビューに偏りすぎてしまった. もう少し技術的な補足をする予定だったけれど , 疲れた今日はこのへんまで. 気がむいたら続きます .
出演 :
The 3,500 - gallon spill of a toxic chemical into San Pablo Bay over the weekend cost an estimated $ 250,000 to clean up - and it was all for a lousy $ 10 worth of brass .
The thieves who caused the spill of the chemical toluene at Reaction Products in Richmond were after the valves on holding tanks - the latest example of a crime wave involving barely precious metals that yield a few dollars at the recycling yard but can cost taxpayers big bucks .
In the past year , thieves have stolen everything from copper wiring along the Richmond Parkway to the little aluminum shades that go over the city 's red , green and yellow street signals .
" You wo n't believe the lengths that thieves will go to these days for a couple of bucks worth of metal , " said Richmond police Lt. Mark Gagan .
It 's happening in San Francisco as well , where someone stole two nearly century - old bronze plaques from the Shakespeare Garden in Golden Gate Park a couple of weeks back .
" And that was just a week after the cops busted a dude who was dragging a 300 - pound bronze tablet from Dolores Park , " said Recreation and Park Department spokeswoman Rose Dennis .
The damage can run into the thousands - as evidenced by metal bandits in Richmond who pulled an air conditioning unit out of the Nevin Community Center , and in the process ruptured a water pipe .
The building flooded , causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage .
" All for a few feet of copper wire and plumbing worth about $ 2.50 , " Gagan said .
Replacing the stripped wiring on the Richmond Parkway cost an estimated $ 250,000 and prompted the city to install wire alarms .
And its not just public property that 's getting hit .
Some homeowners have come back from extended absences to find that metal thieves have torn out their interior walls and carted off wiring and piping .
Even the dead are targets .
Last year , Gagan said , metal thieves made off with more than 200 little graveside bronze flower vases from Rolling Hills Memorial Park cemetery in Richmond .
Measuring up :
It was all smiles for the cameras a few days back as San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and Sen.
Dianne Feinstein held a rally in Bayview - Hunters Point in support of Proposition G , the June ballot measure backing a big development at Candlestick Point that could include a new home for the 49ers .
But with vote - by - mail balloting already getting under way this week , there is a growing fear behind the scenes that the measure is in danger of going down far short of the goal line .
A lack of unified support from the Board of Supervisors , the absence of a deal with organized labor over how much " workforce housing " should be included , and a rival " poison pill " initiative by Supervisor Chris Daly that would require half the homes built to be affordable housing , threaten to upend the mayor 's big development before it even gets off the ground .
" You can always count on a certain number of folks to line up and do the wrong thing , " said Prop .
G and mayoral campaign adviser Eric Jaye .
" It 's really destructive ... but I do n't think anyone is surprised . "
Recent polls conducted by developer Lennar Corp .'s " Yes on G " campaign show that while the measure is ahead 50 percent to 30 percent , Daly's " companion " Proposition F is leading by an even wider margin - 58 percent to 31 percent .
And even if Prop .
G gets more votes , Prop .
F needs only simple majority approval to take effect .
If that happens , " it 's all over - we absolutely can't do the project at 50 percent ( affordable hous - ing ) , " said Kofi Bonner , head of Lennar 's San Francisco office .
The mayor 's City Hall point man on the project , Michael Cohen , calls Daly 's initiative " reckless and dishonest " - arguing that it will kill development in the city 's southeast corner for years .
Daly , whose initiative has the backing of the weekly Bay Guardian and the local chapter of the Sierra Club , said the Lennar plan - at least in its present form - deserves to die .
" This out - of - state developer should play by the rules and meet the needs of everyday San Franciscans , " he said .
Not surprisingly , with millions of dollars already invested in the project , Lennar is gearing up for a costly campaign against Prop .
F that highlights Daly - not exactly the town 's most popular politician - as its biggest backer .
Meanwhile , Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin is also holding back his endorsement of the mayor 's plan , and instead is turning up the heat on Lennar to bend more for the unions .
Put it all together , and what once looked like a sure thing for Lennar is shaping up more as a 50 - 50 bet at best .
Hurd on the street : Veteran NBC - 11 reporter Cheryl Hurd found herself the star of her own story on San Francisco 's plague of car robberies the other day when she had her computer snatched right out of her lap as she sat in her camera truck working on a story about " smash and grab " robberies in the Western Addition .
Hurd had just wrapped up her interviews and had parked on the corner of Eddy and Buchanan streets for her live shot .
" Three men walked up very close to the van and the next thing I know the passenger door was pulled open , " Hurd said .
" They grabbed the computer and ran . "
It all happened right under a police surveillance camera .
The cops are still looking for the guys who did it .
And finally : San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 'sgubernatorial road show continued Tuesday with some nice photo ops in Israel - first of the mayor laying a wreath at slain leader Yitzhak Rabin 's memorial , then meeting with Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai .
When Huldai mentioned that he had to deal with a legislative body of 31 members , Newsom - who has 11 supervisors of his own to contend with - sympathetically shot back , " I 'm sorry to hear that . "
" Yes , " Huldai said after the laughter subsided , " but ours only meets once a month . "

" Too good to be true , " most cubicle occupants would probably say , but an upcoming book about this results - only work environment is not fiction .
In fact , authors Cali Ressler and Jody Thompson pioneered the concept while working at consumer electronics chain Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N , which now makes the option available to about 3,000 of its 4,000 corporate staffers .
In “ Why Work Sucks and How To Fix It ” ( Portfolio , $ 23.95 ) , Ressler and Thompson maintain that time -- or control over it -- heals many corporate wounds .
Too often , they say , a company will treat employees like children incapable of working without supervision , while promoting mediocre performers simply because they put in a lot of time at their desks .
Meanwhile , the traditional work week of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday no longer serves the needs of many customers .
In a results - oriented work environment ( ROWE ) , however , a company focuses exclusively on job performance , rather than work schedules or office politics .
At Best Buy , productivity has increased , and fewer of the employees that the company wanted to retain have left , although “ involuntary ” turnover rates have increased as unsatisfactory workers were exposed .
Employees can do their jobs at home or in Starbucks , first thing in the morning or in the middle of the night .
One of the hallmarks of a ROWE is that a person who goes home at 2 p.m. is not leaving early , while someone who arrives at that time is not late .
The book , which is set for publication on Monday , includes the story of an e-learning specialist who typically wakes up without an alarm and does at least some of his work at home in front of the television set .
Meanwhile , a dot - com employee has been able to spend more time with her son .
The authors have gone on to apply the ROWE concept at a small financial services company in Wisconsin through CultureRx , the consulting firm they have founded .
“ We ’ve perfected ROWE for the office environment today , ” Ressler said , “ but we know that there are elements of it that can be spread to any company in the country and across the world . ”
But with ROWE still in its infancy , unhappy employees may have to resort to other measures .
Luckily , a couple of new books offer some suggestions .
For those who want to make the best of the corporate life , “ How To Be Useful ” ( Houghton Mifflin , $ 19.95 ) combines what author Megan Hustad calls the best of the past century or so of “ success literature ” and tailors the advice to the young and cynical .
“ I ’d like everyone to be more aware of what was being written back when working for a living was actually a source of inspiration to people , ” writes Hustad , a former book editor and bookstore manager .
But there are always people who fantasize about leaving the rat race .
“ Escape from Corporate America ” ( Ballantine , $ 15 ) by marketing - executive - turned - career - coach Pamela Skillings provides a step - by - step guide to finding more fulfilling work , whether with another employer or as an entrepreneur , freelancer or artist .
“ You do n’t have to stay stuck in a job you hate , and you do n’t have to starve to find work you love , ” Skillings writes .
“ All you need is a plan and a little bit of nerve . ”

Online Advertising Spiraling Downward
Abbey Klaassen at AdAge.com published this report last Friday ,
“ Just three months ago , it seemed as though the internet advertising industry could get through this tough economy relatively unscathed .
But in what may be a bad sign for a seemingly recession - resistant sector , several internet companies have reported relatively disappointing earnings .
The giant in the space , Google , did n’t grow as fast as analysts expected , and its shares dropped about 7 % on the news .
It reported net income of $ 1.25 billion , or $ 3.92 per diluted share , up 35 % from $ 925 million , or $ 2.93 per diluted share , during second - quarter 2007 .
Of course , Google does n’t offer financial guidance , so there ’s a greater chance investors can be caught off - guard .
The company continued to milk the stronger international economy , which accounted for 52 % of total revenue , up from 51 % .
Google spreads the blame
Despite the troubles , Google executives did n’t blame the economy or weakness in the online advertising sector , instead attributing the company ’s less - stellar - than - hoped - for performance primarily to financial moves and a bit to costs related to its acquisition of advertising service DoubleClick .
However , signs from other companies , such as display - ad - heavy ValueClick , indicate the economy is having an effect on the sector .
ValueClick announced it was paring back its second - quarter guidance .
The company now estimates growth will be in the low - single digits for 2008 , compared with the first quarter ’s 17 % growth .
Display and comparison - shopping business was proving particularly weak .
“ Against a deteriorating macro - environment , online display advertising is being materially impacted , much more so than performance - based search advertising , ” wrote Citibank analyst Mark Mahaney .
“ We believe [ ValueClick ] is seeing display - ad weakness across almost all verticals . ”
Such news , he added , could have negative implications for a company with a heavy display business , such as Yahoo . ”

Mattias Lindgren shares his experience setting up a VPN connection with a Cisco device :
A friend of mine and I wanted to see how easy it would be to set up a reasonably secure IPSec tunnel between OpenBSD and a Cisco router .
Inspired by the SecurityFocus article " Zero to IPSec in 4 minutes " , we wanted to see if we could repeat the same feat .
Mattias continues below .
Edit ( 2008/07/16 ) : Cisco configuration fixed as pointed out in the comments .
( merdely )
This evening 's contestants consist of a Soekris Net4801 running OpenBSD 4.3 and a Cisco 2621 router running 12.4 code .
OpenBSD already has a great framework for working with IPSec , called ipsecctl ( 8 ) , which we used to simplify the configuration .
It reads from ipsec.conf ( 5 ) to generate reasonable IPSec flows .
The networks are denoted as follows :
OpenBSD private subnet : a.a.a.a/24
Cisco private subnet : b.b.b.b/24
OpenBSD public address : A.A.A.A
Cisco public address : B.B.B.B
I started out by editing my ipsec.conf file on the OpenBSD box and entered the following :
ike esp from a.a.a.a/24 to b.b.b.b/24 \ peer B.B.B.B \ main auth hmac - sha1 enc aes - 128 group modp1536 \ quick auth hmac - sha1 enc aes - 128 \ srcid A.A.A.A psk " mekmitasdigoat "
The next step is to allow the appropriate traffic through the PF firewall .
The following lines were entered :
pass in on $ ext_if inet proto udp from B.B.B.B to A.A.A.A port 500 pass in on $ ext_if inet proto esp from B.B.B.B to A.A.A. A set skip on enc0
All that remains on OpenBSD is to start up the VPN subsystems with the following commands :
isakmpd -K ipsecctl -f /etc/ipsec.conf
Now , moving over to the Cisco side .
The relevant configuration sections looks something like this :
crypto isakmp policy 10 encr aes authentication pre-share group 5 crypto isakmp key mekmitasdigoat address A.A.A.A crypto isakmp keepalive 30 5 crypto ipsec transform - set aes - set esp-aes esp - sha-hmac !
crypto map VPN 15 ipsec- isakmp set peer A.A.A.A set transform - set aes - set match address VPN - to - OpenBSD !
interface FastEthernet0/0 crypto map VPN ip address B.B.B.B ip access - group INET in !
ip access - list extended INET permit esp any any permit udp any any eq isakmp ! ip access - list extended VPN - to - OpenBSD permit ip b.b.b.b 0.0.0.255 a.a.a.a 0.0.0.255
That was all there is to it .
VPN came up on the first try .
Time spent : 4 minutes 1 seconds , d'oh !
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush pressed lawmakers Tuesday to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling , saying " the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil resources is action from the U.S. Congress . "
President Bush wants Congress to repeal a law that prohibits offshore oil drilling .
On Monday , the president lifted an executive order that prohibited offshore drilling .
A 1981 law barring the practice remains in effect , however , and Congress would have to vote to repeal the law before any drilling could occur .
Congressional Democrats have opposed efforts to repeal the ban .
" The sooner Congress lifts the ban , the sooner we can get these resources from the ocean floor to the refineries , to the gas pump , " the president said .
" Democratic leaders have been delaying action on offshore exploration , and now they have an opportunity to show that they finally heard the frustrations of the American people , " Bush said .
" They should match the action I have taken , repeal the congressional ban and pass legislation to facilitate responsible offshore exploration . "
Watch Bush say ' it 's time to get it done ' »
Congressional Republicans joined the president in pressing the Democrats to repeal the drilling ban .
House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , accused congressional Democrats of standing " in the way of more American - made energy " and pushed for legislation that would not only permit offshore drilling but also allow oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and the processing of oil - containing sand in the West .
Democrats have repeatedly blocked oil exploration in ANWR , arguing that it would damage the fragile Arctic environment .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R- Kentucky , said " $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline is unacceptable to the American people and unacceptable to the Republicans in Congress , and we want to do something about it .
And doing something about it involves both finding more and using less .
We need to do both . "
See how gas prices have gone up across the country »
But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , resisted the Republicans ' calls for an expansion of offshore drilling , saying it would do little to reduce prices at the pump in the near term .
What the president should do immediately to lower gas prices , Pelosi said , is release oil from the 700 million barrels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Bush has resisted that move because , he says , it would hurt national security .
" The president said ... that drilling offshore would not have an impact on the price at the pump , and I 'm glad he 's finally admitted that to the American people , " Pelosi said .
" Our message back to the president is , ' It 's the economy , Mr. President . ' "
Watch how drilling will not lower the price at the pump »
Officials in coastal states , including Florida and California , have also expressed opposition to Bush 's push to expand offshore drilling .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , issued a statement Monday afternoon that said , " I know people are frustrated with the soaring price of gas , and I welcome the national debate on solutions to lower our energy costs , but in California , we know offshore drilling is not the answer .
We will continue to foster a market for alternative energies , because choice is the only way we will ultimately bring down fuel costs . "
iReport.com : Is drilling the answer ?
But Bush said Tuesday that lifting the ban would " send a signal that we 're willing to explore for ... oil here at home . "
" I fully understand this is ... a transition period away from hydrocarbons , " he said .
" But we ought to be wise about how we ... use our own resources . "
The potential damage drilling could cause to reefs has been a major reason driving opposition to an expansion of offshore drilling , but Bush said new technology would allow companies to explore for oil without damaging coastal reefs .
" I 'm concerned about the reefs .
I 'm a fisherman .
I like to fish .
Reefs are important for fisheries , " Bush said .
" But the technology is such that you can protect the reefs , " he said , noting that new techniques allow for companies to drill vertically far from a reef and then drill horizontally to get to oil reserves that are under sensitive reef environments .

A photoblog is like a regular blog except that the principal content is not text but photographs .
The main reason for choosing a photoblog is that the range of features to be implemented is small enough so that we can concentrate on their design and implementation .
The goals behind going through this application are as follows :
To see how to slice the development of a web application into meaningful layers and therefore show that a web application is not very different from a rich application sitting on your desktop .
To show that the separation of concerns can also be applied to the web interface itself by using principles grouped under the name of Ajax .
To introduce common Python packages for dealing with common aspects of web development such as database access , HTML templating , JavaScript handling , etc .
Photoblog Entities
As mentioned earlier , the photoblog will try to stay as simple as possible in order to focus on the other aspects of developing a web application .
In this section , we will briefly describe the entities our photoblog will manipulate as well as their attributes and relations with each other .
In a nutshell our photoblog application will use the following entities and they will be associated as shown in the following figure :
This figure is not what our application will look like but it shows the entities our application will manipulate .
One photoblog will contain several albums , which in turn will host as many films as required , which will carry the photographs .
In other words , we will design our application with the following entity structure :
Entity : Photoblog
Role :
This entity will be the root of the application .
Attributes :
name : A unique identifier for the blog
title : A public label for the blog
Relations :
One photoblog will have zero to many albums
Entity : Album
Role :
An album carries a story told by the photographs as an envelope .
Attributes :
name : A unique identifier for the album
title : A public label for the album
author :
The name of the album ’s author
description : A simple description of the album used in feeds
story : A story attached to the album
created : A timestamp of when the album is being created
modified : A timestamp of when the album is being modified
blog_id : A reference to the blog handling the album
Relations :
One album will reference zero to several films
Entity : Film
Role : A film gathers a set of photographs .
Attributes :
name : A unique identifier for the film
title : A public label for the film
created : A timestamp of when the film is being created
modified : A timestamp of when the film is being modified
album_id : A reference to the album
Relations :
A film will reference zero to several photographs
Entity : Photo
Role :
The unit of our application is a photograph .
Attributes :
name : A unique identifier for the photo
legend : A legend associated with the photograph
filename :
The base name of the photograph on the hard - disk
filesize :
The size in bytes of the photograph
width : Width of the photograph in pixels
height : Height of the photograph in pixels
created : A timestamp of when the photograph is being created
modified : A timestamp of when the photograph is being modified
film_id : A reference to the film carrying the photograph
Relations : None
Functionally , the photoblog application will provide APIs to manipulate those entities via the traditional CRUD interface : Create , Retrieve , Update , and Delete .
Vocabulary
Here is a list of the terms we will be using :
Persistence : Persistence is the concept of data items outliving the execution of programs manipulating them .
Simply put , it is the process of storing data in long lasting memory medium such as a disk .
Database : A database is a collection of organized data .
There are different organization models : hierarchical , network , relational , object - oriented , etc .
A database holds the logical representation of its data .
Database Management System ( DBMS ) : A DBMS is a group of related software applications to manipulate data in a database .
A DBMS platform should offer the following among other features : Persistence of the data A query language to manipulate data Concurrency control Security control Integrity control Transaction capabilities
We will use DBMSes as the plural of DBMS .
DBMSes Overview
In this section , we will quickly review the different kinds of existing DBMSes .
The goal is to quickly introduce their main characteristics .
Relational Database Management System ( RDBMS )
Of all DBMSes , the RDBMS is the most common , whether it is in small applications or multi-national infrastructure .
An RDBMS comes with a database based on the concepts of the relational model , a mathematical model that permits the logical representation of a collection of data through relations .
A relational database should be a concrete implementation of the relational model .
However , modern relational databases follow the model only to a certain degree .
The following table shows the correlation between the terms of the relational model and the relational database implementation .
Relational databases support a set of types to define the domain of scope a column can use .
However , there are only a limited number of supported types , which can be an issue with complex data types as allowed in objected - oriented design .
Structure Query Language more commonly known as SQL is the language used to define , manipulate , or control data within a relational database .
The following table is a quick summary of SQL keywords and their contexts .
A construction of these keywords is called an SQL statement .
When executed , an SQL statement returns a collection of rows of the data matching the query or nothing .
The relational model algebra uses the relation composition to compose operations across different sets ; this is translated in the relational database context by joins .
Joining tables allows complex queries to be shaped to filter out data .
SQL provides the following three kinds of joins :

Archaeologists google an ancient find
Indiana Jones 's next adventure may well be in front of a computer if Hollywood scriptwriters decide to embrace a new approach to archaeological research in war - torn zones .
David Thomas , a PhD student in La Trobe University 's archaeological program in Melbourne , has used Google Earth to safely uncover historic sites in a remote part of war - torn Afghanistan .
Using the free internet resource , Thomas found up to 450 possible archaeological sites in Registan , which borders Helmand and Kandahar provinces in southern Afghanistan .
The decision to use Google Earth was " partly born out of adversity " , Thomas says when a planned field trip was cancelled because of security concerns .
The region has been made inaccessible because of the ongoing military conflict between western and Afghan government forces and the former Taliban government .
Since the Soviet invasion in 1979 , Afghanistan has been increasingly difficult for archaeologists to visit , he says .
However , Google Earth allows archaeologists to overcome the perils of war zones .
Bounty of new sites
Thomas 's approach has reaped a huge bounty of new details about known archaeological sites , and uncovered hundreds of previously unknown sites in the country .
Under the project , which was presented to the recent World Archaeological Congress in Dublin , Thomas and his team have surveyed a virtually unexplored 75 kilometre by 17 kilometre strip of the Registan desert .
Overlapping images of the area were zoomed to a scale 100 metres above the ground and the research team then tediously viewed the image for signs of archaeological sites .
Thomas says one 17 square kilometre took up to nine hours in front of the computer to assess .
After the initial review of the aerial maps , they had 1800 " suspicious sites " which were then reassessed and culled to 450 sites " that we think are significant " .
Among the structures the team has located are remnants of camp sites , villages centred on a mosque , animal corrals , reservoir , dams and water channels and military installations such as occupation mounds .
He says by using Google Earth he has been able to expand the known area of the Ghaznavid winter capital of Bust , on the Helmand River .
Impressive
" French archaeologists worked at the site from 1949 - 1952 , but despite their impressive achievements , large areas remain unsurveyed , " he says .
The aerial technology has allowed Thomas and his team to identify remnants of structures and canals at the medieval site and expand the known area of the site .
" [ Our ] plans provide Afghan archaeologists with the framework on which to base large area surveys and to undertake more detailed localised studies . "
Thomas says while the Google Earth approach cannot replace field work , it can give archaeologists access to areas that are off - limits due to war .
" The most valuable aspect of what we are doing is that we can pass on the information to the Institute of Archaeology in Afghanistan , " Thomas says .
" Then it is a question for them as to whether they can travel there and have the resources to investigate further . "
Thomas , whose doctorate is investigating the semi-nomadic Ghurid people and their empire that stretched from eastern Iran to Bengal in India in the latter part of the 12th century , says he hopes archaeologists will take Google Earth more seriously as a result of his finds .
" The potential for further research using Google Earth images is huge , particularly as the areas covered by high - resolution images increases , " he says .
The project is sponsored by the Cary Robertson Fund at Trinity College in Cambridge , England .
Barr : Since 9/11 , there has been unprecedented growth in government power and the ascendancy of this notion that , because they are fighting terrorism , the government can do whatever it wants regardless of law .
That has forced me to go back and take a look at areas that in prior times I could afford to support because we had a certain amount of freedom in other areas .
It 's no longer the case .
We have to be much more zealous in protecting ourselves against government power .
Once it may have made sense , been even acceptable to allow the government more leeway .

Farmers and food executives appealed fruitlessly to federal officials yesterday for regulatory steps to limit speculative buying that is helping to drive food prices higher .
Meanwhile , some Americans are stocking up on staples such as rice , flour and oil in anticipation of high prices and shortages spreading from overseas .
Their pleas did not find a sympathetic audience at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) , where regulators said high prices are mostly the result of soaring world demand for grains combined with high fuel prices and drought - induced shortages in many countries .
The regulatory clash came amid evidence that a rash of headlines in recent weeks about food riots around the world has prompted some in the United States to stock up on staples .
Costco and other grocery stores in California reported a run on rice , which has forced them to set limits on how many sacks of rice each customer can buy .
Filipinos in Canada are scooping up all the rice they can find and shipping it to relatives in the Philippines , which is suffering a severe shortage that is leaving many people hungry .
While farmers here and abroad generally are benefiting from the high prices , even they have been burned by a tidal wave of investors and speculators pouring into the futures markets for corn , wheat , rice and other commodities and who are driving up prices in a way that makes it difficult for farmers to run their businesses .
“ Something is wrong , ” said National Farmers Union President Tom Buis , adding that the CFTC ’s refusal to rein in speculators will force farmers and consumers to take their case to Congress .
“ It may warrant congressional intervention , ” he said .
“ The public is all too aware of the recent credit crisis on Wall Street .
We do n’t want a lack of oversight and regulation to lead to a similar crisis in rural America . ”
Food economists testifying at a daylong hearing of the commission said the doubling of rice and wheat prices in the past year is a result of strong income growth in China , India and other Asian countries , where people entering the middle class are buying more food and eating more meat .
Farm animals consume a substantial share of the world ’s grain .
U.S. wheat stocks are at the lowest levels in 60 years because worldwide consumption of wheat has exceeded production in six of the past eight years , said U.S. Agriculture Department chief economist Gerald Bange .
Adding to tight supplies was the back - to - back failure of two years of wheat crops caused by drought in Australia , a major wheat exporter , he said .
In addition , the diversion of one - third of the U.S. corn crop into making ethanol for vehicles has increased prices for corn and other staples such as soybeans and cotton as more acreage is set aside for ethanol production .
Farmers also have raised prices because they have been hard hit by spiraling energy costs , which not only raised the price of diesel fuel to records of over $ 4 a gallon but drove up the cost of nitrogen fertilizer , which is made from natural gas .
“ Commodity prices across the board are at levels not experienced in many of our lifetimes , ” said CFTC Chairman Walter Lukken .
“ These price levels , along with record energy costs , have put a strain on consumers as well as many producers and commercial participants that utilize the futures markets to manage risks . ”
The upswing in prices has been exaggerated by the massive influx of investors and speculators seeking to profit from rising prices for corn , wheat , oil , gold and other commodities .
Big Wall Street firms and hedge funds have taken huge positions in futures markets that once were dominated by relatively small operators such as farmers and grain - elevator owners .
Small investors , who see fast - rising commodities as good hedges against inflation and a falling dollar , also are getting a piece of the action by investing in index funds that are tied to commodity prices .
“ During such turbulent times , it is tempting to shoot first and ask questions later , ” Mr. Lukken said , but he contended the commission should be “ cautious ” about doing anything to curb speculation .
He and other regulators argued that speculators add volume and liquidity to the markets , which makes them operate more efficiently and helps farmers and other players .
Commissioner Michael V. Dunn said the soaring demand for food and fuel worldwide might be leading to permanently higher food prices , both domestically and abroad .
“ We may already be working under or fast approaching a new paradigm of higher agricultural prices , ” he said .
“ There is not a silver bullet or single solution to address the problems we are currently facing . ”

China and Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe ’s President Robert Mugabe and members of his regime for rigging the June 27 presidential runoff election .
The U.S. - sponsored resolution , which would have frozen the leaders ’ assets , barred them from leaving the country , and prohibited arms imports , aimed to pressure Mugabe to reach a political settlement with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change .
Zimbabwe ’s ambassador to the U.N. , Boniface Chidyausiku , said the resolution ’s failure was a blow to the United States ’ and Britain ’s attempts to use the Security Council as their tool to “ rule the world . ”
He said that the vetoes by China and Russia validated Zimbabwe ’s argument that the situation in his country did not warrant international intervention and that sanctions would undermine talks in South Africa between the ruling party and MDC leaders .

But British Ambassador John Sawers told the Council that it had “ failed to shoulder its responsibility to do what it can to prevent a national tragedy deepening and spreading its effects across southern Africa . ”
The MDC won the most seats in parliamentary elections March 29 , and its presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , received more votes than Mugabe .
But , officially , Tsvangirai fell short of a majority .
He eventually dropped out of the runoff , citing violence and intimidation by Mugabe ’s ZANU - PF party .
Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980 .
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin framed his country ’s veto as an expression of opposition to a larger trend of Western countries trying to intervene in other nations ’ matters , such as in Myanmar and Sudan , under the guise of protecting international security .

In Zimbabwe ’s case , he said , sanctions would only undercut South Africa ’s mediation efforts .
“ This resolution is nothing but an attempt to interfere in the internal matters of Zimbabwe , ” he said .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said any country opposing the resolution would “ be on the wrong side of history . ”
“ I do n’t see how anybody , anybody , any country in good conscience can vote against this resolution after witnessing what has gone on in Zimbabwe , ” McCormack said .

Nine countries voted in favor of the sanctions and one abstained .
Besides China and Russia , South Africa , Libya and Vietnam voted against .
A resolution needs at least nine yes votes and no vetoes to pass .
In Zimbabwe , the Movement for Democratic Change said 113 of its activists had been killed in violence since the elections , including one found dead Thursday .
Gift Mutsvungunu , an MDC polling agent , disappeared last week .
His eyes had been gouged out and his back was badly burned , according to the MDC .
Hundreds of other activists are in hiding , including one who sent a cellphone text message to The Times in Harare at midnight recently : “ Pliz help me , my life is in danger . ”
Despite the violence , the opposition ’s lobbying for a tough Security Council resolution was hampered when its own negotiators , including the party secretary general , Tendai Biti , met officials of the Mugabe regime in Pretoria , South Africa .

Although the MDC insisted that Biti ’s mission was only to formally set down the opposition ’s conditions for negotiations to begin , the visit was widely perceived in the international media as signaling a resumption of talks .
Tsvangirai had ruled out participation in talks of any kind until a second mediator is named to work alongside South African President Thabo Mbeki , who was appointed by a regional body , the Southern African Development Community , as the mediator .
The opposition says it has lost confidence in Mbeki .
The MDC is calling for the violence to stop , the militias to be disbanded , their bases to be closed , more than 1,500 political prisoners to be released and for the ZANU - PF to recognize the March 29 election .

The ZANU - PF insists that Mugabe , who claimed victory in the one - man presidential runoff after Tsvangirai withdrew because of the violence , be recognized as the legitimate leader .
The ruling party wants a ZANU - PF - dominated government of national unity , which it sees as a vehicle to regain legitimacy and win back the support of investors and international financial institutions .
The MDC wants to see some form of transitional arrangement to bring about a power transfer , but refuses to be drawn into details until after the negotiating mechanism is in place .

A Times staff writer in Harare , Zimbabwe , contributed to this report .
It says " the President has no intention of allowing any foreign power to catch up with the huge lead the United States has opened since the fall of the Soviet Union more than a decade ago " .
The document , titled The National Security Strategy of the United States , declares the policies of containment and deterrence - staples since the 1940s - all but dead .
There was no way in this changed world to deter those who " hate the United States and everything for which it stands " .
" America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones . "
The document delivers Mr Bush 's first comprehensive rationale for shifting military strategy towards pre-emptive action against hostile states and terrorist groups developing weapons of mass destruction .
He also seeks to answer the critics of growing US muscle - flexing by insisting that it will exploit its military and economic power to encourage " free and open societies " rather than seek " unilateral advantage " .
The document calls this " a distinctly American internationalism " .
Mr Bush put the final touches on the strategy last weekend at Camp David , after working on it for months with his national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , and with other members of the national security team .
It is the first wide - ranging explanation of the Administration 's foreign policy - from defence strategy to global warming .
Much of the document focuses on how public diplomacy , the use of foreign aid , and changes in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can be used to win what it calls a battle of competing values and ideas - including " a battle for the future of the Muslim world " .
It describes a commitment to bolster US foreign aid by 50 per cent in the next few years in " countries whose governments rule justly , invest in their people , and encourage economic freedom " .
A senior White House official said Mr Bush had edited the document heavily " because he thought there were sections where we sounded overbearing or arrogant " .
But its hawkishness is clear .
" Our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military build - up in hopes of surpassing , or equalling , the power of the United States . "
With Russia no longer able to come close to matching US military spending , the doctrine seems aimed at rising powers like China .
It cites the non-proliferation agreements that have failed to prevent Iran , North Korea , Iraq and other countries from obtaining weapons of mass destruction .
It says the US will never subject its citizens to the new International Criminal Court , " whose jurisdiction does not extend to Americans " .
The document makes no reference to the Kyoto accord but sets an overall objective of cutting US greenhouse gas emissions " per unit of economic activity by 18 per cent over the next 10 years " .

Customer : “ That ’s too much meat !
What are you doing ? ”

Would you like me to take some off ?
Customer : “ Only if you lower the price .
I said add more meat , so ADD it !

I make a solemn plea to sports analysts everywhere : Please stop referring to the 2007 - 08 Boston Celtics as the greatest turnaround in NBA history .
Or can we at least put an asterisk next to such a comment ?
For those sports fans who were not aware ( and I ’m looking at you , people living in the Biodome ) , the Celtics won the 2008 NBA Championship , and in the process they won an impressive 66 games .
During the 2006 - 07 season , however , the Celtics managed only 24 wins — but that ’s pretty impressive considering the team consisted of Paul Pierce , some eighth graders and a couple of those old guys whom you see playing at the rec center with Horace Grant - style glasses and braces on both knees .
I mean , sure , we all remember the huge splash they made in the free agent market when they signed Kevin Pittsnogle on July 26 , but amazingly they turned right around and got rid of him on October 20 .
The increase of 42 wins shattered the previous record of 32 games , set by the 1997 - 98 San Antonio Spurs .
Some attribute that amazing feat by the Spurs to the addition of guard Reggie Geary , but I ’ve stubbornly held that it had more to do with the drafting of this guy named Tim Duncan ( coupled with a healthier David Robinson ) .
Well , what happened in Boston ?
Did Brian Scalabrine pull Larry Bird out of his ass ?
Not that I ’m aware of .
Did Doc Rivers learn how to coach ?
Definitely not .
The Celtics were poised to get the number one pick in the 2007 NBA Draft and make Greg Oden the “ Shaq ” to Paul Pierce ’s “ Kobe . ”
But at the end of the Draft Lottery , Boston was shocked to find itself with the fifth pick , which was definitely the opposite of “ wicked awesome . ”
With Pierce growing more and more frustrated with the overall shittiness of the franchise , General Manager Danny Ainge decided it was time to resort to Plan B , entitled : “ We Got the Fifth Pick ?
Holy Shit !
What the Fuck Are We Going To Do Now ? ’
And so the Celtics executed a number of personnel moves ( the most underrated of which was the signing of James Posey ) .
Of course , the primary moves were a trade to acquire Ray Allen from the Seattle Supersonics and a trade to acquire Kevin Garnett from the Minnesota Timberwolves .
In fact , out of 15 players on the Celtics 2007 - 08 roster , only six were on the team during the 2006 - 07 season .
Boston went from a starting lineup of ( then - rookie ) Rajon Rondo , Wally Szczerbiak , Paul Pierce , Al Jefferson and Kendrick Perkins to a lineup of Rajon Rondo , Ray Allen , Paul Pierce , Kevin Garnett and Kendrick Perkins ( not to mention a slew of better bench players ) .
So , really the analysts are right : the Celtics experienced an incredible single season turnaround .
Unfortunately , it was a turnaround of their roster .
Does this devalue the Celtics championship ?
Of course not .
My frustration is merely with those people who tend to give credit where credit is not due .
To most people , a “ dramatic turnaround ” is keeping relatively the same roster , drafting one ( albeit incredible ) player and winning 32 more games — it ’s not adding two future Hall - of - Famers , completely changing your bench players and winning 42 more games .
Which brings me to Danny Ainge .
We ’re quick to forget that he was on the hot seat before this season .
I ’ll admit , Ainge deserves credit simply for pulling off these trades , but it ’s time for everyone else to admit that he fell ass - backwards into this scenario : he is not some sort of GM genius .
First of all , he was extremely lucky that there were two teams out there that were in full rebuilding mode and were very eager to unload their respective superstars .
People are acting like somehow this was Ainge ’s plan all along : stockpile young players and eventually trade them for superstars .
In what way is that a reliable strategy ?
In actuality , Ainge was planning on drafting Greg Oden or Kevin Durant and hoping that either one would form a nice core with Pierce and Al Jefferson .
When they wound up with the fifth pick in the Draft , Ainge was forced to say “ fuck it ” and trade the team away or risk being fired halfway through the season .
This probably makes me seem bitter about the Celtics ’ success ; however , although I would n’t say that I was rooting for them in the Finals , I definitely was not upset about them winning .
There are three reasons for this mindset :
1 ) My hatred of Kobe , Phil Jackson and the Lakers reigns supreme ; 2 ) The result of the Finals made my team , the Cleveland Cavaliers , look pretty damn good considering we almost defeated Boston with nothing more than Lebron James and some cardboard cut-outs of basketball players ; and 3 ) I ’m kind of excited ( make that downright giddy ) about the prospect of the Celtics following the exact same path of the Miami Heat .
Much like the Heat , the Celtics mortgaged their future to win a championship right now .
There ’s nothing wrong with that , but Boston fans need to be prepared for the repercussions .
By my math , Ray Allen will be 98 at the start of next season , and he showed significant signs of slowing down throughout the playoffs .
Additionally , Kevin Garnett proved to the world that he is content with taking 18 - foot jumpers every time down the floor and that he really does n’t feel compelled to take over a game on most nights , even though he is talented enough to do so .
I congratulate the Boston Celtics on their NBA Championship , but can we please stop talking about this like it ’s a rag - tag , Walt Disney , underdog sports tale , reminiscent of Tiny Giants ?
Cougars
Kristen Schaal brings out a live cougar , and comes up with her own insulting name for men who date younger women .
PRINCETON , NJ -- The Democratic candidates lead Republican John McCain among unmarried voters , while McCain bests both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton among married voters .
These results , based on interviews with more than 18,000 registered voters from Gallup Poll Daily tracking in May , are similar to what Gallup has observed in recent presidential elections .
In the last three presidential elections , the Republican candidate has fared better among married voters of either gender -- winning all of the marriage - by - gender groups except married women in 1996 , which Bob Dole lost narrowly to Bill Clinton .
Meanwhile , the Democratic candidate has won among unmarried voters of both genders in all three elections since 1996 .
( Gallup does not have data for the vote by marital status prior to the 1996 election . )
Usually , of the four marriage - by - gender groups , married men show the greatest support for the Republican candidate and unmarried women most strongly back the Democratic candidate .
The degree to which those relationships hold in 2008 depends in part on which candidate the Democrats eventually nominate .
If , as seems likely , Obama is the Democratic nominee , he would enter the general - election phase of the campaign with commanding leads among both unmarried men and unmarried women .
He leads McCain by 23 percentage points among unmarried women and by 16 points among unmarried men .
In turn , McCain outpolls Obama by a wide 17 - point margin among married men , but holds a smaller 6 - point advantage among married women .
The picture would look somewhat different if Clinton were the Democratic nominee .
She would , like Obama , lead McCain among both unmarried groups , but by a larger margin among unmarried women ( 31 points ) and by a smaller margin among unmarried men ( 6 points ) .
McCain would fare just as well among married men vs. Clinton as he does against Obama , but these data suggest Clinton and McCain would be highly competitive for the votes of married women .
No doubt these relationships reflect Clinton 's appeal to female voters , who have been among her most reliable supporters in the Democratic primaries .
It is unclear whether Obama would be able to increase his standing among female voters if he were the Democratic nominee .
But any disadvantage he has among female voters he has tended to make up for with greater support among blacks and young people .
Implications
These results suggest that the marriage gap evident in the past few elections will likely persist in 2008 as well , with McCain typically leading among married voters and the Democratic candidate leading among unmarried voters .
Of the four marriage - by - gender groups , married women seem to be the most competitive , with Clinton and McCain essentially running even and McCain holding only a modest lead versus Obama among this group .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 18,462 registered voters nationwide , aged 18 and older , conducted May 1 - 21 , 2008 , as part of Gallup 's daily tracking survey .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
For results based on the sample of 6,085 registered voters who are married men , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
For results based on the sample of 2,965 registered voters who are unmarried men , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 4,539 registered voters who are married women , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
For results based on the sample of 4,762 registered voters who are unmarried women , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

The Happening type Movie
Stephen King : Why Hollywood ca n’t do horror
While walking back to my Boston hotel after a surprisingly well - attended Tuesday afternoon showing of Bryan Bertino ’s horror thriller The Strangers , I found myself musing on what ’s scary and what ’s not .
Whatever it is ,
The Strangers had enough of it to do incredibly well at the box office .
But what makes such a little film with only one star ( Liv Tyler ) work in the first place ?
That the question interests me should n’t amaze anyone , since I ’ve worked in the scare - ’em - silly field for years .
And it must be of vital interest to Twentieth Century Fox , which this summer releases two movies in the genre with much higher budgets :
The Happening and The X - Files : I Want to Believe .
The Happening was better than I expected , but it was n’t as scary as The Strangers .
As for The X - Files ( out July 25 ) ?
Children , I have my doubts .
Horror is an intimate experience , something that occurs mostly within oneself , and when it works , the screams of a sold - out house are almost intrusive .
In that sense , a movie such as Blair Witch is more like poetry than like the ” event films ” that pack the plexes in summer .
Those flicks tend to be like sandwiches overstuffed with weirdly tasteless meat and cheese , meals that glut the belly but do nothing for the soul .
Studio execs , who not only live behind the curve but seem to have built mansions there , do n’t seem to understand that most moviegoers recognize all the bluescreens and computer graphics of big - budget films and flick them aside .
Those movies blast our emotions and imaginations , instead of caressing them with a knife edge .
NEXT PAGE : ” Horror is an unknown actress , perhaps the girl next door , cowering in a cabin with a knife in her hands we know she ’ll never be able to use . ”
The scariest sequence I can remember is in Night of the Living Dead .
The cemetery - visiting heroine , Barbara , is chased back to her car by a lurching zombie with white hair and dazed eyes .
She locks herself in only to discover her brother has taken the keys .
The zombie reaches down , finds a rock , and begins to bash it strengthlessly against the car window .
The first time I saw this ( and twice after ) , the scene reduced me to jelly .
Of Fox ’s two summer creepshows , give the edge to The Happening , partly because M. Night Shyamalan really understands fear , partly because this time he ’s completely let himself go ( hence the R rating ) , and partly because after Lady in the Water he had something to prove .
And , happily , Happening plays as a relatively small movie .
The new X - Files movie , on the other hand , looks big … but horror is not spectacle , and never will be .
Horror is an unknown actress , perhaps the girl next door , cowering in a cabin with a knife in her hands we know she ’ll never be able to use .
Horror is the scene in The Strangers where Liv Tyler tries to hide beneath the bed …and discovers she ca n’t fit there .
One more problem : Big movies demand big explanations , which are usually tiresome , and big backstories , which are usually cumbersome .
If a studio is going to spend $ 80 or $ 100 million in hopes of making $ 300 or $ 400 million more , they feel a need to shove WHAT IT ALL MEANS down the audience ’s throat .
Is there a serial killer ?
Then his mommy did n’t love him ( insert flashback ) .
A monster from outer space ?
Its planet exploded , of course ( and the poor misunderstood thing probably needs a juicy Earth woman to make sexy with ) .
But nightmares exist outside of logic , and there ’s little fun to be had in explanations ; they ’re antithetical to the poetry of fear .
That ’s why I can’t imagine that anything in X - Files will match Liv Tyler ’s exchange with one of the masked home invaders in one particularly terrifying scene of The Strangers .
” Why are you doing this to us ? ” she whispers .
To which the woman in the doll - face mask responds , in a dead and affectless voice : ” Because you were home . ”
In the end , that ’s all the explanation a good horror film needs .

I 'm always slightly amused by these inane popularity polls .
Anyone who knows just a bit of the history of this country knows that our forefathers thought very little of Europeans .
Europeans were considered as corrupt and effeminate ( little has changed in 232 years ) .
America was by design the " anti-Europe . "
The fact that Europeans hate us today means we are doing something right .
John Adams must be smiling in heaven .
I also liked another comment back - handing Canada for its " phony niceness " .

Well , I 'll have to thank them publicly for their opinion .
Nice of them to point it out to us , thanks guy !
Here let me hold the door for you .

The question is not " Why do they hate us " ?
but " Why do we keep forgetting they have hated us for centuries ? "
Europe ’s attitudes towards the U.S. are by no means recent .
“ This quote is from a book called " Memoranda During The War " by Walt Whitman .
It is a compilation of his notes from about 3 years worth of visits to War hospitals in and around Washington D.C. from 1862 - 1865 .
Toward the end he inserts some interesting political commentary ( mixed in with a variety of topics ) that sounds as if it could have been written today .
Here 's the piece : Attitude of Foreign Governments toward the U.S. during the War of 1861 -'65 -
" Looking over my scraps , I find I wrote the following during 1864 , or the latter part of ' 63 :
The happening to our America , abroad as well as at home , these years , is indeed most strange .
The Democratic Republic has paid her to - day the terrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the nations of the world that her Union should be broken , her future cut off , and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level of kingdoms and empires ordinarily great !
" There is certainly not one government in Europe but is now watching the war in this country , with the ardent prayer that the united States may be effectually split , crippled , and dismember 'd by it .
There is not one but would help toward that dismemberment , if it dared .
I say such is the ardent wish to - day of England and of France , as governments , and of all the nations of Europe , as governments .
I think indeed it is to - day the real , heart - felt wish of all the nations of the world , with the single exception of Mexico -- Mexico , the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong , and now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph , with genuine prayer .
" Is it not indeed strange ?
America , made up of all , cheerfully from the beginning opening her arms to all , the result and justifier of all , of Britain , Germany , France , and Spain - all here - the accepter , the friend , hope , last resource and general house of all - she who has harm'd none , but been bounteous to so many , to millions , the mother of strangers and exiles , all nations - should now I say be paid this dread compliment of general governmental fear and hatred ?... " .... Are weindignant ?
alarm'd ?
Do we feel wrong'd ?
jeopardized ?
No ; help'd , braced , concentrated , rather .
" We are all too prone to wander from ourselves , to affect Europe , and watch her frowns and smiles .
" We need this hot lesson of general hatred , and henceforth must never forget it .
Never again will we trust the moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single government of the world .

Heh .
It 's always amused me that for being so hated and reviled by the rest of the world our borders are innundated with people trying to get in .
Green - eyed envy , unfortunately , is a powerful force in world politics today .

After WW II , Charles de Gaulle demanded that all American forces leave France .
Eisenhower replied ,
Ok but it 's going to take some time for us to disinter the American soldiers buried in France .

You do realize that in a flame war situations Canadians will just become more polite ? :-)

Europe does n't bother me .
What does bother me is the number of people here , particularly in the news media and the Democratic Party who worry about what Europeans think of us .
A leader can't lead if he 's constantly pandering to his allies , particularly when most of them have been allowing themselves to become weak , while relying on the leader for protection .
This is what 's wrong with our State Department : too much U.N. thinking , by which I mean that we keep trying to pretend that we 're just one among equals while we 're paying most of the freight .
I appreciate those nations who have stood with us in Iraq , and I 'm happy to honor them , but I would n't hesitate to cut off support for nations and NGOs who are doing all they can to undermine us .

I must admit , when I was in Grade 8 - 9 , I went to the Bahamas with my parents and hung out with a very nice well to do girl from Long Island and a whack of other kids , all American .
I held the door for the girls and they stopped dead .
They thought that something was wrong with the door and I was checking it out for some reason .
When I explained that no , I was simply holding it for them and letting them go ahead of me ( they being female ) , they giggled and went through and spent the rest of the day noting how polite I was .
The guys on the other hand just started to ignore then finally openly dislike me .
( Mental note made at 14 : Being excessively Polite gets you the girls )
You see we may live just north of the US , but we actually all strive to be proper British folk as per our majority lineage .
Heck , most of us when asked " what are you ? " say Irish , British , French , English , Scottish etc .
Rarely do we say " Canadian " unless it is preceded by our original family place of residence as in " Belgian Canadian " .
So in truth , we are mostly just a polite rather well to do northern colony of Europe who watch BritComs ..
My apologies .
Did I ramble ?
Here , let me get you a lemon scented napkin .. you seem to be drooling my American friend .

Gorthos , Never , ever make the appalling mistake of assuming that persons from New York are representative of all Americans .
Any young man from the American South ( other than the purest of white trash or somebody from the utterly dysfunctional inner-city welfare culture ) was raised to hold open the door for ladies ; any of us who subsequently traveled to the Northeast had an experience very similar to yours .
I ( a redneck from the southeastern Oklahoma hills ) had been at Princeton for about two weeks when I absent - mindedly held the door open for a lady who was arriving at a store just as I was .
I was treated to an unblushingly profane harangue about what a sexist [ fill in bad words of your choice here ]
I was and how she was perfectly physically capable of opening a door for her own self .
Welcome to New Jersey !
But , as I say , not all of America is Long Island and New Jersey .

When I was in North Carolina for a family camp a little kid came up to me at breakfast .
He could n't talk yet and I assumed the cute , typically spoiled modern day kid wanted to finish off my fries but someone that knew him explained - he was asking if he could take my plate to the dishwashers .
The southrons have got something pretty special down there .

" phony niceness " - Interesting in light of my having just spent a weekend south of the border .
It was determined that while people there seem to be friendlier overall ( although the guy who approached us at the diner to ask about the laptop was n't friendly so much as curious ) , service and retail workers were more polite this side of the border ( and that includes the border guards ) .

As the Real News Network enumerates , Obama ’s recently - announced ‘ Senior Working Group on National Security ‘ is little more than a consortium of top globalists , secret society members , former Clinton & Bush officials and war - engineers at large .
It was revealed yesterday that Obama may retain Defense Secretary Robert Gates if he gains the presidency .
Gates co-wrote the CFR report ‘ Iran : Time for a New Approach ’ with Zbigniew Brzezinski , already an Obama adviser .
Gates also attended the most recent Bilderberg meeting just outside Washington D.C .
The report also names a number of former Clinton officials– including two former Secretaries of State , two Secretaries of Defense and two members of the 9/11 Commission– who are members of the ‘ continuing government ’ bureaucracy at large .
Those who brought you Bosnia would likely bring you Iran .
Former US national security adviser Anthony Lake today called Iran ’s potential to hold a nuclear - arm ‘ the most dangerous crisis ’ and indicated that Obama would go along with harsh Iran sanctions .
Lake also tamed hopes that Obama would bring home troops , citing the need for “ a residual presence ” in Iraq as he told the Financial Times the Vietnam withdrawal was ‘ traumatic . ’
Another member of Obama ’s National Security Group has long advocated re-routing a ‘ unilateral pre-emptive war ’ into a coalition - supported ‘ preventive war . ’
Former Deputy National Security Advisor James Steinberg wrote in a white - paper titled ‘ Preventive War , A Useful Tool , ’ that “ Unilateralism is not the only alternative … regional organizations and a new coalition of democratic states offer ways to legitimize the use of force when the council fails to meet its responsibilities . ”
Steinberg does n’t see Bush ’s unilateral war with Iraq as a mistake ; it ’s just one example of what may come : “ One problem with the Bush doctrine , then , is not that it is overly reliant on preventive force but that it too narrowly conceives of its use . ”
James Steinberg , currently a Dean at the University of Texas and has been involved in the CFR , the Trilateral Commission , Brookings Institute , RAND Corp . and the Bilderberg group .
Two former Clinton Secretaries of State , Warren Christopher and Madeline Albright , who was spotted at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting , would apparently also advise Obama .
Albright has received criticism and since apologized for commenting in 1996 that “ the price ” of half a million dead Iraqi children as a result of Iraq sanctions “ is worth it . ”
Others on Obama ’s Senior Working Group on National Security include :
– William Perry , former Secretary of Defense in Clinton ’s second term .
— coercive diplomacy –
– 9/11 Commission co-chairman Lee Hamilton ; also a member of the equally ineffective Iraq Study Group .
– Senator David Boren , former Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
– Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig
– Representative Tim Roemer , 9/11 Commissioner
– Greg Craig , former director of the State Department Office of Policy Planning
– Dr. Tony Lake , former National Security Advisor
– Eric Holder , former Deputy Attorney General , who served in the Reagan and Clinton administrations .
– Former Senator Sam Nunn , who previously headed the Senate Armed Services Committee and who chaired the The Nuclear Threat Initiative ( NTI ) , a public charity founded in 2001 , alongside Ted Turner .
It deals with the spread of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
– Susan Rice , former Assistant Secretary of State and member of the CFR and Brookings Institute .
While this group at large has promoted the idea of diplomacy with Iran , we have already seen Obama ’s duplicity with foreign policy , as well as his willingness to cooperate with the foreign policy agenda of Israel– making him , likely , little different ( in effect ) from any other candidate .
As the Real News Network puts it , is this change we can believe in ?
Obviously not .

Solomon : WNBA star joins Russian Olympians COMMENTARY
Hammon caught in middle trying to fulfill Olympic dream
Recommended Video :
Some actions are almost unforgivable .
Turning on one 's country is among those .
That is why to some , Becky Hammon might always be thought of as a Benedict ( or perhaps Bernadette ) Arnold .
The San Antonio Silver Stars guard , who scored 20 points in a 75 - 72 loss to the Comets on Tuesday , will play basketball for Russia at the Olympics this summer .
She is not Russian .
She was n't born there .
She did n't grow up there .
She does n't have relatives from there .
Hammon is an all - American girl .
( Literally , she was one at Colorado State in 1999 . )
She grew up in South Dakota , which she describes as " a red state , where it 's God , family , country . "
God and family might continue to hold her loyalty , but her newest passport is from Russia .
And when she takes to the court in Beijing , " RUSSIA " will be printed across her jersey , not USA .
Traitor ?
Uh , we 're talking basketball here , not war .
" This is not life or death , " Hammon said .
" My patriotism is n't defined by basketball .
My patriotism is n't defined in 94 feet of hardwood .
San Antonio Silver Stars guard Becky Hammon is caught in the middle of trying to fulfill Olympic dream and playing in the WNBA .

" I do n't expect everybody to agree with my decision or understand my decision .
But I know where my courage and patriotism lie .
So I 'm comfortable with it .
I 'd still do anything for my country . "
Snubbed by USA Basketball
This all - American girl grew up in schools where prayer was part of the morning routine , where students recited the Pledge of Allegiance daily at the raising of the flag .
" That 's the kind of girl I am , " Hammon said .
Will that be enough to stave off criticism when she actually starts rebounding for Russia ?
Traitor ?
Webster 's defines a traitor as one who betrays one 's country .
Hammon , 31 , did not do that .
USA Basketball turned its back on her .
Hammon , who has long dreamed of playing in the Olympics , said she never has been given serious consideration for a spot on the U.S. national team .
The WNBA MVP runner - up a year ago was left off USA Basketball 's list of players from which the 2008 Olympic team would be chosen .
She later was invited to try out but said indications from USA Basketball were that she would not make the team .
The organization named nine players to the team last week , including the Comets ' Tina Thompson , and named 20 players who remain in contention for three final slots .
Hammon is n't one of them .
" I did n't say no to USA Basketball , " Hammon said .
" The option for me to play for USA Basketball really was n't an option .
" It was : ' You can go take part in the Olympics or stay at home . ' "
Russia 's rules different
Under league rules in Russia , where Hammon signed to play for a team in Moscow last year , a player who has not played for another country in a FIBA - sanctioned event is allowed to become a naturalized citizen .
Once a person is a citizen , the Olympic team is an option .
It is not unusual for American citizens to be on foreign Olympic teams .
Typically , though , the loophole for participation is some familial tie .
" People want to make this too dramatic , because we 're treading on new territory and new ground , " Hammon said .
It could be quite dramatic if Hammon and the Russian team were to face Team USA , the defending Olympic champion , in Beijing .
Russia women 's basketball is not some start - up .
Russia won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games and currently is ranked No. 3 in the world .
Not all of her Russian teammates were happy about her inclusion , but Hammon said after meeting them , she has been accepted .
The teams are in different groups in Beijing , so they could not meet until the quarterfinal round , possibly putting Hammon in the difficult position of trying to lead the Russians to victory over the Red , White and Blue in an elimination game or , worse , in a medal round .
" I 'm not going there expecting to beat the U.S. team , " she said .
" There is no way any team should beat the U.S. team .
They have the best players in the world . "
If it comes down to a game - winning shot , however , Ham -
mon said she would shoot it like she always does : to make it .
" I would never cheat the game , " she said .
" I would never cheat myself and dishonor myself , the game , my country or another country .
I 'm a basketball player , so I 'll play to win . "
Thankful for opportunity
When she gets to the medal stand , as is expected , and The Star - Spangled Banner is playing , as is expected , Hammon will be emotional .
" When I 'm standing on a podium , I 'll be crying , but it 'll be crying for much , much different reasoning than other athletes have cried , " she said .
" I 'll just be thankful for the opportunity . "
What a country .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexicans went out and planted more than 8 million trees across the country on Saturday as part of a government push to shed its reputation for environmental mismanagement and rampant illegal logging .
Mexican Greenpeace activists lay out an S.O.S. banner on deforested land in Ocuyoapan , Lagunas de Zempoala , some 100 km ( 62 miles ) southeast of Mexico City , in a forest that is supposed to be protected but has been stripped of its trees , February 3 , 2004 .
REUTERS / Daniel Aguilar
Packs of volunteers , including oil workers and schoolchildren , trekked into fields and forests up and down Mexico wielding shovels and wheelbarrows full of government - supplied saplings .
They planted a 8.3 million trees , the environment ministry said .
“ We are repairing just a little of the enormous damage that we are doing ” to the environment , President Felipe Calderon said at a tree planting event just north of the capital .
Illegal logging destroys some 64,000 acres ( 26,000 hectares ) of Mexican forest each year , the government says , putting Mexico near the top of a U.N. list of nations losing primary forest fastest .
Environmental activists say the figure is much higher .
“ Everybody needs to help out a little to keep the world green , ” said volunteer Marcela Lopez as she patted down soil around a sapling on the west side of Mexico City .
Environmental group Greenpeace called the government - led effort a publicity stunt , saying a better way to keep forests healthy would be to cut back on logging , which is often controlled by the country ’s powerful organized crime gangs .
“ This program is a fraud .
Only 10 percent of what is planted survives , which means they are throwing the federal budget for reforestation straight into the garbage , ” the group said in a statement .
Calderon regularly speaks out against global warming , and the leftwing Mexico City mayor has launched a number of green initiatives to curb rampant pollution in the city , where government fuel subsidies and a lack of public transport mean the roads are permanently choked with cars .
Mexican Environment Minister Juan Rafael Elvira said the point of the tree planting was to raise environmental consciousness in Mexico , which ecologists also criticize for allowing the oil industry to contaminate many rural states .
“ We do n’t just want a green country .
We want to plant trees to nurture environmental conscience , ” he said .
As the world marks the 200th anniversary of the end of the slave trade , Sarah Left says Ghanaian boys as young as four are still being sold as cheap labour
Kofi Azadavor is sitting stiffly on a bench under a mango tree on his family 's compound , getting up every so often to tend the fire in the open - air kitchen .
He looks smart in his school uniform of brown shorts and a blue - and - white checked shirt , but both school and family life are still fairly new experiences for the 10 - year - old .
Kofi only returned home to his village near Sogakope , a small town in south - eastern Ghana , in June .
When he was just four years old , his mother sent him and his older brother , Mawuta , to live with their uncle in a fishing town 250 km away .
It was the end of Kofi 's childhood and the start of his life as a slave .
Kofi explains that while living with his uncle , he and Mawuta would get up very early in the morning , wash dishes and sweep the house , then head straight out onto Lake Volta to fish .
They would spend the day casting out the heavy fishing net and checking for the catch .
When the net snagged on the branches and stumps at the bottom of the lake , Mawuta was made to dive into water to untangle it .
It was a dangerous and delicate task , and the boys ' risked drowning , contracting the disease bilharzia , and , if they damaged the net while setting it free , a beating from their master .
" My uncle would beat us sometimes , " Kofi says .
" If he said we should go to fish or farm and we said we were too tired , then he would beat us . "
When asked if he likes his uncle , Kofi just silently shakes his head .
This Sunday marks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the Slave Trade Act , an event being commemorated in Ghana at Elmina castle , the country 's most notorious slave trading fort , and in a series of events around the UK .
But across Ghana , and most stubbornly in fishing communities on Lake Volta , Ghanaian children are still being sold for as little as 200,000 cedis ( £ 12 ) into a life of forced labour , malnutrition , physical abuse and no schooling .
Raymond Tchia was seven when his future master woke him from his bed and took him away to a life of fishing and diving into the deep water to untangle nets .
Raymond lived in a one - room mud hut with 20 other boys and says they were fed only one meal a day .
Now 17 , Raymond was released only two months ago .
He has never been to school before now .
" I did not enjoy living with that man .
The man uses force .
When I was young , I was very scared , so if I was to dive into the water and was afraid , he would beat me , " Raymond says .
The International Organisation for Migration has rescued 612 trafficked children from Lake Volta since 2002 , and it estimates that there are hundreds , and possibly thousands , more trafficked children still fishing on the lake .
Through a programme of community education and persuasion , IOM convinces fishermen to release trafficked children , and then reunites them with their families .
To secure their cooperation , IOM offers the fishermen help in improving their fishing business without relying on child labour , or help in setting up alternative businesses .
The children 's parents are offered micro-credit loans to help them keep the children at home , and the returned children are guaranteed school or vocational training .
Both parents and fishermen are also warned that Ghana passed a law against child trafficking in December 2005 .
Just last month , the country 's authorities secured their first conviction under the new law .
Most of the children , mainly boys between the ages of 6 and 17 , come from communities near Ghana 's central and eastern coast , and are sent to live either with relatives who have migrated north onto the lake in search of better fishing , or with unrelated fishermen looking for cheap , obedient labour .
IOM project manager , Joseph Rispoli , says the trafficking of children to Lake Volta is a distortion of the much older practice of placement , where West African parents would send children to live with wealthier relatives to secure their education or training in a trade .
But the children doing the fishing almost never go to school , are generally fed only one meal a day , and are beaten on a regular basis , Mr Rispoli says .
The work itself is dangerous as well as backbreaking , he adds .
" Sometimes it 's just a bunch of eight - year - olds out on the lake alone in a rickety canoe with no supervision , " he says .
Sharon Abbey , an assistant director at Ghana 's department of social welfare , runs a shelter for trafficked children at Madina , just outside the capital , Accra .
After IOM and its partner NGOs rescue the children from the lake , they are sent to Ms Abbey 's shelter for two to three months for counselling and an introduction to the classroom while their families are traced .
She introduces us to Joel Adinortey .
He does not know how old he is , but she estimates he is about six .
Joel cannot remember the name of the town he was in , and can not yet speak about the experience .
" You wonder how a mother can take a child this young to be subjected to this .
You wonder what sort of mother that is .
When he came here , he was crying all the time , " she says .
The children also have a hard time coming to terms with their parents ' decision .
Raymond Tchia says he thinks his father is dead , and he has no memory of his mother , not even a picture of her in his head .
He is not angry with her for sending him away , he says , he feels nothing about her .
Kofi's mother , Favour Azadavor , insists she never received money from her brother for sending Kofi and Mawuta to him , only food parcels .
In the six years they were away , she did not see them once .
Ms Azadavor , who scrapes a living as a subsistence farmer , has 10 surviving children and says she simply could not cope financially .
" I sent the two because the father could not take care of them and , looking at the numbers , I could not afford to take care of them , " she says .
The return of Kofi and Mawuta has clearly been less than a joyful occasion for Ms Azadavor .
She says she was happy to have them back and regrets sending them away , but providing for them is still a worry now , despite IOM providing a school uniform , supplies and any fees .
" There has been no reduction in the suffering , " she explains .
In Kofi's hometown of Sogakope , Julius Kwadzo Ameku runs a local NGO , Fysso , that has reunited 50 children with the parents who sold them or sent them away .
He says that some of the parents were angry with Fysso for returning their children without additional money ( Fysso is just beginning to offer micro-credit and training to the parents of trafficked children ) .
" The parents say that if you brought them back , you must take care of them .
They say , it is your duty because we did not ask you to bring them here . "
Mr Ameku feels the solution lies in tackling three problems .
The parents need education about child welfare , how to keep the children safe and the importance of sending them to school .
He points towards a group of children selling loaves of bread on the main road , in full view of police at a checkpoint .
" It 's not just about poverty .
It 's about mindset and attitude , " he says .
" The parents should be made to feel the full rigours of the law if the children are not in school . "
Second , he says , much more work needs to be done to promote family planning .
" People give birth to so many children and with that they have the problem of taking care of them .
So to give them out is a relief .
Those children work and the masters send the parents some money , and they use the money to take care of the remaining children . "
Finally , there needs to be greater employment opportunities for the parents , so that they can afford to take care of their children at home .
Ms Abbey just hopes that the children passing through her shelter will be able to make something of their lives , and that they will find the self - confidence they need .
" They should not think that life is like that and that adults can always push you around .
We are not all like that .
They should know that they have rights , " she says .
The ruling will apply to countries which recognise same - sex marriage A gay man in Germany may be entitled to his dead partner 's pension following a ruling by the highest court in the EU .
Tadao Maruko's partner died in 2005 but the pension fund refused him a widower 's pension and the case was sent to the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) .
The court ruled that refusing a pension was direct discrimination if the partnership was comparable to marriage .
Mr Maruko 's lawyers predict the case will have repercussions in EU countries where same - sex partnerships are legal .
" I 'm happy .
It 's a very important step , " lawyer Helmut Graupner told the BBC News website .
" This will help all those countries which have registered partnerships .
It 's the first time the ECJ has ruled in favour of same - sex couples . "
GAY MARRIAGES IN THE EU
Full marriage recognised : Spain , Netherlands , Belgium Legal partnerships similar to marriage : Germany , Sweden , Denmark , UK , Czech Republic , Slovenia , Hungary , Finland , Portugal Civil contracts : France , Luxembourg No provision : Austria , Baltic states , Cyprus , Greece , Malta , Romania , Bulgaria , Italy , Ireland , Poland , Slovakia
The court based its ruling on an EU directive which states that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
Although German law considers only heterosexual unions as marriage , the ruling makes it clear that any country in the EU that gives same - sex couples rights equivalent to marriage should treat the two as comparable .
The European Commission welcomed the decision , but emphasised that national governments rather than the EU were in charge of legislation on family law .
" It all depends on the law of the country .
The right to a survivor 's pension exists if the two regimes [ marriage and gay partnership ] are analogous , " said commission spokesman Johannes Laitenberger .
European repercussions
Mr Graupner said the ruling would have significant repercussions for the UK and Scandinavia where same - sex partners had " mirror institutions " to marriage , rather than French - style civil contracts .
But he also suggested that indirectly it would help gay couples in countries where there was no equivalent to marriage .
" The next case may be one of indirect discrimination , from a country that excludes same - sex partners from the rights and obligations of marriage .
" The way out for such a country would mean they would have to provide the same benefits as other countries , " he said .

Benford 's law is one of those things your high school math teacher would break out on a slow , rainy day when the students ' attention span was even lower than usual .
He 'd start out by asking the class to look at the leading digits in a list of numbers and then predict how many times each leading digit would appear first in the list .
The students would make some guesses and eventually come to the consensus that the probability would be pretty close — about 11 % each .
Then , the teacher would just sit back , smile , and gently shake his head at his simple - minded pupils .
He would then go on to explain Benford 's law , which would blow everyone 's mind — at least through lunchtime .
( Click the image above … or here 's an embeddable YouTube version )
Per Wikipedia :
Benford 's law , also called the first - digit law , states that in lists of numbers from many real - life sources of data , the leading digit is distributed in a specific , non-uniform way .
Specifically , in this way :
Leading Digit Probability 1 30.1 % 2 17.6 % 3 12.5 % 4 9.7 % 5 7.9 % 6 6.7 % 7 5.8 % 8 5.1 % 9 4.6 %
Again , from Wikipedia :
This counter - intuitive result applies to a wide variety of figures , including electricity bills , street addresses , stock prices , population numbers , death rates , lengths of rivers , physical and mathematical constants , and processes described by power laws ( which are very common in nature ) .
Boiling it down , this means that for almost any naturally - occurring data set , the number 1 will appear first about 30 % of the time .
And , by naturally occuring , this can mean check amounts or stock prices or website statistics .
Non-naturally occurring data would be pre-assigned numbers like postal codes or UPC numbers .
Besides being fun to play with , Benford 's is used in the accounting profession to detect fraud .
Because data like tax returns and check registers follow Benford 's , auditors can use it as a high - level check of a data set .
If there are anomalies , it may be worth investigating closer as potential fraud .
If you 're interested in further information about fraud detection using Benford 's , definitely give these two articles by Malcolm W. Browne and Mark J. Nigrini a read .

I make the effort to share this information because it gives me , at last , a plausible answer to a long - unanswered question :
Why , no matter how much intelligent goodwill exists in the world , is there so much war , suffering and injustice ?
It does n't seem to matter what creative plan , ideology , religion , or philosophy great minds come up with , nothing seems to improve our lot .
Since the dawn of civilization , this pattern repeats itself over and over again .
The answer is that civilization , as we know it , is largely the creation of psychopaths .
All civilizations , our own included , have been built on slavery and mass murder .
Psychopaths have played a disproportionate role in the development of civilization , because they are hard - wired to lie , kill , cheat , steal , torture , manipulate , and generally inflict great suffering on other humans without feeling any remorse , in order to establish their own sense of security through domination .
The inventor of civilization , " the first tribal chieftain who successfully brainwashed an army of controlled mass murderers , " was almost certainly a genetic psychopath .
Since that momentous discovery , psychopaths have enjoyed a significant advantage over non-psychopaths in the struggle for power in civilizational hierarchies -- especially military hierarchies .
Behind the apparent insanity of contemporary history , is the actual insanity of psychopaths fighting to preserve their disproportionate power .
And as their power grows ever - more - threatened , the psychopaths grow ever - more - desperate .
We are witnessing the apotheosis of the overworld -- the overlapping criminal syndicates that lurk above ordinary society and law just as the underworld lurks below it .
During the past fifty years , psychopaths have gained almost absolute control of all the branches of government .
You can notice this if you observe carefully that no matter what illegal thing a modern politician does , no one will really take him to task .
All of the so called scandals that have come up , any one of which would have taken down an authentic administration , are just farces played out for the public , to distract them , to make them think that the democracy is still working .
One of the main factors to consider in terms of how a society can be taken over by a group of pathological deviants is that the psychopaths ' only limitation is the participation of susceptible individuals within that given society .
Lobaczewski gives an average figure for the most active deviants of approximately 6 % of a given population .
( 1 % essential psychopaths and up to 5 % other psychopathies and characteropathies . )
The essential psychopath is at the center of the web .
The others form the first tier of the psychopath 's control system .
The next tier of such a system is composed of individuals who were born normal , but are either already warped by long - term exposure to psychopathic material via familial or social influences , or who , through psychic weakness have chosen to meet the demands of psychopathy for their own selfish ends .
Numerically , according to Lobaczewski , this group is about 12 % of a given population under normal conditions .
So approximately 18 % of any given population is active in the creation and imposition of a Pathocracy .
The 6 % group constitutes the Pathocratic nobility and the 12 % group forms the new bourgeoisie , whose economic situation is the most advantageous .
When you understand the true nature of psychopathic influence , that it is conscienceless , emotionless , selfish , cold and calculating , and devoid of any moral or ethical standards , you are horrified , but at the same time everything suddenly begins to makes sense .
Our society is ever more soulless because the people who lead it and who set the example are soulless - they literally have no conscience .
In his book Political Oenology , Andrej Lobaczewski explains that clinical psychopaths enjoy advantages even in non-violent competitions to climb the ranks of social hierarchies .
Because they can lie without remorse ( and without the telltale physiological stress that is measured by lie detector tests ) , psychopaths can always say whatever is necessary to get what they want .
In court , for example , psychopaths can tell extreme bald - faced lies in a plausible manner , while their sane opponents are handicapped by an emotional predisposition to remain within hailing distance of the truth .
Too often , the judge or jury imagines that the truth must be somewhere in the middle , and then issues decisions that benefit the psychopath .
As with judges and juries , so too with those charged with decisions concerning who to promote and who not to promote in corporate , military and governmental hierarchies .
The result is that all hierarchies inevitably become top - heavy with psychopaths .
Since psychopaths have no limitations on what they can or will do to get to the top , the ones in charge are generally pathological .
It is not power that corrupts , it is that corrupt individuals seek power .
How can we distinguish between psychopaths and healthy people ?
What is the portrait of a true psychopath ?
Such a dangerous question has almost never been successfully asked .
The reason is because we mistakenly confuse healthy for normal .
Human psychological diversity is the health of our race .
There is no normal because healthy humans continuously evolve beyond all normalizing standards .
The terrorism of searching through hierarchies for anyone deviating from normal is no different from witch hunts or Inquisitions .
You must remember that hierarchies thrive on such low dramas , torturing victims until they confess to evil beliefs .
Not so long ago the church and state ongoingly acquired significant income and property through witch hunts and Inquisitions .
This continued for over two hundred and fifty years .
Ten generations of Europeans understood pogrom as normal life .
Let us not return to that nightmare .
Testing for normal is guaranteed to backfire in our face .
There is no normal .
But there is conscience .
We have very little empirical evidence to support the idea that true psychopathy is the result of an abused childhood , and much empirical evidence to support that it is genetic .
The neurobiological model offers us the greatest hope of being able to identify even the most devious psychopath .
Other recent studies lead to similar results and conclusions : that psychopaths have great difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal affective ( emotional ) material , that they tend to confuse the emotional significance of events , and most importantly , that these deficits show up in brain scans !
A missing internal connection between the feeling heart and the thinking brain is detectable .
Psychopaths are incapable of authentic deep emotions .
In fact , when Robert Hare , a Canadian psychologist who spent his career studying psychopathy , did brain scans on psychopaths while showing them two sets of words , one set of neutral words with no emotional associations and a second set with emotionally charged words , while different areas of the brain lit up in the non-psychopathic control group , in the psychopaths , both sets were processed in the same area of the brain , the area that deals with language .
They did not have an emotional reaction until they intellectually concluded that it would be better if they had one , and then they whipped up an emotional response just for show .
The simplest , clearest and truest portrait of the psychopath is given in the titles of three seminal works on the subject : " Without Conscience " by Robert Hare , " The Mask of Sanity " by Hervey Cleckley , and " Snakes in Suits " by Robert Hare and Paul Babiak .
A psychopath is exactly that : conscienceless .
The most important thing to remember is that this lack of conscience is hidden from view behind a mask of normality that is often so convincing that even experts are deceived .
As a result , psychopaths become the Snakes in Suits that control our world .
Psychopaths lack a sense of remorse or empathy with others .
They can be extremely charming and are experts at using talk to charm and hypnotize their prey .
They are also irresponsible .
Nothing is ever their fault ; someone else or the world at large is always to blame for all of their problems or their mistakes .
Martha Stout , in her book , " The Sociopath Next Door , " identifies what she calls the pity ploy .
Psychopaths use pity to manipulate .
They convince you to give them one more chance , and to not tell anyone about what they have done .
So another trait -- and a very important one -- is their ability to control the flow of information .
They also seem to have little real conception of past or future , living entirely for their immediate needs and desires .
Because of the barren quality of their inner life , they are often seeking new thrills , anything from feeling the power of manipulating others to engaging in illegal activities simply for the rush of adrenaline .
Another trait of the psychopath is what Lobaczewski calls their special psychological knowledge of normal people .
They have studied us .
They know us better than we know ourselves .
They are experts in knowing how to push our buttons , to use our emotions against us .
But beyond that , they even seem to have some sort of hypnotic power over us .
When we begin to get caught up in the web of the psychopath , our ability to think deteriorates , gets muddied .
They seem to cast some sort of spell over us .
It is only later when we are no longer in their presence , out of their spell , that the clarity of thought returns and we find ourselves wondering how it was that we were unable to respond or counter what they were doing .
Psychopaths learn to recognize each other in a crowd as early as childhood , and they develop an awareness of the existence of other individuals similar to themselves .
They also become conscious of being of a different world from the majority of other people surrounding them .
They view us from a certain distance .
Think about the ramifications of this statement : Psychopaths are , to some extent , self - aware as a group even in childhood !
Recognizing their fundamental difference from the rest of humanity , their allegiance would be to others of their kind , that is , to other psychopaths .
Their own twisted sense of honor compels them to cheat and revile non-psychopaths and their values .
In contradiction to the ideals of normal people , psychopaths feel breaking promises and agreements is normal behavior .
Not only do they covet possessions and power and feel they have the right to them just because they exist and can take them , but they gain special pleasure in usurping and taking from others ; what they can plagiarize , swindle , and extort are fruits far sweeter than those they can earn through honest labor .
They also learn very early how their personalities can have traumatizing effects on the personalities of non-psychopaths , and how to take advantage of this root of terror for purposes of achieving their goals .
So now , imagine how human beings who are totally in the dark about the presence of psychopaths can be easily deceived and manipulated by these individuals , gaining power in different countries , pretending to be loyal to the local populations while at the same time playing up obvious and easily discernable physical differences between groups ( such as race , skin color , religion , etc ) .
Psychologically normal humans would be set against one another on the basis of unimportant differences ( think of Rwanda 1994 , think of Israelis and Palestinians ) while the deviants in power , with a fundamental difference from the rest of us , a lack of conscience , an inability to feel for another human being , reaped the benefits and pulled the strings .
We are seeing the final desperate power - grab or endgame ( Alex Jones ) of brutal , cunning gangs of CIA drug- runners and President - killers ; money - laundering international bankers and their hit - men -- economic and otherwise -- corrupt military contractors and gung - ho generals ; corporate predators and their political enablers ; brainwashers and mind - rapists euphemistically known as psy-ops and PR specialists .
In short , the whole crew of certifiable psychopaths running our so - called civilization .
And they are running scared .
Why does the Pathocracy fear it is losing control ?
Because it is threatened by the spread of knowledge .
The greatest fear of any psychopath is of being found out .
Psychopaths go through life knowing that they are completely different from other people .
Deep down they know something is missing in them .
They quickly learn to hide their lack of empathy , while carefully studying others ' emotions so as to mimic normalcy while cold - bloodedly manipulating the normals .
Today , thanks to new information technologies , we are on the brink of unmasking the psychopaths and building a civilization of , by and for the healthy human being -- a civilization without war , a civilization based on truth , a civilization in which the saintly few rather than the diabolical few would gravitate to positions of power .
We already have the knowledge necessary to diagnose psychopathic personalities and keep them out of power .
We have the knowledge necessary to dismantle the institutions in which psychopaths especially flourish -- militaries , intelligence agencies , large corporations , and secret societies .
We simply need to disseminate this knowledge , and the will to use it , as widely and as quickly as possible .
Until the knowledge and awareness of pathological human beings is given the attention it deserves and becomes part of the general knowledge of all human beings , there is no way that things can be changed in any way that is effective and long - lasting .
If half the people agitating for truth or stopping the war or saving the earth would focus their efforts , time and money on exposing psychopathy , we might get somewhere .
One might ask if the weak point of our society has been our tolerance of psychopathic behavior ?
Our disbelief that someone could seem like an intelligent leader and still be acting deceptively on their own behalf without conscience ?
Or is it merely ignorance ?
If the general voting public is not aware that there exists a category of people we sometimes perceive as almost human , who look like us , who work with us , who are found in every race , every culture , speaking every language , but who are lacking conscience , how can the general public take care to block them from taking over the hierarchies ?
General ignorance of psychopathology may prove to be the downfall of civilization .
We stand by like grazing sheep as political / corporate elites throw armies of our innocent sons and daughters against fabricated enemies as a way of generating trillions in profits , vying against each other for pathological hegemony .
Nearly everyone who has been part of an organization working for social change has probably seen the same dynamic play out :
The good and sincere work of many can be destroyed by the actions of one person .
That does n't bode well for bringing some sort of justice to the planet !
In fact , if psychopaths dominate political hierarchies , is it any wonder that peaceful demonstrations have zero impact on the outcome of political decisions ?
Perhaps it is time to choose something other than massive , distant hierarchies as a way of governing ourselves ?
So many efforts to provide essays , research reports , expose 's and books to leaders so they might take the new information to heart and change their behavior have come to naught .
For example , in the final paragraph of his revised edition of the book , " The Party 's Over , " Richard Heinberg writes : I still believe that if the people of the world can be helped to understand the situation we are in , the options available , and the consequences of the path we are currently on , then it is at least possible that they can be persuaded to undertake the considerable effort and sacrifice that will be entailed in a peaceful transition to a sustainable , locally based , decentralized , low - energy , resource - conserving social regime .
But inspired leadership will be required .
And that is the just - murdered fantasy .
There are no inspired leaders anymore .
And in hierarchical structures there can't be .
Assuming that you can elect men or women to office who will see reason and the light of day , and who will change and learn and grow , make compassionate decisions and take conscientious actions is a foolish , childish dream .
Continuing to dream it simply plays into psychopathic agendas .
Only when the 75 % of humanity with a healthy conscience come to understand that we have a natural predator , a group of people who live amongst us , viewing us as powerless victims to be freely fed upon for achieving their inhuman ends , only then will we take the fierce and immediate actions needed to defend what is preciously human .
Psychological deviants have to be removed from any position of power over people of conscience , period .
People must be made aware that such individuals exist and must learn how to spot them and their manipulations .
The hard part is that one must also struggle against those tendencies to mercy and kindness in oneself in order not to become prey .
The real problem is that the knowledge of psychopathy and how psychopaths rule the world has been effectively hidden .
People do not have the adequate , nuanced knowledge they need to really make a change from the bottom up .
Again and again , throughout history it has been meet the new boss , same as the old boss .
If there is any work that is deserving of full time efforts and devotion for the sake of helping humanity in this present dark time , it is the study of psychopathy and the propagation of this information as far and wide and fast as possible .
There are only two things that can bring a psychopath under submission : 1 . A bigger psychopath .
2 . The non-violent , absolute refusal to submit to psychopathic controls , no matter the consequences ( non-violent noncompliance ) .
Let us choose path 2 !
If individuals simply sat down and refused to lift a hand to further one single aim of the psychopathic agenda , if people refused to pay taxes , if soldiers refused to fight , if government workers and corporate drones and prison guards refused to go to work , if doctors refused to treat psychopathic elites and their families , the whole system would grind to a screeching halt .
True change happens in the moment that a person becomes aware of psychopathy in all its chilling details .
From this new awareness , the world looks different , and entirely new actions can be taken .
Distinguishing between human and psychopathic qualities begins the foundation of responsibility upon which we have a real chance to create sustainable culture .

Dennis Overbye is a science correspondent for The Times .
His most recent book is ” Einstein in Love : A Scientific Romance . ”
In a recent report to Congress ( pdf ) , NASA offered two contradictory statements : a $ 1.5 billion physics experiment intended for the International Space Station was on track for a 2009 launch , but it had no intention of actually launching the device into space .
Once upon a time the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer , as it is known , was to be the scientific centerpiece of the space station .
By sifting cosmic rays from outer space , the 15,000 pound detector would look for evidence of antimatter or the mysterious dark matter that accounts for 25 percent of creation .
The brainchild of MIT physicist and Nobel laureate Sam Ting , the detector was built by a collaboration of scientists from 16 countries , including China and Taiwan , mostly with their own money .
NASA agreed in 1995 to give it a ride to the space station and then reneged 10 years later after the loss of the space shuttle Columbia , saying the remaining flights between now and 2010 when the shuttles are to be retired were all spoken for .
This dismayed many physicists who thought the space agency should keep its word and was being a bad international partner .
“ It ’s a pity that NASA is living up to its commitment to finish the Space Station , but not to its commitment to use it for something scientifically interesting , ” said Steven Weinberg , himself a Nobel physicist at the University of Texas , in Austin .
But Dr. Ting has supporters in Congress , including Sen. Bill Nelson , the chairman of the Space , Aeronautics , and Related Sciences Subcommittee who rode the shuttle into space in 1986 .
In December , he vowed to file legislation adding a shuttle flight for the detector if Michael Griffin , NASA ’s administrator did not change his mind .
In a speech on February 8 , the day after Atlantis lifted off on the most recent mission to the space station , Sen. Nelson said of Dr. Ting ’s experiment , “ What it does is it identifies the origin of cosmic rays , and that means it can help us understand the origin of the universe .
This is not just an American experiment ; this is an international experiment of countries around the world .
This is a part of us wanting to understand our beginnings .
This is a part of our nature , as a people , to want to explore the heavens and understand the universe . ”
As part of the final 2008 budget that was finally approved last fall , NASA was required to report to the Appropriations Committee on the status and prospects of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer .
Dr. Griffin has not changed his mind .
The report lists tests and safety reviews expected to be completed in the next two years .
“ The AMS and Shuttle programs are moving forward to develop , by early 2009 , all required analytical and operations data to support an AMS launch on the Space Shuttle , ” that portion of the report smoothly concludes .
There are no “ showstoppers , ” in NASA terminology , except NASA itself .
In order to fly Dr. Ting ’s device before September 2010 , the shuttle end date , the agency said , either “ critical space station hardware ” would have to be bumped from a flight , or an additional flight would have to be booked at a cost of some $ 300 - 400 million and additional risk .
Extending the shuttle operations into 2011 , they said , would cost $ 3 billion or more and have a “ significant negative impact ” on NASA ’s new exploration program .
Moreover , it takes 18 months to get ready for a flight , so the decision to fly the experiment has to be made ( and presumably the funds provided ) by a year from now .
What about launching the experiment on another unmanned rocket ?
That could cost as much as $ 1 billion and could n’t happen before 2013 or 2014 , which raises a final problem : Dr. Ting ’s spectrometer is supposed to work for three years , but the money for space station operations , according to the report , is currently scheduled to run out in 2016 .
Dr. Ting declined to comment on the NASA report .
But he said by e-mail that the detector , being assembled at CERN , the European physics laboratory outside Geneva , was now complete .
“ I do hope it will be possible for you to visit CERN in the near future and see the Detector , ” he wrote .
The Iranian president is due in India next week India has rebuffed a call by the United States for it to ask Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment programme .
The foreign ministry said neither India nor Iran needed external guidance on how to conduct bilateral relations .
It said relations between the two spanned centuries , and they were capable of handling them with due care .
Earlier , a senior US official said Washington would welcome India telling Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to curtail Tehran 's nuclear programme .
President Ahmadinejad is due to visit Delhi next week .
Engagement " India and Iran are ancient civilisations whose relations span centuries .
Both nations are perfectly capable of managing all aspects of their relationship with the appropriate degree of care and attention , " Navtej Sarna , a foreign ministry spokesman , was quoted by the Indian Express newspaper as saying .
" Neither country needs any guidance on the future conduct of bilateral relations as both countries believe that engagement and dialogue alone lead to peace , " he added .
The Iran issue casts a shadow over US - India relations Earlier , US state department spokesman Tom Casey said : " We would hope that the Indian government ... would call on him [ President Ahmadinejad ] to meet the requirements that the Security Council and the international community has placed on him in terms of suspending their uranium enrichment activities and complying with the other requirements regarding their nuclear programme . "
In the past , Tehran has singled India out for criticism over Delhi 's support for Iran to be referred to the UN Security Council over its nuclear plans .
In September 2005 , Tehran threatened to reconsider its economic co-operation with Delhi after India voted at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to refer Iran to the UN Security Council .
India and Iran have been in negotiations over a $ 7bn gas pipeline deal that would help India 's energy supply problems .
The Indian government came under attack both from the opposition as well as communist allies for its decision to side with the West and vote against Iran , a traditional ally .
Critics said Delhi's vote was linked to the India - US nuclear accord .
Washington suspects Iran of developing its nuclear programme for military purposes .
Tehran denies seeking nuclear arms , saying it wants nuclear technology purely for peaceful production of energy .

Google Incorporated is arguably the most successful Internet company today .
But Google did n't get to where it is without takings risks -- some of which have failed spectacularly .
For example , remember the Google Accelerator , which was supposed to speed up Web surfing ?
( A dubious claim , but least it was free . )
But you had to pay to get a Google Answer , and eventually people stopped asking .
Google Video did so well that the company finally gave up and shelled out big bucks to buy YouTube .
If you can't beat 'em , buy 'em .
Some Google flops lasted no more than a day and then vanished without a trace .
Other Google efforts have been left to languish like a neglected orphan inside Google 's labyrinth of Web services .
Still other dogs were released as betas nearly five years ago and are still trapped in Google Labs with apparently little hope of escaping the test tube .
Our list of Google 's lead balloons is by no means exhaustive ; if you have other candidates , by all means , point them out in our comments section below .
Lhamotso never learned to read and write , and she has few marketable skills other than the ability to milk a yak .
Yet she can earn up to $ 1,000 a week these days , an unimaginable fortune for a Tibetan nomad .
With the money , she has bought herself a shiny new Honda motorcycle .
She and her husband gave up their tent for a house they built themselves with solar panels , a satellite dish and television .
The worm , Lhamotso explains , “ has changed our lives . ”
What Tibetans call the worm is actually not a worm but a fungus -- Cordyceps sinensis , to be precise -- that feeds on caterpillar larvae .
Or , to give the fungus its more poetic name , “ winter worm , summer grass , ” because its appearance changes from one to the other with the seasons .
The worm is a prized ingredient in traditional medicines here , with prices in the last few years skyrocketing to the point where prime specimens are worth their weight in gold , literally , about $ 900 an ounce .
Even the most ordinary pickings command prices rivaling that of French truffles , another famous fungus .
Because the caterpillar fungus is indigenous only to the 1,000 - mile - long Tibetan plateau running from western China to Nepal , the money has hastened the nomads ’ lurching transition into modernity .
“ It is a bit like a gold rush in the Wild West .
It ’s brought enormous wealth to these communities , ” says Andrew Fischer , an economist specializing in Tibet at the London School of Economics .
For centuries , Tibetan nomads added caterpillar fungus to their soups or tea , believing it boosted stamina , endurance , lung capacity , kidney function and , of course , sexual performance .
Its use for medicinal purposes was documented as far back as the 14th century .
But until recently , the fungus was cheap and abundant enough that Tibetans also would feed it to yaks and horses when their energy was flagging .
The fungus ’ popularity took off after the 1993 World Championships in Athletics , when Chinese female athletes stunned the world by breaking records in nine track and field events and their coach gave partial credit to an elixir containing the fungus ( along with turtle blood and deer penis ) .
More recently , Houston Rockets basketball phenomenon Yao Ming revealed that he too is a fan of the fungus .
Then came the 2003 epidemic of SARS , sudden acute respiratory syndrome , which set Asian consumers off on a frenzy of buying anything that might boost immunity .
China last year exported $ 43 million worth of caterpillar fungus .
In China and abroad , it is touted as a treatment for everything from impotence to aging .
“ Yes !
Grandma & Grandpa , you may not be a world - class athlete shattering world records , but would n’t it be great to feel like one ? ” claims one promoter out of Canada .
The center of the caterpillar fungus trade is in Qinghai province , particularly the Tibetan enclave of Golog .
Here , the bu -- Tibetan for worm -- is by far the largest source of cash and dictates the pace of daily life .
During the peak fungus hunting season , schools close down to allow children to help .
People with jobs shirk work to prospect for riches .
The winding roads into the mountains are roped off with checkpoints run by police whose job is to keep out outsiders who might clash with locals .
Every year , several people are killed in turf battles , often ethnically tinged , pitting Tibetans against Hui Muslims , another minority , or against Han Chinese .
The season runs for about 40 days , beginning in early spring when the snowmelt turns the mountains brown and spongy as though covered with a dirty shag carpet .
Timing is crucial .
If you dig too early , you get a live , wriggling caterpillar .
It ’s best to dig just after the fungus has killed the larvae .
For practitioners of traditional medicine , it is this strange interplay between the animal and the plant kingdoms -- the yin and the yang , as it were -- that makes the caterpillar fungus such a prize .
The best caterpillar fungus is found at higher elevations , places such as Heitushan , the 14,000 - foot Black Earth Mountain in Golog , where Lhamotso lives .
The climb is steep , that even a nomad used to the elevation will be huffing and puffing , so Lhamotso counts herself lucky to have the motorcycle .
She and her daughters , 10 and 16 , pile on and zigzag uphill in a cloud of dust until the terrain gets too rough and they must walk .
Lhamotso , who like many Tibetans goes by one name , wears traditional clothes -- black wedge - heeled lace - up shoes and an ankle - length black dress , her head swathed in pink and turquoise scarves to keep out the sun and dust .
Her daughters are more modern ; the younger , Hiriti , in jeans and white sneakers , scrambles energetically up the mountain , helping her mother .
Children are useful on the hunt because their sharp eyes allow them to pick the fungus out of the clumps of grass and sodden earth -- a little like finding a needle in a haystack .
Although the dead caterpillar is rather unprepossessing in appearance , it ’s not nearly as disgusting as it sounds : sort of like a little yellow root with a stalk growing out of the top .
“ It is very boring work , ” complains Hiriti , who just this year began fungus - hunting at 10 , the same age her mother started .
Reaching into the pocket of her faux leather jacket , the girl pulls out a tissue and unwraps what looks like a 3 - inch - long twig , the only piece she found all day .
She will sell it for about $ 3 , but it could command a retail price of $ 10 in Singapore or Tokyo .
“ I think people must be insane to pay so much , ” Lhamotso says .
“ It ’s only in the last two years it has gotten so expensive .
It ’s crazy , but it is good for us .
How else would I make so much money ?
I ca n’t read or write . ”
Lhamotso and the girls expect to make at least $ 6,000 this season -- about triple what most Chinese families earn in a year .
Last year ’s take was enough that Lhamotso and her husband built their house , the interior wallpapered with photographs from magazines of an assortment of celebrities , movie stars , Mao Tse-tung , the Dalai Lama .
Over a stove burning dung in the center of the main room , Lhamotso boils a kettle of water to make yak - butter tea , a salty brew popular here .
The television is the only appliance .
The worm has helped pay for the house , but more important , it has provided the motivation and the money for Hiriti to get an education .
The family pays $ 30 a month in tuition at a Buddhist monastery where Hiriti studies Tibetan , Chinese , a little English and math .
( Lhamotso says they can afford tuition for only one child and that her older daughter is needed to help with traditional chores such as milking yaks . )
The caterpillar fungus has made it painfully apparent to Lhamotso and her husband how crippled they are by a lack of education .
Neither can speak Chinese or do basic math .
So they must rely on intermediaries , many of them Muslim traders , to do the counting , weighing , calculating and marketing of their pickings .
“ We need to have one person in the family who is educated , ” she says .
Lhamotso is well aware that fungus may not be a reliable source of income for much longer .
The fungus is growing scarcer each year from over - harvesting and changes in the fragile ecosystem of the Tibetan plateau .
“ When I was young , somebody could just walk out of the tent and dig 800 to 900 pieces in a day .
Now we have to hike three hours up the mountain and the best we do is maybe 50 pieces , ” says Tsering , 38 , in a straw hat who was picking one afternoon with Lhamotso and her friends .
The bottom could drop out of the market if artificially cultivated caterpillar fungus catches on in Asia , as it has in the U.S. , where much of the supply is cultivated .
Many people believe that the prices for caterpillar fungus are ridiculously high and that the bubble will burst soon .
“ It is expensive because it is rare and it is rare because it is over - exploited , ” says Lin Zhibin , a pharmacology expert at Peking University Health Science Center .
Another concern is that the relentless digging on the mountains is contributing to soil erosion and desertification that keeps a perpetual cloud of dust swirling around Golog .
Although the caterpillar fungus has given the nomads a financial boost , Tibetan intellectuals remain ambivalent about its benefits to society as a whole .
“ It is not good for the environment or for building harmonious society , ” says Tseten Dargye , a Tibetan educator and a physician in Dawu , one of Golog ’s main towns .
“ People have become territorial .
There are a lot of fights between family and friends and the possibility of corruption . ”
The real problem is that Tibetans themselves have become used to the easy money and the creature comforts it buys -- the motorized transit , the houses , the televisions .
“ People ca n’t go backwards .
For years , it ’s been like digging up gold , but more valuable , ” says Daodu , 31 , a teacher .
“ People today ca n’t survive without it . ”

Far from a new objection , to hear the demur of ' Anarcho - Capitalism 's ' oxymoron status from those ' social anarchists ' lulled by the hot charisma of Noam Chomsky will not exactly ring a fresh tune to the ears of Market Anarchists .
Noting that some of the socialist banter on the other side can be unnecessarily hostile , however , could there perhaps be truth in the contradiction of ' Anarcho - capitalism ' ?
Could there perhaps be a point in calling attention to the vulgar nature of associating the two antonymic terms of Anarchism and capitalism ?
Could Market Anarchism really be a form of anti-capitalism ?
In most estimates , it would seem that the theoretical implications , derivatives , and variables of a free - market ' that is , one absent all state facilities and their corporate beneficiaries ' do not at all resemble the same nuances found in the historically correct definition of capitalism .
This fact , this single truth , this blindingly revisionist statement cannot be denied after intelligently pondering the inquiries as to the origin of capitalism as a word , the nature of its foundation , and the meaning expressed by its creators with consideration for further theoretical implications .
Yes , unapologetically contrary to partisan sentiments and startlingly true , the fact that Anarchists of all strains share the common enemies of capitalism and statism will surely create alliances with some , strike a chord with a few , and alienate even more .
This unfortunate reality aside , however , the possibility should not stop one from trying to create logical alliances made in the interests of restoring Anarchist fraternity between Anarchists sharing the same basic tendencies .
After all , there certainly does exist much for Anarchists to agree upon ; for example , Anarchist - Communists , in the strain of Peter Kropotkin , will find much support from Rothbardians when they define their philosophy of Anarchism thusly :
Anarchism [ is ] the name given to a principle or theory of life and conduct under which society is conceived without government - harmony in such a society being obtained , not by submission to law , or by obedience to any authority , but by free agreements concluded between the various groups , territorial and professional , freely constituted for the sake of production and consumption , as also for the satisfaction of the infinite variety of needs and aspirations of a civilized being .
Likewise , Market Anarchists , in the strain of Murray N. Rothbard , will only see nodding heads when presenting to Anarchist - Communists the following statement :
The State does not merely use coercion to acquire its own revenue , to hire propagandists to advance its power , and to arrogate to itself and to enforce a compulsory monopoly of such vital services as police protection , firefighting , transportation , and postal service .
For the State does many other things as well , none of which can in any sense be said to serve the consuming public .
It uses its monopoly of force to achieve , as Nock puts it , a ' monopoly of crime ' ' to control , regulate , and coerce its hapless subjects .
Often it pushes its way into controlling the morality and the very daily lives of its subjects .
The state uses its coerced revenue , not merely to monopolize and provide genuine services inefficiently to the public , but also to build up its own power at the expense of its exploited and harassed subjects : to redistribute income and wealth from the public to itself and to its allies , and to control , command , and coerce the inhabitants of its territory .
Still though , as the nature of the divide between broken comrades entails , the hidden agreements notwithstanding , there certainly does exist a great deal of animosity between the separate sections of libertarian sectarians .
Far from it being a problem of ' social Anarchists ' simply refusing to acknowledge freedom , as some articles would seem to suggest , however , the issue appears to tie much tighter with a rather pathetic yearning of some Market Anarchists to cling to the remnants of their past bouts with conservatism ' usually taking form with the embracing of the term capitalism .
By draining both Anarchism and capitalism of all historical context and meaning , many Market Anarchists marry the two terms in an ' Anarcho - capitalist ' wedding that only a Salvador Dal ' could design .
Strikingly , that many Market Anarchists embrace the term capitalism in order to polarize themselves from the more distasteful rhetoric of other Anarchists reminds one of a child pushing away a hearty meal and reaching for a bag of potato - chips and a pack of Oreos .
' But what 's so wrong with the word capitalism ?
Do n't you love the free - market ? ' an ' Anarcho - capitalist ' might ask .
To answer , that so many conflate free - market with capitalism remains one of the greatest disappointments of political terminology ; completely divergent from the principle of free and voluntary association , as Kropotkin and Rothbard both aspire to create , the system of capitalism is one of economic exploitation by the definition of the word , or at least in its original phraseology .
As created in the context of an economic system , the coinage of the word capitalism , far from referring to the actual substance of a free - market , mostly references the symptoms of the world seen by many socialists as exploitative .
Proven indirectly from contemporary socialists describing capitalism as ' the social system which now exists in all countries of the world ' and directly from the nature by which the first anti-capitalists observed the capitalist mentality , that capitalism always meant economic coercion by the strong lording over the weak seems fairly ironclad .
Arguing that capitalism is what modern society suffers from , socialists make it clear that capitalism is not synonymous with free - market , since the free - market does not at all resemble the capitalist society of today , the 19th century , or any era ; furthermore , being indirect inheritors of the first socialist position on capitalism , it becomes easy to see that socialists merely argue against what they observe as the defined system of capitalism , and not against the logic of liberty itself .
Here , socialists like Mikhail Bakunin point to the conditions of their societies to describe the system of capitalism :
The risks of the worker are infinitely greater [ than the capitalists ' ] .
After all , if the establishment in which he is employed goes bankrupt , he must go several days and sometimes several weeks without work , and for him it is more than ruin , it is death ; because he eats everyday what he earns '
The accidents and illnesses that can overtake him constitute a risk that makes all the risks of the employer nothing in comparison : because for the worker debilitating illness can destroy his productive ability , his labor power .
Over all , prolonged illness is the most terrible bankruptcy , a bankruptcy that means for him and his children , hunger and death .
Damning this system as capitalist , coining the term capitalism itself , the socialists are absolutely right !
The system of capitalism , from which the socialists observed , absolutely existed and exists to exploit not only the workers , but every honest entrepreneur without connections to the violent state .
Yes , originally used as a pejorative to describe the economic system of the day , the socialists and state - socialists ( or Marxists ) apparently delved no deeper into the defining of the term than the evident consequences of the system around them .
Pointing to their primary concerns with conditions at the time and not with the moral arguments for freedom , capitalism 's establishment comes with the pillars of the 19th century as an eternal reference .
Regarding capitalism as the apparent , socialists took it to be evil ; associating capitalism with the realities of their society , it seems that they did so correctly .
The term capitalism being determined by the scene of the 19th century then , the idea that a capitalist economy could find any common definition with the free - market seems absolutely ludicrous .
Indeed , for from early antiquity , to the 19th century , and even to this day , the plague of statism infests the very same economies that all correctly hail as capitalist .
To expound , of the many statist institutions exploiting the entrepreneurs and the workers in the 1800s there included the first Central Bank of England established in 1694 , the colonies of major Western European and American powers run by monopolized charter - companies , the continued economic instability of France in and through la Terreur , the protectionism of Otto von Bismarck and the Prussians , and of course the forever deteriorating situation of Russia and its many faces of tyranny .
So , understanding the historical unfree-market of Europe , if the motives behind the objections to the system of capitalism launched from the inequitable scenes seen , then as the word capitalism was only coined to describe that which caused the effects of inequity and not the theoretical free - market itself , it must be concluded that which is , was , and will ever be capitalism cannot be free - market !
For what free market could include blatantly authoritarian institutions like Central Banks , land trusts inherited from the remnants of feudal lords , and ' monopolies granted by governments to associations of merchants and craftsmen who [ aid ] in the collection of taxes , in return for the assurance of profits by excluding native and foreign competitors ' ( Rothbard 18 ) ?
Certainly no free - market in the Mutualist , Rothbardian , or Austrian traditions !
Yes , with capitalism defined in terms of a historic perspective , if those advocating a free - market oppose protectionism and economic exploitation as seen in that context , then the free - marketer , the libertarian , the Market Anarchist must understand his inherent position against capitalism as a free - market anti-capitalist !
Sadly , however , many capitalist apologists and vehement anti-marketers will still disagree , holding grudges of rhetoric and terminology without any consideration for Anarchist progress .
For the anti-marketers , they will point to the ignorant , capitalist apologists as proof of Market Anarchism 's actual allegiance to capitalism ; for the capitalist apologists , their vulgar libertarianism will always corrupt their souls and separate them from success in the pursuit of all of that which walks on an anti-authoritarian path .
These stubborn boars aside , however , what can be done to reaffirm an alliance between Anarchists for the common goal of a libertarian society ?
Conceding the oxymoronic nature of ' Anarcho - capitalism ' is a good start , but where else can Anarchists strike ?
Here , one may primarily suggest multi-tendency organizations like the Alliance of the Libertarian Left , an organization aimed at advancing the left - libertarian cause of liberation and voluntary cooperation .
Introducing alliances like ALL , clandestine and potent in nature , the rise of a unified front for libertarianism seems increasingly inevitable , and with Market Anarchists at long last on their way back to their anti-capitalist roots , little seems likely to get in the way .
The Tibetan prayer flags suspended on a string over the sleeping body of Captain Blue rose and fell in fluttering counterpoint to the wheezy rhythm of his breath .
Lifted by a gentle breeze off the Pacific Ocean , each swatch of red , white , yellow , or green cotton bore a paragraph of Asian script .
Every time a flag flaps in the breeze , it is thought , a prayer flies off to Heaven .
Blue ’s mother says that when her son was an infant he used to sleep until noon , which is still the time that he wakes up most days , on his platform bed in a one - bedroom apartment overlooking Venice Beach , a neighborhood of Los Angeles .
California now has more than two hundred thousand physician - sanctioned pot users and hundreds of dispensaries .
Illustration by Adrian Tomine
It was now three o’clock in the afternoon , and Captain Blue was dozing after a copious inhalation of purified marijuana vapor .
( His nickname is an homage to his favorite variety of bud . )
His hair was black and greasy , and was spread across his pillow .
On the front of his purple T - shirt , which had slid up to expose his round belly , were the words “ Big Daddy . ”
With his arm wrapped around a three - foot - long green bong , he resembled a large , contented baby who has fallen asleep with his milk bottle .
Captain Blue is a pot broker .
More precisely , he helps connect growers of high - grade marijuana upstate to the retail dispensaries that sell marijuana legally to Californians on a doctor ’s recommendation .
Since 1996 , when a referendum known as Proposition 215 was approved by California voters , it has been legal , under California state law , for authorized patients to possess or cultivate the drug .
The proposition also allowed a grower to cultivate marijuana for a patient , as long as he had been designated a “ primary caregiver ” by that patient .
Although much of the public discussion centered on the needs of patients with cancer , AIDS , and other diseases that are synonymous with extraordinary suffering , the language of the proposition was intentionally broad , covering any medical condition for which a licensed physician might judge marijuana to be an appropriate remedy — insomnia , say , or attention - deficit disorder .
The inside of Blue ’s apartment , where he spends most of his time , measures less than four hundred square feet .
It opens onto a huge wraparound terrace that offers mind - bending views of the ocean and the Hollywood Hills .
The apartment , which is in the vicinity of Washington Boulevard , used to be occupied by another pot dealer , who moved out a few years ago , leaving Blue with his crash pad and a list of about a hundred patients .
The building is near Abbot Kinney Boulevard , the commercial drag in Venice that , in recent years , has been transformed from a low - rent strip of bars and secondhand - clothing stores into a destination for well - heeled shoppers and restaurant - goers .
The building retains a funky seventies vibe , with white wood floors , murky brown walls , and faded Morrison Hotel - style carpets .
The sounds of “ Tom and Jerry ” episodes blare through locked doors in the middle of the day .
I recently spent six months , off and on , with Blue — at his apartment , in private homes , on farms , in pot grow rooms , and in other places where “ medical marijuana ” is produced , traded , sold , and consumed in California .
During that time , I saw thousands of Tibetan prayer flags .
The flags identify their owners with serenity and the conscious path , rather than with the sinister world of urban dope dealers , who flaunt muscles and guns , and charge exorbitant prices for mediocre product .
For Blue and tens of thousands of like - minded individuals , Proposition 215 presented an opportunity to participate in a legally sanctioned experiment in altered living .
The people I met in the high - end ganja business had an affinity for higher modes of thinking and being , including vegetarianism and eating organic food , practicing yoga , avoiding prescription drugs in favor of holistic healing methods , travelling to Indonesia and Thailand , fasting , and experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs .
Many were also financially savvy , working long hours and making six - figure incomes .
Blue and I have known each other for almost two decades .
Our fathers were both professors of political science , and , starting in the mid-eighties , we both attended Ivy League colleges in the Northeast , where we shared a fondness for illegal drugs .
After graduation , Blue spun records and taught nursery school in Manhattan .
He left for California in 1998 , not long after the state banned cigarette smoking in workplaces — Blue is highly allergic to cigarette smoke — and passed Proposition 215 .
After working for a while as a bouncer , he began selling pot full time .
In 2003 , the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill 420 .
The law was intended to clear up some of the confusion caused by Proposition 215 , which had failed to specify how patients who could not grow their own pot were expected to obtain the drug , and how much pot could be cultivated for medical purposes .
The law permitted any Californian with a doctor ’s note to own up to six mature marijuana plants , or to possess up to half a pound of processed weed , which could be obtained from a patients ’ collective or coöperative — terms that were not precisely defined in the statute .
It also permitted a primary caregiver to be paid “ reasonable compensation ” for services provided to a qualified patient “ to enable that person to use marijuana . ”
The counties of California were allowed to amend the state guidelines , and the result was a patchwork of rules and regulations .
Upstate in Humboldt County , the heartland of high - grade marijuana farming in California , the district attorney , Paul Gallegos , decided that a resident could grow up to ninety - nine plants at a time , in a space of a hundred square feet or less , on behalf of a qualified patient .
The limited legal protections afforded to pot growers and dispensary owners have turned marijuana cultivation and distribution in California into a classic “ gray area ” business , like gambling or strip clubs , which are tolerated or not , to varying degrees , depending on where you live and on how aggressive your local sheriff is feeling that afternoon .
This summer , Jerry Brown , the state ’s attorney general , plans to release a more consistent set of regulations on medical marijuana , but it is not clear that California ’s judges will uphold his effort .
In May , the state Court of Appeal , in Los Angeles , ruled that Senate Bill 420 ’s cap on the amount of marijuana a patient could possess was unconstitutional , because voters had not approved the limits .
Most researchers agree that the value of the U.S. marijuana crop has increased sharply since the mid-nineties , as California and twelve other states have passed medical - marijuana laws .
A drug- policy analyst named Jon Gettman recently estimated that in 2006 Californians grew more than twenty million pot plants .
He reckoned that between 1981 and 2006 domestic marijuana production increased tenfold , making pot the leading cash crop in America , displacing corn .
A 2005 State Department report put the country ’s marijuana crop at twenty - two million pounds .
The street value of California ’s crop alone may be as high as fourteen billion dollars .
According to Americans for Safe Access , which lobbies for medical marijuana , there are now more than two hundred thousand physician - sanctioned pot users in California .
They acquire their medication from hundreds of dispensaries , collectives that are kept alive by the financial contributions of their patients , who pay cash for each quarter or eighth of an ounce of pot .
The dispensaries also buy marijuana from their members , and sometimes directly from growers , whose crops can also be considered legal , depending on the size of the crop , the town where the plants are grown , and the disposition of the judge who hears the case .
California ’s encouragement of a licit market for pot has set off a low - level civil war with the federal government .
Growing , selling , and smoking marijuana remain strictly illegal under federal law .
The Drug Enforcement Administration , which maintains that marijuana poses a danger to users on a par with heroin and PCP , has kept up an energetic presence in the state , busting pot growers and dispensary owners with the coöperation of some local police departments .
In the past five years , an unwritten set of rules has emerged to govern Californians participating in the medical - marijuana trade .
Federal authorities do not generally bother arresting patients or doctors who write prescriptions .
Instead , the D.E.A. pressures landlords to evict dispensaries and stages periodic raids on them , either shutting them down or seizing their money and marijuana .
Dispensary owners are rarely arrested , and patient records are usually left alone .
Through trial and error , dispensary owners have learned how to avoid trouble :
Do n’t advertise in newspapers , on billboards , or on flyers distributed door to door .
Do n’t sell to minors or cops .
Do n’t open more than two stores .
Any Californian who is reasonably prudent can live a life centered on the cultivation , sale , and consumption of marijuana with little fear of being fined or going to jail .
Captain Blue displays his pot on a shelf by his bed , next to two new laptop computers and an assemblage of high - end stereo equipment .
The weed is kept in silver Ziploc bags .
All the pot that Blue sells is grown in accordance with California state law , he says , and is provided only to dispensaries of which Blue is a member , and to patients for whom he is the primary caregiver .
Blue has a photo I.D. card from the City of Los Angeles confirming that he is a bona - fide medical - marijuana patient .
His malady is anxiety .
On a side table by his bed , he keeps a Volcano , a German - made vaporizer that resembles a stainless - steel coffeemaker .
The Volcano , which costs five hundred dollars , warms dried marijuana , releasing vapor into a plastic bag and leaving behind a toasted brown chaff that smells oddly like popcorn .
When Blue uses the Volcano , he inhales the contents of the plastic bag through a bong , which purifies the vapor .
While Blue napped , I wandered around his apartment , and counted nearly a dozen images and carvings of the elephant - headed Hindu god Ganesha .
The proliferation of Ganesha dates back to a well - publicized federal bust in January , 2007 , when the D.E.A. seized the medicine and cash of eleven pot dispensaries in Los Angeles .
The only major dispensary that was n’t busted had a Ganesha in its window .
Now it is hard to find a karmically inclined ganja dealer in Los Angeles who does n’t own a herd of lucky figurines .

Blue ’s cell phone rang several times in succession , rousing him .
His phone rings , on average , once every two and a half minutes between noon and 2 A.M. , and I soon developed a Pavlovian aversion to his ringtone , a swirling , Middle Eastern - inflected electronica tune called “ Lebanese Blonde . ”
Blue switches phone numbers every six months or so .
Although it is unlikely that the D.E.A. would tap his phone , he told me , it does n’t hurt to take simple precautions , if only to reassure his more paranoid clients .
Blue answered the phone , rubbed his eyes , and began rattling off numbers .
“ Three hundred fifty ?
Three - fifty ?
Three - twenty - five ?
We could do three - twenty - five , ” he said , quoting a final price per ounce .
Assuming a sitting position on his bed , he punched numbers into a calculator and suggested some designer strains that his patient might enjoy .
“ Try Sour Diesel , ” he told the client .
“ Take that and the Bubba Kush . ”
In addition to Sour Diesel and Bubba Kush , which are grown indoors , he also had AK Mist , an outdoor strain ; Jedi , which is brown and fuzzy ; Purple Urkel , whose hue is suggested by its name ; O.G. Kush and L.A. Confidential , two particularly potent strains ; and Lavender , a fragrant purple grown up North .
Modern Kush plants are derived from a strain that is said to have originated in the Hindu Kush mountains , in Afghanistan and Pakistan , and , according to stoner lore , was imported to Southern California by some hippie surfers in the seventies , and then popularized in the late nineties by the Los Angeles rap group Cypress Hill .
Stronger , better - tasting varieties of pot can sell for more than five thousand dollars per pound , more than double the price of average weed .
The premium paid for designer pot creates a big incentive for growers and dealers to name their product for whatever strains happen to be fashionable that year .
The variety of buds being sold as Kush has proliferated to the point where even the most catholic - minded botanist would be hard pressed to identify a common plant ancestor .
The rapper RZA , a founder of the Wu - Tang Clan , sat in a suite on the 48th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel overlooking Central Park , staring at a chess game through a pair of sunglasses .
His hand was frozen a few inches above the board as he looked for a strategy to thwart his opponent .
Chess has long had an important role in the aesthetic of the Wu - Tang Clan , which has songs about the game .
In “ The Wu - Tang Manual , ” a 2005 book about the group and its members , RZA ( pronounced RIZ - a ) wrote that chess is part of the Wu - Tang essence “ because it ’s a game of war  it ’s about battle .
And Wu - Tang was formed in battles , from challenging each other . ”
RZA , 38 , learned the game when he was 11 , from a girl who , as he writes in the manual , also took his virginity .
Though he and his cousin GZA , another founder of the group , both love chess , they did not play much when they were younger because , GZA said , they were too poor to own a board .

Now they play chess almost every day , and RZA , holder of the Hip - Hop Chess Federation belt  a trophy he picked up last fall at a tournament in San Francisco that featured rappers and martial - arts experts  is turning his interest into a business .
On Monday he started WuChess ( wuchess.com ) , a Web site where fans can play chess online , chat , see scores of their games and other personal information , and get news about RZA and Wu - Tang .
RZA said that the site might one day offer monthly tournaments , with the winner playing him online .
Last summer , I was having a hard time finding a job , so a friend referred me to a placement agency .
They ’d found her and her partner good positions quickly and had been generally helpful overall .
So I checked them out and sure enough they found me a job in less than a week .
It was n’t perfect , but what I was looking for while I figured out what I want to do with the rest of my life .
After reading Ron ’s essay on major life mistakes , I thought I ’d write a follow - up on what you should and should n’t do with an employment agency .
1 . You should n’t expect the agency to simply find you a job .
Yes , they will find you a job , that ’s their business .
But you ’ll have to be involved too .
Most of the things you should expect and prepare for below are derived from this principle .
Agencies open a door to opportunities .
They may help sell you a little before the interview .
But if you ’re unqualified , if you do n’t put out effort , etc , they may not be able to help you .
They ’ll try to find something that fits , but it ’s not magic ( feels like it if you get a job after months of looking , but it ’s not really magic ) .
2 . You should be prepared to interview .
A placement agency needs to know about you in order to place you .
A resume helps , but they ’ll want to discuss the specifics of what you can do for their clients and what they can do for you .
And they need to know that you ’re not crazy and really are who you say you are ( as best they can tell ) .
You see , both you and the company hiring you are the agency ’s clients .
Without hires , they ’d make no money .
Without companies , they ’d make no money ( or they should n’t ) .
It ’s in their best interest to make good matches for good recommendations by previous placements and repeat business from companies .
3 . You should be prepared to take tests .
I had to take skill assessment tests right in the agency ’s office to prove how fast I could type and my overall proficiency with basic programs like Microsoft Word , Excel , Photoshop , etc .
Do n’t be too scared by these , just do your best .
I never needed Photoshop or more than basic
Word at my admin job .
I did need to be good with Excel , however .
Placement agencies can’t afford to take your word .
They ca n’t risk letting you hurt their relationship with a company .
So if they test you , do n’t sweat it .
The results may even help them recommend you for jobs you ’ll suit better .
4 . You should have very specific ideas for what you want .
Be flexible , but let them know where to send you .
This is n’t a complete cop -out , you need to express what you ’re looking for .
Have a field or two , explain why you ’d be good in these fields ( they do n’t want to send someone unqualified ) .
Specify a desired salary range .
I gave them a resume which was good for either office / admin assistance work or editing / copy editing / business writing .
In retrospect , I probably should have given them two resumes , one more focused towards each .
5 . You should be prepared to interview again .
If they ’re just sending you in for a couple days of temp work , you probably wo n’t have to interview .
But if they ’re placing you as a hire or even as a temp - to - hire , it ’s quite possible you ’ll go through an interview with the company that ’s actually bringing you on board .
Even if she trusts the temp agency about your qualifications , your hiring manager needs to know you ’re a good fit for the office .
The placement agency is the reason you got the interview , but they wo n’t do everything for you .
6 . You should be prepared for a temp - to - hire to drag on a bit .
If you ca n’t handle that , tell them you ’re looking strictly for placement ( but it may cut out a lot of options ) .
The hiring company probably wants to make sure it only pays what it has to .
For example , when I was hired last summer it was on a temp - to - hire basis .
After about 2 weeks , my boss told me she was planning to hire me but the company had a policy .
They were paying the agency , which was paying me .
The agency took a commission on my pay , so I made $ X / hour and they were paid $ Y an hour .
$ 12 / hour more than I was making ( !!! ) .
I know this because I was the person who processed their invoice every week .
Company policy was that they ’d only hire me once I ’d worked through the entire agency finder ’s fee .
It was cheaper , in case I quit early .
If I quite early , they ’d be out the $ 8 k ( !!! again ) they were spending on me , plus whatever it took for the next person .
While I understood this , it did n’t quite engender feelings of loyalty .
That combined with the depressingness of my job and the general cynical attitude of my boss ( it ’s ok to complain a couple times a day , not half of the day ) meant that I did n’t feel bad about leaving before the period was over .
The next girl got hired after a month , full benefits , whatnot .
I ’m still in touch with my old boss from time to time and I hear she seems quite happy .
Benefits and the slightly higher salary might have been more of an incentive .
Feeling like I was really part of the company .
But I digress .
Still , the amount the company was paying for my services is relevant for this last point .
7 . You should n’t EVER EVER pay them to find you a job .
Here ’s the way it plays out .
You are an employee and a mildly valuable resource .
Companies need employees .
Companies ( especially smaller ones ) may not want to have entire HR departments or go to the trouble of advertising for jobs .
They may not want to spend a lot of money on hiring .
A person whose only job is hiring and who makes $ 40,000 / year is only earning their money ( according to what I cost , anyway ) , if they bring in 5 new people every year .
If you add in benefits , it ’s more like 6 or 7 new people .
That may or may not seem like a good deal for the company .
Hence placement agencies exist .
They give 1 employee for 1 payment .
No hiring and firing the hiring person , no extra headcount or payroll .
Strict business .
Outsourcing .
It makes sense for the company to pay the agency .
More importantly , there are plenty of legitimate placement agencies out there which will be paid by the hiring company .
You should n’t pay them to place you .
Ever ever ever .
I only say this because there are a lot of people out there who get tricked into paying for it .
I think it ’s a disgusting and shameful practice , ripping off people who are looking for jobs ( and possibly feeling desperate , which is why they ’re looking for placement to begin with ) .
So apparently people are being convinced that they are the ones who have to pay .
And it makes some sense … the placement people have to be paid somehow .
But the reputable ones are paid by the companies .
( Worse , an agency making you pay might be working both ends and making the company pay too ! )
In Ron ’s story , the placement place also turned into a fly - by - night deal .
They ’d guaranteed a year ’s worth of placements , but did n’t follow through .
Just disappeared .
I was fortunate enough to have been told in college ( or perhaps high school ) how it all works .
So even on the days when I was feeling desperate , I would have known that I should steer clear of shady agencies .
Have you ever used a temp or placement agency ?
What kind of experience was it ?

Last year , Rock Band was the only music game that enabled users to play as a full - fledged band .
Things are different this year with Konami's Rock Revolution and , more dauntingly , Guitar Hero World Tour .
Ultimately , no amount of features or new equipment is going to matter .
The real winner will be whichever game has the best track list .
Harmonix and MTV must be fully aware of this fact , because today , the two released the full 84 - song set list .
Judging by the impressive list , Konami and Activision have reason to worry .
This is easily the greatest assemblage of music in a game to date .
The big jaw - to - the - floor announcement is that Guns N ' Roses is set to debut a new song from the long - awaited album Chinese Democracy .
It 's not just that Rock Band 2 has GNR -- it has new GNR and effectively announces the imminent arrival of the band 's oft - delayed album .
Guns N' Roses ' " Shackler 's Revenge " is just the tip of the iceberg for a track list that features far more greats ( Bob effin ' Dylan ! ) than stinkers ( Linkin effin ' Park ? ! ) .
Joining GNR and Dylan are such surprises as Tenacious D , Pearl Jam , Beck , Talking Heads , and The Replacements .
The list is n't so focused on spreading across decades as it is spanning genres .
There 's a lot more heavy metal this time around and the music from the '60s is better focused ( and lacking the horror that is Green Tides and High Grass ) .
Perhaps the only head scratcher is the inclusion of Norman Greenbaum 's " Spirit in the Sky , " which most will recognize as an overused sports anthem .
Check out the full list of tracks .
Note that all tracks on RB2 are master recordings .
There are 75 tracks from famous artists , plus nine bonus tracks from various bands that feature members of Harmonix .

I ’ve been working on and off on a new linker .
To my surprise , I ’ve discovered in talking about this that some people , even some computer programmers , are unfamiliar with the details of the linking process .
I ’ve decided to write some notes about linkers , with the goal of producing an essay similar to my existing one about the GNU configure and build system .
As I only have the time to write one thing a day , I ’m going to do this on my blog over time , and gather the final essay together later .
I believe that I may be up to five readers , and I hope y’all will accept this digression into stuff that matters .
I will return to random philosophizing and minding other people ’s business soon enough .
A Personal Introduction
Who am I to write about linkers ?
I wrote my first linker back in 1988 , for the AMOS operating system which ran on Alpha Micro systems .
( If you do n’t understand the following description , do n’t worry ; all will be explained below ) .
I used a single global database to register all symbols .
Object files were checked into the database after they had been compiled .
The link process mainly required identifying the object file holding the main function .
Other objects files were pulled in by reference .
I reverse engineered the object file format , which was undocumented but quite simple .
The goal of all this was speed , and indeed this linker was much faster than the system one , mainly because of the speed of the database .
I wrote my second linker in 1993 and 1994 .
This linker was designed and prototyped by Steve Chamberlain while we both worked at Cygnus Support ( later Cygnus Solutions , later part of Red Hat ) .
This was a complete reimplementation of the BFD based linker which Steve had written a couple of years before .
The primary target was a.out and COFF .
Again the goal was speed , especially compared to the original BFD based linker .
On SunOS 4 this linker was almost as fast as running the cat program on the input .o files .
The linker I am now working , called gold , on will be my third .
It is exclusively an ELF linker .
Once again , the goal is speed , in this case being faster than my second linker .
That linker has been significantly slowed down over the years by adding support for ELF and for shared libraries .
This support was patched in rather than being designed in .
Future plans for the new linker include support for incremental linking –which is another way of increasing speed .
There is an obvious pattern here : everybody wants linkers to be faster .
This is because the job which a linker does is uninteresting .
The linker is a speed bump for a developer , a process which takes a relatively long time but adds no real value .
So why do we have linkers at all ?
That brings us to our next topic .
A Technical Introduction
What does a linker do ?
It ’s simple : a linker converts object files into executables and shared libraries .
Let ’s look at what that means .
For cases where a linker is used , the software development process consists of writing program code in some language : e.g. , C or C++ or Fortran ( but typically not Java , as Java normally works differently , using a loader rather than a linker ) .
A compiler translates this program code , which is human readable text , into into another form of human readable text known as assembly code .
Assembly code is a readable form of the machine language which the computer can execute directly .
An assembler is used to turn this assembly code into an object file .
For completeness , I ’ll note that some compilers include an assembler internally , and produce an object file directly .
Either way , this is where things get interesting .
In the old days , when dinosaurs roamed the data centers , many programs were complete in themselves .
In those days there was generally no compiler –people wrote directly in assembly code–and the assembler actually generated an executable file which the machine could execute directly .
As languages liked Fortran and Cobol started to appear , people began to think in terms of libraries of subroutines , which meant that there had to be some way to run the assembler at two different times , and combine the output into a single executable file .
This required the assembler to generate a different type of output , which became known as an object file ( I have no idea where this name came from ) .
And a new program was required to combine different object files together into a single executable .
This new program became known as the linker ( the source of this name should be obvious ) .
Linkers still do the same job today .
In the decades that followed , one new feature has been added : shared libraries .
More tomorrow .

Menus and toolbars are used in just about every modern program in existence , barring the ones that only run from the command line .
In this post , we ’ll learn how to create them using the wxPython toolkit .
Here ’s what you ’ll need to follow along :
Python 2.3 – 2.5
wx Python ( I recommend 2.7 or higher )
Creating Menus
First , we ’ll take a look at the parts that make up a menu .
The base of the menu system in wxPython is the wx .
MenuBar object .
As its name implies , it creates a bar to put your menus on .
The next piece of the puzzle is the wx .
Menu object .
These are basically the words you see in your menu bar , such as “ File ” and “ Edit ” .
The items under the wx .
Menu object are created by using the Append method of the menu object that you create .
See the following example :
import wx class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .
ID_ANY , " wx. Menu Tutorial " ) #
Add a panel so it looks the correct on all platforms self .
panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx . ID_ANY ) menuBar = wx.MenuBar( ) fileMenu = wx.Menu( ) exitMenuItem = fileMenu.Append( wx.NewId( ) , " Exit " , " Exit the application " ) menuBar .
Append( fileMenu , " & File " ) self.
SetMenuBar( menuBar ) #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
Your application should now look something like this :
Note the three arguments to create a menu item :
fileMenu.Append(wx.NewId( ) , " Exit " , " Exit the application " )
You need an id , a label , and a description .
The description will appear in the Statusbar , if you have created one .
Lately there ’s been a lot of people on the wxPython mailing list that want to disable items in the menu or entire menus .
To do this , we have to use the counter - intuitively named methods , Enable ( ) and EnableTop ( ) , respectively .
The Enable ( ) method is part of the menu item ’s methods whereas EnableTop ( ) must be called by the MenuBar object .
Now be careful here as you need to attach the menubar to the frame BEFORE you can disable an entire menu .
Let ’s take a look at some code .
Based on my source above , you could do something like this to disable the “ exit ” item in the “ File ” menu :
exitMenuItem.Enable ( False )
If you wanted to disable the entire “ File ” menu , you would do this :
self.menuBar.EnableTop(0 , False )
As you can see , creating menus with wxPython is quite easy and straight - forward .
Now , let ’s bind an event handler to the “ Exit ” menu item or it wo n’t do anything .
Binding an event to a menu item is much the same as binding an event to anything else in wxPython .
I will show you the easiest way and also the way that the demo does it .
The quickest way is to just bind to the EVT_MENU event , like this :
self .Bind(wx.EVT_MENU , self.onExit , exitMenuItem )
However , if you have lots of menu items , this gets tedious very quickly .
Thus , I like the method I found in the wxPython demo of creating a nested method to do it for me .
The general methodology is to put the following code inside one of your methods :
def doBind ( item , handler ) : ''' Create menu events . ''' self .
Bind( wx.EVT_MENU , handler , item )
I usually create my menus in their own function that I call from the __init__ constructor .
If you do it this way , then your code should end up looking something like the snippet below :
def createMenu( self ) : " " " Create the menu bar . " " " def doBind ( item , handler ) : " " " Create menu events . " " " self .
Bind( wx.EVT_MENU , handler , item ) doBind ( fileMenu .
Append( wx.ID_ANY , " &Exit\tAlt + F4 " , " ExitProgram " ) , self .on Exit )
Finally , you might want a horizontal line to separate some of the items in your menu .
To add one , call your menu ’s AppendSeparator ( ) method :
fileMenu.AppendSeparator ()
Creating Toolbars
Using wxPython ’s toolbar functionality is really easy too .
To initialize the toolbar , all you need to do is call wx. CreateToolBar ( ) .
I also set the toolbar ’s icon sizes using the SetToolBitmapSize ( ) method .
Toolbars can have separators too , but you use the toolbar ’s AddSeparator ( ) rather than AppendSeparator ( ) .
Let ’s look at some code so you can see this better .
Here is my createToolbar method :
def createToolbar ( self ) : " " " Create a toolbar . " " " self.toolbar = self.CreateToolBar( ) self.toolbar.SetToolBitmapSize(( 16,16 ) ) # sets icon size #
Use wx .
ArtProvider for default icons save_ico = wx .
ArtProvider .GetBitmap(wx.ART_FILE_SAVE , wx.ART_TOOLBAR , ( 16,16 ) ) saveTool = self.toolbar.AddSimpleTool(wx.ID_ANY , save_ico , " Save " , " Saves the Current Worksheet " ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_MENU , self.onSave , saveTool ) self.toolbar.AddSeparator ( ) print_ico = wx .
ArtProvider .GetBitmap(wx.ART_PRINT , wx.ART_TOOLBAR , ( 16,16 ) ) printTool = self.toolbar.AddSimpleTool(wx.ID_ANY , print_ico , " Print " , " Sends Timesheet to Default Printer " ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_MENU , self.onPrint , printTool ) delete_ico = wx .
ArtProvider .GetBitmap(wx.ART_DELETE , wx.ART_TOOLBAR , ( 16,16 ) ) deleteTool = self.toolbar.AddSimpleTool(wx.ID_ANY , delete_ico , " Delete " , " Delete contents of cell " ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_MENU , self.onDelete , deleteTool ) undo_ico = wx .
ArtProvider .GetBitmap(wx.ART_UNDO , wx.ART_TOOLBAR , ( 16,16 ) ) self.undoTool = self.toolbar .
AddSimpleTool( wx.ID_UNDO , undo_ico , " Undo " , " " ) self.toolbar.EnableTool(wx.ID_UNDO , False ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TOOL , self.onUndo , self.undoTool ) redo_ico = wx .
ArtProvider .GetBitmap(wx.ART_REDO , wx.ART_TOOLBAR , ( 16,16 ) ) self.redoTool = self.toolbar.AddSimpleTool(wx.ID_REDO , redo_ico , " Redo " , " " ) self.toolbar.EnableTool(wx.ID_REDO , False ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_TOOL , self.onRedo , self.redoTool ) #
This basically shows the toolbar self.toolbar .
Realize ( )
Note that I have disabled a couple of toolbar buttons by calling EnableTool ( wx. ID_UNDO , False ) .
As you can see , this method takes two arguments : the id of the toolbar button and a bool .
To get an idea of how this looks , I have included the following screenshot :
Creating Accelerators
Most power users prefer to use keyboard shortcuts rather than digging through convoluted menus .
Fortunately , wxPython provides a way to do just that ; it ’s known as the Accelerator table .
These tables are usually associated with the menu system , however you do n’t need menus to use the table .
I will go over both approaches though .
First we ’ll talk about using the table with the menus .
To begin , we need to create an instance of a wx .
AcceleratorTable .
The AcceleratorTable takes a lists of 3 - item tuples consisting of a wx.ACCEL_CTRL , the key - combo , and an id .
For this example , I want to map CTRL+Q to make the application exit .
The way to do that with wxPython is like this :
accel_tbl = wx.AcceleratorTable ([( wx.ACCEL_CTRL , ord ( 'Q ' ) , exitMenuItem. GetId ( ) ) ] ) self.frame.SetAcceleratorTable(accel_tbl)
Now let ’s do it without using a menu item .
You ’ll notice that I create a new id and bind to an event handler before creating the table .
Other than that , it ’s really not that much different .
exit Id = wx. NewId ( ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_MENU , self.onExit , id=exitId ) accel_tbl = wx.AcceleratorTable ( [( wx.ACCEL_CTRL , ord ( 'Q ' ) , exitId ) ] ) self. SetAcceleratorTable ( accel_tbl )
Now we ’ve covered the basics of menu , toolbar and accelerator creation .
I hope you ’ve found this helpful .

** Update ** I had forgotten about this , but Robin Dunn reminded me that you can also use the wxUpdateUIEvent / EVT_UPDATE_UI to update the menus and toolbars and whether or not they are enabled or disabled .

Your next laptop could have a continuous power battery that lasts for 30 years without a single recharge thanks to work being funded by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory .
The breakthrough betavoltaic power cells are constructed from semiconductors and use radioisotopes as the energy source .
As the radioactive material decays it emits beta particles that transform into electric power capable of fueling an electrical device like a laptop for years .
Although betavoltaic batteries sound Nuclear they ’re not , they neither use fission / fusion or chemical processes to produce energy and so ( do not produce any radioactive or hazardous waste ) .
Betavoltaics generate power when an electron strikes a particular interface between two layers of material .
The Process uses beta electron emissions that occur when a neutron decays into a proton which causes a forward bias in the semiconductor .
This makes the betavoltaic cell a forward bias diode of sorts , similar in some respects to a photovoltaic ( solar ) cell .
Electrons scatter out of their normal orbits in the semiconductor and into the circuit creating a usable electric current .
The profile of the batteries can be quite small and thin , a porous silicon material is used to collect the hydrogen isotope tritium which is generated in the process .
The reaction is non-thermal which means laptops and other small devices like mobile phones will run much cooler than with traditional lithium - ion power batteries .
The reason the battery lasts so long is that neutron beta - decay into protons is the world 's most concentrated source of electricity , truly demonstrating Einstein ’s theory E=MC2 .
Doris Payne never carried a gun .
She never smashed a window or broke into a safe to take what she wanted .
She just crossed her pantyhosed legs and murmured about the filigree ring under the glass .
She wondered aloud about matching earrings .
She would promise to return in 45 minutes , and only after Payne wafted away in her flowered dress would the clerk count the rings and come up short .
But the decades passed , and the job grew more difficult .
Her face became familiar .
Information about her raced through the Internet and over fax machines .
On the last day of Payne ’s career , security guards quietly watched her every move on television screens as she walked through Neiman Marcus .
When she made her move , they made theirs .
“ Thirty or forty years ago , she could get away with it a little more , ” said FBI supervisory special agent Paul Graupmann , who dealt with Payne in the 1980s .
At 77 and serving out a sentence in Denver after two years in a Nevada prison , Payne now must settle for sharing the story of how she managed her prolific career for five decades .
Advertisement
“ I had lots of fun , ” Payne said .
“ I did . ”
She was a rarity in a business known for its thuggery , in which criminals smash store windows or slice the tires of traveling salespeople carrying gems so they can attack them on deserted roads .
Payne used her wits and smooth tongue .
“ We do n’t see a lot of criminals like Doris Payne , ” said John Kennedy , president of the Jewelers ’ Security Alliance .
Payne grew up in the coal - mining town of Slab Fork , W.Va. , her imagination fueled by “ Gone With the Wind ” and its depictions of women she would impersonate for the rest of her life .
In her mother ’s dresses and hats , she would roam the house , clicking her heels , talking to Rhett Butler .
“ I think that movie contributed as much to what I became as anything else in my life , ” Payne said .
Advertisement
When she was 13 , she was trying on watches at a local store when a white customer entered .
The owner dismissed Payne , who is black , and she realized she could walk out with the merchandise .
“ I could cause this man , the white man , to forget . ”
For the next several years , Payne said , she practiced lifting jewelry but never stole anything , though her son , Ronald , said in an interview that his mother did keep the goods during that time .
Payne said she stole her first diamond at age 27 , hoping to raise money to help her mother leave an abusive husband .
She remembers her mother ’s reaction : “ She said , ‘ Doris , do n’t you know that ’s stealing ? ’ ”
“ I ’m not stealing , because I ’m just going to keep what they let me have , ” she replied .
Advertisement
Payne ’s formula was simple :
Pick a fine store and look like she belonged there .
“ I knew how to dress , ” said Payne , who still cuts an elegant figure even in prison greens and with her white hair brushed straight back .
“ I never did like ruffles and frills .
I just like a simple - cut fine material that moves when I move . ”
Whatever she wore , she added , always had pockets .
Deep pockets .
The rest , she said , fell into place .
A clerk would present her with at least five pieces of jewelry , usually emeralds and diamonds .
When she decided which to take , she would place it on her finger , making sure the clerk saw it there .
Advertisement
Then she would begin her distractions , discussing other rings on the counter , then asking the clerk to bring more jewelry .
Meanwhile , she would slip the ring from one hand to the other .
“ I ’m going to make sure he sees this hand I had it on is naked . ”
Payne says she practiced her trade all over the world , London to Paris to Tokyo .
Though Payne claims she was never caught in the act , she was frequently arrested days or weeks later -- and has been convicted of grand theft at least nine times in the U.S .
She says she has no idea how many jewels she stole in her lifetime .
“ They were not that great in number .
They were great in value . ”
Advertisement
The jewels funded plush hotels and meals in fine restaurants , she said .
“ I love seafood and I love great pastry , ” she said .
“ Not a gob of it .
I like small servings . ”
Payne ’s tale may contain some exaggerations .
Graupmann , for example , recalls arresting her in the 1980s for stealing a diamond so inexpensive that federal prosecutors decided not to charge her .
When he arrested her , “ she was living in a very modest little apartment ” in Ohio with a crack addict for a roommate .
“ Not exactly the lifestyles of the rich and famous , ” Graupmann said .
Advertisement
She was n’t as good as she thought she was , he said ; the good ones do n’t get caught .
Still , he said , “ you have to give her credit for being so bold . ”
Her son does .
“ It took me a while to become proud of her , ” said Ronald , of Louisiana .
Now 61 , he was born when his mother was a teenager .
He was raised partly by his grandparents .
“ I realized she was very good at what she does and had fun doing it . ”
The beginning of the end came 10 years ago when she stole a five - carat diamond ring from a Neiman Marcus in Denver .
Captured several months later when a security guard recognized her at a mall in Pennsylvania , she was convicted in 1999 and was sentenced to 12 years .
Advertisement
By 2005 , she was on parole in Colorado .
She began slipping away on jaunts to other states .
In Nevada , she stole an $ 8,500 ring .
In California , she walked out of a Neiman Marcus in Palo Alto with a $ 31,500 three - stone diamond ring with a platinum band , police records show .
Store officials suspected that the well - spoken stranger was Payne .
Over the years , they had lost a lot of money to a woman who fit her description .
Two days later , she was spotted in the Las Vegas Neiman Marcus , filling a bag with $ 2,700 worth of clothing .
When she walked outside , authorities stopped her , according to police reports .
When police interviewed her , Payne admitted stealing the ring in Palo Alto and described how she had done it .
On her booking sheet , she gave her occupation as “ jewel thief . ”

Sentenced to two to five years for pawning the stolen Palo Alto ring in Las Vegas , as well as stealing a ring in Nevada that year , she spent the last two years in a Nevada prison .
This spring , Payne returned to Colorado to complete the prison term interrupted by her other adventures .
By the time she gets out , she ’ll be 81 .
But the law wo n’t be done with her then -- she must return to California to face charges for the Palo Alto theft .
At the Denver prison where she has traded leather heels for work boots with “ inmate ” stamped on the sole , one of the jewelry industry ’s more persistent headaches says she ’s done stealing .
“ I could kill myself in here , ” she said .
She just wants out so she can live the rest of her life free .
“ She ’s not going to steal anymore , ” said her son , who hopes to offer her a home .
Advertisement
Even if she wanted to go back to her old ways , Ronald said , she could hardly get away with it .
“ There ’s not a jewelry store in this nation that does n’t have a picture of Doris Payne in the back room with her gray - haired self , ” he said .
“ She ’s through . ”

Google gives Wikipedia the VIWS treatment
Yesterday , Google blogged about this new feature , calling it " a tale of teleportation . "
When you key the name of a website into Google and Google links you to that site , Google thinks science fiction :
Have you ever forgotten the exact address of a site that you wanted to visit ?
Not a problem - just type the name of the site into the Google search box and hopefully it appears at the top of the search results page .
We call this " teleporting . "
We call it searching .
But we 'll indulge Google on this one :
One of the trends we noticed while studying teleporting was that there were lots of searchers who would type the name of a specific website as if they wanted to teleport , but would then immediately issue another more refined search within this site .
For example , if someone is looking for official information about the Hubble Space Telescope on the NASA website , one might first search for [ NASA ] and then [ NASA Hubble Telescope ] .
So , NASA gets its very own search box as well as Amazon , The New York Times , and Willypedia .
What other sites get the VIWS treatment ?
How many sites get the VIWS treatment ?
Google wo n't say .
But it will say that these sites are chosen by super secret Google algorithms : " This feature will now occur when we detect a high probability that a user wants more refined search results within a specific site , " read a statement tossed our way .
" Like the rest of our snippets , the sites that display the site search box are chosen algorithmically based on metrics that measure how useful the search box is to users . " ®
Update
As one Reg reader has pointed out , if you search on Yahoo ! , Google does not provide a second search box .
Obviously , the company believes that users are n't likely to be interested in doing additional searching on Yahoo !
And the company is right .
Update 2
El Reg chip and server maven Ashlee Vance points out that Intel and Sun Microsystems get their own search boxes .
Intel and Sun ?
But not Yahoo! or eBay ?
Either Google 's CEO Eric Schmidt is pulling favors for people like Google board member / Intel CEO Paul Otellini and old chum Scott McNealy or Google 's algorithms are rubbish .
This is not anymore the most recent version of the API .

CairoPlot now has a Mailing List !
For more information , refer to : this post .
So , a while ago , I ’ve decided to code a library to plot some information I had .
The idea was to create simple graphics in a way they would be easy to create , beautiful and good to present to people with no or few backgrounds on math and computers .
For the ease one creation I , obviously , used Python 😀
And , as I was already a PyCairo enthusiast ( that began by the time I read Aventuras no cairo by Marcelo Lira and , as pointed out by him , this other one ) , I decide to use it to draw my graphics .
On this first version , the CairoPlot library provides 3 functions :
dot_line_plot ( )
Function to plot graphics using dots and lines as seen below .
dot_line_plot ( name , data , width , height , background = None , border = 0 , axis = False , grid = False , h_legend = None , v_legend = None , h_bounds = None , v_bounds = None )
name – Name of the desired output file , no need to input the .svg as it will be added at runtim ;
data –
The list , list of lists or dictionary holding the data to be plotted ;
width , height – Dimensions of the output image ;
background – A 3 element tuple representing the rgb color expected for the background .
If left None , a gray to white gradient will be generated ;
border – Distance in pixels of a square border into which the graphics will be drawn ;
axis –
Whether or not the axis are to be drawn ;
grid –
Whether or not the gris is to be drawn ;
h_legend , v_legend – lists of strings containing the horizontal and vertical legends for the axis ;
h_bounds , v_bounds – tuples containing the lower and upper value bounds for the data to be plotted .
Example of Use
teste_data = [ 0 , 1 , 3 , 8 , 9 , 0 , 10 , 10 , 2 , 1 ] CairoPlot.dot_line_plot ( ' teste ' , teste_data , 400 , 300 , axis=True )
Result :
teste_data_2 = { " john " : [ 10 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 30 ] , " mary " : [ 0 , 0 , 3 , 5 , 15 ] , " philip " : [ 13 , 33 , 11 , 25 , 2 ] } teste_h_legend = [ " jan/2008 " , " feb/2008 " , " mar/2008 " , " apr/2008 " , " may/2008 " ] CairoPlot.dot_line_plot( ' teste2 ' , teste_data_2 , 400 , 300 , h_legend = teste_h_legend , axis = True , grid = True )
Result :
pizza_plot ( )
Function to plot pizza graphics .
pizza_plot ( name , data , width , height , background = None )
name – Name of the desired output file , no need to input the .svg as it will be added at runtim ;
data –
The list , list of lists or dictionary holding the data to be plotted ;
width , height – Dimensions of the output image ;
background – A 3 element tuple representing the rgb color expected for the background .
If left None , a gray to white gradient will be generated ;
Example of Use
teste_data = { " john " : 123 , " mary " : 489 , " philip " : 600 , " suzy " : 235} CairoPlot.pizza_plot( " pizza_teste " , teste_data , 500 , 500 )
Result :
gantt_chart ( )
Function to create Gantt Charts .
Note : the output for this function was based on the graphic seen on this post from wired .
gantt_chart ( name , pieces , width , height , h_legend , v_legend , colors )
name – Name of the desired output file , no need to input the .svg as it will be added at runtim ;
pieces – A list defining the spaces to be drawn .
The user must pass , for each line , the index of its start and the index of its end .
If a line must have two or more spaces , they must be passed inside a list ;
width , height – Dimensions of the output image ;
h_legend – A list of names for each of the vertical lines ;
v_legend – A list of names for each of the horizontal spaces ;
colors – List containing the colors expected for each of the horizontal spaces .
Example of Use
pieces = [ ( 0.5,5.5 ) , [ ( 0,4 ) , ( 6,8 ) ] , ( 5.5,7 ) , ( 7,8 ) ] h_legend = [ ' teste01 ' , ' teste02 ' , ' teste03 ' , ' teste04 ' ] v_legend = [ ' 0001 ' , ' 0002 ' , '0003 ' , '0004 ' , '0005 ' , '0006 ' , '0007 ' , '0008 ' , ' 0009 ' , '0010 ' ] colors = [ ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.0 ) , ( 1.0 , 0.7 , 0.0 ) , ( 1.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) , ( 0.0 , 1.0 , 0.0 ) ] CairoPlot.gantt_chart ( ' gantt_teste ' , pieces , 600 , 300 , h_legend , v_legend , colors )
Result :
So , I think it ’s ready for you guys to use .

An extract from " If London Were Like Venice : Oh ! That It Were ! " by Signor Somers L. Summers Harmsworth 's Magazine , August 1899 , Illustrated by Messrs .
R. Thiele and Co .
" Geologists say that the land upon which London is built has subsided 68 feet during the last 500 years .
This doubtless is traceable to substratiform deposits , lunar attraction , or causes equally occult ; but whatever it is , the figures 68 disarm suspicion .
Assuming that the subsidence is still going on , one can imagine the metropolis some day sinking below Thames level and becoming a second Venice " -- Daily Paper .
BUT did n't you know ? " asked my travelling companion .
" No ! " I answered .
" You see , I left England away back in ' 99 , and I have been virtually cut off from civilisation ever since .
In Siberia the reading of newspapers is not encouraged , and letters , even if you have friends at home to write them , have a way of going astray unrivalled in any other country .
Until I landed in Hull this morning , I had not had occasion to use the English language for years .
So it is little wonder that what you say is surprising news to me . "
" Quite so , " continued the affable gentleman with whom I shared the first - class carriage , " though we have grown so used to it by this time that we almost forget London ever existed in any other form .
Let me see , it must have been in 1910 -- the year of the floods -- that the last subsidence occurred .
It would have come about naturally in time , geologists said , but the climax was certainly precipitated by the Government 's action in allowing London to be undermined to such an extent when the new coal fields were discovered under the city in 1900 .
We had been steadily raising the embankments of the Thames , but the floods swept these away , and one morning we awoke to find our streets converted into waterways .
All manner of remedies were tried , including a Royal Commission , which , by the way , decided only last week that nothing could be done , thus endorsing the public opinion of fifteen years ago .
Of course the lower stories of all houses had to be abandoned , save as diving baths , but it was a simple matter to add others .
Naturally the old street traffic almost vanished , cabs , ' buses , and carts giving place to gondolas and steamboats .
To begin with , we had to import gondoliers from Venice , to instruct our late cabdrivers in their new craft , at the same time adopting many other features peculiar to the Bride of the Adriatic .
These , as you can imagine , have had considerable influence on our customs , our architecture , and even our language . "
There is much more here .
Thanks to a generous anonymous donation , Hudson High ( as we 'll call it ) was finally able to trebuchet themselves into the 21st century .
In addition to buying new computers for the teachers and staff , they found a contractor that would build them the ultimate system to maintain every function in the school , top to bottom .
After a few months the system was built and deployed .
As one of the school 's sysadmins , part of Jason L.'s job was to support the software .
And it did n't take long for his eagerness to learn the software to turn into confusion , and it did n't take long after that for his confusion to turn into horror .
The GUI
They say you only get once chance to make a first impression , and this software totally blew its first impression ( and every subsequent impression thereafter ) .
The GUI ... oh god , the GUI ...
It had one consistent feature across all windows — two ( apparently randomly selected ) retina - burningly bright colors applied as a gradient background .
The top of the window would be , perhaps , the color yellow that you can only see by staring directly at the sun , and it would fade gradually into the color red that you could only see if your eyes were literally on fire .
The developer must have realized that these backgrounds would be pretty distracting , and that the welder 's mask required to view the application made it hard to see the buttons .
So the buttons were assigned even brighter colors , and to make them stand out even further , they 'd blink .
Each screen in the app had two to seven flashing , often unlabeled buttons with no tooltips ( helpfully arranged in ROY G BIV order ) .
If you wanted to know what a button does , hopefully you 're friends with the original developer and can ask him .
Not unlike the basic survival skills everyone should know before entering the wilderness , Jason learned some common techniques to avoid breaking the software .
The first rule he learned was if you see a flashing red button , do NOT click it .
Without confirmation or any way to cancel , it clears the production database and starts you from scratch .
Fortunately , it would only display for administrators .
The software suite was divided into several smaller components : ( as we 'll call them ) InterLunch , InterPunish , InterPresence , and InterGrades .
InterLunch
InterLunch allows students to order their lunches , so long as what they wanted to eat conformed to InterLunch 's standards .
Would you like , say , a slice of pizza , some chips , and a soft drink ?
Tough — you can only order some quantity of one item .
That is , you can buy a hundred slices of pizza if you want , but you have to decide whether you 're going to eat or drink .
And it was built to support only eight food items .
Since eight slots were n't enough to support the 70 + possible combinations of food items up for sale , the school went back to their old pen-and - paper system .
InterPunish
Intended to completely automate the school 's discipline system , InterPunish had a host of features .
" It even has a Detention Wizard , " the programmer once boasted .
The school even updated their disciplinary policies — each offense netted increasing punishments , starting with detentions , then in - school suspensions , expulsions , and finally being forced to stare at the InterPunish UI for a few seconds .
Ultimately , InterPunish did n't work out for the school since they required students to sign demerits , and there was no way to record this in InterPunish .
Using it would 've taken more time and energy than sticking with the old pen-and - paper system , so it was abandoned .
InterPresence
InterPresence was built to replace the pen-and - paper attendance system .
Problem was that it only had two possible states : Present , and ( unexcusedly ) Absent .
Even with doctor 's notes and parental or faculty approval , excused absences were counted against the students .
Eventually they reached a compromise — InterPresence would be used only for Present and unexcused Absences , and for excused absences they'd be marked Present and have the absence recorded on paper .
And after a little while , they completely reverted back to a paper - based system , leaving InterPresence with InterLunch and InterPunish .
InterGrades
This was the key part of the system — the other software was all well and good , but InterGrades was what really mattered .
The goal was to have a single point of entry for all grades for all students , making it easy to pull class averages or drill down to a specific student and see how they were doing .
And it was about as successful as the other products in the suite .
Its first problem was with math .
If I was to ask you what a student 's grade was if she got 95 % on everything she 'd done , what would you say ?
Probably 95 % .
And you'd be right , using Earth math .
But if you use InterGrades 's proprietary math , you 'd realize that the student was actually failing with a grade in the low 30s .
When this was discovered , the school board decreed that all grades be recorded in the old pen-and - paper gradebooks .
The Backend
These applications were built on an Access database , and the quirks of dealing with the database first appeared during installation .
Specifically , the database path was case - sensitive , despite it being a Windows application .
It also had to be in the first subfolder of a root folder on a network share , no exceptions .
And the subfolder has to start with a dollar sign .
And much like confirming your email address or password , the installer required that you enter the same path twice for verification .
Updates are handled like so :
User clicks an irritating blinky button InterWhatever downloads the entire database onto the user 's computer User makes changes
Wait for the database to be available with no other users editing and download again Merge the user 's changes back in If the database was changed while attempting this , go back to step four Upload the modified database
This made things get real interesting at the end of the semester .
With thirty teachers and a 100 MB database , ( 300 MB per request ) , it did n't take long for the network to go down .
Going Dark
Each product in the suite had one thing in common with all of the other products in the suite — the seizure - inducing UI and being completely useless .
The developer genuinely wanted a happy client , however , and promised free data updates and support for ( the rest of his ) life if the school promised to test it in a production environment .
And shortly after making that promise , he disappeared .
It was total radio silence ; ignored emails , unreturned pages , unanswered calls .
Not only that , but he does n't even live at the same place anymore .
The school tried and tried to make the most out of the software , but every product was completely useless to them .
After blowing over $ 10,000 on the project just to go back to pen-and - paper , the board decided to do a gradual rollout of a commercially - developed web - based suite .
And although the new software is working great , it does n't have the neon gradient / blinky button UI they 'd grown accustomed to .
Mended Spiderweb # 19 ( Laundry Line )
C-print , 20 x 30 inches , 1998
The Mended Spiderweb series
The Mended Spiderweb series came about during a six - week period in June and July in 1998 which I spent on Pörtö .
In the forest and around the house where I was living , I searched for broken spiderwebs which I repaired using red sewing thread .
All of the patches were made by inserting segments one at a time directly into the web .
Sometimes the thread was starched , which made it stiffer and easier to work with .
The short threads were held in place by the stickiness of the spider web itself ; longer threads were reinforced by dipping the tips into white glue .
I fixed the holes in the web until it was fully repaired , or until it could no longer bear the weight of the thread .
In the process , I often caused further damage when the tweezers got tangled in the web or when my hands brushed up against it by accident .
The morning after the first patch job , I discovered a pile of red threads lying on the ground below the web .
At first I assumed the wind had blown them out ; on closer inspection it became clear that the spider had repaired the web to perfect condition using its own methods , throwing the threads out in the process .
My repairs were always rejected by the spider and discarded , usually during the course of the night , even in webs which looked abandoned .
The larger , more complicated patches where the threads were held together with glue often retained their form after being thrown out , although in a somewhat " wilted " condition without the rest of the web to suspend and stretch them .
Each " Rejected Patch " is shown next to the photograph showing the web with the patch as it looked on site .
A video called GIFT / GIFT was part of the suite of works as well .
The Huffington Post and Talking Points Memo , in particular , have already become a persistent problem for McCain ’s campaign .
GOP losing the new - media war
Republicans have no lack of would - be George F. Wills .
But what they really need are some more Robert D. Novaks .

The distinction between the two prominent conservative journalists is n't always obvious , but it 's nevertheless important to understand :
One almost exclusively writes opinion pieces , while the other offers reporting with a point of view .
The same might be said of the emerging differences between the conservative presence on the Internet and the liberal one :
The right is engaged in the business of opining while the left features sites that offer a more reportorial model .
At first glance , these divergent approaches might not seem consequential .
But as the 2008 campaign progresses , it ’s becoming increasingly clear that the absence of any websites on the right devoted to reporting — as opposed to just commenting on the news — is proving politically costly to Republicans .
While conservatives are devoting much of their Internet energy to analysis , their counterparts on the left are taking advantage of the rise of new media to create new institutions devoted to unearthing stories , putting new information into circulation and generally crowding the space traditionally taken by traditional media .
And it almost always comes at the expense of GOP politicians .
While online Republicans chase the allure of punditry and commentary , Democrats and progressives are pursuing old - fashioned shoe - leather reporting , in a fashion reminiscent of 2004 .
Back then , the Drudge Report and other lesser - known conservative portals played a key role in defining John Kerry and pushing back against criticism of George W. Bush , such as when conservative bloggers debunked documents purportedly related to the president ’s Air National Guard service .
Just as Drudge and critics of the now - infamous “ 60 Minutes ” report on Bush were able to push stories damaging to Kerry or beneficial to Bush into the mainstream media , liberal online organs are now doing the same , to the detriment of GOP presidential nominee John McCain .
This week , for example , a young liberal writer named Spencer Ackerman heard that McCain committed a gaffe on Iraq in an unaired portion of an interview with CBS anchor Katie Couric .
Ackerman , a former reporter for The New Republic and The American Prospect who now blogs at the liberal Firedoglake site , posted the transcript and pointed out the relevant portion just after 5:00 p.m. Tuesday night .
It was picked up by the Huffington Post two hours later , discussed on Keith Olbermann ’s MSNBC show , moved onto The Associated Press wire overnight and by Wednesday afternoon McCain was forced to respond .
“ We amplify its effect and then stay on it , ” explains Arianna Huffington , namesake of the popular liberal news and entertainment hub .
But the left is n’t simply promoting its own version of the news — it ’s also breaking it .
Deploying writers with backgrounds grounded in journalism rather than politics , The Huffington Post and Talking Points Memo , in particular , have already become a persistent problem for McCain ’s campaign , regularly posting negative opposition research and embarrassing videos in addition to advancing damaging story lines against the GOP nominee .
There is simply no equivalent on the right to these two liberal - leaning websites .
The challenge these sites present have become so apparent that McCain was forced to hire his own in - house blogger to ensure dissemination of a steady stream of anti-Barack Obama material , much of it culled from the campaign ’s extensive research file .
Michael Goldfarb , a former reporter at the Weekly Standard , almost exclusively uses his blog on McCain ’s website to target the Democratic nominee in the hopes mainstream reporters will link to or pick up the oppo he ’s posting .
To be sure , neither of the two liberal - leaning sites — referred to online as TPM and HuffPo — have yet to break the next Watergate story this campaign .
But every day , there comes a steady drip .
It ranges from the amusing ( reporting that McCain ’s campaign lifted recipes from the Food Network while he ’s giving a major economic speech ) to the strategic ( popping up research on McCain ’s opposition to a bill that included wind energy incentives when he ’s about to give a speech at a turbine facility ) to the eyebrow - raising ( disclosing that Mitt Romney said at a private meeting that he would not likely appoint a Muslim Cabinet member ) .
In some cases , the stories incrementally move the anti-McCain message forward ( by flagging an off - message Iraq statement by a McCain surrogate , for example ) .
In others , the reporting scores broadside hits that inflict notable damage ( such as posting controversial audio of the Rev. John Hagee that would prompt McCain to finally renounce the pastor ) .
Add in the increasingly aggressive online efforts of liberal think tanks such as the Center for American Progress , and it leaves the right at a severe disadvantage in the high - stakes business of distributing information about favored candidates and the opposition .
“ It ’s something we have to get in gear on , ” says Patrick Ruffini , the Bush campaign ’s webmaster in 2004 and former RNC ecampaign director .
“ What drives discussion in the blogosphere is original information . ”
The lack of any meaningful right - wing entities today is partly because of how left and right media outlets sprung up , he says .
“ Liberal media has traditionally been upstream media , generating information and putting it into circulation .
Conservative media is downstream ; it ’s the second bite at the apple . ”
For years , says New York Times columnist David Brooks , the model for conservatives who developed a passion for writing ( or vice - versa ) was not a reporter but a commentator : National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr .
Besides being attracted to his elegant language and compelling arguments , up - and - coming conservatives saw something else in Buckley : job stability .
“ In the past 60 years , only one employee of the National Review , Weekly Standard or any conservative magazine has actually been hired as a reporter for a newspaper , ” says Brooks , who researched the question a few years ago .
At the same time , scores of young reporters from liberal - leaning journals such as The New Republic or The Washington Monthly have been called up to the journalistic big leagues by general interest newspapers and magazines .
“ There is just no career line for a conservative reporter , ” observes Brooks .
Further , prominent conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh and Michelle Malkin have prospered by seizing upon the sense of grievance conservatives have felt toward the mainstream media .
Liberals , on the other hand , responded to their own disenchantment with the media and the Bush era by channeling their anger into the creation of parallel reporting outlets geared toward doing what old - line news outlets purportedly were n’t doing .
This development just happened to take place right when the mood matched empowering new technologies , enabling new players who would have found it impossible to break through under the old media model .
“ It ’s fair to say that the mainstream media … was increasingly either neutral or effectively browbeaten by the right , ” says Josh Marshall , the founder and editor of Talking Points Memo .
The powerful presence of Limbaugh on the radio airwaves and the ascendance of Fox News on cable television energized liberals , Marshall says .
“ People on the center - left , especially in the lead - up to the Iraq war and after the 2000 recount , realized that there was nothing on that side of equation , ” he adds .
The result was the emergence of TPM and HuffPo , along with the opinion - and organizing - centered Daily Kos .
“ Republicans have n’t developed a lot of that infrastructure because they have n’t been forced to , ” says Michael Turk , a former ecampaign director at the RNC .
But Turk and others say that must change — and the GOP might soon find the impetus .
“ If Republicans are out of power , they ’ll start to realize this is one of the things we need to do to rebuild , ” he says .
A writer for TPM puts it more bluntly .
“ If Obama gets in , we 'll see a lot of this stuff spring up , probably following the same initial pattern as the lefty Netroots , ” predicts Eric Kleefield .
“ First it 's a bunch of nobodies with dingy websites doing the equivalent of writing profanity on bathroom walls .
And then it will evolve into some kind of real organization and discourse , and with its own journalism . ”
While there is no real national site , Erick Erickson , founder of the popular RedState , points out that there is some reporting taking place on conservative blogs in Minnesota and Colorado .
“ The next major wave of conservative funding will be toward journalistic institutions , ” he says hopefully .
But for now , Erickson concedes that most potential angel funders are hesitant to bankroll a start - up , still gun-shy after many websites have flopped and skeptical that a right - wing version of HuffPo or TPM would be taken seriously by established media organs .
Conservatives have not been able to obtain the sort of financing that has powered the two sites — for HuffPo , it ’s venture capital ; for TPM , initially it was reader contributions but is increasingly advertisements .
Amidst the inertia on the right , HuffPo and TPM are not only prospering but growing .
Both major liberal sites have added new elements for this election , and the proprietors for each are already thinking past 2008 .
Huffington said in the site 's next round of financing , to take place later this year , she ’ll hire more reporters .
Each promises that , even if Obama wins in November , they ’ll keep up the scrutiny .
“ If you want to break stories or report the news , you cannot do it only from your political views , ” says Huffington , citing the ironic case of their most significant splash to date : Obama 's comments , reported by an Obama donor , concerning the presumptive nominee ’s assessment of the psyche of rural America .
“ I think if Obama wins , people will see that we ’re fundamentally a news organization , ” adds Marshall .
“ We ’d cover an Obama administration equally as aggressively .
People will believe it when they see it , but that ’s what we plan to do . ”

IT'S OFFICIAL : THE BEAR HAS ARRIVED .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average last week qualified for the widely accepted definition of a bear market of a 20 % drop from the highs .
The good news is that once the decline reaches that arbitrary 20 % mark , based on history , the market has suffered most of its losses .
The bad news is that the decline typically drags on for some time , and time may be the worst enemy .
Investors may initially try to grab erstwhile highfliers that have crashed and burned but rarely regain their former status .
And as the decline wears down investors ' psyches , they tend to bail out at the market 's nadir , when things look bleakest -- and when the greatest opportunities present themselves .
The post -1940 average bear market ( as defined by the Standard & Poor 's 500 index ) produced a decline of 30.4 % from a peak that took 386 days to reach its trough , according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group .
By the time the market was down the requisite 20 % , the average bear market was 74 % completed .
Based on those averages , the bear market would have another 118 days to run and would face losses of another 14 % from current levels .
Rarely does the market get a short , sharp shock , as in 1987 , when the bear market lasted just 101 days -- with most of the total damage of 22.51 % done on Black Monday , Oct. 19 .
The longest march downward was the 1973 - 74 decline , which took 630 days and sliced 48.2 % off the S&P .
BUT BESPOKE DEFINES two separate bear markets following the bursting of the technology bubble -- an initial 36.77 % drop from March 2000 to September 2001 , punctuated by a brief , post - 9/11 recovery until the next decline of January - July 2002 of 31.97 % .
In the minds of most investors who suffered through that period , it was three long years of false starts and frustration until the recovery really got under way , in March 2003 .
Signs of bear - market fatigue already are becoming evident .
Investors have yanked more than $ 80.4 billion from domestic equity funds in the past 12 months , according to Investment Company Institute data parsed by Bianco Research .
Overseas funds drew $ 75.7 billion from American mutual - fund investors , leaving a net equity fund outflow of $ 4.7 billion .
What 's more , there have been few hiding places other than commodities , observes Jack A. Ablin , chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank .
Even Warren Buffett is n't immune , with Berkshire Hathaway ( ticker : BRKA ) off 21 % from its peak .
The foreign stocks Americans have been flocking to lost nearly as much as U.S. equities , despite help from the falling dollar .
The MSCI EAFE , the benchmark for developed markets outside the U.S. , suffered a negative 10.58 % total return in the first half , according to Bianco Research , compared with a negative 11.91 % for the S&P .
Emerging markets were slightly worse than the EAFE , with a negative 11.64 % return , according to MSCI 's measure .
Even the once hotter - than - hot China market has gone into a deep - freeze ; the iShares FTSE / Xinhua exchange - traded fund ( FXI ) , a popular way for Americans to play that market , is down 43 % from its high last October .
Bonds other than Treasuries lost money in the first half , especially corporates , junk bonds and municipals .
Meanwhile , the Dow Jones - AIG Commodity Index returned 27.23 % in the first six months of 2008 .
Yet there 's little prospect for relief in the near term , especially as the second - quarter earnings reporting season is about to kick off .
Despite its near 20 % retreat , the S&P 500 remains too high relative to prospective earnings , says Ablin .
Even though analysts have slashed their 2008 earnings forecasts to just 5.8 % gains from 15 % at the beginning of the year , he thinks they 're still too optimistic .
Based on his estimated profit gains this year of 3 % , and an earnings yield ( the inverse of the price - earnings multiple ) equal to triple - B corporate bonds ' 6.8 % , Ablin 's model indicates the S&P should shed another 5 % .
But others see the current decline as another phase in a longer - term secular bear market .
" We are still in the super bear of 2000 , " asserts Jeremy Grantham , chairman of money manager GMO .
In a bear market , stocks fall back to , or below , their long - term trend line .
But after the great bull market from 1982 to 2000 , equities never flushed out their excesses " because of the Greenspan - inspired chain of bubbles , from growth stocks to real estate to commodities , " referring to former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan .
" Great bear markets always take their time , and the most likely end is 2010 , " Grantham continues .
If the S&P 500 were to fall to 1100 in 2010 , that would be about a 13 % decline from here , about 1263 , and would put the index back on its long - term trend line .
He adds : " Chances are we will overshoot on the downside .
We always do .
We will be lucky if it is 1100 . "
Like Tolstoy 's unhappy families , every bear market is different , observes John De-Gulis , a portfolio manager at the Sound Shore Fund .
Citing data from Ned Davis Research , he notes that the S&P has been down an average of 4.83 % six months after the start of a recession and up 3.15 % 12 months on .
" Of course , we have n't entered the recession officially yet , " he adds , which may happen late this year or early 2009 .
But , he adds , " the two recessions where the market was down big time 12 months after the recession started were ' 73 , minus 27 % , and ' 81 , down 18 % -- both periods when oil prices spiked . "
What seems consistent among bear markets is the tendency of investors to despair in their later stages , dumping everything indiscriminately .
For instance , Bespoke Investment found that in the early stages of a decline , from the peak to the down - 20 % bear print , the traditional defensive redoubts -- consumer staples and health care -- hold up relatively well , shedding about 4 % each .
But after the bear market becomes " official " at minus 20 % , the two actually do slightly worse through the rest of the decline -- down 11.6 % for consumer staples and down 13.9 % for health care , versus minus 10 % for the S&P at that stage , as investors tend to dump anything and everything .
There 's no surprise about what did best during past bear markets tracked by Bespoke .
During the first phase on the way to the minus - 20 % mark , gold prices were virtually unchanged while oil was up 18.7 % .
Bond yields , as measured by the 10 - year Treasury , actually were up by about 7 % in the early phase , which would result in negative returns .
But after the S&P was down 20 % , gold gained an average of 6.6 % , oil was up 19 % , and bond yields were down 0.5 % for a positive return .
WHAT'S LESS CLEAR IS what will be the signal leader when a new bull phase starts .
Rarely , however , is it the group that led the previous advance .
Energy stocks , for instance , did not return to the lead position until the recent bull run , about a quarter century after their last heyday .
After the dot - com bust , technology stocks did not take the lead in the subsequent bull market ; indeed , the Nasdaq recovered only a bit more than half its decline from its bubble peak of 5048 .
The late bull market was , of course , led by financial stocks -- on the way up as well as down .
Critics charge that was because the Fed slashed rates too far , to 1 % at their low , and kept them too low for too long .
This effectively free money fueled the subprime mortgage bubble and bust , which reverberated throughout the credit markets and eventually led to the emergency rescue of Bear Stearns in March .
But after numerous declarations that the worst of the credit crisis is over , and with the latest round of " kitchen sink " write - downs of bad assets by banks and brokers , few pros at this point want to bottom - pick in financials .
" I know what I do n't want to own , " says David Sowerby , portfolio manager of Loomis Sayles -- " toxic subprimes , " which one day will be " great trades , " but not yet .
Bank stocks are nowhere near as cheap as in the early '90s , contends Frederic Marks , president of Cheviot Value Management , which manages $ 236 million in separate accounts .
For instance , Wells Fargo ( WFC ) had been cut in half by the fall of 1990 to just 75 % of its book value .
Today , Wells ' shares trade for closer to 1.75 times book , and book values are less than certain , given the potential for write - downs .
Wells traded in 1990 at about six to seven times its long - term earnings power ( not that year 's published earnings ) , compared with 12 times long - term earnings today .
Despite the ongoing housing woes and credit strains , inflation has moved to the top of the Fed 's worry list .
So , too , with the stock market .
" The critical variable lies with the [ consumer - price index ] .
It 's the biggest driver of the market multiple for the S&P 500 , " says Francois Trahan , strategist with ISI Group .
He adds that if gains in the CPI slacken in the second half , " then multiples start to expand .
Some 80 % looks great , like rents and wages , but 20 % -- oil and food and import prices -- looks horrible .
If commodities just level off , then the CPI will come down . "
On that score , the Economic Cycle Research Institute 's Future Inflation Gauge , a leading indicator for the CPI , fell to a four - year low in June .
WITH CRUDE SOARING past $ 145 a barrel and prices at the gas pump well past $ 4 a gallon , investor and consumer psychology is the glummest in decades .
So much so , in fact , that the market might be setting itself up for a short - term trading bounce , says Woody Dorsey , proprietor of Market Semiotics .
It would be akin to the short - lived rebound from the March lows following the passing of the Bear Stearns phase of the credit crisis .
Marks of Cheviot , who says his composite portfolio of client accounts is up 4 % in the past 12 months ' 13 % slide in the S&P , has had one - third in precious metals and other vehicles that benefit when the dollar or the market declines , one - third in cash , and one - third in strong U.S. companies not tied to the domestic economy .
Two exceptions are Wal - Mart Stores ( WMT ) , " which is one of our largest holdings a couple of years running because of our thesis that buyers will be more price conscious and will be more attracted than ever to this store . "
Another retailer Cheviot has been buying recently is Walgreen ( WAG ) , says Marks , because " two - thirds of its revenues are from pharmacy sales , the company is enormously profitable with zero debt , and its shares are as cheap as they 've been in well over a decade . "
Down , but Not There Yet : Despite being down 8.2 % in June and nearly 20 % from its peak , the S&P 500 remains overvalued by 5 % reckons Jack Ablin of Harris Private Bank , given 2008 earnings estimates that are " unrealistically " high .
BCA Research 's Global Investment Strategy Weekly Bulletin advises subscribers to batten down the hatches to ride out the " perfect storm " resulting from spiking oil prices by reducing equities and boosting bonds , especially European securities .
( The SPDR Lehman International Treasury Bond ETF [ BWX ] provides exposure to foreign government bonds . )
" This latest oil surge is canceling out the impact of the Federal Reserve 's policy easing , crippling economic growth and causing share prices to relapse , " writes Chen Zhao , BCA 's managing editor .
It is no time for heroics , he adds .
The key to surviving bear markets is capital preservation , concludes GMO 's Grantham .
You want to " live to fight another day .
You may see amazingly cheap asset opportunities in the next couple of years as distressed pricing might become more commonplace .
It would be nice to have the money to take advantage . "
Two Toronto police officers were arrested this morning in connection with what investigators call a large - scale operation to produce and distribute marijuana and launder the proceeds .
The two , were taken into custody this morning along with 21 other people .
Const . Kevin Bourne , of 51 Division , has nine years of service .
Const . Patrick Lee , of 31 Division , has been on the force for eight years .
If they are released on bail , Police Chief Bill Blair said today , they will be suspended from their duties with pay .
" It 's a betrayal of all the hard working decent men and women in this service , " he said at a press conference this afternoon .
" It 's a huge disappointment to us as a group . ”
After a lengthy investigation , police executed 63 search warrants around 6 a.m. , taking 23 people into custody , seizing $ 60,000 in cash , 17 pounds of marijuana and smaller amounts of other drugs including ecstasy .
Detectives have implicated the two police officers , three correctional officers , a real estate agent and others in the scheme .
It ’s alleged the “ elaborate ” operation had been ongoing for at least two years .
The police investigation lasted several months before the raids were launched .
The accused were scheduled to appear in a Newmarket court Friday .
Police said the investigation is continuing .
With files from Canadian Press
Army auditors had determined that KBR lacked credible data or records for more than $ 1 billion in spending , so Mr. Smith refused to sign off on the payments to the company .
“ They had a gigantic amount of costs they could n’t justify , ” he said in an interview .
“ Ultimately , the money that was going to KBR was money being taken away from the troops , and I was n’t going to do that . ”
But he was suddenly replaced , he said , and his successors — after taking the unusual step of hiring an outside contractor to consider KBR ’s claims — approved most of the payments he had tried to block .
So an Army official was overseeing the KBR ( company motto : " Rape ?
I do n't see any evidence of Rape . " ) account , and came across a few charges that seemed a bit off .
They did n't have the proper documentation for them , or , well , any documentation .
Of course , it was a minor amount -- just $ 1 billion -- but the Army official decided he should probably deny payment , given that the charges , you know , were n't supported by facts .
So -- funny story -- the guy got fired
I 'm sure it 's just a total coincidence that KBR is a spinoff from Halliburton , the company once helmed by Darth Crashcart , also known as Dick Cheney .
Of course , the Army says there 's a perfectly reasonable explanation : KBR blackmailed 'em .
Army officials [...] said that KBR had warned that if it was not paid , it would reduce payments to subcontractors , which in turn would cut back on services .
“ You have to understand the circumstances at the time , ” said Jeffrey P. Parsons , executive director of the Army Contracting Command .
“ We could not let operational support suffer because of some other things . ”
Yeah !
I mean , it 's totally reasonable that an American company would sabotage American troops because of a billing dispute , and there 's no way that this could be resolved , other than to simply pay $ 1 billion in taxpayer money to a company that probably did n't do anything to earn it .
Fortunately , there are people other than me who are n't stunned by this revelation :
When told of Mr. Smith ’s account , Representative Henry A. Waxman , the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said it “ is startling , and it confirms the committee ’s worst fears .
KBR has repeatedly gouged the taxpayer , and the Bush administration has looked the other way every time . ”
Well , duh , Congressman !
I mean , if the Bushies did n't look the other way , that might eat into profits .
And that would be the worst possible outcome for our glorious Iraq adventure .
UPDATE : As Hilzoy helpfully reminds us , this is one of many reasons why the rush to privatize the military was really bad for the country .
From BusinessWeek : The Next Real Estate Crisis
[ T ]he next wave of foreclosures will begin accelerating in April , 2009 .
... hundreds of thousands of borrowers who took out so - called option adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) will begin to see their monthly payments skyrocket as they reset .
...
According to Credit Suisse , monthly option recasts are expected to accelerate starting in April , 2009 , from $ 5 billion to a peak of about $ 10 billion in January , 2010 .
...
The loans automatically recast after five years , but many will recast sooner as loan balances hit specific principal caps — typically between 110 % and 125 % of the initial loan amount .
Click on image for Business Week graph in new window .
[ Once the loan hits the principal ceiling ] , the loan must become a fully amortizing loan — no more minimum payment allowed , all payments must be sufficient to pay all interest due and sufficient principal to amortize the loan over the remaining term .
The percent of original balance limitation , in other words , marks the day that neg am is no longer an option for the borrower , and the loan has to start paying down principal from here on out — the borrower is “ caught up , ” and never again allowed to “ get behind . ”
...
Note that the loan remains an ARM , even though it is now no longer a neg am ARM .
That means that the borrower ’s payment can still increase or decrease at future rate change dates .
It will simply be , from here on out , an increase or decrease from one fully - amortizing payment to a new fully - amortizing payment .
emphasis added
This graph from Credit Suisse ( via Business Week ) makes a key point .
Many of the Option ARMs will recast sooner than originally scheduled , because the loan amount will have hit the principal ceiling ( usually 110 % of the original loan amount ) .
Tanta explained this in Negative Amortization for UberNerds
What matters for the housing market is the gray bars - and we are just starting to see the impact on delinquencies of homeowners moving from NegAm payments to fully amortizing payments on their Option ARMs .
And , finally , the blue bars tell us when these homeowners obtained their loans - usually 5 years before the scheduled recast .
Since the peak is in 2011 , we know that most of these homeowners bought or refinanced from 2005 through early 2007 .
Therefore , with falling house prices , most of these homeowners are underwater ( owe more than their homes are worth ) , and selling or refinancing will not be a viable alternatives .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil rose on Monday , led by gains in natural gas and refined products at the start of the U.S. hurricane season .
U.S. crude settled up 41 cents at $ 127.76 a barrel , off session lows of $ 125.22 .
London Brent rose 24 cents to $ 128.02 .
“ There ’s a big ( crude ) rally here , fueled by natgas , with fund money coming in , ” said Tom Knight , trader at Truman Arnold in Texarkana , Texas .
Oil gained along with natural gas prices , which rallied up 4 percent as the start of the U.S. hurricane season stirred concerns that storms could cut oil and natural gas production and shut refineries along the Gulf of Mexico .
Forecasters have called for an active storm season , although Arthur , the Atlantic basin ’s first storm this year , quickly dissipated after forming over the weekend .
Oil rallied back from early losses after an Iraqi official said the country expected to boost oil exports this month to a new post - war high of about 2.2 million barrels per day ( bpd ) -- about 130,000 barrels a day higher than in May .
Pressure also came from early strength in the dollar against the euro after a survey showed stronger - than - expected U.S. manufacturing activity in May .
Investors have flocked into oil and other commodities this year as a hedge against the weaker dollar and rising inflation , helping to push oil to record highs above $ 135 a barrel in May and raising concerns that high prices could hurt consumer nations ’ economies and clip demand .
The head of the U.S. Energy Information Administration , Guy Caruso , told the Reuters Global Energy Summit that prices could hold above $ 100 a barrel at least through 2009 and that U.S. gasoline prices could hit new highs during the summer holiday driving season .
“ If the crude oil prices stay around $ 120 , $ 125 , it looks like ( gasoline ) might be somewhere in the $ 4.10 area , ” Caruso said .
Caruso said faltering oil production growth from nations outside of OPEC was keeping supply struggling to keep pace with demand , adding he expected demand from No. 2 consumer China to continue to boom even after the Olympics .
Oil prices have jumped six - fold since 2002 as supply gains lag demand growth from emerging economies such as China , sparking fuel protests across the globe .
Demand in consuming nations such as the United States and Britain has already showed signs of slipping due to rising fuel costs , and some analysts are concerned demand in some Asian countries could be hit as governments cut subsidies .
A Reuters poll of analysts ahead of the weekly government inventory data due out Wednesday forecast a 1.1 million barrel gain in crude inventories , a 1.4 million barrel build in distillates stocks and a 600,000 barrel build in gasoline .
Speculators cut their net long positions in crude oil to 25,867 in the week to May 27 , the lowest level since late August and down from 50,060 in the previous week , data released by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) showed last week .
SAN ANGELO , Texas ( CNN ) --
The state of Texas should not have removed children from a polygamist sect 's ranch because it did n't prove that they were in " imminent danger , " an appeals court ruled Thursday .
Photos from a Web site launched by the sect show scenes during and after the raid of their ranch .
In the ruling , a three - judge panel did not order that the children be returned to their families on the Yearning for Zion Ranch in Eldorado , Texas .
Instead , the judges gave the lower court 10 days to vacate an order placing the children in state custody .
" The existence of the FLDS belief system as described by the department 's witnesses , by itself , does not put children of FLDS parents in physical danger , " the judges said .
More than 450 children were removed from their homes last month on the Yearning for Zion Ranch , which is owned by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints , a Mormon offshoot that practices polygamy .
In its ruling , the Texas 3rd District Court of Appeals decided in favor of 38 women who had appealed a lower court judge 's decision that the children remain in state custody .
Although the ruling applies only to the children of the 38 mothers represented in this case , a lawyer for the women said the Court of Appeals ' reasoning would apply to all of the children who were removed from their homes .
" It is a great day for families in the state of Texas , " said Julie Balovich of Texas RioGrande Legal Aid .
Watch Balovich and the FLDS mothers react to the ruling »
Members of the YFZ community said they were " extremely grateful " for the court 's ruling , but acknowledged the long road ahead .
The state can still appeal the decision or renew the investigation .
" I 'd like to see the children in my arms before I rejoice greatly , " said Maggie Jessop , who has two girls and two boys in state custody across Texas .
Jessop told CNN's Larry King that the experience had traumatized her children , whom she has visited several times since they went into foster care .
" They feel betrayed by adults , and they 're hurting very badly , " Jessop said .
The parents said they had spent the last few weeks zigzagging across the state to visit their children , who were taken from the sprawling 1,700 - acre ranch on April 3 .
" You can see it 's a lot of stress on them , " Edson Jessop said , referring to his three boys and girl .
" Every time we leave , they go through that trauma again .
It 's enough to rip your heart out . "
State officials told CNN they were reviewing the ruling .
" We are trying to assess the impact this may have on our case and what our next steps will be , " child welfare spokesman Patrick Crimmins said in a written statement .
" Our office is confident that [ the ] state 's lawyers will review the appropriate next steps in this case to ensure the safety and welfare of the children involved , " Krista Piferrer , spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry , said in a written statement .
The law grants the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services the authority to take emergency possession of a child if authorities have reason to suspect that there is an " immediate danger to the physical health or safety , " warranting their immediate removal .
According to the ruling , the department obtained an emergency order to take custody of the children based on reports from a hot line caller who said she had been raped and impregnated on the ranch .
The girl , who claimed to be 16 , reported that she had an 8 - month - old baby and was pregnant again , and that she was married to Dale Barlow , who abused her physically and sexually .
Lawyers for the 38 mothers said authorities used those allegations to draw broader inferences about the practices and beliefs of all the sect members .
After interviewing five minors who were or had been pregnant , CPS removed all of the children , based on the assumption that the community 's belief system allowed minor females to marry and bear children , lawyers for the women argued .
" The department 's lead investigator was of the opinion that due to the ' pervasive belief system ' of the FLDS , the male children are groomed to be perpetrators of sexual abuse and the girls are raised to be victims of sexual abuse , " the ruling noted .
Watch CNN 's Sunny Hostin explain the ruling »
After the state took custody of the children , the mothers appealed the order on the grounds the department failed to establish that the need for protection was urgent .
Because no such proof was presented , the mothers argued that the district court , which backed the raid , abused its discretion and was obligated to return the children to their parents .
The appeals panel agreed .
" Evidence that children raised in this particular environment may someday have their physical health and safety threatened is not evidence that the danger is imminent enough to warrant invoking the extreme measure of immediate removal prior to full litigation of the issue , " the panel wrote .
Watch how the ruling favors FLDS »
Furthermore , the court said , CPS did not make any reasonable effort to determine if measures other than removal would have reduced the perceived risk to the children .
Outside the courthouse , Balovich said it was " ridiculous " how the courts had ignored the parents ' rights .
" It was about time a court stood up and said that what has been happening to these families is wrong , " she said .
Surrounded by the FLDS mothers represented in the case , Balovich said authorities considered the YFZ Ranch one household , an assertion with which the appeals court did not agree .
Therefore , proving that there was abuse in one household did not mean the state could apply that behavior to the entire ranch .
" This was the right decision , " Balovich said , adding that she and her clients are " ecstatic about this news . "
The ruling noted other deficiencies in the Department 's investigation .
The authenticity of the initial abuse reports that turned authorities ' attention on the ranch is in question , the court noted in its ruling .
Police have alleged that a family shelter crisis line received multiple calls March 29 and 30 from a caller claiming to be Sarah Jessop Barlow , age 16 .
At least one of the telephones used by " Sarah Barlow " has been traced to a Colorado woman .
Police say Rozita Swinton is a person of interest in connection with the reports of abuse at the ranch , but she has not been charged .
She does , however , face a charge of providing a false report to authorities in a Colorado case .
Court hearings in the FLDS case resumed Monday , with hearings in several courtrooms to accommodate lawyers for the children .
The hearings were held so the parties could review " family service plans " dictating the parameters under which FLDS parents can regain custody of their children .
FLDS members have denied any physical or sexual abuse takes place , and maintain they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs .
The sect 's leader , Warren Jeffs , is in a Utah prison after being convicted on charges of being an accomplice to rape in connection with a marriage he performed in 2001 .
Jeffs also faces trial in Arizona on charges stemming from arranged marriages involving FLDS teens .

Subject : domestic violenceIn 1971 I opened the first refuge in the world in Chiswick , London .
I said then that domestic violence is a learned pattern of behaviour in early childhood .
I also explained that boys and girls exposed to violent and dysfunctional parents often internalise the parent ’s behaviour and go on to also lead violent and dysfunctional lives .
Unfortunately at that time the feminist movement was looking for a cause and funding .
They had a feminist / Marxist focus on domestic violence that claimed that all men ( patriarchy ) were guilty of violence towards women and children .
They also claimed that the family and marriage was a dangerous place for women and that the ‘ new ’ family in the future would consist of women and their children .
Men and fathers were expendable .
Unfortunately in the Western world we have seen the damage that has been done to family life in our countries .
The Shelter movement particularly in America has totally ignored the plight of boys and men who can also be exposed to domestic violence .
Men are banned from working in the shelters and often boys over the age of twelve are denied access with their mothers and siblings .
No men can sit on the Boards of these Shelters .
In the early years I toured America on many occasions begging audiences not to create a movement hostile to men , fathers and boys .
I failed .

Please reconsider your ideas .
To export what is a crude feminist ideology to the rest of the world does your country and yourself a great disservice .
The roots of domestic violence lie in our parenting .
If we educate parents about the dangers of behaving violently towards their children - we will change the course of those children ’s lives .
Both mothers and fathers can be violent - we need to acknowledge this .
Domestic violence is not a gender issue .
It affects us all .

Netherlands took a firm grip on Euro 2008 ’s so - called “ Group of Death ” by winning a classic encounter with Italy .
Ruud van Nistelrooy put the Dutch ahead in controversial circumstances after 26 minutes when he scored from close range – but also from an offside position .
Wesley Sneijder swept in a second from Dirk Kuyt ’s header five minutes later .
Edwin van der
Sar then denied Italy with stunning saves from Fabio Grosso and Andrea Pirlo before Giovanni van Bronckhorst headed in after 78 minutes .
First Half
Second Half
The ruling on Thursday focused in large part on the centuries old writ of habeas corpus ( “ you have the body , ” in Latin ) , a means by which prisoners can challenge their incarceration .
Noting that the Constitution provides for suspension of the writ only in times of rebellion or invasion , Justice Kennedy called it “ an indispensable mechanism for monitoring the separation of powers . ”
In the years - long debate over the treatment of detainees , some critics of administration policy have asserted that those held at Guantánamo have fewer rights than people accused of crimes under American civilian and military law and that they are trapped in a sort of legal limbo .
Justice Kennedy wrote that the cases involving the detainees “ lack any precise historical parallel .
They involve individuals detained by executive order for the duration of a conflict that , if measure from September 11 , 2001 , to the present , is already among the longest wars in American history . ”
The detainees at the center of the case decided on Thursday are not all typical of the people confined at Guantánamo .
True , the majority were captured in Afghanistan or Pakistan .
But the man who gave the case its title , Lakhdar Boumediene , is one of six Algerians who immigrated to Bosnia in the 1990 ’s and were legal residents there .
They were arrested by Bosnian police within weeks of the Sept. 11 attacks on suspicion of plotting to attack the United States embassy in Sarajevo  “ plucked from their homes , from their wives and children , ” as their lawyer , Seth P. Waxman , a former solicitor general put it in the argument before the justices on Dec. 5 .
The Supreme Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ordered them released three months later for lack of evidence , whereupon the Bosnian police seized them and turned them over to the United States military , which sent them to Guantánamo .
Mr. Waxman argued before the United States Supreme Court that the six Algerians did not fit any authorized definition of enemy combatant , and therefore ought to be released .
The head of the New York - based Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents dozens of prisoners at Guantánamo , hailed the ruling .
“ The Supreme Court has finally brought an end to one of our nation ’s most egregious injustices , ” Vincent Warren , the organization ’s executive director , told The Associated Press .

The impacts of an abusive health care system RAW STORY
Published : Sunday July 6 , 2008
Print This Email This Kathy Hund 's son Milo has autism .
To pay for mounting health costs and insurance premiums , she and her family sold their car , cashed in their 401k and retirement funds , sold their furniture and eventually were forced to declare bankruptcy in order to save their house .
Mere months later , Hund and family were forced to sell their home and move into a rental property .
Yet in spite of these sacrifices , she still has immense difficulty procuring proper treatment for 6 - year - old Milo .
" I think its a big scam , " says Hund in a video report by the Associated Press .
" I think that the pharmaceutical companies are just the biggest ripoff , and they should be ashamed of themselves .
I think that insurance companies are just screwing people left and right ... "
" I think the whole medical field needs to be shaken out and re-done , I really do .
I do n't have the answer on how to do that .
I 'm hoping that when a new president comes in , he will really help with all that .
And I 'm scared , if we do n't get a new president in , if we get the same old president in , I 'm really scared for this country . "

OK , so maybe it 's just a replica , but come on !
AIRWOLF !
How awesome would it be to own Airwolf ( even if it were just a copy of the original bird ) .
A friend invites you over for a BBQ and you ask , " How big is your lawn ? "
He asks why , and you tell him not to worry about it – then you land in his front yard in frickin ' Airwolf and fly away with his girlfriend .
Kid getting bullied in school ?
Pick him up in Airwolf and see what happens .
If he does n't get instant street cred , you can always just waste the place with your Sidewinder missiles ( not included ) .
Of course , it would take a lot of work to perform any of these heroic acts , because this bird does n't fly .
According the seller , Steve Stull ( whoever the hell that is ) did the work , and it took him five months to build , using a Bell 222A airframe as a starting point .
The " Wolf " was apparently made for a helicopter museum in Georgia that never took off (! ) , and now all the exhibits are being sold .

I almost laughed when I saw the title of the Evidence - Based Mental Health journal article , “ Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is associated with poorer academic performance . ”
Not a “ ha , ha , that ’s funny ” type of laugh .
More of a , “ well yes , of course , ” type laugh .
Now I ’m not implying that this is actually any laughing matter .
School is a huge part of most children ’s life and having problems there means that these problems are now a huge part of their life .
And it ’s important to do this research along these lines .
But as a former teacher and someone who has worked with children who have ADHD , I can tell you that this is n’t a surprise .
This study followed 370 adolescents who have ADHD as well as 740 controls .
( There were two controls for each adolescent with ADHD . )
The study examined reading achievement , grade retention , dropout rates , and attendance .
And the conclusions were that ADHD students are absent more , have lower standardized reading scores , dropout of school at higher levels , and are held back more often .
I wish I had the answer to this problem because there is nothing good about watching a child struggle to sit still or frantically ruffle through their backpack looking for a 3 - day - old homework assignment .
And it ’s not fun to watch an 8 year old get frustrated trying to do something that is easy for children who do n’t have ADHD .
But I believe that in general , children with ADHD will continue to struggle until their care givers , teachers , and doctors realize just how much assistance they need .
Although the schools are “ supposed ” to meet the needs of all children , they do n’t ; they can ’t .
This is as impossible as saying that the schools will make sure that “ no child ( is ) left behind . ”
When a child has any sort of special needs , whether this need is due to a learning disability or being “ gifted , ” the schools can try to meet the needs of the child but it will take some major work and input from parents as well .
And even more than this , it will take collaboration between the schools , parents , and doctors .
Raising a child is not easy , for anyone .
But when your child has something like ADHD it becomes a little more difficult .
Your child probably needs to learn some specific skills that you may not have experience teaching .
Their motivation patterns may not be familiar to you .
You may not understand how to help them .
And if they have a teacher who does n’t have a good understanding of ADHD , it ’s that much harder .
I recall a conversation I had with a parent of a child with ADHD .
They just did n’t understand why their child could n’t clean their room .
It took them many years before they realized that their child did n’t “ see ” the steps needed to clean their room like someone without ADHD would .
So of course , it was hard for them to help their child .
In the end I think that this research points out something that many educators , doctors , and parents of ADHD / ADD children already know : we need to collaborate to find definitive strategies that will help these children be successful in school .
These strategies need to be wide - spread , taught to teachers and parents alike .
Because we know there ’s a problem ; we need to focus on finding a solution .
Until then , parents of children who have ADHD and ADD will have to exhaust local resources and will need to research the subject extensively so they can even out the playing field for their child .

It ’s been a while since I ’ve heard anything about the epic power / speed metallers from Dragonforce .
Well , as it turns out , they ’ve been working really hard to release their new album , “ Ultra Beatdown ” , on August 25 via Roadrunner Records .
Band members also took the time to talk about this album .
Guitarist Sam Totman says :
“ It ’s not going to be majorly different .
But hopefully the melodies will be nicer , the guitar solos will be better , the production will be better .
You just try to improve in every area . ”
Vocalist ZP
Theart added , “ There is n’t much to change , but yet there is .
The last three albums have been very much guitar - orientated , and this one probably will be as well , but I want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals . ”
But he ’s not the only one who took the time to talk .
Herman
Li also spoke his mind :
“ Bands always say , ‘ Our new album is faster and heavier , ’ and then it ’s never true , so we ’re not gonna say that .
But playing fast just works for us .
People who say we play too fast are probably right , but guess what ?
There ’s a million other bands that play slow .
People listen to DRAGONFORCE and go to the show because they know that we ’re doing something other bands are n’t doing . ”
Track list is as follows :
01 . “ Heroes Of Our Time ”
02 . “ The Fire Still Burns ”
03 . “ Reasons To Live ”
04 . “ Scars Of Yesterday ”
05 . “ Heartbreak Armageddon ”
06 . “ The Last Journey Home ”
07 . “ Inside The Winter Storm ”
08 . “ The Warrior Inside ”
Louis Wain was an artist popular for his paintings of cats in the late 1800s and early 1900s .
H.G. Wells said that “ He has made the cat his own .
He invented a cat style , a cat society , a whole cat world .
English cats that do not look and live like Louis Wain cats are ashamed of themselves . ”
Wain began to exhibit the symptoms of schizophrenia around 1910 , and was committed to a mental hospital in 1924 .
The following pictures of cats are typically interpreted as illustrating the increasing effects of his schizophrenia .
Some debate this however , as Wain did not date his paintings , and argue that he was simply experimenting with patterns reflecting his mother ’s work designing textiles .
Regardless of explanation , they remain utterly fascinating .

BAGHDAD  Iraq ’s foreign minister said Tuesday that the United States had agreed to lift immunity for foreign security contractors operating in Iraq , making them subject to prosecution under Iraqi law , according to Iraqi politicians .
In a briefing for lawmakers on the status of a complex security agreement being negotiated with the United States , the foreign minister , Hoshyar Zebari , said Iraq had insisted on ending the immunity for private security companies , according to three Iraqi politicians who were present .
American troops are operating under a United Nations mandate that expires in December .
The private security companies , like Blackwater Worldwide , have reputations of using excessive force in protecting diplomatic and other foreign clients , and currently enjoy immunity from Iraqi law .
That immunity became a political issue last fall , after a Blackwater shooting in Baghdad in September left 17 Iraqis dead , according to Iraqi investigators .
According to the three Iraqi politicians who were interviewed , Mr. Zebari said the agreement by the United States to lift the immunity eliminated one of many sticking points in the negotiations , which the United States has said it wants to complete by the end of this month .
The Food and Drug Administration this week issued a stern health advisory once again warning parents not to give babies under two years of age over - the - counter ( OTC ) cold and cough medicine because of potentially " serious and life - threatening side effects . "
This includes decongestants , expectorants , antihistamines and antitussives ( cough suppressants ) that you can pick up at pharmacies and supermarkets , including Wyeth 's Robitussin , Novartis , AG's Triaminic and Johnson & Johnson 's Tylenol Plus Cold .
" The FDA strongly recommends to parents and caregivers that OTC cough and cold medicines not be used for children younger than two , " Charles Ganley , director of the FDA 's Office of Nonprescription Products said .
" These medicines , which treat the symptoms and not the underlying condition , have not been shown to be safe or effective in children under two . "
The announcement comes on the heels of a high - profile meeting last October at which experts warned of dangerous side effects in children and recommended they not be given to those younger than six years old .
Besides fatalities , adverse effects reported include convulsions , rapid heart rates , and reduced levels of consciousness .
The FDA noted in its public advisory that it is " aware of reports of serious side effects " in children between two and 11 years old , but is still reviewing information about risks in that age group .
The agency in August warned parents not to give over - the - counter cough and cold remedies to tykes under two years old , but issued the current alert because it was worried parents did not get or heed the message .
After last year 's huddle , many drug companies voluntarily pulled 14 cough and cold products targeted at toddlers from store shelves .
The FDA in the past has not required pharmaceutical manufacturers to prove the elixirs , which have been sold for decades , work in children , allowing dosing to be gleaned from adult data .
But pediatricians have been increasingly concerned about the safety of these products in their young patients .
" Children metabolize and react to medications differently than adults , often in unanticipated ways , '' the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement released after the FDA alert .
" Studies have shown cough and cold products are ineffective in treating symptoms of children under six years old and may pose serious risks . ''
Physicians have suggested using old - fashioned remedies to help ease cold symptoms , including drinking lots of fluids ( among them , Mom 's favorite chicken soup ) , humidifiers and rubbing babies ' backs in a steamed - up bathroom .
The FDA is expected to rule by the spring on whether the drugs should also be nixed for kids between the ages of two and 11 .
In the meantime , it cautions parents who use them in that age group to , among other things , carefully follow dosing directions , only use measuring spoons or cups that come with or are specifically designed to be used with the drugs , and remember that the drugs , at best , temporarily mask symptoms of but neither cure nor shorten the duration of colds or coughs .
When all else fails , try to cut off the revenue source :
The Munich - based company that has supplied Zimbabwe with the
special blank sheets to print its increasingly worthless dollar caved
in to pressure on Tuesday from the German government for it to stop
doing business with the African ruler .
Mr. Mugabe ’s regime
relies on a steady supply of the paper — fortified with watermarks and
other antiforgery features — to print the bank notes that allow it to
pay the soldiers and other loyalists …
Here is the story .
And in case you are wondering , it ’s the same company that printed up the bills for the famous Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920s .
In fact only a few companies in the world can make so much " quality " money in such quantities so quickly .
When in doubt , go with experience !
They ’ve been airlifting the bills to Zimbabwe in huge quantities ; by the way their motto is " Creating Confidence . "
Not as good as " Always Low Prices " if you ask me .
The deeper question is why any tyrannical government would find such a high inflation rate to be seigniorage - maximizing .
At some point people simply abandon the currency or prices end up rising as fast or faster than the government spends the newly printed money .
( Related query :
When the number " quadrillion " is in play , are the " anti- forgery " features of the paper really needed ?
Is n’t the value of the bill higher as paper in any case ? )
Under one hypothesis , the time horizon is very short and the mass printing of bills maximizes seigniorage on a week - to - week basis but not overall .
Under another hypothesis , seigniorage is declining ( given price expectations ) , but without the stream of new bills it would be declining even more rapidly .
I know who to ask .

Science correspondent , BBC News
Cannabis is currently graded as a class C substance
The Science Select Committee said the present system was based on historical assumptions , not scientific assessment .
BBC News has seen details of a system devised by government advisers which was considered by former Home Secretary Charles Clarke but is now on hold .
It rates some illegal drugs as less harmful than alcohol and tobacco .
The new system was based on the first scientific assessment of 20 legal and illegal stimulants used in contemporary Britain .
Alcohol was rated the fifth most harmful drug , ahead of some current class A drugs , while tobacco was listed as ninth .
Cannabis , currently rated a class C drug , was below both those legal stimulants at 11th .
The MPs said including alcohol and tobacco in the classification would give the public " a better sense of the relative harms involved " .
It 's time to bring in a more systematic and scientific approach to drug classification
Phil Willis
They also denounced the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs - which provides scientific guidance to the government - for " dereliction of duty " in failing to alert ministers of " serious flaws " in the rating system .
Phil Willis , who chairs the committee , said the current classifications were " riddled with anomalies " and " clearly not fit for purpose " .

Controlled drugs are currently put into alphabetical categories , reflecting the level of penalties offences such as possession and dealing can attract .
Class A , which is the highest category , contains substances such as heroin , cocaine , ecstasy and magic mushrooms .
Class B includes speed and barbiturates .
Cannabis and some tranquilisers are graded as class C substances .
Systematic
Mr Willis said the only way to get " an accurate and up to date classification system " was to " remove the link with penalties and just focus on harm " , adding that this meant social consequences as well as harm to the user .
CURRENT DRUG CLASSIFICATION
Class A Cocaine / crack Heroin Ecstasy LSD Magic mushrooms Crystal meth ( pending ) Class A / B Amphetamines Class C Cannabis Ketamine
Drugs key facts Crystal meth to be Class A
He went on : " It 's time to bring in a more systematic and scientific approach to drug classification - how can we get the message across to young people if what we are saying is not based on evidence ? "
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 's
Today programme , he said : " In 1971 when the classification system was launched , that was right for the time .
" What we 've had is a huge societal change over that period and what we 've seen is that putting a drug into Class A does not stop people using it at all . "
Alcohol
The alternative system was prepared by Professor David Nutt , a senior member of the Committee that advises the government on drug classification , and Professor Colin Blakemore - chief Executive of the Medical Research Council .
There are three class A drugs in the top five of the system , as well as one Class B and alcohol .
Tobacco is listed as the ninth most harmful drug and cannabis , a class C drug , comes in at number 11 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Many people complain about the nanny state but still support draconian drug laws

This places them well below tobacco and alcohol and a number of class B and C drugs .
Professor Blakemore told BBC
News alcohol and tobacco were included in the ranking to give a " calibration of what these levels of harm mean " .
He added : " That 's not to say there 's any argument that alcohol should be banned but it does give one a feel for the relative harm " .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices sank Friday , settling down more than $ 5 for the week , after two stronger - than - expected economic reports calmed nervous investors .
Lingering concerns over a drop in demand also pressured prices lower .
Light , sweet crude for September delivery fell $ 2.23 to settle at $ 123.26 a barrel , the lowest closing price since June 4 .
For the week , prices fell $ 5.62 .
Earlier in the session prices reached as low as $ 122.50 a barrel , the lowest intraday level since June 5 , when prices touched $ 121.61 .
Prices fell after a government report showed new home sales were stronger than expected last month , and a survey from the University of Michigan revealed that the government 's economic stimulus package had boosted consumer sentiment .
Both reports , on top of an unexpected increase in orders for durable goods , drove investors away from oil which has been used as a hedge against economic downturn .
" [ Investors ] bought oil because they were worried about the economy , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst with Alaron Trading in Chicago .
The Dow industrials gained nearly 100 points in Friday morning trading and were still up about 40 points midday , following a sharp selloff the previous day , as investors poured money into stocks .
These reports have given investors " a little more confidence that the world is n't coming to an end , " added Flynn .
Demand :
Oil prices have slipped in recent days as reports have confirmed that demand has indeed declined , largely due to high fuel prices .
An Energy Department report released Wednesday showed that gasoline demand in the United States last week had fallen 2.4 % from the same period last year .
And a weekly survey of filling station credit card swipes from MasterCard recorded declining demand for the 13th week in a row .
Worries about falling demand have helped push prices down $ 24 a barrel from a record trading high of $ 147.27 set July 11 .
The fall in July demand has been of particular concern to investors because Americans have traditionally used more fuel in the summer .
" This is when we should be struggling with demand , but the demand is n't there , " said Flynn .
Gas responds :
Average gasoline prices have dropped in response to oil 's decline , even though they remain above $ 4 a gallon at the pump , according to surveys by motorist group AAA .
And some investors fear that the U.S. demand decline may spread to other countries as well .
" The ever - deteriorating demand picture in the U.S. only seems to be getting from bad to worse and this contagion may even be spreading to China , " wrote Nauman Barakat , energy trader at Macquarie Futures in a report Thursday .
Fragile market : Despite the trend , " there 's always the possibility that something could happen in this market to turn it around , " said Peter Beutel , oil analyst at Cameron Hanover .
International oil supplies remain tight .
Tensions between the West and Iran , the second - largest producing member of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries , and militant attacks in Nigeria , Africa 's largest oil producer , have been one of the main concerns that drove oil prices to their record highs .
Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico have also been a traditional worry this time of year .
Hurricane Dolly drove prices up briefly this week before it was clear the storm would miss vital oil facilities .
So Tucker Max has officially accepted my challenge to a fight .
Good .
That was the easy part .
The hard part ?
Deciding exactly how I am going to rearrange his face .
Will I pluck out an eye and stuff it up his nostril ?
Will I make him choke down his own tongue until he throws it up and then sit on his head and force him to lap up his own puke like a bad little puppy ?
Or will I simply knock out his teeth and then use them as Chinese death stars which I will then throw into his black heart ?
I just do not know .
But I do know this : Tucker Max is going down .
How do I know this ?
Because Tucker may have the athleticism , the muscles , the fighting skills , the experience , the guts , and the heart .
But I have something he will NEVER have – I ’m not sure what that is , but if I think about it long enough I will probably come up with something .
I might be better at Scrabble , for example .
( I also have one of the original pets.com sock puppets , which I ’m sure he does n’t have , and will never have , but I do n’t think that will help me in the fight . )
So confident is he of winning this fight that he has offered to give me one of his piddling royalty checks ( “ which should be for about $ 150,000 ” ) .
Fuck that .
Does he think a hundred and fifty thousand dollars means ANYTHING to me ?
Well it does n’t !*
I ’M ON BASIC CABLE TELEVISION !!!
He says we do n’t even have to make it a bet .
That I can just keep the check if I win , and he gets nothing if he loses .
Well I say let ’s make it a bet , you punked - out vagina !
If I win , I get the royalty check .
Fine .
I ’ll take your shitty little check and use it to wipe my ass .**
But if you win , I will give you my ENTIRE COLLECTION of books about New Kids on the Block .
I have three of them and now that they have reformed , those books are worth A LOT MORE THAN $ 150,000 !!!***
That ’s how confident I am that I am going to not only destroy your body , but your entire psyche .
He asks me to pick the time and place .
I will have to work on that , but rest assured it will be soon and it will be well - publicized and it will be sponsored and there will be some hot ring girls and probably a motorcycle jump before the fight .
Also , I am hoping to enter the ring via helicopter .
And I ’m going to get a special robe with my name bedazzled on it .
And you know how UFC has the Octagon ?
Well our ring is going to be shaped like the Star of Fucking David .
Because that ’s how we Jews roll .
Tucker Max , you are going to regret the day you ever read my blog .
( Tucker Max when I get through with him )
* When I say it does n’t mean “ anything ” to me , what I actually mean is , that would mean a lot .
I have n't had steady work in a while .
** After I use it to wipe my ass , I will then use it to pay off a home equity loan I took out to finish my basement .
***
It ’s true I have the books , but I think they are probably worth , in total , about a dollar fifty .
Here 's one really smart idea that will convert a few Kindle - haters : textbooks .
Princeton University Press join Oxford ,
Yale and the UC in putting some of their titles into e-book form , allowing students to bypass the used book store and directly download their textbooks onto their Kindles .
You 'll save a few bucks for the digital version , plus shipping costs and shipping time .
And if you figure out a way to hack it , that 's like , free textbooks dude .
Whoa .
We see this extended to concerned parents of elementary school kids who 've been complaining about how many textbooks they have to lug from home to school and back .
Then again , maybe that 's why your kids are so fat .

We expect our cell phones to do a lot these days : make calls , check e-mail , take photographs , play music , surf Web sites , let the government track your every move .
But civil liberties groups have a few questions about that last feature , and have filed a lawsuit seeking to force the Department of Justice to respond to a Freedom of Information Act Request submitted late last year , seeking documents about the practice of using mobile phones as homing beacons .
The complaint brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Electronic Frontier Foundation seeks to compel the release of " all records pertaining to [ the government 's ] policies , procedures and practices followed to obtain mobile phone location information for law enforcement purposes , " especially when that information is sought without a warrant .
The original request for expedited release of the records was made last November , to no avail , in the wake of press reports that federal law enforcement officials were routinely requesting location information for investigative purposes .
Cell providers are required to be able to pinpoint a phone 's location under " Enhanced 911 " rules originally intended to aid police and paramedics when a mobile user called 911 .
Most judges who have considered such requests have insisted that federal agents obtain a probable cause warrant to track suspects , as they would be required to do if they wished to wiretap the suspect 's conversation .
But in 2005 , a federal judge in New York ruled that cells could be tracked under a far looser evidentiary standard .
Traditionally , courts have drawn a sharp distinction between the content of a telephone call and information about a call .
Records of the numbers that have called or been called by a particular phone can be obtained relatively easily , via a trap - and - trace or pen register order .
The call itself , however , requires a traditional Fourth Amendment warrant supported by probable cause .
Justice Department guidelines suggest that investigators hew to the stricter standard when seeking to pinpoint a suspect , but the government has also argued that the laxer standard — requiring only that the request be supported by " specific and articulable facts " — may be appropriate when less precise geographical information is sought .
The ACLU and EFF are hoping that the release of internal memoranda and policies will shed some light on the prevalence of such requests , and the level of judicial scrutiny to which they are subject .
Thus far , they have been ignored or rebuffed by the offices to which they have sent requests .

Bloggers and journalists in China are using a novel approach to bypass Internet filters in their country – they write backwards or from right to left .
The content therefore remains readable by human beings but defeats the web filtering software .
China is known to implement ‘ packet filtering ’ – a technique that detects TCP packets containing controversial keywords like Tibet , Democracy , Tiananmen , etc .
To dodge these censors , Internet writers in China are writing backwards when posting to web forums and blogs .
They do it using this web tool that flips sentences to read right to left instead of left to right , and vertically instead of horizontally .

It ’s like old times in the Persian Gulf .
As of this week , a second aircraft carrier battle task force is being sent in — not long after Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Adm .
Michael Mullen highlighted planning for “ potential military courses of action ” against Iran ; just as the Bush administration ’s catechism of charges against the Iranians in Iraq reaches something like a fever pitch ; at the moment when rumors of , leaks about , and denials of Pentagon back - to - the - drawing - board planning for new ways to attack Iran are zipping around ( “ Targets would include everything from the plants where weapons are made to the headquarters of the organization known as the Quds Force which directs operations in Iraq … ” ) ; and only days before the U.S. military in Iraq is supposed to conduct its latest media dog-and - pony show on Iranian support for Iraqi Shi’ite militias ( “ … including date stamps on newly found weapons caches showing that recently made Iranian weapons are flowing into Iraq at a steadily increasing rate … ” ) .
On the dispatching of that second aircraft carrier , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates offered the following comment : “ I do n’t see it as an escalation .
I think it could be seen , though , as a reminder . ”
And , when you really think about it , it is indeed a “ reminder ” of sorts .
After all , the name of that second carrier has a certain resonance .
It ’s the USS Abraham Lincoln , the very carrier on which , on May 1st exactly five years ago , President George W. Bush landed in that S - 3B Viking sub reconnaissance Naval jet , in what TV people call “ magic hour light , ” for his Top - Gun strut to a podium .
There , against a White House - produced banner emblazoned with the phrase “ Mission Accomplished , ” he declared that “ major combat operations in Iraq have ended . ”
Now , more than five years after Baghdad fell , with Saddam Hussein long executed , Osama bin Laden alive and kicking , and American soldiers fighting and dying in the vast Shi’ite slum suburb of Sadr City in Baghdad , the dangerous administration game of chicken with Iran in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere once again intensifies .
It ’s a dangerous moment .
When you ratchet up the charges and send in the carriers , anything is possible .
We regularly read about all of this , of course , but almost never as seen through anything but American administration or journalistic eyes ( and sometimes it ’s hard to tell the two apart ) .
The author of Globalistan and also Red Zone Blues , Pepe Escobar , a continent - hopping super - journalist for the always fascinating Asia Times and now The Real News as well , has done a striking job of covering the Iraq War , the various oil wars and pipeline struggles of the Middle East and Central Asia , and , these last years , has regularly visited Iran .
Today , in his first appearance at Tomdispatch , he offers something rare indeed , an assessment of Iran “ under the gun ” — without the American filter in place .

The Iranian Chessboard
By Pepe Escobar
More than two years ago , Seymour Hersh disclosed in the New Yorker how George W. Bush was considering strategic nuclear strikes against Iran .
Ever since , a campaign to demonize that country has proceeded in a relentless , Terminator - like way , applying the same techniques and semantic contortions that were so familiar in the period before the Bush administration launched its invasion of Iraq .
The campaign ’s greatest hits are widely known : “ The ayatollahs ” are building a Shi’ite nuclear bomb ; Iranian weapons are killing American soldiers in Iraq ; Iranian gunboats are provoking U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf — Iran , in short , is the new al - Qaeda , a terror state aimed at the heart of the United States .
It ’s idle to expect the American mainstream media to offer any tools that might put this orchestrated blitzkrieg in context .
Here are just a few recent instances of the ongoing campaign : Secretary of Defense Robert Gates insists that Iran “ is hell - bent on acquiring nuclear weapons . ”
Adm. Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , admits that the Pentagon is planning for “ potential military courses of action ” when it comes to Iran .
In tandem with U.S. commander in Iraq Gen. David Petraeus , Mullen denounces Iran ’s “ increasingly lethal and malign influence ” in Iraq , although he claims to harbor “ no expectations ” of an attack on Iran “ in the immediate future ” and even admits he has “ no smoking gun which could prove that the highest leadership [ of Iran ] is involved . ”
But keep in mind one thing the Great Saddam Take - out of 2003 proved : that a “ smoking gun ” is , in the end , irrelevant .
And this week , the U.S. is ominously floating a second aircraft carrier battle group into the Persian Gulf .
But what of Iran itself under the blizzard of charges and threats ?
What to make of it ?
What does the world look like from Tehran ?
Here are five ways to think about Iran under the gun and to better decode the Iranian chessboard .
1 . Do n’t underestimate the power of Shi’ite Islam : Seventy - five percent of the world ’s oil reserves are in the Persian Gulf .
Seventy percent of the Gulf ’s population is Shi’ite .
Shi’ism is an eschatological — and revolutionary — religion , fueled by a passionate mixture of romanticism and cosmic despair .
As much as it may instill fear in hegemonic Sunni Islam , some Westerners should feel a certain empathy for intellectual Shi’ism ’s almost Sartrean nausea towards the vacuous material world .
For more than a thousand years Shi’ite Islam has , in fact , been a galaxy of Shi’isms — a kind of Fourth World of its own , always cursed by political exclusion and implacable economic marginalization , always carrying an immensely dramatic view of history with it .
It ’s impossible to understand Iran without grasping the contradiction that the Iranian religious leadership faces in ruling , however fractiously , a nation state .
In the minds of Iran ’s religious leaders , the very concept of the nation - state is regarded with deep suspicion , because it detracts from the umma , the global Muslim community .
The nation - state , as they see it , is but a way station on the road to the final triumph of Shi’ism and pure Islam .
To venture beyond the present stage of history , however , they also recognize the necessity of reinforcing the nation - state that offers Shi’ism a sanctuary — and that , of course , happens to be Iran .
When Shi’ism finally triumphs , the concept of nation - state — a heritage , in any case , of the West — will disappear , replaced by a community organized according to the will of Prophet Muhammad .
In the right context , this is , believe me , a powerful message .
I briefly became a mashti — a pilgrim visiting a privileged Shi’ite gateway to Paradise , the holy shrine of Imam Reza in Mashhad , four hours west of the Iran - Afghan border .
At sunset , the only foreigner lost in a pious multitude of black chadors and white turbans occupying every square inch of the huge walled shrine , I felt a tremendous emotional jolt .
And I was n’t even a believer , just a simple infidel .
2. Geography is destiny : Whenever I go to the holy city of Qom , bordering the central deserts in Iran , I am always reminded , in no uncertain terms , that , as far as the major ayatollahs are concerned , their supreme mission is to convert the rest of Islam to the original purity and revolutionary power of Shi’ism — a religion invariably critical of the established social and political order .
Even a Shi’ite leader in Tehran , however , ca n’t simply live by preaching and conversion alone .
Iran , after all , happens to be a nation - state at the crucial intersection of the Arabic , Turkish , Russian , and Indian worlds .
It is the key transit point of the Middle East , the Persian Gulf , Central Asia , the Caucasus , and the Indian subcontinent .
It lies between three seas ( the Caspian , the Persian Gulf , and the sea of Oman ) .
Close to Europe and yet at the gates of Asia ( in fact part of Southwest Asia ) , Iran is the ultimate Eurasian crossroads .
Isfahan , the country ’s third largest city , is roughly equidistant from Paris and Shanghai .
No wonder Dick Cheney , checking out Iran , “ salivates like a Pavlov dog ” ( to quote those rock ‘n roll geopoliticians , the Rolling Stones ) .
Members of the Iranian upper middle classes in North Tehran might spin dreams of Iran recapturing the expansive range of influence once held by the Persian empire ; but the silky , Qom - carpet - like diplomats at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will assure you that what they really dream of is an Iran respected as a major regional power .
To this end , they have little choice , faced with the enmity of the globe ’s “ sole superpower , ” but to employ a sophisticated counter - encirclement foreign policy .
After all , Iran is now completely surrounded by post - 9/11 American military bases in Afghanistan , Central Asia , Iraq , and the Gulf states .
It faces the U.S. military on its Afghan , Iraqi , Pakistani , and Persian Gulf borders , and lives with ever - tightening U.S. economic sanctions , as well as a continuing drumbeat of Bush administration threats involving possible air assaults on Iranian nuclear ( and probably other ) facilities .
The Iranian counter - response to sanctions and to its demonization as a rogue or pariah state has been to develop a “ Look East ” foreign policy that is , in itself , a challenge to American energy hegemony in the Gulf .
The policy has been conducted with great skill by Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki , who was educated in Bangalore , India .
While focused on massive energy deals with China , India , and Pakistan , it looks as well to Africa and Latin America .
To the horror of American neocons , an intercontinental “ axis of evil ” air link already exists — a weekly commercial Tehran - Caracas flight via Iran Air .
Iran ’s diplomatic ( and energy ) reach is now striking .
When I was in Bolivia early this year , I learned of a tour Iran ’s ambassador to Venezuela had taken on the jet of Bolivian President Evo Morales .
The ambassador reportedly offered Morales “ everything he wanted ” to offset the influence of “ American imperialism . ”
Meanwhile , a fierce energy competition is developing among the Turks , Iranians , Russians , Chinese , and Americans — all placing their bets on which future trade routes will be the crucial ones as oil and natural gas flow out of Central Asia .
As a player , Iran is trying to position itself as the unavoidable bazaar - state in an oil - and - gas - fueled New Silk Road — the backbone of a new Asian Energy Security Grid .
That ’s how it could recover some of the preeminence it enjoyed in the distant era of Darius , the King of Kings .
And that ’s the main reason why U.S. neo -Cold Warriors , Zio-cons , armchair imperialists , or all of the above , are throwing such a collective — and threatening — fit .
3 . What is the nuclear “ new Hitler ” Ahmadinejad up to ? :
Ever since the days when former Iranian President Mohammed Khatami suggested a “ dialogue of civilizations , ” Iranian diplomats have endlessly repeated the official position on Iran ’s nuclear program :
It ’s peaceful ; the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) has found no proof of the military development of nuclear power ; the religious leadership opposes atomic weapons ; and Iran — unlike the US — has not invaded or attacked any nation for the past quarter millennium .
Think of George W. Bush and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as the new Blues Brothers : Both believe they are on a mission from God .
Both are religious fundamentalists .
Ahmadinejad believes fervently in the imminent return of the Mahdi , the Shi’ite messiah , who “ disappeared ” and has remained hidden since the ninth century .
Bush believes fervently in a coming end time and the return of Jesus Christ .
But only Bush , despite his actual invasions and constant threats , gets a ( sort of ) free pass from the Western ideological machine , while Ahmadinejad is portrayed as a Hitlerian believer in a new Holocaust .
Ahmadinejad is relentlessly depicted as an angry , totally irrational , Jew - hating , Holocaust - denying Islamo - fascist who wants to “ wipe Israel off the map . ”
That infamous quote , repeated ad nauseam but out of context , comes from an October 2005 speech at an obscure anti-Zionist student conference .
What Ahmadinejad really said , in a literal translation from Farsi , was that “ the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the pages of time . ”
He was actually quoting the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution , Ayatollah Khomeini , who said it first in the early 1980s .
Khomeini hoped that a regime so unjust toward the Palestinians would be replaced by another more equitable one .
He was not , however , threatening to nuke Israel .
In the 1980s , in the bitterest years of the Iran - Iraq War , Khomeini also made it very clear that the production , possession , or use of nuclear weapons is against Islam .
Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei later issued a fatwa — a religious injunction — under the same terms .
For the theocratic regime , however , the Iranian nuclear program is a powerful symbol of independence vis–vis what is still widely considered by Iranians of all social classes and educational backgrounds as Anglo - Saxon colonialism .
Ahmadinejad is mad for the Iranian nuclear program .
It ’s his bread and butter in terms of domestic popularity .
During the Iran - Iraq War , he was a member of a support team aiding anti-Saddam Hussein Kurdish forces .
( That ’s when he became friends with “ Uncle ” Jalal Talabani , now the Kurdish president of Iraq . )
Not many presidents have been trained in guerrilla warfare .
Speculation is rampant in Tehran that Ahmadinejad , the leadership of the Quds Force , an elite division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) , plus the hardcore volunteer militia , the Basij ( informally known in Iran as “ the army of twenty million ” ) are betting on a U.S. attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities to strengthen the country ’s theocratic regime and their faction of it .
Reformists refer to Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s visit to Tehran last October , when he was received by the Supreme Leader ( a very rare honor ) .
Putin offered a new plan to resolve the explosive Iranian nuclear dossier : Iran would halt nuclear enrichment on Iranian soil in return for peaceful nuclear cooperation and development in league with Russia , the Europeans , and the IAEA .
Iran ’s top nuclear negotiator of that moment , Ali Larijani , a confidant of Supreme Leader Khamenei , as well as the Leader himself let it be known that the idea would be seriously considered .
But Ahmadinejad immediately contradicted the Supreme Leader in public .
Even more startling , yet evidently with the Leader ’s acquiescence , he then sacked Larijani and replaced him with a longtime friend , Saeed Jalili , an ideological hardliner .
4 . A velvet revolution is not around the corner : Before the 2005 Iranian elections , at a secret , high - level meeting of the ruling ayatollahs in his house , the Supreme Leader concluded that Ahmadinejad would be able to revive the regime with his populist rhetoric and pious conservatism , which then seemed very appealing to the downtrodden masses .
( Curiously enough , Ahmadinejad ’s campaign motto was : “ We can . ” )
But the ruling ayatollahs miscalculated .
Since they controlled all key levers of power — the Supreme National Security Council , the Council of Guardians , the Judiciary , the bonyads ( Islamic foundations that control vast sections of the economy ) , the army , the IRGC ( the parallel army created by Khomeini in 1979 and recently branded a terrorist organization by the Bush administration ) , the media — they assumed they would also control the self - described “ street cleaner of the people . ”
How wrong they have been .
For Khamenei himself , this was big business .
After 18 years of non -stop internal struggle , he was finally in full control of executive power , as well as of the legislature , the judiciary , the Revolutionary Guards , the Basij , and the key ayatollahs in Qom .
Ahmadinejad , for his part , unleashed his own agenda .
He purged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of many reformist - minded diplomats ; encouraged the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to crack down on all forms of “ nefarious ” Western influences , from entertainment industry products to colorful made - in - India scarves for women ; and filled his cabinet with revolutionary friends from the Iran - Iraq War days .
These friends proved to be as faithful as administratively incompetent — especially in terms of economic policy .
Instead of solidifying the theocratic leadership under Supreme Leader Khamenei , Ahmadinejad increasingly fractured an increasingly unpopular ruling elite .
Nonetheless , discontent with Ahmadinejad ’s economic incompetence has not translated into street barricades and it probably will not ; nor , contrary to neocon fantasyland scenarios , would an attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities provoke a popular uprising .
Every single political faction supports the nuclear program out of patriotic pride .
There is surely a glaring paradox here .
The regime may be wildly unpopular — because of so much enforced austerity in an energy - rich land and the virtual absence of social mobility — but for millions , especially in the countryside and the remote provinces , life is still bearable .
In the large urban centers — Tehran , Isfahan , Shiraz , and Tabriz — most would be in favor of a move toward a more market - oriented economy combined with a progressive liberalization of mores ( even as the regime insists on going the other way ) .
No velvet revolution , however , seems to be on the horizon .
At least four main factions are at play in the intricate Persian - miniature - like game of today ’s Iranian power politics — and two others , the revolutionary left and the secular right , even though thoroughly marginalized , should n’t be forgotten either .
The extreme right , very religiously conservative but economically socialist , has , from the beginning , been closely aligned with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood .
Ahmadinejad is the star of this faction .
The clerics , from the Supreme Leader to thousands of provincial religious figures , are pure conservatives , even more patriotic than the extreme right , yet generally no lovers of Ahmadinejad .
But there is a crucial internal split .
The substantially wealthy bonyads — the Islamic foundations , active in all economic sectors — badly want a reconciliation with the West .
They know that , under the pressure of Western sanctions , the relentless flight of both capital and brains is working against the national interest .
Economists in Tehran project there may be as much as $ 600 billion in Iranian funds invested in the economies of Persian Gulf petro-monarchies .
The best and the brightest continue to flee the country .
But the Islamic foundations also know that this state of affairs slowly undermines Ahmadinejad ’s power .
The extremely influential Revolutionary Guard Corps , a key component of government with vast economic interests , transits between these two factions .
They privilege the fight against what they define as Zionism , are in favor of close relations with Sunni Arab states , and want to go all the way with the nuclear program .
In fact , substantial sections of the IRGC and the Basij believe Iran must enter the nuclear club not only to prevent an attack by the “ American Satan , ” but to irreversibly change the balance of power in the Middle East and Southwest Asia .
The current reformists / progressives of the left were originally former partisans of Khomeini ’s son , Ahmad Khomeini .
Later , after a spectacular mutation from Soviet - style socialism to some sort of religious democracy , their new icon became former President Khatami ( of “ dialogue of civilizations ” fame ) .
Here , after all , was an Islamic president who had captured the youth vote and the women ’s vote and had written about the ideas of German philosopher Jurgen Habermas as applied to civil society as well as the possibility of democratization in Iran .
Unfortunately , his “ Tehran Spring ” did n’t last long — and is now long gone .
The key establishment faction is undoubtedly that of moderate Hashemi Rafsanjani , a former two - term President , current chairman of the Expediency Council and a key member of the Council of Experts — 86 clerics , no women , the Holy Grail of the system , and the only institution in the Islamic Republic capable of removing the Supreme Leader from office .
He is now supported by the intelligentsia and urban youth .
Colloquially known as “ The Shark , ” Rafsanjani is the consummate Machiavellian .
He retains privileged ties to key Washington players and has proven to be the ultimate survivor — moving like a skilled juggler between Khatami and Khamenei as power in the country shifted .
Rafsanjani is , and will always remain , a supporter of the Supreme Leader .
As the regime ’s de facto number two , his quest is not only to “ save ” the Islamic Revolution , but also to consolidate Iran ’s regional power and reconcile the country with the West .
His reasoning is clear :
He knows that an anti-Islamic tempest is already brewing among the young in Iran ’s major cities , who dream of integrating with the nomad elites of liquid global modernity .
If the Bush administration had any real desire to let its aircraft carriers float out of the Gulf and establish an entente cordiale with Tehran , Rafsanjani would be the man to talk to .
5. Heading down the New Silk Road
Reformist friends in Tehran keep telling me the country is now immersed in an atmosphere similar to the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s in China or the 1980s rectification campaign in Cuba — and nothing “ velvet ” or “ orange ” or “ tulip ” or any of the other color - coded Western - style movements that Washington might dream of is , as yet , on the horizon .
Under such conditions , what if there were an American air attack on Iran ?
The Supreme Leader , on the record , offered his own version of threats in 2006 .
If Iran were attacked , he said , the retaliation would be doubly powerful against U.S. interests elsewhere in the world .
From American supply lines and bases in southern Iraq to the Straits of Hormuz , the Iranians , though no military powerhouse , do have the ability to cause real damage to American forces and interests — and certainly to drive the price of oil into the stratosphere .
Such a “ war ” would clearly be a disaster for everyone .
The Iranian theocratic leadership , however , seems to doubt that the Bush administration and the U.S. military , exhausted by their wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , will attack .
They feel a tide at their backs .
Meanwhile the “ Look East ” strategy , driven by soaring energy prices , is bearing fruit .
Ahmadinejad has just concluded a tour of South Asia and , to the despair of American neocons , the Asian Energy Security Grid is quickly becoming a reality .
Two years ago , at the Petroleum Ministry in Tehran , I was told Iran is betting on the total “ interdependence of Asia and Persian Gulf geo-economic politics . ”
This year Iran finally becomes a natural gas - exporting country .
The framework for the $ 7.6 billion Iran - Pakistan - India pipeline , also known as the “ peace ” pipeline , is a go .
Both these key South Asian U.S. allies are ignoring Bush administration desires and rapidly bolstering their economic , political , cultural , and — crucially — geostrategic connections with Iran .
An attack on Iran would now inevitably be viewed as an attack against Asia .
What a disaster in the making , and yet , now more than ever , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s faction in Washington ( not to mention possible future president John McCain ) seems ready to bomb .
Perhaps the Mahdi himself — in his occult wisdom — is betting on a U.S. war against Asia to slouch towards Qom to be reborn .

Advertisement I am living in hiding after I received threats because of my undercover work exposing the threat from witchdoctors to albinos living in Tanzania .
I do not regret it , even if I am very scared .
Mine is just one life , compared to the several thousand people living with albinism in the country .
If nothing is done about this network , they could kill every albino in the country - estimates vary between 4,000 and 173,000 .
This year , at least 25 people with albinism have been killed , mostly in the Lake Victoria Zone , especially the Mwanza , Shinyanga and Mara areas .
Winifrida Rutahiro ( 2nd left ) is one albino who fears for her life
They are being killed because local witchdoctors say their body parts provide the potent ingredient for magic charms , which many local people use to bring success in business and love .
The bodies are left limbless and sometimes with a huge hole in the neck , from where blood would have been drained .
Families not only grieve because of the loss of their loved ones but are also shocked at the state in which the bodies are left by these murderers .
As if that is not enough , they have to bury their dead in the house , guard the graves on their farm and or build them with stones , metal bars and cement to prevent the killers from stealing the body parts .
Talking to chickens
So I posed as a businesswoman who wanted to get rich and " consulted " 10 witchdoctors .
The consultations included talking to a hedge and telling my problems to a chicken .
Once , albinos used to seek shelter from the sun .
Now they have gone into hiding simply to survive , after a series of killings linked to witchcraft
Living in fear : Tanzania 's albinos
These are regarded as intermediaries between the witchdoctor , their ancestors and the spirits , or " jinns " .
They used old German and English coins with holes in the middle , cowry shells , pebbles , nails , nuts and bolts , screws , crosses with the little figure representing Jesus , and beads which they would shake in a red or white cloth and throw on the ground , while incense burned from all around .
Sticky green stems or old money notes are put between pages from the Koran .
Then the witchdoctors would speak in Arabic and the local Sukuma language and translate or use an interpreter to get the message through to me .
I presented the same case to all of them and got different solutions .
The consultation fee ranged from $ 20 to $ 100 per session , with a promise of returning for a further problem - solving process .
All of them gave me different suggestions of who my enemies were - not by name but by description .
None got anything right , most importantly my true mission .
But that did not stop me from praying for my safety , as that was the only defence I had .
Ground organs
Never in my life had it occurred to me that I would one day be sitting in front of a witchdoctor , also known as sangomas or voodoo priests and priestesses .
Coming from a religious family , it was unthinkable to approach or even go near the compound of such people .
The graves of albinos are guarded or sealed with cement I met a registered traditional healer who uses African herbs to cure ailments in Magu , the town that shares the name with the district which is known to be the hub of sorcery .
This man condemned the way " conmen and foreign witchdoctors " lured locals into trusting them , before hiring murders to organise raids on homes of albinos just after sunset .
Two witchdoctors promised to get me a magic concoction mixed with ground albino organs .
The starting price was $ 2,000 for the vital organs .
Another told me said that the police were among his customers and that he could make a special potion mixed with ground male and female private parts to enable people to commit armed robbery without being caught .
The encounter with witchdoctor number three was in a village called Gambusi , the most feared area in the region .
The compound had about eight huts around the outside , with a more elaborate structure in the middle .
Here a man in his forties wearing a white T - Shirt and khaki trousers with a mobile phone on his belt asked me whether I had brought a chicken .
A gang of men went round the small town where we had stayed , searching all the guest houses
" What for ? " I asked .
He laughed and said that I was forgiven because he realised that I was a novice in the business .
He demanded $ 2 for a tiny three - week - old chicken and $ 3 for the fortune - telling .
I was then told to get out of the compound , face south - east , where I hail from - Dar es Salaam - spit on the bird 's head , back , tail and on my hand and have a heart - to - heart talk with the chick revealing all my problems .
He asked for $ 200 for the consultations and said I should spend two nights there before completing the process .
But when I told him that I had only $ 30 he told me to go away and return when I had the full amount .
Chilling message
When I went back with other BBC colleagues , his nephew was there to receive me .
He said he knew what I wanted and said he would find me albino blood , hair , leg and palms for $ 2,000 .
He charged me $ 55 for the initial consultations and asked me to return with the rest of the money .
I found the last witchdoctor in Lamadi , a tiny rural town which lies at the junction of the roads leading to Kenya and Uganda .
He charged me $ 100 for the first session and said he would give me the magic potion with albino and other human organs for a price .
While I was there , a man came for a consultation - the witchdoctor said he was a police officer but he was wearing civilian clothes .
However , he was made to wait until my session was over and , I later learned , told the witchdoctor that I was involved in a sting operation .
Shortly afterwards , the threatening phone calls started .
And a gang of men went round the small town of Magu , where we had briefly stayed , searching all the guest houses .
Luckily , we had already moved on to the nearest city , Mwanza .
One particularly chilling message came on my mobile phone : " What have you done now ?
Watch your back . "
The witchdoctor had boasted of working with a powerful network across East Africa , which included police officers and armed robbers .
I knew they were involved in the murder of albinos , so I was terrified .
At first , I did regret taking on this mission - especially for the sake of my family .
Had I put their lives at risk ?
But then I realised that I had done the right thing .
Even if I die today , those involved will have been exposed .

Many times , we have seen different robots transforming , mimicking our imaginary friends from the movies .
It is not surprising that although they are cool to watch , we know there is a long way to go to make it a truly adaptable reality .
Carnegie Mellon University has done some work on a different shape shifting mechanism …or so called robot swarms .
First of all , this is a lot smaller and more realistic than simply watching a transformer toy powered and programmed to act without external force .
In addition , this goes down to the nitty griddy of what the vision is .
You see , in this case , they are making separate pieces come together by a magnetic force and integrate with each other .
I do not want to attempt to explain it , since the video shows both an example plus provides a intriguing explanation .
After watching the video the first time , I realized this is not necessarily for transformers alone .
It could be combined into many of our electronic products , so in the future , additional pieces could be added on and adapt to each other .
This may be far fetched , but what could you see this used for ?

Many ideas have been proposed  pumping it into old oil and gas fields or saline aquifers , to name a few .

CNNMoney ( NEW YORK ) --
Retail gasoline prices jumped to yet another record high Sunday , according to drivers ' advocacy group AAA 's Web site .
The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline edged up to $ 3.707 , topping the previous record of $ 3.671 , set on Friday .
Gas prices had been hitting almost daily record highs , most recently running up a 17 - day streak that ended May 1 .
Last week , gas prices resumed their record run as crude oil prices pushed higher .
Drivers now pay , on average , 22 % more than they did a year ago , when a gallon of gas cost $ 3.037 , according to AAA .
Crude futures surged above the $ 126 - a - barrel mark for the first time Friday before settling back at $ 125.96 .

Vehicles that draw their energy from green sources have created an exciting new frontier in the travel industry !
At least , that ’s what most people think .
When it comes to boats , though , alternative energy crafts are nothing new .
Back in the day ( 1902 in fact ! ) , Mary Gordon was an electric - powered boat sporting stained glass windows , silk curtains and luxurious , velvet covered chairs .
So how far have we really come since then ?
Pretty damn far .
This is Earthrace , a state - of - the - art speedcraft that runs on human fat , in addition to other biodiesel fuels .
The crew of this vessel is currently racing to break the world speed record for circumnavigating the globe .
According to the Guardian , Earthrace is a 24 meter powerboat that runs on 100 % renewable biodiesel fuels and has a net zero carbon footprint .
Furthermore , Earthrace is the first boat in the world to use hemp composite in the construction of the ship body .
Lubricants for the ship are made from vegetable oils , bedding foams are made from canola oils , and the crew even eats organic / local foods and wears hemp and bamboo clothing .
Here ’s the 70 ft.
Mary Gordon–an electric - powered boat–taking a crowd for a tour in 1902 .
Note how Earthrace appears to be a direct descendant of ‘ Ms Gordon ’ : ) .
Pete Bethune , the New Zealand skipper of Earthrace , believes the boat can help advance biodiesel as a genuinely viable alternative to petroleum diesel .
Bethune and his family are more than a little invested in promoting fuel alternatives - they sold their home and belongings to fund the boat .
Demonstrating further commitment to the cause , Bethune underwent liposuction and donated enough of his personal body fat to produce 100 ml of biofuel .
Earthrace is now on pace to break the world speed record .
The current record holder is British boat Cable and Wireless Adventurer , which circumnavigated the globe in 75 days a decade ago .
The race is going well –after a little trouble in paradise , the crew repaired a broken engine and powered into Palau this week , 2400 miles ahead of schedule .
Check here to see where Earthrace is right now .
What`s in the future for Earthrace ’s technology ?
Well , the “ greenest ” part of Earthrace ’s design is n’t its two Cummins Mercruiser QSC 540 engines - it ’s the unique and incredibly efficient hull .
Unlike other boats that ride on top of waves , Earthrace pierces through them with its trimaran hull .
The design allows this boat to go far faster in rough seas than conventional vessels .
The piercing is controlled by pumping up to 2.5 tons of water into a special ballast tank in the bow .
The faster the boat is travelling , the more it pierces .
The limiting speed factor is the crew ’s ability to handle the ride , rather than the capacity of the boat .
In rough seas , this boat is fierce .
If that does n’t sound like it ’s for you , consider a more relaxed alternative such as a solar powered boat .

What does n't kill cancer cells makes them stronger , Duke researchers have observed .
Doctors use radiation and chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells .
About half of patients are cured -- that is , all of their tumor cells die .
The other half of the time , some tumor cells survive treatment .
These cancer cells are more aggressive than they were before treatment , says Mark W. Dewhirst , DVM , PhD , professor of radiation oncology at Duke University .
" When you give a tumor treatment , whatever cells survive are going to be more resistant to that treatment , " Dewhirst tells WebMD .
" Those not killed are healthier cancer cells . "
This does not mean radiation and chemotherapy do n't work .
It does mean that additional new treatments will be needed .
And to know what treatments will work best , Dewhirst says doctors need to know how cancer cells survive radiation and chemotherapy .
The key may be a protein called HIF -- hypoxia - inducing factor .
Government , university , and drug - company researchers are racing to develop new drugs that inhibit HIF .
But patients may not have to wait that long : Existing drugs , already approved by the FDA for cancer treatment , turn out to be potent anti-HIF agents .
Why is HIF suddenly a big deal ?
It 's the key to a different way of looking at cancers .

Invitation to try out open source code review tool
Some of you may have seen a video recorded in November 2006 where I showed off Mondrian , a code review tool that I was developing for Google ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMql3Di4Kgc).
I 've always hoped that I could release Mondrian as open source , but it was not to be : due to its popularity inside Google , it became more and more tied to proprietary Google infrastructure like Bigtable , and it remained limited to Perforce , the commercial revision control system most used at Google .
What I 'm announcing now is the next best thing : an code review tool for use with Subversion , inspired by Mondrian and ( soon to be ) released as open source .
Some of the code is even directly derived from Mondrian .
Most of the code is new though , written using Django and running on Google App Engine .
I 'm inviting the Python developer community to try out the tool on the web for code reviews .
I 've added a few code reviews already , but I 'm hoping that more developers will upload at least one patch for review and invite a reviewer to try it out .
To try it out , go here : http://codereview.appspot.com

Following are excerpts from an Iranian documentary on Hollywood cinema , focusing on the movie " Chicken Run . "
The documentary aired on IRINN on May 29 , 2008 :
" Traces of Zionism in World Cinema "
Presenter : Movies into which huge amounts of money are poured , in an effort to turn Zionist themes into entertainment , include movies created for children and youth .
Animation films produced since the 1990's joined other film genres in becoming a tool for Zionist propaganda .
Sometimes this is achieved by using falsified biblical narratives , like in the case of " The Prince of Egypt . "
Other times , it is achieved in a very subtly , crafty , and indirect manner , like in the film " Chicken Run . "
[...]
Dr. Majid Shah - Hosseini , an Iranian film critic :
Many films from the 1960's and the 1970's indirectly convey the notion that the Jews were oppressed .
This is conveyed through the themes of distance from the motherland , and the search for one 's mother , who symbolizes the motherland .
These messages were gradually introduced into animation and children 's films .
[...]
Sayyid Abu-Alhassan Allawi Tabatabai , an Iranian film critic :
These people never make a film without a premeditated motive .
[...]
Two emotional themes can be identified in children 's films , especially animations .
One is the lost mother , and the other is the lost land .
There is also the lost dog ...
These three themes frequently appear in animations produced since the 1970's .
[...]
Presenter : Even though " Chicken Run " is a sort of fantasy about an animal farm , on a deeper level it depicts the Zionists ' favorite themes , which appear in many of the visual dramas of the 20th century .
The recreation of a kind of genocide , using visual elements reminiscent of Nazi Germany death camps – an idea linked to the religious themes of a savior and immigration to a promised land – serves a propaganda machine , whose goal it is to depict itself as a symbol for the oppressed and for those who suffer .
[...]
Dr. Majid Shah - Hosseini : In " Chicken Run , " for example , you find allusions to the Holocaust , to concentration camps , and to the concept of awaiting a hero or a savior .
It portrays efforts to escape a predetermined fate – the death of all those who lived in that camp , who are depicted as chickens .
Eventually , a kind of Noah's
Ark is built – in this case , it is a flying ship – which is used for their escape .
[...]
Presenter : Unfortunately , Zionist notions can be detected in children 's movies , from the days of Walt Disney and to TV animation films .
The Zionists ' exclusive investments in group specializing in children 's films , such as DreamWorks in the 1990's , and the appearance of various works like " Chicken Run , " which employed magnificent techniques , were part of their premeditated plan to cover the blood stains soiling the clothes of the occupiers of the lands of Lebanon and the Gaza Strip .

The Ishaqs ' neighbour feels a certain guilt .
" Only a wall separated those children from us , but we knew so little about them .
I never saw Khyra in six months .
You would hear a short scream sometimes , but more like the screams children do when playing .
Once I heard a scream at about 3 am , but it might have been a child having a nightmare .
You could smell garlic and other ingredients on the cooker .
They would shout ' mummy , mummy ' in a normal way .
After the row over the bread , I did n't want to get into another row . "

NEW ORLEANS 
A sheen of oil coated the Mississippi River for nearly 100 miles from the center of this city to the Gulf of Mexico on Friday following the worst oil spill here in nearly a decade .
Around noon , after two days with no ship traffic , the Coast Guard opened the river to limited use .
The thick industrial fuel pouring from the barge could be smelled for miles in city neighborhoods up and down the river , even as hundreds of cleanup workers struggled to contain the hundreds of thousands of gallons .
Some environmentalists worried about reports of fish and bird kills in sensitive marsh areas downstream , though officials said they had so far heard of only a handful of oil - covered birds .
Booms to protect areas richest in wildlife , at the river ’s mouth , were being deployed , officials said .
The Mississippi had been closed to all boat traffic , stranding about 200 vessels .
The Coast Guard said 58 vessels were stopped in the river , the Associated Press reported Friday morning , and 97 were waiting at Southwest Pass — the narrow entrance from the Gulf of Mexico into the river .
Another 37 were waiting on the Intercoastal Waterway , a shallow canal system that extends across the Gulf Coast .
Forty - eight more were en route and expected to arrive over the weekend , and it could take days to clear the backlog .
The effect on the area ’s economy was thought to be significant , with this city ’s port estimating a loss of at least $ 100,000 a day and probably more while the river was closed , and petrochemical facilities dependent on it for shipping were threatened with a bottleneck , the Coast Guard said .
Some suburbs stopped drawing drinking water from the river .
When authorities have reason to believe that a drunken driver has caused a serious or fatal accident they have a right to draw the driver 's blood to test its alcohol content without their consent and without a search warrant , the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Friday .
The ruling was greeted with relief by law enforcers .
The high court reversed a ruling by a Dakota County district judge in the case of Janet Sue Shriner , 48 , of Burnsville .
Charges of drunken driving and criminal vehicular homicide were dismissed against Shriner involving a 2006 accident in Burnsville because the lower court ruled that police should have at least tried to obtain a warrant before taking her blood without her consent .
In a 5 - 2 decision , the Supreme Court said that the " rapid , natural dissipation of alcohol in the blood creates ... a circumstance [ requiring immediate attention ] that will justify police taking a warrantless , nonconsensual blood draw from a defendant " provided the officer has probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed criminal vehicular homicide or operation .
The case against Shriner has been on hold pending the Supreme Court ruling , but will now move forward .
" This decision in the Shriner case is very much appreciated , " Dakota County Attorney Jim Backstrom said .
" It 's very positive news for law enforcement across our state . "
State Patrol Maj .
Mike Asleson , who was messaging all patrol staff about the ruling Friday afternoon , said it " will keep us from having to go through what we sort of felt were unnecessary hoops that just delayed the inevitable , which was getting the blood draw from the driver .
" We 're grateful to the court for their ruling , " Asleson said .
" While we find their message of hate to be repugnant and their attempt to connect their motives and message to the death of Sgt. Liczbinski even more disgraceful , we live in a country that allows for certain freedoms of expression , " the commission stated in a news release yesterday .
" At present , it appears that this group has not broken any laws . "
OTTAWA  An American Army deserter who sought refuge in Canada from the war in Iraq was expelled Tuesday to the United States .
The deserter , Robin Long , a native of Boise , Idaho , is believed to be the first from the Iraq war returned by the Canadian government .
Mr. Long was expelled a day after the Federal Court of Canada rejected his request to delay his removal order pending further legal appeals .
That decision and Mr. Long ’s expulsion were somewhat unexpected .
Two other American deserters received Federal Court permission this month to stay in Canada to continue their appeals .
Since the Iraq war began in 2003 , about 200 people have abandoned the United States military and fled to Canada , according to groups that represent their interests and provide them with support , legally and otherwise .
“ This is just one skirmish , ” said Bob Ages , the chairman of the Vancouver War Resisters Support Campaign .
“ Despite the current government strategy of picking on resisters , the tide has turned in our favor both in the legal and political spheres . ”
DETROIT ( Reuters ) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday its U.S. sales fell 25 percent in May from a year earlier on an unadjusted basis , under pressure from declining demand for large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles .
Chrysler said its sales fell to 148,747 vehicles in May for its Chrysler , Dodge and Jeep brands , down from 199,393 a year earlier .
Car sales fell 33 percent and truck sales fell 22 percent , it said .
The company ended May with inventory of 412,009 vehicles , or a 75 - day supply , down 14 percent from a year earlier .

The unprecedented price volatility in crude oil , grain and other commodities , has focused our attention and galvanized a collective opinion .
" Too much speculation " is the cry of the day .
There appears to be much truth in that statement , since few can point to supply and demand factors that account for the shocking price moves .
But maybe we are not looking closely enough at the speculation angle .
The most visible culprit for the excessive speculation is said to be the index funds .
These are huge institutional funds that hold significant long positions in many commodity futures markets ( but not in COMEX gold or silver futures ) .
I have previously written about index funds .
This is an important topic , although I have been clear to state that I have no vested interest in whether they continue to hold their big long positions or not .
http://news.silverseek.com/TedButler/1168984728.php

Presently , there is a political frenzy developing to more closely regulate the index funds , and perhaps even force them to sell their long positions , thereby lowering the price of oil and other commodities .
While I question whether these index funds should have been allowed to amass such a large position they were permitted to amass their positions legally and openly .
Should the index funds be forced to dump their long positions , that would likely pressure , at least temporarily , oil and other commodity prices .
Perhaps a temporary lowering of prices is all the politicians are interested in .
That way they could declare victory over the evil speculators and go back to their business of efficiently running ( ruining ? ) the country .
But before the index funds are tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail , let �s clear up a common misperception that it has been a sudden influx of index fund buying that has caused the recent dramatic increase in the price of crude oil .
That is simply not true .
The index funds are holding the same size , or smaller , long position in crude oil than they held 10 months ago , when crude oil was $ 70 / barrel .
Ditto for the large long speculators and smaller ( unreported ) traders on the NYMEX , according to CFTC data in the Commitment of Traders Report ( COT ) .
The data clearly shows that long traders on the NYMEX have not been buying aggressively and running up the price of crude .
Well , if speculators are behind the recent sharp run-up in oil prices and the long - side traders haven�t been buying , then who has been buying oil ?
The answer is painfully obvious - the speculative shorts have been doing the buying .
Public COT data proves this .
The buying back of previously sold short futures contracts , primarily in the commercial category , account for the bulk of the buying over the past eight months or so , when oil was trading at $ 70 .
There is always a short for every long position in every commodity futures contract .
When enough longs panic and sell aggressively , prices plummet .
When enough shorts panic and buy back their short positions aggressively , prices soar .
Oil prices didn�t jump sharply because many new longs came into the market .
They jumped because , at the margin , enough shorts panicked and bought back contracts they previously sold short , to prevent their losses from getting larger .
So while I agree that speculation caused oil prices to jump sharply , at least we should correctly identify which speculators did the buying .
It was the shorts , not the longs .
In fact , the data shows that the longs were selling .
That �s not to say that oil prices won�t plunge in the future .
They will , when enough longs panic and sell .
To a large extent , this is the trading pattern of most markets .
By correctly identifying the real cause of the recent price spike caused by the speculative oil buying , we come to the real hidden problem with speculation .
That problem is that large numbers of shorts are , effectively , trapped with their short positions .
The shorts are trapped because the index funds buy and hold for the long term .
That doesn�t mean prices can�t go down sharply while the index funds are long .
For example , the wheat market rose almost 100 % and then fell by 40 % with hardly a change in the index funds� large position .
But because the index funds hold and don�t sell , regardless of whether prices rise or fall , large numbers of shorts can�t exit their short positions , even if prices fall .
And when prices do fall , there are no complaints about index funds , just when prices rise .
Recently , some commentators have labeled the index funds as not playing fairly , because they don�t sell , but instead invest for the long term .
But there is no rule that anyone can�t invest in futures for the long term .
The index funds were clear in their intentions as they came into the futures market over the past several years .
Everyone knew beforehand how they behaved and they certainly didn�t sneak into the market ; because they were so big , you could see them coming a mile away .
The shorts initially licked their chops , because they knew the index funds wouldn�t demand delivery and therefore attempt to squeeze the shorts .
The shorts also knew the index funds would have to roll over their positions constantly , giving the shorts an opportunity to extort spread advantages due to the mandatory roll - over behavior of the index funds .
But there is such a thing as the law of unintended consequences , and that law has prevailed in the trading dance between the index funds and the shorts .
When the index funds initially established their positions in oil or grain futures , there was no extreme tight supply / demand situation .
That�s why great numbers of shorts sold into the index fund buying .
But then conditions tightened up and the shorts appear to be on the wrong side and are looking for a way out .
The easiest solution for the shorts is to have the regulators mandate that the index funds sell .
The real story should be told .
It doesn�t seem fair to me to label the index funds as the real speculators when they back their purchases with the full cash value of the contracts and hold for the long term , while casting the short speculators masquerading as commercials , who are out for a quick buck , as innocent victims .
If the regulators want to change the rules against the index funds , let them do so .
Just don�t pretend these funds are evil and the short speculators are without blame .
If we get shortages in oil or grain or anything else , prices will go higher , with or without the index funds .
I do have an interest in silver ( and gold ) , so I would like to relate what I think all this index fund business means to those metals .
There is no index fund participation in COMEX gold and silver futures ( the index funds buy gold and silver through the ETFs and directly ) .
This can be confirmed by observing the consistently small gross and net ( ex spreads ) long positions in the commercial category of the COT reports ( the index funds are included in this category for all commodities ) .
So , first and foremost , any arbitrary edict to limit index fund long commodity futures positions will not involve liquidation of gold and silver futures , because there are none to liquidate .
In fact , any such across the board order of index fund futures contract liquidation may so limit the choices of where to invest by large participants , that it could result in more , not less , buying in precious metals .
Increasingly , I have been struck with the thought , independent of the index fund discussion , of just how few good real alternatives are available for investment , other than silver .
Although there is no index fund participation in gold and silver futures trading , there is a somewhat similar short situation connecting all the markets .
There is a true speculative connection present in most markets that is hidden and excluded from current debate .
That connection is the existence of a large number of shorts who are trapped and can�t easily fulfill the contract delivery requirements , nor extricate themselves from their short obligations by buying back their contracts .
This is the real , but unspoken , motivation in the current index fund debate .
How can the shorts be secretly rescued from the folly of their own creation that threatens to send many prices explosively higher ?
Nowhere is the problem of the trapped shorts more extreme than in COMEX silver ( and secondarily , gold ) .
Precisely because there is no index fund long presence in COMEX silver futures , the problem for the shorts is worse .
That �s because the corresponding long position is relatively diverse and not subject to an arbitrary edict of forced liquidation .
The big shorts in COMEX silver and gold probably wish there was an index fund , or some other big concentrated long position , that they could attack and lobby against to get the shorts off the hook .
But the real situation , to the shorts � dismay , is as opposite as it can get .
While it is my contention that there is a large contingent of short positions trapped in many commodities , only in COMEX silver and gold is that trapped position held in a super - concentrated form .
This elevates and intensifies the problem to the highest level .
Whereas there is much debate about too much speculation in our markets , like oil , there is no talk of concentration or the intent to manipulate , two vital components in manipulation .
That �s because there is no concentration or intent to manipulate in most markets .
Except , of course , in silver ( and gold ) .
In other words , while I think the shorts should be more readily blamed for the sudden spike in oil prices , for example , I don�t think that they intentionally manipulated prices upward , or that they held a concentrated position .
Common sense and public data confirm this .
But that same common sense and public data confirm the opposite in silver and gold , namely , an intentional and documented short - side manipulation .
The data contained in the COTs clearly indicates that the concentration held on the short side in COMEX silver and gold is head and shoulders above the concentration on the short side of oil or any market that has come under the accusation of speculative manipulation .
And this is true whether you look at it either in percentage of the entire market terms or in terms of days of world production .
In the most recent COT for positions held as of June 3 , the percentage of the entire NYMEX crude oil futures market held net by the 8 largest shorts was 12.8 % .
This concentration percentage is generally low compared to most other futures markets , mainly because the crude oil market is one of the largest futures markets around .
But it is striking compared to the concentrations in silver and gold .
The reported concentration of the 8 largest short traders in silver is 53.8 % and 57.2 % in gold , each more than 4 times the reported short concentration in oil .
And remember , these reported figures grossly understate the real concentrations in these markets , once you remove all the spread transactions , and make the comparisons more stark .
Removing all the spreads in crude oil raises the true net concentration of the 8 largest short traders to maybe 19 % of the entire market , while the silver percentage jumps to 79 % and gold jumps to a new record of 84 % , How 8 traders controlling 79 % and 84 % of an entire market can not be manipulation , in and of itself , is beyond me .
In terms of equivalent days of world production , the comparisons are off the charts .
In crude oil , the 8 largest short traders represent 2 days of world oil production ( 174 million barrels held short vs. 85 million barrels daily production ) .
In gold , the 8 traders hold short 103 days of world mine production ( 22.8 million ounces vs. 220,000 daily world mine production ) .
In silver , the 8 largest traders hold short 183 days of world mine production ( 330 million ounces vs. 1.8 million ounces daily mine production ) .
Under this comparison , gold has a concentrated short position more than 50 times the concentration in oil , while silver is 90 times more concentrated than oil .
This is simply astounding .
Now here comes the most important message of this piece .
If you think I �m just complaining about the super short concentration in silver and gold in terms of proving they are manipulated in price , you are only partially correct .
I want to convey something else .
If you agree with my premise that the most plausible explanation for the sudden sharp jump in crude oil prices was due to some panicky short covering , then I ask you to contemplate just what is likely to be the price result when some big shorts try to buy back silver ?
Yes , I rant and rave about the manipulative and depressing impact of the concentrated short position in silver , as I believe I should , but there are big benefits in this manipulation .
The price - support this short position places below the market and the explosive effect it will have on prices yet to be , must not be underappreciated .
If such a small amount of short - covering in such a large market , like oil , can have such a big impact on price , it is hard to imagine what the impact on price might be from a large amount of short covering in such a small market as silver .
This is the bullish beauty of the short concentration in silver ( and gold ) .
Because the concentrated position is so large ( on both a percentage and real world basis ) and held by so few participants , any short covering by any of these short traders is virtually guaranteed to impact prices profoundly .
Much more profoundly than what we have witnessed in oil .
In fact , it is the growing extreme concentration that should tell everyone that the game is coming to an end .
That fewer and fewer traders want anything to do with the short side in silver ( and gold ) means that the manipulators are growing more isolated and desperate .
If silver and gold were such attractive free market short candidates , more and more participants would be shorting them , not less .
And to those who think these short traders are so powerful and in control , that they can extend the manipulation in silver indefinitely , please think again .
What assures that the short manipulators will fail for sure , at some point , are the realities of the physical realm .
The shorts can play all the paper games in the world , but the moment a wholesale physical shortage becomes evident , the shorts are toast .
I intend to publish information in the near future which should provide such evidence .
In the meantime , we must try to decipher and understand and learn from the events of the day as they occur .
I think oil prices recently shot up , just like wheat and cotton did not so long ago , because a number of shorts , at the margin , decided to buy back short positions in a hurry .
I know that the short position in silver is held by very few participants , so when they cover , it will not be an event measured at the margin .
It will be an event characterized by a change at the core of the market .
The short covering in oil , wheat and cotton are just a hint of what�s to come when the shorts cover in silver .

To have one trade union paralyse Hollywood was strange ; two doing it in quick succession feels like carelessness .
A threatened walkout by actors , which could begin as early as next week , is throwing major film and television studios into chaos .
The contract dispute , this time between the Screen Actors Guild ( SAG ) and their white - collar bosses , the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers ( AMPTP ) , is causing what industry experts have called a " virtual strike " .
Production deadlines for dozens of major projects have been scrapped amid growing signs that the SAG , which has 120,000 members , will fail to resolve its dispute before a deadline for industrial action on Tuesday next week .

Most major film shoots are now either being put on hold , or wrapping - up early to avoid disruption .
" No one is doing anything that finishes after 30 June , and nobody 's starting anything now , " one lawyer representing actors told The Hollywood Reporter .
" This is the impact of a strike already . "
Victims of the crisis include Sir Ridley Scott , who has delayed filming his Robin Hood remake , Nottingham , until late summer .
Martin Scorsese , Peter Jackson and Steven Soderbergh are meanwhile rushing to finish their current projects by 1 July .
Those films are Shutter Island , starring Leonardo DiCaprio , The Lovely Bones and The Informant .
Other stars who are likely to have a busy week include Will Ferrell ( currently working on Land of the Lost ) , together with Seth Rogen ( Observe and Report ) , and the James Bond actor Daniel Craig .
The entire cast of High School Musical 3 ; GI Joe ; When in Rome and Disney 's Race to Witch Mountain are also racing to complete shoots before any picket lines appear .
At issue in the SAG dispute are almost 70 elements of a proposed new contract with the major studios that is being haggled over at AMPTP 's headquarters in Sherman Oaks , Los Angeles .
Bones of contention are said to include payments for film and video clips screened online , the issue that was at the heart of the previous writers ' dispute .
With no resolution on the horizon , several major projects are planning to suspend actual filming and work on special effects for however long it takes to resolve the dispute .
The Transformers sequel is about to begin a planned hiatus , along with Angels & Demons , the follow up to The DaVinci Code .
On television , the autumn season for dozens of network shows , which was already knocked out of schedule by the 100 - day writers ' crisis , now faces renewed chaos .
The hit show Gossip Girl is in the middle of filming its second series .
Army Wives , Saving Grace , The Closer and Monk are also mid-production , while 24 has decided not to chance its arm and cancelled an entire year of shows .

Whatever happens , the " summer of discontent " could not have come at a worse time for an industry that is counting the cost of its first strike in 20 years .
The Milken Institute , a Californian economic think - tank , recently estimated that the state would already lose about $ 2.1 bn ( £ 1.07 bn ) in output as well as 37,000 jobs by the end of the year .
" Even if the actors strike does n't happen , there is already an economic impact going on which is currently affecting production schedules , " said the study 's author , Kevin Klowden .
" Even a smaller strike would slow down the recovery . "
The dispute has gained added importance in trade union circles because SAG 's smaller rival union Aftra recently concluded contract negotiations with the AMPTP .
In a Monty - Python style dispute , SAG is now attempting to prevent Aftra 's members endorsing that deal .
" We 're frustrated and discouraged that the talks have stalled because SAG's Hollywood leadership is focused on its campaign to interfere with the affair of a fellow union , " said AMPTP 's spokesman , Jesse Hiestand , yesterday .
" The producers remain committed to avoiding another harmful , unnecessary strike and to reaching another fair and forward - looking labour agreement . "
Whatever happens , those worst hit by any disruption will be actors and technical staff .
The Actors Fund , a charity that assists film - industry employees who have fallen on hard times , said yesterday that it has received 800 requests for support already this year , more than four times its usual level .
" Usually we give out $ 250 - $ 350,000 a year in emergency financial assistance in Los Angeles , " said a spokesman .
" This year , we 've already given out $ 1.2 m .
If this new strike happens , it will be devastating for people . "
George Clooney recently donated $ 25,000 to the Actors Fund , but other major stars are actively lobbying to prevent the strike .
Tom
Hanks recently took a full - page advert out in Variety urging both sides in the dispute to mend their differences , while T R Knight , the star of Grey 's Anatomy ( another show that begins filming this week ) told a recent interviewer : " I support my union , but I 'm hopeful that it 's going to resolve this because it 's not time for another strike . "
The turmoil may also spill over into the political arena .
California 's Governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger – who is a SAG member – was the subject of a heated editorial in yesterday 's Los Angeles Times criticising his failure to intervene in the dispute .
" We saw how you handled the writers ' strike ...
It was , frankly , kind of a girlie- man performance , " it read .
Food waste contributes to landfill , creating methane gas People are needlessly throwing away 3.6 m tonnes of food each year in England and Wales , research suggests .
The Waste & Resources Action Programme ( WRAP ) found that salad , fruit and bread were most commonly wasted and 60 % of all dumped food was untouched .
The study analysed the waste disposed of by 2,138 households .
Environment Minister Joan Ruddock said the findings were " staggering " at a time of global food shortages and WRAP added it was an environmental issue .
' Value of food '
The study found that £ 9bn of avoidable food waste was disposed of in England and Wales each year .
It is mostly food that could have been consumed if it had been better stored or managed , or had not been left uneaten on a plate .
Much of that food waste goes into landfill rather than into council food disposal and composting programmes , it said .
There are climate change costs to all of us of growing , processing , packaging , transporting , and refrigerating food that only ends up in the bin
Joan Ruddock , Environment Minister Based on the data for England and Wales , WRAP estimated that householders across the UK throw away £ 10.2 bn of avoidable food waste every year .
Using the same extrapolation , they also estimated the average UK household needlessly throws away 18 % of all food purchased .
Families with children throw away 27 % .
The study also suggested £ 1bn worth of food wasted in the UK was still " in date " .
Nearly a quarter , in terms of cost , was disposed of because the " use by " or " best before " date had expired .
Liz Goodwin , chief executive of WRAP , said food waste had " a significant environmental impact .

" It highlights that this is an economic and social issue , as well as about how much we understand the value of our food . "
Yoghurts and chickens
The study also found that : Bakery goods made up 19 % , by weight , of all avoidable food waste .
Vegetables contributed 18 % .
Meat and fish also made up a large proportion - 18 % - of the total money wasted on food .
WRAP said 5,500 whole chickens were thrown away each day in the UK .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This amount of waste is truly disgusting Mark , UK
" Mixed foods " like ready meals made up 21 % of the total cost of waste , with 440,000 thrown away each day .
The two most significantly wasted foods that could have been eaten were potatoes and bread
Yoghurt was a commonly abandoned product , with an estimated 1.3 m unopened pots disposed of each day .
WRAP receives government funding from England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .

The body says The Food We Waste survey is the first of its kind in the world , surveying both household habits and the actual waste they throw away .
The survey interviewed 2,715 households in England and Wales and several weeks later , analysed the rubbish of 2,138 of them .
Ms Ruddock said : " This is costing consumers three times over .
" Not only do they pay hard - earned money for food they do n't eat , there is also the cost of dealing with the waste this creates .
" And there are climate change costs to all of us of growing , processing , packaging , transporting , and refrigerating food that only ends up in the bin . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ Flabbergasted ” NASA scientists said on Thursday that Martian soil appeared to contain the requirements to support life , although more work would be needed to prove it .
The Robotic Arm on NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander carries a scoop of Martian soil bound for the spacecraft 's microscope in handout photo released on June 13 , 2008 .

Scientists working on the Phoenix Mars Lander mission , which has already found ice on the planet , said preliminary analysis by the lander ’s instruments on a sample of soil scooped up by the spacecraft ’s robotic arm had shown it to be much more alkaline than expected .
“ We basically have found what appears to be the requirements , the nutrients , to support life whether past present or future , ” Sam Kounaves , the lead investigator for the wet chemistry laboratory on Phoenix , told journalists .
“ It is the type of soil you would probably have in your back yard , you know , alkaline .
You might be able to grow asparagus in it really well .
...
It is very exciting for us . ”
The 1 cubic meter ( 35 cubic feet ) of soil was taken from about 1 inch below the surface of Mars and had a pH , or alkaline , level of 8 or 9 .
“ We were all flabbergasted at the data we got back , ” Kounaves said .
Pressed on whether there was still any doubt that life existed on Mars in some form , Kounaves said the results were “ very preliminary ” and more analysis was needed .
But he added : “ There is nothing about the soil that would preclude life .
In fact , it seems very friendly ... there is nothing about it that is toxic . ”
The $ 420 million Phoenix lander touched down in the north pole region of Mars on May 25 after a 10 - month journey from Earth .
It is the latest NASA bid to determine whether water -- a crucial ingredient for life -- ever flowed on the planet and whether life , even in the form of mere microbes , exists or ever existed there .
Scientists said last week they had definitive proof that ice was on the planet after eight dice - sized chunks were seen melting away in a series of photographs .
Analysis in the past 24 hours of soil placed in the spacecraft ’s wet chemistry laboratory showed it to be less acidic than many scientists expected .
It also contained traces of magnesium , sodium , potassium and other elements , they said .
When told the pH levels , one colleague “ jumped up and down as if he had the winning lottery ticket , ” mission soil analysis specialist Michael Hecht told a telephone news conference .
“ It is a huge step forward , ” Hecht said , adding the “ wet chemistry ” technique , which involves mixing Martian soil with water brought from Earth , was aimed at discovering what native Martian microbes might be able to live , survive and grow in the soil .
The mission scientists said levels of salt were reasonable and the calcium levels appeared to be low but they warned that the composition of the soil could change at deeper levels below the surface .
They also would not be drawn on what form of life the Martian soil might have supported .
Something I have long known about myself is that I have the heart of a follower — I am really a prime target for the right cult leader .

IBM supercomputer uses PS3 Cell CPUs to break Petaflop barrier
Not exactly a computer you can pick up at your local Circuit City , but we ’ll make an exception for something that can break the petaflop barrier .
IBM ’s Roadrunner can fathom in excess of 1.026 quadrillion calculations per second , which makes it twice as fast as the company ’s previous machine , Blue Gene / L , that topped out at a measly 478.2 teraflops .
The silicon behind the massive figures is an interesting mixture of standard Opteron processors – almost 7,000 of them in fact – and almost 13,000 cell chips , initially designed for the PS3 .
Designed by IBM , Sony , Toshiba and others , the cell CPUs consist of eight cores running at more than 4GHz ; they ’ve been modified for more specialist calculations and to cope with higher data bandwidth .
It ’s the cells that work through the real data under analysis , while the Opeterons churn away keeping the whole system running properly .
Roadrunner is yet to be classified , but once that is done it will be set to work monitoring the US nuclear stockpile from a lab in New Mexico .
It wo n’t be a small lab either : fully assembled , the supercomputer takes up 288 refrigerator - sized cases and is inter-connected by 57 miles ( 92 km ) of fibre optic cable .
Around three megawatts of power are needed to keep it running .
IBM are currently working on a replacement for Blue Gene / L , also set to break the petaflop barrier , called Blue Gene / P .
It ’s hard to convince most Americans that there is a silver lining to $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline .
But General Motors provided a nugget of good news when it announced that it would shutter much of its production of pickups and sport utility vehicles  and might even get rid of the Hummer , the relative of the Abrams tank unleashed on the streets in the cheap - gas days of the 1990s .
It ’s hardly the solution to global warming , or the country ’s dependence on imported oil , but it ’s a start .
Playing the urban warrior in a Hummer was a fairly inexpensive thrill when a gallon of gas cost just over $ 1 .
But at $ 4 a gallon , driving a full - powered Hummer H3 or a big Ford F - 150 would cost a typical driver , who drives 15,000 miles a year , almost $ 4,300 in gas .
This is more than 10 percent of the median earnings of full - time workers and about $ 2,200 more than it would cost to drive the same distance in a Honda Civic .
By May , there were signs that the S.U.V. - era was over .
For the first time , Detroit ’s Big Three automakers and their trucks were outsold in the United States by fuel - efficient cars made by Asian companies .
And monthly sales of Ford ’s muscular F - series pickups fell by a third , bumping it five spots from its previous perch as America ’s best - selling vehicle , behind the Honda Civic , the Toyota Corolla , the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord .
It was the first time since December 1992 that a car , not a truck , claimed the top spot in monthly sales .

[ This classic piece appeared in Ramparts , VI , 4 , June 15 , 1968 .
It was the fulfillment of an ideological trend that began a few years earlier when consistent libertarians , led by Rothbard , sensed an estrangement from the American right - wing due to its support of militarism , police power , and the corporate state .
Here Rothbard presents a rationale for why he and others had , by 1968 , largely given up on the Right as a viable reform movement toward liberty , realized that the Right was squarely on the side of power , and thereby developed an alternative intellectual historiography .
The relevance of this essay in our own time hardly needs to be explained , given the record on liberty of the Republican president , congress , and judiciary , to say nothing of conservative and right - wing media . ]
TWENTY YEARS AGO I was an extreme right - wing Republican , a young and lone " Neanderthal " ( as the liberals used to call us ) who believed , as one friend pungently put it , that " Senator Taft had sold out to the socialists . "
Today , I am most likely to be called an extreme leftist , since I favor immediate withdrawal from Vietnam , denounce U.S. imperialism , advocate Black Power and have just joined the new Peace and Freedom Party .
And yet my basic political views have not changed by a single iota in these two decades !
It is obvious that something is very wrong with the old labels , with the categories of " left " and " right , " and with the ways in which we customarily apply these categories to American political life .
My personal odyssey is unimportant ; the important point is that if I can move from " extreme right " to " extreme left " merely by standing in one place , drastic though unrecognized changes must have taken place throughout the American political spectrum over the last generation .
I joined the right - wing movement — to give a formal name to a very loose and informal set of associations — as a young graduate student shortly after the end of World War II .
There was no question as to where the intellectual right of that day stood on militarism and conscription : it opposed them as instruments of mass slavery and mass murder .
Conscription , indeed , was thought far worse than other forms of statist controls and incursions , for while these only appropriated part of the individual 's property , the draft , like slavery , took his most precious possession : his own person .
Day after day the veteran publicist John T. Flynn — once praised as a liberal and then condemned as a reactionary , with little or no change in his views — inveighed implacably in print and over the radio against militarism and the draft .
Even the Wall Street newspaper , the Commercial and Financial Chronicle , published a lengthy attack on the idea of conscription .
All of our political positions , from the free market in economics to opposing war and militarism , stemmed from our root belief in individual liberty and our opposition to the state .
Simplistically , we adopted the standard view of the political spectrum : " left " meant socialism , or total power of the state ; the further " right " one went the less government one favored .
Hence , we called ourselves " extreme rightists . "
Originally , our historical heroes were such men as Jefferson , Paine , Cobden , Bright and Spencer ; but as our views became purer and more consistent , we eagerly embraced such near - anarchists as the voluntarist , Auberon Herbert , and the American individualist - anarchists , Lysander Spooner and Benjamin R. Tucker .
One of our great intellectual heroes was Henry David Thoreau , and his essay , " Civil Disobedience , " was one of our guiding stars .
Right - wing theorist Frank Chodorov devoted an entire issue of his monthly , Analysis , to an appreciation of Thoreau .
In our relation to the remainder of the American political scene , we of course recognized that the extreme right of the Republican Party was not made up of individualist anti-statists , but they were close enough to our position to make us feel part of a quasi-libertarian united front .
Enough of our views were present among the extreme members of the Taft wing of the Republican Party ( much more so than in Taft himself , who was among the most liberal of that wing ) , and in such organs as the Chicago Tribune , to make us feel quite comfortable with this kind of alliance .
What is more , the right - wing Republicans were major opponents of the Cold War .
Valiantly , the extreme rightist Republicans , who were particularly strong in the House , battled conscription , NATO and the Truman Doctrine .
Consider , for example , Omaha 's Representative Howard Buffett , Senator Taft 's midwestern campaign manager in 1952 .
He was one of the most extreme of the extremists , once described by The Nation as " an able young man whose ideas have tragically fossilized . "
I came to know Buffett as a genuine and thoughtful libertarian .
Attacking the Truman Doctrine on the floor of Congress , he declared : " Even if it were desirable , America is not strong enough to police the world by military force .
If that attempt is made , the blessings of liberty will be replaced by coercion and tyranny at home .
Our Christian ideals cannot be exported to other lands by dollars and guns . "
When the Korean War came , almost the entire old left , with the exception of the Communist Party , surrendered to the global mystique of the United Nations and " collective security against aggression , " and backed Truman 's imperialist aggression in that war .
Even Corliss Lamont backed the American stand in Korea .
Only the extreme rightist Republicans continued to battle U.S. imperialism .
It was the last great political outburst of the old right of my youth .
Howard Buffett was convinced that the United States was largely responsible for the eruption of conflict in Korea ; for the rest of his life he tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate Armed Services Committee to declassify the testimony of CIA head Admiral Hillenkoeter , which Buffett told me established American responsibility for the Korean outbreak .
The last famous isolationist move came late in December 1950 , after the Chinese forces had beaten the Americans out of North Korea .
Joseph P. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover delivered two ringing speeches back - to - back calling for American evacuation of Korea .
As Hoover put it , " To commit the sparse ground forces of the non-communist nations into a land war against this communist land mass [ in Asia ] would be a war without victory , a war without a successful political terminal . . . that would be the graveyard of millions of American boys " and the exhaustion of the United States .
Joe Kennedy declared that " if portions of Europe or Asia wish to go communistic or even have communism thrust upon them , we can not stop it . "
To this The Nation replied with typical liberal Red- baiting : " The line they are laying down for their country should set the bells ringing in the Kremlin as nothing has since the triumph of Stalingrad " ; and the New Republic actually saw Stalin sweeping onwards " until the Stalinist caucus in the Tribune Tower would bring out in triumph the first communist edition of the Chicago Tribune . "
The main catalyst for transforming the mass base of the right wing from an isolationist and quasi-libertarian movement to an anti-communist one was probably " McCarthyism . "
Before Senator Joe McCarthy launched his anti-communist crusade in February 1950 , he had not been particularly associated with the right wing of the Republican Party ; on the contrary , his record was liberal and centrist , statist rather than libertarian .
Furthermore , Red-baiting and anti-communist witch hunting were originally launched by liberals , and even after McCarthy the liberals were the most effective at this game .
It was , after all , the liberal Roosevelt Administration which passed the Smith Act , first used against Trotskyites and isolationists during World War II and then against communists after the war ; it was the liberal Truman Administration that instituted loyalty checks ; it was the eminently liberal Hubert Humphrey who was a sponsor of the clause in the McCarran Act of 1950 threatening concentration camps for " subversives . "
McCarthy not only shifted the focus of the right to communist hunting , however .
His crusade also brought into the right wing a new mass base .
Before McCarthy , the rank - and - file of the right wing was the small - town , isolationist middle west .
McCarthyism brought into the movement a mass of urban Catholics from the eastern seaboard , people whose outlook on individual liberty was , if anything , negative .
If McCarthy was the main catalyst for mobilizing the mass base of the new right , the major ideological instrument of the transformation was the blight of anti-communism , and the major carriers were Bill Buckley and National Review .
In the early days , young Bill Buckley often liked to refer to himself as an " individualist , " sometimes even as an " anarchist . "
But all these libertarian ideals , he maintained , had to remain in total abeyance , fit only for parlor discussion , until the great crusade against the " international communist conspiracy " had been driven to a successful conclusion .
Thus , as early as January 1952 , I noted with disquiet an article that Buckley wrote for Commonweal , " A Young Republican 's View . "
He began the article in a splendid libertarian manner : our enemy , he affirmed , was the state , which , he quoted Spencer , was " begotten of aggression and by aggression . "
But then came the worm in the apple : the anti-communist crusade had to be waged .
Buckley went on to endorse " the extensive and productive tax laws that are needed to support a vigorous anti-communist foreign policy " ; he declared that the " thus far invincible aggressiveness of the Soviet Union " imminently threatened American security , and that therefore " we have to accept Big Government for the duration — for neither an offensive nor a defensive war can be waged . . . except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within our shores . "
Therefore , he concluded — in the midst of the Korean War — we must all support " large armies and air forces , atomic energy , central intelligence , war production boards and the attendant centralization of power in Washington . "
The right wing , never articulate , has not had many organs of opinion .
Therefore , when Buckley founded National Review in late 1955 , its erudite , witty and glib editorials and articles swiftly made it the only politically relevant journal for the American right .
Immediately , the ideological line of the right began to change sharply .
One element that gave special fervor and expertise to the Red - baiting crusade was the prevalence of ex-communists , ex- fellow travelers and ex-Trotskyites among the writers whom National Review brought into prominence on the right - wing scene .
These ex-leftists were consumed with an undying hatred for their former love , along with a passion for bestowing enormous importance upon their apparently wasted years .
Almost the entire older generation of writers and editors for National Review had been prominent in the old left .
Some names that come to mind are : Jim Burnham , John Chamberlain , Whittaker Chambers , Ralph DeToledano , Will Herberg , Eugene Lyons , J. B. Matthews , Frank S. Meyer , William S. Schlamm and Karl Wittfogel .
An insight into the state of mind of many of these people came in a recent letter to me from one of the most libertarian of this group ; he admitted that my stand in opposition to the draft was the only one consistent with libertarian principles , but , he said , he can't forget how nasty the communist cell in Time magazine was in the 1930's .
The world is falling apart and yet these people are still mired in the petty grievances of faction fights of long ago !
Anti-communism was the central root of the decay of the old libertarian right , but it was not the only one .
In 1953 , a big splash was made by the publication of Russell Kirk 's The Conservative Mind .
Before that , no one on the right regarded himself as a " conservative " ; " conservative " was considered a left smear word .
Now , suddenly , the right began to glory in the term " conservative , " and Kirk began to make speaking appearances , often in a kind of friendly " vital center " tandem with Arthur Schlesinger Jr .
This was to be the beginning of the burgeoning phenomenon of the friendly - though - critical dialogue between the liberal and conservative wings of the Great Patriotic American Consensus .
A new , younger generation of rightists , of " conservatives , " began to emerge , who thought that the real problem of the modern world was nothing so ideological as the state vs. individual liberty or government intervention vs. the free market ; the real problem , they declared , was the preservation of tradition , order , Christianity and good manners against the modern sins of reason , license , atheism and boorishness .
One of the first dominant thinkers of this new right was Buckley 's brother - in - law , L. Brent Bozell , who wrote fiery articles in National Review attacking liberty even as an abstract principle ( and not just as something to be temporarily sacrificed for the benefit of the anti-communist emergency ) .
The function of the state was to impose and enforce moral and religious principles .
Another repellent political theorist who made his mark in National Review was the late Willmoore Kendall , NR editor for many years .
His great thrust was the right and the duty of the majority of the community — as embodied , say , in Congress — to suppress any individual who disturbs that community with radical doctrines .
Socrates , opined Kendall , not only should have been killed by the Greek community , whom he offended by his subversive criticisms , but it was their moral duty to kill him .
The historical heroes of the new right were changing rapidly .
Mencken , Nock , Thoreau , Jefferson , Paine — all these either dropped from sight or were soundly condemned as rationalists , atheists or anarchists .
From Europe , the " in " people were now such despotic reactionaries as Burke , Metternich , DeMaistre ; in the United States , Hamilton and Madison were " in , " with their stress on the imposition of order and a strong , elitist central government — which included the southern " slavocracy . "
For the first few years of its existence , I moved in National Review circles , attended its editorial luncheons , wrote articles and book reviews for the magazine ; indeed , there was talk at one time of my joining the staff as an economics columnist .
I became increasingly alarmed , however , as NR and its friends grew in strength because I knew , from innumerable conversations with rightist intellectuals , what their foreign policy goal was .
They never quite dared to state it publicly , although they would slyly imply it and would try to whip the public up to the fever pitch of demanding it .
What they wanted — and still want — was nuclear annihilation of the Soviet Union .
They want to drop that Bomb on Moscow .
( Of course , on Peking and Hanoi too , but for your veteran anti-communist — especially back then — it is Russia which supplies the main focus of his venom . )
A prominent editor of National Review once told me : " I have a vision , a great vision of the future : a totally devastated Soviet Union . "
I knew that it was this vision that really animated the new conservatism .
In response to all this , and seeing peace as the crucial political issue , a few friends and I became Stevensonian Democrats in 1960 .
I watched with increasing horror as the right wing , led by National Review , continually grew in strength and moved ever closer to real political power .
Having broken emotionally with the right wing , our tiny group of libertarians began to rethink many of our old , unexamined premises .
First , we restudied the origins of the Cold War , we read our D.F.
Fleming and we concluded , to our considerable surprise , that the United States was solely at fault in the Cold War , and that Russia was the aggrieved party .
And this meant that the great danger to the peace and freedom of the world came not from Moscow or " international communism , " but from the U.S. and its Empire stretching across and dominating the world .
And then we studied the foul European conservatism that had taken over the right wing ; here we had statism in a virulent form , and yet no one could possibly think these conservatives to be " leftist . "
But this meant that our simple " left/ total government — right / no government " continuum was altogether wrong and that our whole identification of ourselves as " extreme rightists " must contain a basic flaw .
Plunging back into history , we again concentrated on the reality that in the 19th century , laissez - faire liberals and radicals were on the extreme left and our ancient foes , the conservatives , on the right .
My old friend and libertarian colleague Leonard Liggio then came up with the following analysis of the historical process .
First there was the old order , the ancien régime , the regime of caste and frozen status , of exploitation by a despotic ruling class , using the church to dupe the masses into accepting its rule .
This was pure statism ; this was the right wing .
Then , in 17th and 18th century western Europe , a liberal and radical opposition movement arose , our heroes , who championed a popular revolutionary movement on behalf of rationalism , individual liberty , minimal government , free markets , international peace and separation of church and state , in opposition to throne and altar , to monarchy , the ruling class , theocracy and war .
These — " our people " — were the left , and the purer their vision the more " extreme " they were .
So far so good ; but what of socialism , which we had always considered the extreme left ?
Where did that fit in ?
Liggio analyzed socialism as a confused middle - of - the - road movement , influenced historically by both the libertarian left and the conservative right .
From the individualist left the socialists took the goals of freedom : the withering away of the state , the replacement of the governing of men by the administration of things , opposition to the ruling class and a search for its overthrow , the desire to establish international peace , an advanced industrial economy and a high standard of living for the mass of the people .
From the right the socialists adopted the means to achieve these goals — collectivism , state planning , community control of the individual .
This put socialism in the middle of the ideological spectrum .
It also meant that socialism was an unstable , self - contradictory doctrine bound to fly apart in the inner contradiction between its means and ends .
Our analysis was greatly bolstered by our becoming familiar with the new and exciting group of historians who studied under University of Wisconsin historian William Appleman Williams .
From them we discovered that all of us free marketeers had erred in believing that somehow , down deep , Big Businessmen were really in favor of laissez - faire , and that their deviations from it , obviously clear and notorious in recent years , were either " sellouts " of principle to expediency or the result of astute maneuverings by liberal intellectuals .
This is the general view on the right ; in the remarkable phrase of Ayn Rand , Big Business is " America 's most persecuted minority . "
Persecuted minority , indeed !
Sure , there were thrusts against Big Business in the old McCormick Chicago Tribune and in the writings of Albert Jay Nock ; but it took the Williams - Kolko analysis to portray the true anatomy and physiology of the American scene .
As Kolko pointed out , all the various measures of federal regulation and welfare statism that left and right alike have always believed to be mass movements against Big Business are not only now backed to the hilt by Big Business , but were originated by it for the very purpose of shifting from a free market to a cartelized economy that would benefit it .
Imperialistic foreign policy and the permanent garrison state originated in the Big Business drive for foreign investments and for war contracts at home .
The role of the liberal intellectuals is to serve as " corporate liberals , " weavers of sophisticated apologias to inform the masses that the heads of the American corporate state are ruling on behalf of the " common good " and the " general welfare " — like the priest in the Oriental despotism who convinced the masses that their emperor was all - wise and divine .
Since the early ' 60s , as the National Review right has moved nearer to political power , it has jettisoned its old libertarian remnants and has drawn ever closer to the liberals of the Great American Consensus .
Evidence of this abounds .
There is Bill Buckley 's ever - widening popularity in the mass media and among liberal intellectuals , as well as widespread admiration on the intellectual right for people and groups it once despised : for the New Leader , for Irving Kristol , for the late Felix Frankfurter ( who always opposed judicial restraint on government invasions of individual liberty ) , for Hannah Arendt and Sidney Hook .
Despite occasional bows to the free market , conservatives have come to agree that economic issues are unimportant ; they therefore accept — or at least do not worry about — the major outlines of the Keynesian welfare - warfare state of liberal corporatism .
On the domestic front , virtually the only conservative interests are to suppress Negroes ( " shoot looters , " " crush those riots " ) , to call for more power for the police so as not to " shield the criminal " ( i.e. , not to protect his libertarian rights ) , to enforce prayer in the public schools , to put Reds and other subversives and " seditionists " in jail and to carry on the crusade for war abroad .
There is little in the thrust of this program with which liberals can now disagree ; any disagreements are tactical or matters of degree only .
Even the Cold War — including the war in Vietnam — was begun and maintained and escalated by the liberals themselves .
No wonder that liberal Daniel Moynihan — a national board member of ADA incensed at the radicalism of the current anti-war and Black Power movements — should recently call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives , since after all they basically agree on these , the two crucial issues of our time !
Even Barry Goldwater has gotten the message ; in January 1968 in National Review , Goldwater concluded an article by affirming that he is not against liberals , that liberals are needed as a counterweight to conservatism , and that he had in mind a fine liberal like Max Lerner — Max Lerner , the epitome of the old left , the hated symbol of my youth !
In response to our isolation from the right , and noting the promising signs of libertarian attitudes in the emerging new left , a tiny band of us ex-rightist libertarians founded the " little journal , " Left and Right , in the spring of 1965 .
We had two major purposes : to make contact with libertarians already on the new left and to persuade the bulk of libertarians or quasi-libertarians who remained on the right to follow our example .
We have been gratified in both directions : by the remarkable shift toward libertarian and anti-statist positions of the new left , and by the significant number of young people who have left the right - wing movement .
This left / right tendency has begun to be noticeable on the new left , praised and damned by those aware of the situation .
( Our old colleague Ronald Hamowy , an historian at Stanford , set forth the left / right position in the New Republic collection , Thoughts of the Young Radicals ( 1966 ) .
We have received gratifying encouragement from Carl Oglesby who , in his Containment and Change ( 1967 ) , advocated a coalition of new left and old right , and from the young scholars grouped around the unfortunately now defunct Studies on the Left .
We 've also been criticized , if indirectly , by Staughton Lynd , who worries because our ultimate goals — free market as against socialism — differ .
Finally , liberal historian Martin Duberman , in a recent issue of Partisan Review , sharply criticizes SNCC and CORE for being " anarchists , " for rejecting the authority of the state , for insisting that community be voluntary , and for stressing , along with SDS , participatory instead of representative democracy .
Perceptively , if on the wrong side of the fence , Duberman then links SNCC and the new left with us old rightists : " SNCC and CORE , like the Anarchists , talk increasingly of the supreme importance of the individual .
They do so , paradoxically , in a rhetoric strongly reminiscent of that long associated with the right .
It could be Herbert Hoover . . . but it is in fact Rap Brown who now reiterates the Negro 's need to stand on his own two feet , to make his own decisions , to develop self - reliance and a sense of self - worth .
SNCC may be scornful of present - day liberals and ' statism , ' but it seems hardly to realize that the laissez - faire rhetoric it prefers derives almost verbatim from the classic liberalism of John Stuart Mill . "
Tough .
It could , I submit , do a lot worse .
I hope to have demonstrated why a few compatriots and I have shifted , or rather been shifted , from " extreme right " to " extreme left " in the past 20 years merely by staying in the same basic ideological place .
The right wing , once in determined opposition to Big Government , has now become the conservative wing of the American corporate state and its foreign policy of expansionist imperialism .
If we would salvage liberty from this deadening left / right fusion on the center , this needs be done through a counter - fusion of old right and new left .
James Burnham , an editor of National Review and its main strategic thinker in waging the " Third World War " ( as he entitles his column ) , the prophet of the managerial state ( in The Managerial Revolution ) , whose only hint of positive interest in liberty in a lifetime of political writing was a call for legalized firecrackers , recently attacked the dangerous trend among some young conservatives to make common cause with the left in opposing the draft .
Burnham warned that he learned in his Trotskyite days that this would be an " unprincipled " coalition , and he warned that if one begins by being anti-draft one might wind up opposed to the war in Vietnam : " And I rather think that some of them are at heart , or are getting to be , against the war .
Murray Rothbard has shown how right - wing libertarianism can lead to almost as anti-U.S. a position as left - wing libertarianism does .
And a strain of isolationism has always been endemic in the American right . "
This passage symbolizes how deeply the whole thrust of the right wing has changed in the last two decades .
Vestigial interest in liberty or in opposition to war and imperialism are now considered deviations to be stamped out without delay .
There are millions of Americans , I am convinced , who are still devoted to individual liberty and opposition to the leviathan state at home and abroad , Americans who call themselves " conservatives " but feel that something has gone very wrong with the old anti-New Deal and anti-Fair Deal cause .
Something has gone wrong : the right wing has been captured and transformed by elitists and devotees of the European conservative ideals of order and militarism , by witch hunters and global crusaders , by statists who wish to coerce " morality " and suppress " sedition . "
America was born in a revolution against Western imperialism , born as a haven of freedom against the tyrannies and despotism , the wars and intrigues of the old world .
Yet we have allowed ourselves to sacrifice the American ideals of peace and freedom and anti-colonialism on the altar of a crusade to kill communists throughout the world ; we have surrendered our libertarian birthright into the hands of those who yearn to restore the Golden Age of the Holy Inquisition .
It is about time that we wake up and rise up to restore our heritage .

Court rules strip - search of 13 - year old for ibuprofen unconstitutional Diane Sweet
Published : Saturday July 12 , 2008
Print This Email This The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Friday that schools may not strip - search students for drugs based on an unverified tip , overturning two previous rulings .
The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Savana Redding , an eighth grade honor roll student at Safford Middle School in Safford , Arizona , who was pulled from class on October 8 , 2003 by the school 's vice principal , Kerry Wilson to investigate whether she had violated a school policy prohibiting bringing medication -- even over - the - counter medication -- to school .
Wilson had discovered another student earlier with prescription - strength ibuprofen -- 400 milligram pills equivalent to two over - the - counter ibuprofen pills , such as Advil -- in the possession of Redding 's classmate .
Under questioning and faced with punishment , the classmate claimed that Redding , who had no history of disciplinary problems or substance abuse , had given her the pills .
After escorting Redding to his office , Wilson presented Redding with the ibuprofen pills and informed her of her classmate 's accusations .
Redding said she had never seen the pills before and agreed to a search of her possessions , wanting to prove she had nothing to hide .
Joined by a female school administrative assistant , Wilson searched Redding 's backpack and found nothing .
Instructed by Wilson , the administrative assistant then took Redding to the school nurse 's office in order to perform a strip search .
In the school nurse 's office , Redding was ordered to strip to her underwear .
She was then commanded to pull her bra out and to the side , exposing her breasts , and to pull her underwear out at the crotch , exposing her pelvic area .
The strip search failed to uncover any ibuprofen pills .
" The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had , " said Redding in a sworn affidavit following the incident .
" I held my head down so that they could not see that I was about to cry . "
" Common sense informs us that directing a 13 - year - old girl to remove her clothes , partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area , for allegedly possessing ibuprofen , an infraction that poses an imminent danger to no one , and which could have been handled by keeping her in the principal 's office until a parent arrived or simply sending her home , was excessively intrusive , " Wardlaw wrote , joined by Judges Harry Pregerson , Raymond C. Fisher , Richard A. Paez , Milan D. Smith Jr. and N. Randy Smith .
The court cited arguments by the National Assn. of Social Workers that strip searches of children " can result in serious emotional damage , including the development of , or increase in , oppositional behavior . "
" And all this to find prescription - strength ibuprofen , " Wardlaw wrote , noting that one pill has the strength of two over - the - counter Advil and might be commonly used by young women to treat menstrual cramps .
The ruling said that Assistant Principal Wilson was liable for monetary damages but that his aide and the school nurse were not because they were acting under his orders .
The ruling was applauded in a statement from the ACLU : " Students and parents nationwide can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that adolescents cannot be strip searched based on the unsubstantiated accusation of a classmate trying to get out of trouble , " said Adam Wolf , an attorney with the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project and co-counsel in the case with the law firms Humphrey & Petersen and McNamara , Goldsmith , Jackson & Macdonald .
" This ruling is a victory for our fundamental right to privacy , sending a clear signal that such traumatizing searches have no place in America 's schools . "
Steam as a motive force is both powerful and difficult to contain , but a team of Britons will be doing their best to topple the steam - powered land speed record with this amazing vapor - driven monster .
Granted , the FIA - recognized steam - powered land - speed record is only 127.66 mph­ and was set in 1906 ( the unofficial version is 145.607 MPH ) , but this thing hopes to crush that speed with an expected top-end of over 150 MPH .
That 's damn fast , particularly considering the rate at which you have to build steam to get moving that quickly .
The cool part about this machine is the lack of a big , locomotive - style boiler .
Instead , it uses a series of LPG - fired mini-boilers feeding a 360 HP Curtis turbine engine .

At the helm will be Don Wales , grandson of none other than land speed record legend Sir Malcolm Campbell ( who we 've mentioned before ) .
The team and the car will be making their way over to the Bonneville salt flats this summer to make an attempt fraught with sky - high blowing - up peril , but we image it 'll be a good show .

Few analysts expect that a concerted effort by producers and consumers will push down prices .
Still , the Saudi statement , while vague , helped prick the momentum of last week , when oil prices gained an unprecedented $ 16 a barrel over two days of trading .
Oil futures fell $ 4.19 on Monday to close at $ 134.35 a barrel .
The surge in fuel prices is turning into a major political issue with Democrats and Republicans competing to take action in Congress .
One bill considered in the Senate would allow the Justice Department to bring antitrust lawsuits against members of OPEC , which include Saudi Arabia , for withholding oil supplies and pushing up prices .
But even as oil declined , gasoline set a new high .
The national average price of a gallon of gas rose 1.8 cents overnight to $ 4.023 , according to AAA .
The average gas price rose above $ 4 a gallon for the first time on Sunday .
Saudi Arabia has been sending increasingly mixed signals in recent months , even as the run-up in oil prices has reached levels that would have seemed unimaginable just a few months ago .
Earlier this year , the Saudi monarch signaled that the kingdom would slow down oil expansion to preserve its hydrocarbon resources for future generations .
President Bush has visited Saudi Arabia twice this year and each time failed to secure a commitment from the Saudis to pump more oil into the market .
But some experts say that the Saudis are concerned about the impact of high prices on the American economy , the world ’s largest consumer of oil , and the growth in alternative fuels .
XTRA CRISPY
So the Bird was out for First Friday recently when it ran into Andrea Beesley - Brown , a.k.a. the Midnite Movie Mamacita , known for hosting splatter and grindhouse flicks at Chandler Cinemas , where she doubles as the operations manager .
The perky New Zealander told this tweeter a wacky tale of Crispin Glover 's visit to Sand Land to showcase his deeply weird art film What Is It ? , which features actors afflicted with Down syndrome , naked chicks , swastikas , and a butt - load of dead snails .
Glover brought his surreal celluloid romp to Chandler for a three - day run at the beginning of May .
And for fans of the quirky character actor , who 's given memorable performances in movies ranging from Back to the Future and Charlie 's Angels to Willard and River 's Edge , to name a few , it must 've been a Gloverama dream come true .
Info Crispin Glover
Before the flick 's screening , Glover narrated a long slideshow drawn in part from self - published scrapbooks such as Rat Catching and Oak Mott .
Afterward , Glover engaged the audience in a protracted Q & A and wound up signing autographs , taking pics , and chatting with long lines of slavish Glover - lovers .
" For $ 18 , it 's a very long night , " Beesley - Brown admitted to this avian .
" You get your money 's worth of Crispin .
You get to meet him and get your freaky photo with him .
He 'll sign stuff .
It 's a good value for the patron . "
But for those promoting and hosting the event , not so much , according to Beesley - Brown .
The lion 's share of the take went to Glover — $ 14 out of the $ 18 ticket price , and Glover 's food , in - town travel , and sundry expenses were covered by the event 's promoters .
Glover required a regular diet of sushi , and had the promoters man his merchandise booth and police the crowd for possible bootleggers filming his surreal , Luis Buñuel - esque film with smuggled - in camcorders .
There is but one 35 mm print of the film , as Glover has opted not to release it on DVD .
So piracy issues are a constant concern to the bizarre star .
The turd in the proverbial punch bowl was n't so much the financial arrangements , but having to deal with Glover 's sometimes prickly , demanding persona .
A couple of incidents in particular left a bitter aftertaste , insisted co-promoters Amy Young of Perihelion Arts gallery on Grand Avenue , Stephanie Carrico of the Phoenix performance - art venue Trunk Space , and Matt Yenkala , proprietor of Chandler Cinemas , a struggling indie multiplex offering $ 2 second - runs and revival fare such as Monty Python double features and screenings of bone - tinglers from Italian horror master Dario Argento .
In other words , Yenkala 's Chandler Cinemas ain't making no big money , and neither are scrappy art - fart types like Young and Carrico .
Perhaps that 's why Glover 's demand for his split in cash each night of the showing socked it to their collective pocketbook .
" We 're a struggling business , " Yenkala related to this yardbird .
" We 're doing our very best , but we were n't in a cash - ready position .
So we had to scramble as bit . "
Another problem was that many of the tickets had been sold online through a service that paid the promoters only after the fact .
So when Glover demanded to be paid up - front for that first - night ticket sales — or he would n't go onstage — the promoters freaked out .
" I was furious ! " recalled Beesley - Brown .
" It 's very difficult for us to come up with all that because we have to pull money from the safe , from the box office , from wherever we can .
So finally Matt managed to get all that money and give it to Crispin . "
Later , while the film was being shown , Glover was in the Chandler Cinema offices , meticulously counting his newly acquired wads of moolah , Beesley - Brown recalled .
" He wanted it in all the nice , new bills because he takes his money to the Czech Republic , where he has land or a castle or something , " Beesley - Brown claimed he told her .
" Apparently , he has to take all the nice bills over there because the Czechs wo n't take ripped bills . "
Glover 's personal take for the three nights was close to six grand , plus whatever he made off his merchandise , which seems like fairly measly pickings by Hollywood standards .
True , Glover ai n't no Brad Pitt , but he did appear in the recent box - office winner Beowulf as the monster Grendel , along with co-stars Angelina Jolie , Anthony Hopkins , and John Malkovich .
Glover also scored the promise of another $ 610 from Yenkala after an alleged meltdown in which Glover accused the theater 's young projectionist of messing up a small portion of his film , reducing her to tears , according to Yenkala and others present .
" He built himself up into this very stressed state of mind , pacing and gradually raising his voice , not really letting anyone have a word in edgewise , " stated Yenkala .
" He made it clear that he felt we had damaged his film and was n't going to be satisfied until we agreed that we were going to pay for the replacement . "
Yenkala reluctantly agreed to the demand to placate the persnickety character actor , even though Yenkala does n't believe the film was damaged on his premises .
This mockingbird e-mailed Glover about the whole episode , and the agitated B - lister immediately called Yenkala and accused the cinema owner of trying to ruin Glover 's career by talking to the press .
Glover eventually e-mailed The Bird back , giving his side of the kerfuffle .
" I did not yell at or even have a conversation with the projectionist other than getting the details of how my print was handled , " wrote Glover .
" My entire conversation after the show on Sunday was with Matthew M. Yenkala about the technical aspects and procedure that led to damaging reel five of my film . "
Glover went on to explain , in detail , his basis for concluding the film was damaged by the projectionist , and his theory about why the promoters are unfairly criticizing him .
( You can read Glover 's e-mails and the promoter 's e-mails on the Feathered Bastard blog . )
Glover also asserted he was nothing but professional during his sojourn in Sand Land , and that getting paid in cash up - front was part of his e-mailed requirements to the promoters before the event .
( Apparently , there was no formal contract . )
Yenkala provided The Bird with a copy of Glover 's technical " rider " for the appearance , which did n't include a demand upfront for the loot .
When e-mailed this rider by The Bird , Glover responded with his own version , which included a demand for payment in cash .
Yenkala responded that Glover 's version was n't what he received from the actor , and Carrico forwarded a copy of an e-mail from Glover to the promoters containing the version of the rider sans the cash request .
All the promoters say Glover 's insistence on a cash payment was new to them on the first night of his Chandler presentation .
This is n't the first time Glover 's pitched a fit over the showing of his art - house masterpiece .
In 2005 , the Tucson Weekly detailed how Glover " flipped his lid " at Tucson 's Loft Theater " after he learned that his directorial debut , What Is It ? , was going to be shown in the smaller upstairs theater rather than in the cavernous main auditorium for the last two days of its week - long engagement . "
And Glover 's known ( and in some quarters beloved ) for his eccentric behavior , like the infamous 1987 incident in which he kicked his platform shoes perilously close to David Letterman 's head during an appearance on Late Night , exclaiming , " I 'm strong . . . I can kick . "
Glover 's also had his beefs with Hollywood big shots like Steven Spielberg , who executive - produced Back to the Future , wherein Glover played milquetoast dad George McFly , father of Michael J. Fox 's character , Marty McFly .
According to the Internet Movie DataBase ( IMDb.com ) , when Glover turned down the offer to reprise the role in Back to the Future , Part II , the producers , who again included Spielberg , " brought the character back to life by splicing together archived footage and new scenes ( using an actor in prosthetic makeup ) . "
Glover successfully sued Spielberg over the issue .
IMDb.com notes , " The case prompted the Screen Actors Guild to devise new regulations about the use of actors ' images . "
Glover maintained the grudge , it seems .
In a compendium of outré articles edited by Adam Parfrey , titled Apocalypse Culture II , Glover has one that poses several outlandish questions concerning his cinematic bête noire , including , " Could anal rape of Steven Spielberg be simply the manifestation of a cultural mandate ? "
And , " Would the culture benefit from Steven Spielberg 's murder , or would it be lessened by making him a martyr ? "
Yet Robert Zemeckis , director of the Back to the Future films , was willing to work with Glover again in Beowulf , which Zemeckis also directed .
But some who 've dealt with him here in Arizona feel differently .
" If he 's all about the indie spirit and stuff , like he says , I really think he should be a little more generous toward the venues where he shows his film , " offered Beesley - Brown .
" Especially for putting up with him . "
TARGET GUADALUPE
That Bob Dylan line " the pettiness that plays so rough " is what comes to this beaker 's mind regarding attacks on Guadalupe Mayor Rebecca Jimenez following her defiance of Sheriff Joe Arpaio on April 3 during the anti-immigrant sweep detailed in the New Times cover story " Brown Out " ( May 29 ) .
Hispanic - hatin ' nativists are out to dig up anything they can on the 36 - year - old ASU student and mother of four who receives a $ 300 - a - month stipend for her mayoral work , on which she estimates she spends anywhere from 30 to 50 hours a week .
( Regular Guadalupe council members receive $ 200 a month . )
Wing - nutty Linda Bentley , reporter for the far - right Sonoran News in lily - white Cave Creek , recently penned a hit piece against the mayor , wherein Bentley dug up old citations for loose dogs the Jimenez had and , therefore , characterized the small - town official as having " a criminal record that spans about a decade . "
( Bentley neglected to follow up on a tip that a really bad hangnail Jimenez had two years ago caused her to snap at the mailman . )
According to Bentley 's twisted logic , the dog incidents make Jimenez as evil as Ma Barker and Hannibal Lecter combined .
Obviously , Bentley pulled most of her info from online sources .
Even the photo she used of Jimenez was clipped from another publication without the photographer 's knowledge .
Bentley also accused of Mayor Jimenez of being convicted of disorderly conduct .
A call by this quacker to Marilyn Trujillo , court administrator for the Guadalupe Municipal Court , uncovered the fact that Jimenez was actually the victim in that case .
Nice work , Bent -ley .
As Cave Creek 's a world away from Guadalupe , Bentley did n't bother to get off her ass and traipse to the Hispanic locale .
When asked if she 'd actually physically done any research in the town , which 's practically across the street from Tempe 's Arizona Mills , Bentley whimpered : " No . . .
Why would I ? "
Good point , Linda .
If you 're already down on the brown and plan to bash anyone who defends Arizona 's Hispanic population , then there 's no reason to venture past your desk .
Bentley 's done similar hit pieces on Salvador Reza , operator of the Macehualli Work Center , and composed crazy screeds for her rag on immigrant - rights firebrand Isabel Garcia in Tucson and Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon .
Once upon a time , the Sonoran News did critical pieces on Arpaio .
But now that Joe 's taken up the cudgel against the undocumented , the weekly 's gone all kissy - face with the county 's corrupt top constable .
These days , the Sonoran News delivers only stories about injured Gila monsters , dust ordinances , and why Hispanics are to be loathed and feared .
Opposition to Mayor Jimenez from the Sonoran News is to be expected , but Jimenez is also getting pummeled by Guadalupe 's loony left in the person of longtime community activist Socorro Bernasconi , whose husband , Santino Bernasconi , is the deacon of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church .
Both Bernasconis want Arpaio out of their community , but their dislike of Jimenez seems even greater , though they 've never proffered a rational explanation behind it .
In persistent , sometimes hysterical e-mails to members of the Guadalupe Town Council , Socorro Bernasconi has compared Jimenez to a " miniature Arpaio " with near - dictatorial powers .
Of course , nothing could be further from the truth .
Jimenez currently leads a small 4 - to - 3 majority on the council .
Her fellow council members are free to make remarks criticizing her during the council sessions and can call council meetings with three signatures .
Citizens speaking for or against anything the mayor does can speak at public meetings .
And all measures of the council must be voted on .
Still , Socorro Bernasconi's helping gather signatures for a recall of Jimenez .
That 's not a difficult thing to accomplish in a town where not enough people vote regularly .
Bernasconi has already been successful in getting the sigs to recall council member Patricia Jimenez , the mayor 's cousin , mostly over personality issues .
The vote 's set for this September , even though Patricia Jimenez 's term is up early next year .
If Patricia Jimenez is successfully recalled , her cousin will quickly face a vote of no confidence and may be stripped of her mayor - ship , as the mayor 's elected from and by the seven - member council .
Asked why she was working so diligently to topple the mayor — one of the few elected officials to defy Sheriff Arpaio — Socorro Bernasconi would reply only via e-mail with the following non sequitur .
" My only comment is that New Times ( like Arpaio ) is only using Guadalupe — to get back at Arpaio ! "
Huh ?
Arpaio 's using Guadalupe to get back at himself ?
As for the part about New Times " using " Guadalupe , Arpaio made Guadalupe ground zero in the immigration debate , not New Times .
Do we care about the abuses perpetuated on Guadalupe citizens by Arpaio ?
Absolutely .
Which 's why New Times has extensively reported on Arpaio 's April sweep there and why it will continue to do so .
If Socorro Bernasconi cares about her town as much as she says she does , and if she wants Arpaio vamoosed , then she should focus her energies on building coalitions instead of tearing them down .
Otherwise , Socorro Bernasconi might as well be an adviser to the sheriff or a regular contributor to the Sonoran News .
Seagull Islands hardly ranks as an obvious location for a spying operation designed to help police track terrorists .
The outcrops in the elegant sweep of sand and water of Poole Harbour are populated by little more threatening than a colony of oystercatchers and large amounts of reed .
But four times in the past three years the islands and their surrounding waters have been under covert surveillance .
Using boats , binoculars and CCTV cameras , a team from Poole Borough Council has been trying to catch cockle rustlers .
The local authority has been forced to defend itself against claims that it is Britain 's nosiest council , because it has used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( Ripa ) , a piece of legislation originally intended for protecting national security and investigating serious crime , to spy on fishermen .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Home Office says Ripa , which critics complain is now being used by nearly 800 public bodies in ways that risk infringing civil liberties , lays down rules for " using methods of surveillance and information gathering to help the prevention of crime , including terrorism " .
It was passed in 2000 to allow spying operations and monitoring of internet traffic .
Officials in Poole also confirmed they had authorised a two - week surveillance operation against a family wrongly accused of lying on an application form about their permanent home to gain a place at a popular primary school .
Jenny Paton , 39 , her partner Tim Joyce , 37 , and their three daughters had their movements chronicled by an undercover official who kept a precise record in a log book with entries such as " curtains open and all lights on in premises " .
The council exonerated the couple of any wrongdoing .
The episode brought a request under the Freedom of Information
Act for the council to release details on how often it has used Ripa ; that revealed 17 operations since 2005 to gather evidence on alleged infringements from damage to a road barrier to stealing from a rubbish tip .
The key project for the council 's Environmental and Consumer Protection Service , which conducts the surveillance , has been enforcing a five - year - old ban on fishing stocks of clams , cockles and mussels in an area to the west of Poole town which includes Seagull Islands .
Tests had found high levels of bacteria in the bivalves which could endanger health .
In surveillance operations averaging two weeks at a time , a team from the council along with Dorset Police and fishery conservation officials set to work .
The council said the investigation was continuing .
Tim Martin , head of legal and democratic services at the council , said : " We are committed to responding to the needs of local people who are concerned about crime , disorder and antisocial behaviour .
Illegal shellfish dredging can cause harm to the conservation of stocks in the harbour and could also lead to a potentially serious public health risk if illegally fished stock is not fit for consumption . "
Fishermen in Poole are unconvinced .
One who has harvested shellfish in the harbour for 20 years said : " It 's a hammer to crack a nut .
If anyone is stupid enough to fish poisoned shellfish they will soon be discovered because of large numbers of people falling ill .
I 'm not sure they need to crawl around in the bushes like the SAS to prove it . "
There is growing debate about the use of Ripa , originally framed to govern the interception of communications by nine government organisations including the security services and police , and by 792 public authorities including 474 councils .
A survey by the Press Association found that 46 local authorities had used the Act a total of 1,343 times in the past 12 months to investigate suspected offences ranging from benefit fraud and dog fouling to the sale of counterfeit goods and misuse of disabled parking badges .
Silicone breast implants and botox could one day be things of the past thanks to promising new techniques that would allow doctors to work plastic surgery miracles using only a patient 's own stem cells .
Traditionally , plastic and reconstructive surgery has relied heavily on fillers .
Bags full of saline or silicone are used to plump up breasts .
Chunks of fat are taken from one area of the body and grafted into another .
These techniques , which like other body enhancement procedures have soared in popularity in recent years , can work successfully but they also have drawbacks .
Dr. J. Peter Rubin , assistant professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , said using fillers requires invasive surgery and the results may not look ideally natural .
In the case of fat grafts , they also might not last as long as a patient would like , as fat transferred whole to a new part of the body has a tendency to break down as time goes on .
Replacing these fillers with stem cells could solve the problems .
Stem cell magic
Stem cells are cells that have the ability to make more of themselves and to differentiate into special types of cells , like skin or other tissue types .
Some stem cells , called pluripotent or multipotent , are capable of turning into many different kinds of cells and growing wide varieties of tissues ranging from bone to neurons to organs and muscle .
While embryonic stem cells are the most well - known type ( and the type that raises controversy ) , not all pluri - and multi-potent cells come from embryos .
Certain so - called adult stem cells , which we make in our bodies , also have these abilities and would most likely be the cells used in plastic surgery .
" If we can capitalize on stem cell biology , we can use those cells to reconstruct lost tissue or construct new tissue in a less invasive way , " Rubin said .
In order to do this , he said , researchers would separate out multi- or pluripotent adult stem cells and grow them in a petri dish .
Depending on how they 're grown and what materials they 're grown in , the stem cells can be coaxed into taking on different specialties , such as fat or cartilage .
Those cells would then be injected into the patient , where they would continue to grow and divide , creating a small amount of natural tissue .
No surgery required .
According to Rubin and colleagues , these techniques could one day be used to fill out wrinkles on an aging face , replace breast tissue lost to cancer treatment , or even grow a natural breast implant .
Fat chance
While these applications are still a ways out , plastic surgeons in Europe and Asia are already using stem cells to get better results for their patients .
To do this , they 're harvesting stem cells from an unlikely place — human fat .
Turns out , fat is an ample source of multi- and pluripotent stem cells .
Science has known for decades that fat tissue is home to a large population of immature cells that have the ability to grow into new fat cells .
Rubin said that around 2000 and 2001 , researchers began to realize that these " pre-fat cells " were actually stem cells that could become not just fat , but cartilage , bone , and even neurons and heart muscle .
And , unlike other tissues rich in stem cells , such as bone marrow , fat tissue is easy to extract .
All you need is liposuction .
Today , as part of ongoing clinical trials and regular practice , doctors outside the United States are taking stem cells from liposuctioned fat and using them to make traditional fat grafts more effective .
Tom Baker , director of investor relations for Cytori , a San Diego - based company that makes machines for processing fat stem cells in the operating room , described how it works :
First , a doctor liposuctions fat from a patient .
Half that fat gets set aside , while the other half is processed to pull out a mixture of cells rich in stem cells .
That mixture is then injected back into the reserved fat , which is grafted into place inside the patient .
The result is a fat graft supercharged with stem cells .
Healthier cells
A Japanese study and a Cytori - funded study presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2007 have shown that the supercharged grafts , unlike normal fat grafts , maintain a more natural shape and do n't wither away .
The difference is extremely important to patients .
The Japanese study , for instance , was conducted on women who'd lost part of a breast to cancer and wanted the reconstructive surgery to look as normal as possible .
Supercharged fat grafts work because stem cells do more than just grow new cells , said Rubin 's colleague Dr. Keith March , a professor of medicine , cellular and integrative physiology , and biomedical engineering at the Indiana University School of Medicine .
They also support cells and tissues , making them healthier .
" It 's just like the trunk of a tree , " March said .
" It gives rise to branches and roots , but it 's also involved in providing the nutrient supply .
Stem cells are involved in maintaining and repairing the tissues around them . "

This is one of several shortened indices into the Quantum Physics Sequence .
Hello !
You may have been directed to this page because you said something along the lines of " Quantum physics shows that reality does n't exist apart from our observation of it , " or " Science has disproved the idea of an objective reality , " or even just " Quantum physics is one of the great mysteries of modern science ; no one understands how it works . "
There was a time , roughly the first half - century after quantum physics was invented , when this was more or less true .
Certainly , when quantum physics was just being discovered , scientists were very confused indeed !
But time passed , and science moved on .
If you 're confused about a phenomenon , that 's a fact about your own state of mind , not a fact about the phenomenon itself - there are mysterious questions , but not mysterious answers .
Science eventually figured out what was going on , and why things looked so strange at first .
The series of posts indexed below will show you - not just tell you - what 's really going on down there .
To be honest , you 're not going to be able to follow this if algebra scares you .
But there wo n't be any calculus , either .
Some optional preliminaries you might want to read :
Reductionism :
We build models of the universe that have many different levels of description .
But so far as anyone has been able to determine , the universe itself has only the single level of fundamental physics - reality does n't explicitly compute protons , only quarks .
Joy in the Merely Real :
If you can't take joy in things that turn out to be explicable , you 're going to set yourself up for eternal disappointment .
Do n't worry if quantum physics turns out to be normal .
And here 's the main sequence :
ZHOUSHAN , China ( CNN ) --
They operate from a bare apartment on a Chinese island .
They are intelligent 20 - somethings who seem harmless .
But they are hard - core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world 's most sensitive sites , including the Pentagon .
The leader of these Chinese hackers says there " is always a weakness " on networks that allows cyber break - ins .
In fact , they say they are sometimes paid secretly by the Chinese government -- a claim the Beijing government denies .
" No Web site is one hundred percent safe .
There are Web sites with high - level security , but there is always a weakness , " says Xiao Chen , the leader of this group .
" Xiao Chen " is his online name .
Along with his two colleagues , he does not want to reveal his true identity .
The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China , launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world .
Watch hackers ' clandestine Chinese operation »
If there is a profile of a cyber hacker , these three are straight from central casting -- young and thin , with skin pale from spending too many long nights in front of a computer .
One hacker says he is a former computer operator in the People 's Liberation Army ; another is a marketing graduate ; and Xiao Chen says he is a self - taught programmer .
" First , you must know about the Web site you want to attack .
You must know what program it is written with , " says Xiao Chen .
" There is a saying , ' Know about both yourself and the enemy , and you will be invincible . ' "
CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers '
Web site , but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years , with 10,000 registered users .
The site offers tools , articles , news and flash tutorials about hacking .
Private computer experts in the United States from iDefense Security Intelligence , which provides cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500 companies , say the group 's site " appears to be an important site in the broader Chinese hacking community . "
Arranging a meeting with the hackers took weeks of on - again , off - again e-mail exchanges .
When they finally agreed , CNN was told to meet them on the island of Zhoushan , just south of Shanghai and a major port for China 's navy .
The apartment has cement floors and almost no furniture .
What they do have are three of the latest computers .
They are cautious when it comes to naming the Web sites they have hacked .
On camera , Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites .
But off - camera , in conversations over three days , he claims two of his colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked into the Pentagon and downloaded information , although he would n't specify what was gleaned .
CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true .
" They would not publicize this , " he says of someone who hacks the U.S. Defense Department .
" It is very sensitive . "
This week , the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States , Germany , Britain and France were hit last year by what they call " multiple intrusions , " many of them originating from China .
At a congressional hearing in Washington last week , administration officials testified that the government 's cyber initiative has fallen far short of what is required .
Most alarming , the officials said , there has never been a full damage assessment of federal agency networks .
Watch Pentagon bans Google from bases »
" We are here today because we must do more , " said Robert Jamison , a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security .
" Defending the federal system in its current configuration is a significant challenge . "
U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network .
But David Sedney , the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia , says , " The way these intrusions are conducted are certainly consistent with what you would need if you were going to actually carry out cyber warfare . "
Beijing hit back at that , denying such an allegation and calling on the United States to provide proof .
" If they have any evidence , I hope they would provide it .
Then , we can cooperate on this issue , " Qin Gang , a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry , said during a regular press briefing this week .
But again off - camera , Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack , his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government .
CNN has no way to independently confirm if that is true .
His allegations brought strenuous denials from Beijing .
" I am telling you honestly , the Chinese government does not do such a thing , " Qin said .
But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth , it appears his colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by Beijing , but paid for after the fact .
" These hacker groups in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state , " says James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis , which works with the U.S. intelligence community .
" They are sort of useful idiots for the Beijing regime . "
He adds , " These young hackers are tolerated by the regime provided that they do not conduct attacks inside of China . "
One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from , and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability .
And across China , there could be thousands just like him , all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world .

Research exploring new ways of exploiting the full medicinal uses of cannabis while avoiding unwanted side - effects will be presented to pharmacologists on July 15 by scientists attending the Federation of European Pharmacological Societies Congress , EPHAR 2008 .
Cannabis is a source of compounds known as cannabinoids , one of which , THC -- the main chemical responsible for the ' high ' -- has long been licensed as a medicine for suppressing nausea produced by chemotherapy and for stimulating appetite , for instance , in AIDS patients .
More recently , the cannabis - based medicine Sativex was licensed both for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain in adults with multiple sclerosis and as an adjunctive analgesic treatment for adult patients with advanced cancer .
Sativex contains approximately equal amounts of THC and the non-psychoactive plant cannabinoid , cannabidiol .
" THC works by targeting molecules in our bodies called cannabinoid receptors " said Roger Pertwee , Professor of Neuropharmacology at the University of Aberdeen , who is co-chairing the cannabis symposium .
" So some current research is focused on designing drugs that only target cannabinoid receptors in the part of the body relevant to the disease in question and not the receptors in the central nervous system involved in the unwanted effects of cannabis . "
A further approach to avoiding the psychoactivity caused by THC involves harnessing the body 's own cannabis , called ' endocannabinoids ' .
advertisement
" We do n't have cannabinoid receptors just in case we come into contact with plant - derived chemicals that activate them but rather because we have our own molecules that do this , " said Christopher Fowler , Professor of Pharmacology at Umea University , in Sweden , and co-chair of the meeting .
" The neat thing about endocannabinoids is that they are often produced only when we need them , such as when our bodies are damaged in some way ; pain , for example , leads to a release of endocannabinoids in a region of the brain that is involved with pain control .
" The problem with this natural protective ' endocannabinoid system ' is that it is too short - lived to be of great benefit -- enzymes in our bodies quickly breakdown or metabolise the endocannabinoids negating their effect .
It 's a bit like a bathtub without a plug -- the water is turned on but rapidly disappears down the plughole .
This suggests an immediate target : block the plughole and the water will stay longer .
" Since the release of endocannabinoids is local , levels in other parts of the brain , stay low .
This approach is under intense investigation and programmes for the development of new drugs targeting pain and possibly other disorders such as anxiety and depression are currently underway . "
Speakers will report on promising studies that show improved strategies for targeting the endocannabinoid system , not only for pain relief , but also for treating other conditions , including stroke , liver diseases and , ironically , nicotine addiction and obesity .
Thus , as the conference will hear , there are some disorders in which endocannabinoid release appears to be detrimental to our health , one example being obesity , which can be treated with Acomplia* , a licensed synthetic medicine that acts by blocking cannabinoid receptors .
Professor Pertwee added : " THC in cannabis is of course well known for its ability to induce ' the munchies ' and , as mentioned , is used in clinics to boost appetite .
But my research group has discovered that another constituent of cannabis , THCV , acts in a similar way to Acomplia , blocking one of the cannabinoid receptors , so providing an alternative -- and potentially better -- treatment route in the fight against obesity .
" The conference will hear about some of the possible advantages THVC has over current obesity treatments , as well as data on the potential of cannabinoids to treat other conditions , including neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and Huntington 's disease . "
* Acomplia has been a licensed medicine for obesity in the UK and Europe for about two years and was accepted by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) on June 28 , 2008 .

In 1944 , the Japanese army sent a man named Hiroo Onoda to the small Philippine island of Lubang with orders to guard the island until the army sent for him .
Shortly after Onoda landed Allied forces took the island , killing or capturing all of the Japanese soldiers save for Onoda and three comrades .
Onoda took the men into the jungle and hid there .
The Japanese surrendered in August 1945 , but no one in the Japanese military got word to Onoda and his men .
As time went by , locals tried to convince them that the war was over but the soldiers believed that every note left and every leaflet dropped was a trick of the enemy .
The emotional and physical strain growing , the four soldiers started to fired on the locals .
One of the four was eventually killed in a skirmish .
Another walked away .
Onoda and his single remaining comrade , Kinshichi Kozuka , lived together in the jungles of Lubang until 1972 , when Kozuka was shot by Filipino police .
News of Kozuka ’s death alerted Japan to the possiblity that Onoda , who had been declared legally dead years earlier , was still alive .
Eventually , he was found by a traveling student , who arranged a meeting between Onoda and his one - time superior officer .
In 1974 , they met on Lubang and Onoda ’s superior officer told him that the war was over .
In 29 years of hiding , Onoda and his men had killed a reported 30 people and injured over 100 more .
Nevertheless , Onoda was pardoned by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and given a hero ’s welcome in Japan .
I mention this only because Ron Paul received 16 percent of the vote in yesterday ’s Republican primary in Pennsylvania .

Where is personal responsibility ?
It 's tossed out the car window at 70 MPH .
Gas prices are brain - numbingly , irritatingly high .
Yet we putter through traffic in our 250 - horsepower cars , drinking gasoline like I drink Tang .
I know my limits .
I can't convince America to stop driving big gas - hungry cars and put more automotive research towards fuel efficiency .
But I 'll still fulfill my debt to society with advice : Change your driving habits and save gas .
A great tool for doing so is the " ScanGauge II " .
The ScanGauge is a small box packed with electronics .
Usable in any car made in 1996 or later , it plugs in to your car 's " OBD II " port , a special plug used for computer diagnostics .
The ScanGauge uses this diagnostic data to give us real - time information about our car 's performance , including mileage :
While driving , the ScanGauge reads your car 's speed , load , throttle position and other factors , and computes your current miles per gallon .
Below are pictures of the ScanGauge in action :
This MPG display lets you dynamically improve driving .
See how mileage changes as you accelerate , climb and descend hills , or cruise the highway .
Fine - tune your driving .
Reduce bad habits , use less gas .
For this ScanGauge II review , setup was simple , no wiring or batteries needed : Plug it in , and start your car .
The mileage monitor is n't ScanGauge 's only tool .
It 's also an OBD - II code reader , allowing you to read and clear problems caused by " Check Engine " lights .
Report trip info , like overall mileage , average speed , driving distance and fuel used .
After using the ScanGauge II in my 2002 Saturn SL , here 's what I learned :
During acceleration , letting up on the pedal just one inch increases mileage by 15 MPG .
Turning on air conditioning drops mileage by 4 MPG .
I always thought coasting in neutral improved mileage ( versus leaving the car in gear ) , but the ScanGauge tells me it makes no difference .
Cruise control is usually good , but wastes too much gas on hills .
The ScanGauge II comes with geek - friendly features :
It 's upgradeable , so future improvements ( like PC communications ) can be installed .
Car hackers can send OBD - II commands to their cars ' computers , tweaking to improve performance .
Customize many options ( including the screen backlight , with 63 different color choices ) .
At $ 170 , it 's not cheap .
But learn from it , and it does pay for itself : I recorded mileage before and after buying my ScanGauge .
In city driving , using it to adjust my driving habits , I averaged 24 MPG before the ScanGauge and 27 MPG after .
I fill my tank about once every five days .
Assuming gasoline is $ 3 per gallon , I 'll need just over seven months to save $ 170 in gas .
Some commercials start pitches by saying " in times like these … "
Half - heartedly alluding to the economy , global terrorism , or just plain persnicketyness , they really mean " whatever unspecified thing bothers you , we can indirectly help . "
Not so with the ScanGauge .
I 'll be very specific : " In times like these , with horrible gas prices , the ScanGauge can help you save gas money by adjusting your driving habits . "
5 Scams That Marked the Internet
The Internet is fertile ground for all sorts of scams .
Which are the biggest ( and funniest ) ones though ?
We have collected 5 that made it pretty big on the Web , check it out .
1. Lonelygirl15
The lonelygirl15 videos were a series of YouTube clips , chronicling the everyday worries of a regular fifteen year old girl and her phenomenally advanced video and editing skills .
As the series progressed sinister overtones of cult behavior crept in .
Despite being slightly more obviously fake than a video of Bigfoot at Roswell , debate about the veracity of the videos raged for weeks and many were upset when the hoax was revealed .
Yes , people publicly announced “ I am upset that I was not voyeuristically enjoying the slide of a real underage girl into terror and abuse without doing anything about it . ”
The LA Times eventually “ exposed ” the hoax , and we ’re sure that when the previously unheard of film - making “ conspirators ” were outed there , and in The Times , and The New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and PBS they were absolutely horrified .
“ Man , ” they must have said to all the reporters and newscasters who would previously never have looked twice at them , “ You really got us there .
We did n’t expect this kind of exposure of our hoax at all . ”
“ We did n’t think it would work half this well . ”
2. EVE banker
For those of you who still know what other people and the daystar look like , EVE Online is a massively immersive space - based MMORPG .
And we mean immersive like an ocean of quicksand being played on fast forward – it is literally a single entire galaxy , and while other worlds have characters and weapon systems this one has an entire economy .
You can actually succeed in the game simply by trading commodities , and the games currency of ISK ( Interstellar Kredit ) has a real , if not entirely legal , conversion to real money .
In fact EVE ISK ( 0.40 USD per 1M ISK , video games tend to deal in big units ) is probably a better investment and more widely used than the actual currency of Iceland Kroner ( 0.01 USD = 1 ISK ) .
The EVE player population also rivals that of Iceland ( about 300,000 ) , and CCP games ( the makers ) are headquartered in Iceland .
Not that we ’re suggesting any Reykjavikians should be worried about being replaced by a fanatical army trained by CCP to obey their every command .
People have set up entire businesses in the virtual space of EVE , inverting the whole function of a video game by essentially working two jobs ( the first paying the monthly subscription fee for the second ) , with the average EVE player logging in 2.5 hours a day .
In 2006 a player called Cally ( real name Dentara Rast ) set up the “ EVE Investment Bank ” , and in yet another example of the amazing unrealistic things that can happen in video games , people entrusted their money to a man named “ Cally ” .
Over time the bank expanded and eventually had over 700 Billion ISK ( over one hundred thousand real , honest to god “ You can buy food or sex with these ” dollars ) in the account .
Then , in a corporate crime that real - life CEOs can only dream of ( and I ’m sure often do ) , Cally just took all the money and ran .
Specifically , he ran and bought an Ultimega - death clas hyper cruiser , put a million ISK bounty on his own head and cruised off into deep space simply daring anyone to try and kill him .
See this ?
THIS is why people play video games so much – in real life white collar crime is fudged numbers and emigration to tax havens , in EVE we ’ve got a bank manager who deals with service complaints with a fusion cannon .
3. Bad Company Downloadable Content
The conundrum of downloadable content has really revealed the true spirit of developers .
Awesome companies like Valve release free content , because they understand this whole “ internet ” thing , with its digital distribution and the value behind a beloved brand .
Non-awesome companies like EA charge for it , while others like Microsoft hover in the middle with “ pay now or free later strategies ” .
Contrary to what half the population of the Internet would have you believe , though , you ca n’t actually hate someone because they do n’t give away their work for free .
Luckily , EA has made it A - OK to hate them again by charging for “ non-downloadable content ” , otherwise known as “ Things you already bought from them . ”
For years EA has been working on that whole troublesome “ Actually having to produce something in order to earn money ” thing , reducing the content of yearly titles with each iteration , and with Bad Company they ’ve finally achieved it .
What you do , right , is you pay for a Battlefield : Bad Company disc .
Or you can pay extra for a version which unlock some of the weapons .
Weapons that are , in fact , already on both discs .
Yes , EA have achieved the Zen Nirvana of Marketing Bastardry by working out how to sell you the same thing twice and charge each time .
This news was about as well received as a plague rat in an operating theatre , but the fact is that Electronics Arts offices worldwide remain un - burned down proves that Internet critics are very , very vocal online and very , very useless in terms of actually doing things .
A boycott movement has already started and we can only hope that once , just once , Internet apathy does n’t bother to ruin it .
Because once they find they can get away with this EA will absolutely grind this practice into the ground long after there ’s any remaining point , motivation or sanity .
These are the guys who turned the popular Madden game franchise into a yearly sixty - dollar player name update , and that at least started good .
4. Gizmondo
You might recall that we talked about the Gizmondo a couple of weeks ago in our “ The 5 Worst Reassurances ” article ( in which case thanks , regular reader , and might we say how particularly discerning and intelligent you ’re looking today ? ) .
This is because the Gizmondo turns up in every single negative - adjective technology list on the entire Internet .
It ’s widely viewed as the greatest electronics disaster since somebody first thought “ I ’d love to make some toast while in the bath ” .
Which is unfair , because it was really a huge success .
Specifically , it was a huge success in its intended function of “ Provide Stefan Eriksson , Johan Enander and friends with a twenty - four month fast - car - and - hookers party . ”
The business history of Tiger Telematics ( the makers of Gizmondo ) makes Grand Theft Auto look like Barney Teaches Spelling .
The “ managing executives ” of the company had over twenty - four years of jail time between them for frauds and physical violence , they bought an entire London “ modeling ” agency , have wrecked over a million dollars worth of sports cars and had the entire - extended - family - of - all launch parties featuring Dannii Minogue , Sting and Busta Rhymes ( among others ) .
All this spending was supported by the sales of shares , presumably to people who signed the cheques in crayon , because when a company is paying for parties with shares then that is not a company that plans to be around for long .
For 2005 the company effectively lost over a million dollars a day .
You could light a hundred dollars on fire once a minute , every minute without eating or sleeping and still not achieve that level of loss – and I assure you that these guys found WAY funner things to do with the cash than that .
It was a real life Brewster ’s Millions .
In what amazingly has n’t turned out to be an April Fool ’s joke , one of the original crew is now attempting to raise investment capital to relaunch the company ( translation – there are a few types of champagne he has n’t tried yet ) .
Which just proves that there are people desperate to make money out of “ those computer - game things ” despite not even knowing how to Google somebody .
5. Scamming the Scammers
Every time I get a 419 spam my faith in humanity goes down a notch ( it ’s currently hovering just above the Earth ’s core ) , because the fact that they keep coming shows that somewhere , somehow , they ’re still working .
I ’m all in favor of the terminally foolish being parted with cash they should n’t have , but I ’m an even bigger fan of poetic justice – which is why the work of 419eater is so entertaining .
E- mailing scamming might be the biggest online fraud of our time but that does n’t mean that there are n’t idiots on both sides , as shown in this wonderful piece where the scammers become the scammees .
And not just for credit cards , or social security , oh no .
They get to hand copy an entire Harry Potter novel .
And they scan the pages to prove it .
Go , really , you have to see these – and then every time your inbox gets clogged with another “ UIRG3NT LOTTTTERY TIKKIT !!# ” mail , you can picture a scammer hunched over his notepad and
Gridiron fans , move over .
The Barack Obama campaign hopes to turn the last evening of the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28 into a giant rally of voters in a football stadium .
The unusual move , confirmed by two sources , would be an echo of John F. Kennedy ’s acceptance speech in 1960 .
Kennedy delivered his address before thousands of supporters at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum .
Obama ’s big moment also would fall on the 45th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ’s “ I Have a Dream ” speech , delivered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington .
The first three days of this year ’s convention are still scheduled to be held at downtown Denver ’s Pepsi Center , a basketball and hockey arena .
But the Pepsi Center holds no more than about 19,000 people , and the Obama campaign thinks it can assemble a much bigger crowd for the acceptance speech — making a more compelling television picture .
Invesco Field , home of the Denver Broncos pro football team , can seat more than 76,000 .
Officials involved in planning the event said the challenge of filling the stadium did n’t seem to be much of a worry for the Obamians , who attracted huge crowds during their primary campaign this spring .
More worrisome , they said , were issues of logistics and security for all the Democratic dignitaries at the convention — plus the possibility of afternoon thunderstorms in the open - air stadium .
The football stadium plan appears to be what was in the works when word surfaced earlier this week that the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee were kicking around the idea of shortening the party convention to three days instead of four .
Obama campaign officials did n’t respond to requests for confirmation .
Shannon Gilson , a spokeswoman for the campaign , simply told the Denver Post via e-mail : “ We think Thursday night in Denver will be very special . ”

No , it ’s from a chop - top , steel - frame 1959 Opel T - 1 ( think melting jelly bean , but uglier ) .
And the record was set in 1973 in a contest sponsored by Shell Oil Co .
Yes , that Shell Oil , better known now as Royal Dutch Shell .
Evan McMullen , owner of Seattle - based Cosmopolitan Motors , rediscovered the Guinness world - record - setting but forgotten car in Florida .
The buzz of the automotive engineering circles in the early 1970s and winner of the Wood River Competition for the planet ’s top mileage car , the little Opel had been bought by the France family , owners of NASCAR , and gifted to the museum at Talladega raceway .
And there it sat , mostly in anonymity , until McMullen , 45 , heard about it and made his move .
He now owns the car and hopes to sell it , maybe to a technological museum at an auction in September in Indiana .
He has a few questions about the car , about its worth mainly , but the provenance seems genuine .
Guinness listed it in its 1975 record book .
Technological journals from the era waxed about the Opel ’s simple but effective modifications and engineering .
But McMullen ’s biggest question is why ?
Why did n’t this technology find its way into the mainstream ?
Why did the car sit unremarked , unremembered for so long ?
“ If this is something they could do back in the 1970s , what happened ? ” he asked , poring over paperwork , including patents , for the car .
“ Certainly in 34 years we could do something to make this work . ”
Especially with gas climbing and then bivouacking above $ 3 a gallon .
Especially when its relatively ancient technology bettered the best hybrid mileage by a 6 - 1 ratio .
To be sure , the Opel is n’t much on looks , luxury or performance .
The team that built it stripped the interior of everything but a seat , chopped the top to lower its wind resistance .
They narrowed the rear axle , used super - hard low - friction tires and a chain drive to save weight .
The mileage from the mostly stock four - cylinder came from heating and insulating the fuel line so the gas entered the engine as lean vapor .
Then they drove the car on a closed course at a steady 30 mph .
So some of that would n’t work in the street , McMullen concedes .
But if the car were made more drivable and lost 200 mpg — it still would get 176 mpg .
“ Here ’s a car that was 20 years old at the time of the contest that was the project of a couple of guys in a garage , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t tell me we ca n’t do better than this with cars today . ”
So McMullen wants to see who wants the car .
And he hopes there ’s something to be learned about the future while looking at the past , in an era when even the oil companies sometimes responded to OPEC fuel crises by promoting conservation .
“ They tell us hybrids are the answer , ” he said .
“ I think the answer , at least part of it , is right here . ”

Japan won eight swimming medals in the 2004 Olympic Games
It can take years to develop a new swimsuit material from scratch for competitive swimmers , but with just weeks to go before the Olympics , Japanese manufacturers are trying to do just that .
They have been forced to try to come up with something after the Nottingham , UK - based firm Speedo developed a new bodysuit , LZR Racer , which has sent world records tumbling .
The new suit has helped swimmers around the world break 30 world records in three months .
It sucks the muscles into the perfect shape to swim .
Lighter than others , it repels water , reducing drag .
I think it 's really sad for the Japanese swimmers to feel like they 've already lost the race , even before they land in Beijing
Tomizo Yamamoto , swimwear manufacturer
In Japan they fear it is unbeatable , and the Japanese firms contracted to supply the Olympic team make nothing like it .
Five swimming medals was Japan 's target after winning eight in Athens four year ago .
Now they are not so sure what they will manage .
Some of the brightest hopes for a medal expressed their frustration at the side of the pool at the National Sports Centre in Tokyo , after a training session for the 31 - member Olympic Squad .
" This is a once in a lifetime chance for me , " said Hanae Ito .
" I do n't want to be disadvantaged .
I want to do my best so I want to wear the best swimsuits there are . "
The Speedo swimsuits cost anything up to £ 320 ( $ 632 ) Her fellow team member Ai Shibata was annoyed that everyone was assuming the Speedo suit was so important .
" I think those who broke the records had practised hard and that 's why they succeeded , " she said .
" It 's not all about swimsuits .
It 's sad that people only talk about swimsuits these days .
I hope people will pay more attention to the swimmers and not what we wear . "
Hefty price tag
That seems unlikely though .
This is an issue that has gripped Japan .
Some grumble that whenever the country does well in a sport , the rules are changed to disadvantage them .
That argument does not stand up to much scrutiny .
2004 Olympics swimming medals US - 28 ( 12 gold ) Australia - 15 ( 7 gold ) Japan - 8 ( 3 gold ) Netherlands - 7 ( 2 gold ) France - 6 ( 1 gold ) Germany - 5 ( 0 gold ) Ukraine - 2 ( 2 gold ) Great Britain - 2 ( 0 gold )
After all , countries across the world which do not have a contract with Speedo , or which cannot afford the hefty price tag for their new suits - they retail at up to £ 320 ( $ 632 ) - are wondering whether that means they will not be able to compete on equal terms .
In Japan 's second city , Osaka , a huge steam press is churning out dark sheets of a new material at the Yamamoto Factory .
Could this lightweight water - resistant rubber be made into a new Japanese bodysuit in time for the Olympics ?
Across Japan , companies are trying to develop a suit as good as Speedo's .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Time is against them of course , but the factory 's owner Tomizo Yamamoto says the country 's swimmers deserve the best .
" I think it 's really sad for the Japanese swimmers to feel like they 've already lost the race , " Mr Yamamoto says , " even before they land in Beijing .
Frustration
He argues that the swimmers would understand if they lost a race " fair and square " but not if they lost to someone wearing a suit they think is giving them an unfair advantage .
He has offered his new material to the three official Olympic swim team manufacturers , not because he wants to make money , he insists , but because he believes : " We should send these athletes to the Olympics fully prepared . "
It 's two months to go before the Olympics and it's a very important time for the preparation ... this issue came out and it's bothering for the swimmers
Kazonori Enami , sports journalist Japan 's Swimming Federation had given its three official suppliers just weeks to come up with new suits .
Last Friday it announced that a few prototypes were ready .
But the suits now need to be tested and approved by the swimming 's world governing body .
And of course the athletes have to get used to wearing them .
Kazonori Enami , a Japanese sports journalist , says the dithering over what to wear is distracting the swimmers at a crucial time .
" It 's two months to go before the Olympics , and it's a very important time for the preparation , " he says .
" Normally the swimmers just concentrate on the training , but this issue came out and it's bothering for the swimmers . "
Stark choice
He is right .
Another medallist , Kousuke Kitajima , gets frustrated back at the National Sports Stadium as journalists press him for more on the row over which bodysuits he and his fellow team - mates should wear .
An Osaka factory hopes this water - resistant rubber might be the answer " I want to wear the swimsuit that I believe is best for me , " he says , but then snaps : " I do n't want to say anything else about the swimsuits , I 'm sorry . "
The Japanese swimmers say they just want the right to compete with the best in the world on equal terms .
Swimming should be about how strong you are and how good your technique is - not what kind of technology is available to help you .
Some have already accused Speedo of beginning a " swimming arms race " .
The company dominates this sport , so Japan and others who do not have a contract with the firm face a stark choice .
Either they can innovate , or they can capitulate and let their swimmers leave their country 's own brands at home , and compete in British swimwear .
But even that will not be easy .
Speedo makes just 70 of the suits each day , they are not cheap , and swimmers all over the world want to get their hands on them .

What are these ?
“ They have cast all the mysteries and secrets of government … before the vulgar ( like pearls before swine ) , and have taught both the soldiery and people to look so far into them as to ravel back all governments to the first principles of nature … ” Clement Walker , on the English Revolution , 1661
From Miami with Love
Something very interesting happened this past April in an El Paso courtroom .
There , a verdict was returned in the case of one Luis Posada Carriles , a man that has notably been described as the “ Osama Bin Laden of Latin America ” and “ one of the most dangerous terrorists in recent history ” . [ 1 ]
The circumstances of the case and the details of Posada ’s extraordinary biography could be mistaken for the plot of an international thriller — there ’s ample evidence of a long career in the business of international terrorism , including declassified FBI and CIA documents [ 2 ] and Posada ’s on - the - record admission of involvement [ 3 ] in a string of hotel bombings in Havana .
Add to that terrorism convictions by multiple governments that have found themselves in Posada ’s crosshairs , an outstanding INTERPOL warrant , sundry bombings and other paramilitary attacks within Cuba and abroad .
He ran guns to the Contras during their cross- border war with Nicuaragua , as exposed during the Reagan - era ‘ Iran Contra ’ scandal hearings [ 4 ] .
He was caught flying 200 lbs of C4 plastic explosive into Panama City and convicted of a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro [ 5 ] .
He ’s connected with the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 in 1976 and the immolation of 78 people . [ 6 ]
Far from being reviled as a mass murderer however , among the fervently anti-Castro members of Miami ’s Cuban exile community Luis Posada Carriles is considered a hero and a freedom fighter .
The Cuban American National Foundation ( CANF ) , a well - connected [ 7 ] organization Posada claimed to have received money from to carry out a 1997 bombing campaign in Havana stated in that same year in a publication that they did not regard attacks against Cuba to be ‘ terrorist actions ’ . [ 8 ]
Note that this defies the common understanding of the term as “ the use of violence and fear to achieve a desired political end . ”
It also defies understanding that a known militant of Posada ’s notoriety was allowed to apply for asylum and set foot in Miami in 2005 , having been just recently pardoned and released from jail in Panama for the attempted Castro hit . [ 9 ]
This political double standard or blind spot in the US - led ‘ War on Terror ’ was not lost on the hundreds of thousands of Cubans that turned out in massive anti-Posada rallies held in Havana during the middle of May 2005 . [ 9 ]
Posada was arrested shortly thereafter , but he was not charged under any anti-terror statutes or treaties .
Instead , he was charged with lying [ 10 ] : specifically , lying to immigration about whether he had arrived in the US by boat or by bus and lying about his past involvement in Havana bombings , all charges that carry relatively light sentences [ 11 ] .
Any questions of charges under the various national and international statutes against terrorism were off the table .
To understand the reasons behind this unique new approach to prosecuting the war on terror , it is necessary only to understand that for decades Posada was America ’s terrorist .
As it turns out , that makes all the difference in the world .
‘ School of the Assassins ’
Outrage in Havana .
Welcome in Miami .
Diffidence in Washington .
The polarized reactions occasioned by Posada ’s return to the US provide an unusually clear example of what ’s meant in practice by the saying ‘ one man ’s freedom fighter is another man ’s terrorist ‘ [ 12 ]
Posada himself has displayed little inhibition in the past to relate his exploits to the media and appears adamant in the belief that his mission is to help free Cuba and / or fight Communism in the region .
As for his methods , he claims he ’s not losing any sleep [ 13 ] over their bloody toll in Havana , at least — an ability we might chalk up to extensive practice .
Young Luis lived through and was shaped by the turmoil and civic unrest of the latter years of the US - backed Batista regime .
He studied medicine and chemistry at Havana University , meeting Castro during the student uprisings , violence , and protests of the era [ 14 ] .
However , he opposed the Cuban Revolution and was active in speaking out against the new regime , convictions which landed him in prison .
Upon his release , he fled to Mexico and then to Miami where he was recruited by the CIA [ 15 ] for the ill - starred Bay of Pigs invasion , though his squadron within Brigade 2506 never saw action .
Between 1963 and 1964 , Posada trained in demolitions and sabotage at the US Army ’s infamous ‘ School of the Americas ’ at Fort Benning in Georgia .
Whistleblower site SOA Watchdescribes the operations of the School of the Americas as having
trained over 64,000 Latin American soldiers in counterinsurgency techniques , sniper training , commando and psychological warfare , military intelligence and interrogation tactics .
These graduates have consistently used their skills to wage a war against their own people .
Among those targeted by SOA graduates are educators , union organizers , religious workers , student leaders , and others who work for the rights of the poor .
Hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans have been tortured , raped , assassinated , “ disappeared , ” massacred , and forced into refugee by those trained at the School of Assassins . [ 16 ]
The alumnus of this school counts among its members a significantly higher number of military dictators and secret police than your average collegiate .
The SOA Watch online database [ 17 ] of program graduates lists some 395 alumni of particular notoriety for their reign as military or intelligence officers once they returned to their home country , including thoseworking with cocaine traffickers [ 18 ] , those involved in church burnings targetting activist preachers [ 19 ] , the organization of death squads [ 20 ] , the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero [ 21 ] , and other similar breaches of human rights .
Posada ’s career took off .
Fast forward a number of years and we find the by - now seasoned militant heading up the feared Venezuelan intelligence agency , the DISIP or DirecciÃ³n Nacional de los Servicios de Inteligencia y PrevenciÃ³n which by that time had become a CIA - supported base of operations against the Castro regime in Cuba . [ 22 ]
The remarkable career of Luis Posada Carriles and other graduates of the SOA ( since renamed but still very much in operation and teaching “ the identical courses ” [ 23 ] ) should not come as any great surprise to students of Latin American history , as even a cursory perusal of the public record reveals a comprehensive , decades - long involvement in the area by American intelligence , special forces , and their proxies .
Yet time and again , public debate on the issue ( on the rare occasions it receives exposure in the mainstream media ) fails to question the ongoing policy of shipping US military resources and expertise to the area , instead focussing on issues narrow enough in scope as to exclude any discussion of the wider context .
Such as the distraction of Posada ’s ‘ immigration fraud ’ charges .
Such as the Army ’s contention that SOA Watch “ claims a false cause - and - effect relationship between training at [ SOA ] and the criminal acts of a few who have attended the school ’s programs in the distant past . ”
Such as one oft - cited attack on the founder of the SOA Watch ( Catholic priest Roy Bourgeois ) , the allegation by Paul Mulshine of the New Jersy Star - Ledger that he “ had once gone on patrol with the Salvadoran guerillas ” [ 24 ] .
Looking into the available facts on the matter , it becomes apparent instead that the priest ’s goal was to travel the countryside , speak with the poor , and investigate who may have been responsible for the assassination of Archbishop Romero and a number of catholic nuns of his order , as reported in Time magazine and a 1999 interview with the priest [ 25 ] [ 26 ] .
Some irony may be detected in the way Bourgeois ’ trip to interview dispossessed natives was ginned - up into a ‘ guerilla patrol ’ , given that the embedding of US agents within guerilla groups is a fairly standard military practice in the area .
The study of these and similar tactics , a field known as ‘ Low Intensity Conflict ’ , has produced a body of military scholarship on counterinsurgency documenting the use of tactics as diverse as the direct creation of armed insurgent ( or counter - insurgent ) militias , the use of embedded special forces operatives asagents provocateur , the administrative suspensions of civil rights in occupied regions , and ‘ psuedo - operations ’ , the use of violence and fear undertaken while masquerading as the enemy .
Counterinsurgency , by the Book
One of the first recorded outline and proposal of guerilla warfare is found in Sun Tzu’s The Art of War , a practical manual on military strategy written in the 6th century BC [ 27 ] .
Niccolo Machiavelli’s
The Prince , published somewhat later in 1532 AD , is one of the West ’s earliest works of modern political philosophy and presents a treatise on regime change and the pacification of rebellious subjects in newly acquired realms .
Machiavelli infamously advises aspiring princes that “ whoever becomes master of a city accustomed to the free way of life invites his own destruction unless he destroys it first …
Anything you implement or plan is useless if you do not set the citizens against each other and scatter them throughout the land , because otherwise they will forget neither the name of liberty nor those institutions … ” [ 28 ]
For current students of Low Intensity Conflict in this past century , there ’s the writings of General Sir Frank Kitson , a British military man that held the title Commander in Chief of UK Land Forces from 1982 - 85 .
During the 1950s , he was assigned to serve in the suppression of the Kenyan and Malayan uprisings during the postwar collapse of Britain ’s colonial empire , and he committed his experiences to print in a number of volumes .
Low Intensity Operations : Subversion , Insurgency and Peacekeeping , published in 1971 , came to print around the time he was actively applying the same concepts in Northern Ireland , setting up a covert British Army unit [ 29 ] subsequently accused of drive - by shootings and assassinations [ 30 ] .
Kitson outlined a theory of the 3 stages of insurgency and subversion [ 31 ] in which , chillingly , any criticism of the state is seen as falling along a continuum of insurgency .
This ‘ slippery slope ’ model encompasses a preparatory period in which the subversives communicate their ideas to the population , the non-violent phase in which the use of protest , pickets , strikes and boycotts by critics are presented as the dangerous precursor to violence — and the use of police force becomes an operational decision to put down protest .
Finally the insurgency erupts , and militants stream into the streets , engaging in armed conflict with government forces .
Just such a theory of ‘ subversion ’ , where protest is seen as leading inevitably to violence appears to have become entrenched in law - enforcement practice .
In 2009 , the American Civil Liberties Union discovered that US Department of Defence anti-terrorism training course material identified protest as a form of ‘ low level terrorism ’ [ 32 ] .
The recent experience of the Toronto G20 , in which large crowds of protestors and passerby were held captive for long periods of time in defiance of Canadian civil charter rights suggest that this attitude is operational in Canada as well .
When questioned about the roundup of innocents outside the Novotel building on June 26 , 2010 , Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair stated that “ I know a lot of people who did not come to commit crimes but were facilitating the potential of that breach of the peace … by providing cover in a crowd ” ( emphasis added ) , thus justifying the suspension of civil rights in the city [ 33 ] .
Counterinsurgency and Low Intensity Conflict theory provides for the use of a number of continuum - of - force tactics ranged along various stages of the insurgency : the use of informants , psychological operations or propaganda campaigns during the ‘ non- violent phase ’ , the stick - and - carrot approach of police force followed up by concessions offered to aggrieved communities upon restoration of public order , the use of velvet - glove intimidation by military or police forces to create an atmosphere of “ respect and awe ” among populations , the cordon and search of civilian areas , the use of central identity databases or watch lists on the population and the insertion of ‘ psuedo - operations ’ special forces disguised as insurgents to wreak deliberate mayhem and confusion . [ 34 ]
Lawrence E Cline , a military instructor at the US Naval Postgraduate School notes crisply in his 2005 monograph Psuedo Operations and Counterinsurgency : Lessons from Other Countries that “ Pseudo operation strategies used in earlier counterinsurgency campaigns can offer valuable lessons for future missions . ”
He goes on to present an exhaustive survey of such lessons from the Phillipines to Africa , offering first a word of caution :
These operations , although of considerable value , also have raised a number of concerns .
Their use in offensive missions and psychological operations campaigns has , at times , been counterproductive .
In general , their main value has been as human intelligence collectors , particularly for long - term background intelligence or for identifying guerrilla groups that then are assaulted by conventional forces .
Care must be taken in running these operations both to avoid going too far in acting like guerrillas , and in resisting becoming involved in human rights abuses . [ 35 ]
Cline also writes that the “ potential political impact ” of direct psuedo - operations unfortunately makes it “ all too easy for government opponents to brand the teams conducting these missions as ‘ death squads ’ beyond the reach of the law . ” [ 36 ]
His apprehension is well - founded .
The first case described in his paper , the paramilitary response to the 1946 - 1955 Huk Insurrection in the Philippines , crops up continuously in the literature for its early innovations in the field like the deployment of small hunter - killer teams .
In his book Instruments of Statecraft : U.S. Guerilla Warfare , Counterinsurgency , and Counterterrorism , 1940 - 1990 Michael McClintock quotes a top army officer describing the style of the Nenita or ‘ skull squadron ’ , named for their use of the skull and crossbone flag “ The special tactic of these squadrons was to cordon off areas ; anyone they caught inside the cordon was considered an enemy … .
When I was stationed in the Candaba area [ in Pampanga ] , almost daily you could find bodies floating in the river , many of them victims of Valeriano ’s Nenita Unit . ” [ 37 ]
His source for the quote is a book co-authored by the same Major Napoleon Valeriano .
As a top agent working under Phillippines CIA station chief Colonel Lansdale , Valeriano was a central figure in shaping future counterinsurgency policy .
Roland G. Simbulan , Manila Studies Program coordinator at the University of the Philippines writes
The CIA ’s success in crushing the peasant - based Huk rebellion in the 1950s made this operation the model for future counterinsurgency operations in Vietnam and Latin America .
Colonel Lansdale and his Filipino sidekick , Col. Napoleon Valeriano were later to use their counterguerrilla experience in the Philippines for training covert operatives in Vietnam and in the US - administered School of the Americas , which trained counterguerrilla assassins for Latin America . [ 38 ]
Valeriano was instrumental in the training of Cuban exiles [ 39 ] [ 40 ] for the Bay of Pigs invasion , and so in tracing the thread of Major Valeriano ’s career we may observe an unbroken decades - long succession of covert involvement in foreign LIC operations from Indonesia to the operations of Luis Carriles Posada in Latin America and beyond , and it is to Posada ’s trial in El Paso that we now return .
Mitsubishi’s Electric Car Will Be Released in 2009 for $ 37,500
It seems our favorite media darling , the Chevy Volt , will have Â bit of competition when it comes time for it ’s eventual release in 2010 .
Though we ’re not sure if it will make it to the US ( like the Smart Car EV ) , we do know that Mitsubishi’s iMiev will make it to market a year earlier than the Volt and be priced lower .
The iMiev , which we start hearing about earlier in the year , has already been slated by Mitsubishi for commercial sale in Japan in 2009 , a full year before the Volt is intended to hit US shores .
There are also unconfirmed rumors that the iMiev may also make it to the US after a run of a few years in Japan .
However , what ’s really interesting about the iMiev right now is that Mitsubishi has just released a price figure of what $ 37,496 US , which is about $ 2,500less than we often hear talked about as the price point for the Chevy Volt .
Despite the similarities in pricing and release date , the two cars are very different beasts .
The iMiev is based on a current Kei-car produced by Mitsubishi for Japan , and has a 47 kW electric motor powered by a 330 - volt lithium ion battery pack .
The car will have a top speed of 80 mph and an all electric range of about 100 miles .
Charging will take place via a normal power outlet and should take about 14 hours to completely charge the battery , though there is all a 220V charge option , which only takes 7 hours .
On the other hand , the Volt will feature a sportier 120 kW motor and 100 + mph top speed , but will only have an electric range of 20 or 40 miles ( depending on the speculation and model selection ) , after which is will switch over to your standard dinosaur burning engine like in most cars these days .
Chevy claims that most people never drive over 40 miles in a day , but I ’m sure these Volts will be burning enough fossil fuels that calling them “ electric cars ” will leave a bitter taste in some peoples ’ mouths .
I think series hybrid or plug - in hybrid is much more appropriate .

Washington , DC - A
House resolution effectively requiring a naval blockade on Iran seems fast tracked for passage , gaining co-sponsors at a remarkable speed , but experts say the measures called for in the resolutions amount to an act of war .
' US Destroyer Off the Coast of Iran '
The destroyer is painted in Iraqi war camouflage I designed .
There is an endless audience of victims in bodybags on the shore .
Natasha Mayers , Common Dreams
H.CON.RES 362 calls on the president to stop all shipments of refined petroleum products from reaching Iran .
It also " demands " that the President impose " stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains and cargo entering or departing Iran . "
Analysts say that this would require a US naval blockade in the Strait of Hormuz .
Since its introduction on May 22 the resolution has attracted 205 cosponsors .
In the Senate , a sister resolution S. RES 580 has gained cosponsors rapidly .
The Senate measure was introduced by Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh on June 2 .
It has now accrued 26 cosponsors .
Congressional insiders credit America 's powerful pro-Israel lobby for the rapid endorsement of the bills .
The American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) held its annual policy conference June 2 - 4 , in which it sent thousands of members to Capitol Hill to push for tougher measures against Iran .
On its website , AIPAC endorses the resolutions as a way to " stop Iran 's nuclear program " and tells readers to lobby Congress to pass the bill .
Proponents say the resolutions advocate constructive steps toward reducing the threat posed by Iran .
" It is my hope that ... this Congress will urge this and future administrations to lead the world in economically isolating Iran in real and substantial ways , " said Congressman Mike Pence ( R- IN ) , who is the original cosponsor of the House resolution .
Foreign policy analysts worry that such unilateral sanctions make it harder for the US to win the cooperation of the international community on a more effective multilateral effort .
In his online blog , Senior Fellow in the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Ethan Chorin points out that some US allies seek the economic ties to Iran that these resolutions ban .
" The Swiss have recently signed an MOU with Iran on gas imports ; the Omanis are close to a firm deal ( also ) on gas imports from Iran ; a limited - services joint Iranian - European bank just opened a branch on Kish Island , " he writes .
These resolutions could severely escalate US - Iran tensions , experts say .
Recalling the perception of the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis , and the international norms classifying a naval blockade an act of war , critics argue endorsement of these bills would signal US intentions of war with Iran .
The sharp rise in the cost of oil following Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz 's threat to attack Iran earlier this month indicated the impact that global fear of military action against Iran can have on the world petroleum market .
It remains unclear if extensive congressional endorsement of these measures could have a similar effect .
In late May , Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reportedly urged the United States to impose a blockade on Iran .
During a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) in Jersusalem , Olmert said economic sanctions have " exhausted themselves " and called a blockade a " good possibility . "
Larry Wilkerson , former Chief of Staff for Colin Powell , disagrees .
Iran has already gained the regional power that these resolutions seek to prevent , leaving diplomatic engagement the only way to proceed , he said in a June 7 interview with Real News Network .
" Demographically , military , every way you want to measure hegemony , Iran is the dominant power in the Persian gulf , " he said .
" Therefore we 've got to come to recognize that , we 've got to deal with that and hope we can shape that to a responsible role in the gulf and the region , and ultimately in the world .
The only way you do that is through diplomacy . "

Francisco de Goya 's iconic painting El Coloso , depicting a brooding giant above frightened people and animals , has for decades been the pride of the Prado Museum in Madrid .
But the museum announced yesterday that the famous Goya painting was not created by the Spanish artist after all .
The one who painted El Coloso was most probably his pupil .
This amazing conclusion has been made by the museum 's senior Goya specialist , Manuela Mena .
The painting was created after 1808 in the period of time when Napoleon occupied Spain .
It has long been considered to be one of the artist 's most dramatic images of war horrors .
Having carefully studied the painting for nearly 20 years in order to clear out the doubts over its attribution , Manuela Mena has finally concluded that El Coloso was created in a style completely alien to Francisco de Goya .
The museum 's chief Goya specialist has also expressed her doubts over at least three other Goya paintings kept in the Prado Museum .
Having held a meeting of international specialists in Madrid , Ms Mena described El Coloso as photogenic , attractive and influenced by Goya .
But , as she and the other specialists concluded , the celebrated painting could not have been the master 's work .
As admitted by Ms Mena , the painter of the bulls depicted on El Coloso did not have any idea about the anatomy of a bull , while Francisco de Goya possessed the deep knowledge about it .
Moreover , the donkey on the painting looks like a furry toy , having nothing in common with Goya 's perfect donkeys the Spanish master depicted during the same period .
El Coloso features no details corresponding to the Goya known to his specialists .
The British Art historian Nigel Glendinning has long argued that Goya was the one who painted El Coloso .
He supported his believe by the power of the composition revealed by the painting and its audacious centrifugal dynamism .
As Professor Glendinning commented on the conclusions made by Ms Mena , they need arguments backed up by facts .
He has promised to study the findings in detail .

色々と雑多に入っている映像サムネイルを「あっち」や「こっち」という感覚でマウスを使って「投げる」ことが可能になります。
投げたものは、加速して「飛んで」行き、ある程度移動すると減速して止まります。 後で、「投げた」サムネイル達を仕分けして編集する事が可能です。
「 投げる」という動作は非常に大きな机の上でカード(書類)を仕分けするような感覚です。
投げる方向というのが「想い」です。
例えば、現実世界の机の上を整理するときに「これは財務の書類」「これはプライベート」などのように複数ある書類を場所で仕分けすることは一般的ですが、その概念を映像編集に持ち込んでいます。
編集は 「タイムライン」を生成することによって行います。
編集作業中に「レンダリングによって待たされる」ということが無いところもLoiLoScopeの特徴です。
再生を行いながら、同時に色々と変更することが可能なので、再生しながらの調整ができます。
サムネイル・タイムラインをクリックすると画面センターにきて、選択されます。
画面上部にいくと、ツールバーが現れて、その中にエフェクトがあります。
ツールバー中のエフェクト上をマウスでホーバーすると仮にエフェクトがかかります。
仮エフェクトをかけたり、外したりしている間も途切れることなく再生を行えるのも特徴です。
ダブりクリックで決定し、サムネイル/タイムラインにエフェクトがかかります。
エフェクトをたくさん追加しても再生は止まりません。
最終的に編集結果を保存したり、YouTubeへ投稿したりすることが可能です。

動作詳細
ズーム
無限平面上にあるサムネイルをクリックするとズームできます。
ホイールマウスでグリグリやってもズームイン/ズームアウトが可能です。
画面全体が1ピクセルを表すまで、どこまでもズームできます。
ダブルクリックで全画面表示も可能です。
何もないところをクリックで全体をフォーカスします。
マグネッ ト
「 投げた」後のサムネイルを「マグネット」を使って引き寄せて集める事が出来ます。
マグネットを使うと、同じような方向に投げた複数のサムネイルを一々クリックしてまわらなくても、引き寄せて集めてくれます。
マグネットは、通常の映像編集ソフトのプレイリストのような役目も果たしています。
マウスホバ ー
様々な細かい動作にはマウスホバーやクリックで行います。
例えば、サムネイル/タイムラインを選択後、エフェクトアイコンにマウスホーバーすると仮にエフェクトがかかって、プレビューできます。
可能な限り従来のようなメニューバーを減らしてあるので、映像編集に慣れていない初心者には使いやすいかも知れません。
専門的なツールを使っていると、どうしてもショートカットを多用するようになってきます。 LoiLoScopeでは、ショートカットをできるだけ使わないように作ったそうです。
YouTube機 能
YouTubeへの投稿機能が非常に楽になっているそうです。
ID , パスワード , タイトル , 解説 , タグ等を入力する とYouTubeへの投稿を行ってくれます。 さらに、YouTubeのファイルサイズ上限である100MBに対して最適化した圧縮を自動的に行ってからYouTubeへのアップロードも行います。
入手方法
現状では、まだ発表していないそうです。
そろそろクローズドベータをリリースするとのことでした。
どうしても、クローズドベータ版を入手してすぐに試してみたい方はメールを下さいとの事でした。
Q : どういう問題意識 でLoiLoScopeを作ったのでしょうか？
株式会 社LoiLo杉山竜太郎氏に伺いました。 以下、杉山氏による回答です。
私は元々映像編集していました。 SEGAでゲームを作っていたのですが、ゲームに登場する映像の編集をしていました。
今の映像編集ソフトは編集中の素材を選び、タイムラインへ切り出したカットを直でタイムラインに入れることしかできません。
一度編集してたものを複数並べてどれがいいかを比較検討するには向いていません。
例えば、ソニックのパンチがあります。 ゲームキャプチャでパンチしたものがあるのですが、いいパンチにも色々あります。
頭の中でそれぞれの「イイ」パンチを覚えていくのは大変です。
シーンとパンチの親和性を考えるときなどに、比較しながらちょっと再生してみるのが簡単なソフトが欲しいと思っていました。
私流の作り方が、まずジャンル毎にタイムラインに集めて、そのタイムラインを複製して、比較していいものを並べるという作業フローに定着していきました。
そのような経験もあって、編集ツールを作るときに仮で置いておくところが欲しいと考えました。
「 仮で集める」という感じでしょうか。 自由な場所で置いておきたい、自由なところでプライオリティを考えたい、集めたものの中でプライオリティを考えたい、同じようなものを一塊にしてその中からいいものを選びたい、そう考えました。
従来型のタイムラインは横にバーっと並べるだけで、いくつかを比べて選ぶのには適していません。 一方、LoiLoScopeのような無限平面上ではたくさんのところに色々と並べられます。
さらに、現在の映像・画像編集ソフトウエアは、遅すぎるという問題意識もありました。
何かをする度にレンダリング時間を待たされるのが嫌でした。
「映像制作をもっと快適に、もっと面白くしたい！」と思ったときに、レンダリング時間を全く感じさせない超高速な「ノンレンダリング」にしたかったのです。 このような想いからLoiLoScopeを作りました。
最後に
お忙しいところ、お時間を頂きありがとうございました。
まだ、発表前のクローズドベータ版には多少のバグなどもありそうですが、今後が非常に楽しみなソフトだと思いました。 頑張ってください！

I 've always sort of thought of Lisa Simpson as a Jezebel - in - training , what with her activism , enthusiasm for hobbies and books , love of cartoons and animals , and regard for feelings and unicorns , but it recently dawned on me that Lisa might just be the most visible , mainstream feminist of our time .
I never thought I could worship a fictional 8 - year - old so much .
So here 's a compilation of the best of Lisa 's most Jezebelian moments .
Enjoy !

At an ongoing programming contest at Donation Coder , one participant has developed this beautiful circular dock called Circle Dock .
He explains :
The idea behind Circle Dock is that the dock should appear where your mouse is instead of you having to move your mouse to the dock like with other programs .
This is accomplished by making the dock a circular or spiral shape so that it can be placed anywhere , even near the edge of the screen .
The offscreen portions of the dock are easily reached by just scrolling with your mouse wheel or arrow keys .
A few days ago I wrote about a similar application called Orbit .
But Circle
Dock looks far better to me , is more flexible and of course , it ’s open source .
What Circle Dock Allows
You to Do :
Drag and drop your files , folders , and shortcuts onto a circular or spiral dock .
Rotate the dock with either your mouse wheel or the keyboard arrow keys .
Change the image shown for the icons and change the skins ( compatible with icons and skins for Rocket Dock , Object Dock , etc . )
Ability to run the program from a portable USB memory stick and have the links in the dock point to the documents on the USB memory stick .
Ability to synchronize the links on the dock with the files , folders , and shortcuts on your desktop or other folders in real - time .
The dock appears where your mouse is by pressing a hotkey .
Works on computers with multiple monitors .
According to the author , this program was coded in under 2 weeks and he is still working on it .
As the program develops , he promises to add more features to it .

Call of Duty 6 Goes Sci-fi
We have all seen what Call of Duty : World at War , created by Call of Duty 3 developers Treyarch , looks like : back to WW2 and , more specifically , fighting in the Pacific against the Japanese .
Many people seem annoyed that Call of Duty 4 developers Infinity Ward are n’t making the game , and even more annoyed that it ’s going back to WW2 .
But with all this talk , where does that leave Infinity Ward ?
We can only assume that they are hard at work on Call of Duty 6 , but recently , reports started flying round about the game ’s setting .
According to these reports , it ’s not back WW2 and it ’s not modern day , but the future .
What do other websites think on this rumor ?
Joystiq mentioned something rather interesting , insisting that rather than “ introduce elements of unrealism into such a history - steeped series , they could be working on an entirely new , space marine - flavored franchise . ”
That does make sense : it would be a rather big risk to launch Call of Duty into the future with such references then being made to games like Halo 3 .
The problem is that , although creating a whole new IP in the future would be something original and fresh , Activision would rather stick to an IP they know will sell by the bucket loads and I do n’t think they will let their best FPS studio go off and do something that could be a gamble .
My personal opinion is that I do n’t think we will be hearing anything on this in until Call of Duty 5 ships , as any talk of an Infinity Ward - developed Call of Duty will only dampen sales of Call of Duty 5 .
That does n’t mean that the rumor is not true , but for the time being , Call of Duty has always been about historic moments in history and for it to go into the future could have a major kick back if not done right .

Rare Developing Killer Instinct 3
Once considered one of the best fighting games around , the Killer Instinct franchise has yet to make a transition from the days of the SNES and N64 .
The Rare - developed game hosts some of the craziest combos and unforgettable characters .
So it comes to no surprise that gamers around the world are begging Rare to develop and rekindle the once great fighting franchise .
Rare , being their cheeky selves , have been teasing gamers with little Killer Instinct 3 hints for a while , most noticeably on Christmas cards sent to gaming websites which had a picture of Banjo sitting on chair next to the fireplace , decorated with a stocking with Killer Instinct 3 written across the front .
There ’s also this photo taken from inside Rare studios in the UK .
This time , the Killer Instinct 3 rumor is from EGM ’s Quartermann .
Quartermann is claiming that Rare is already underway on Killer Instinct 3 for the Xbox 360 , called “ Killer Instinct 3 - D : Death , Destruction , and Doom . ”
It ’s about time we got a new Killer Instinct and where better to have it but on the Xbox 360 with Live ; this is n’t the first time this rumor has appeared , and I ca n’t see it being the last .

God of War 3 to be shown at E3
There are a few games known by the world to be Playstation games but God of War sticks out from the crowd .
The franchise so far has spawned 2 PS2 games and a PSP game , and everyone assumes there is going to be a God of War 3 .
Sony itself was quoted at the Paris Game Developer Conference as saying God of War 3 will be shown at this years E3 , though Sony has denied this as a mistranslation .
PS3 Fanboy and Joystiq are both in agreement that a God of War 3 announcement would be amazing , but both doubt that Sony would announce it at this years E3 and if they did , would only be a teaser and nothing more .
E3 is still the biggest gaming shown on earth and all eyes will be on Sony to outdo Microsoft ; what better than to announce God of War 3 ?
One thing we do know is that it wo n’t be released yet for a very long time , with some retailers having it down as Christmas next year , so maybe this E3 is too soon , and instead could be revealed later on in the year .
With Sony formally denying and a release touted for next Christmas , there is only one verdict .
TGR Verdict : Rumor Killed
Microsoft to drop price of 360
When Microsoft dropped the price of the Xbox 360 in Europe , it boosted sales and ever since that price drop , the 360 been selling well there .
Microsoft has n’t until now needed to drop the price in North America as the 360 been outselling the PS3 on a regular basis .
With the PS3 picking up some needed steam from Metal Gear Solid 4 , it ’s now up to Microsoft blow away some of that steam and a price drop would certainly help .
CVG contacted Microsoft but got that " we do n’t comment on rumor and speculation . "
To add more fuel to the fire , a sales leaflet from retailer K - Mart shows the Premium Xbox 360 at $ 299.99 , which is $ 50 off the original price .
Games analyst Michael Pachter believes that a Xbox 360 price cut makes sense ; speaking to GamesIndustry.biz , Pachter says :
" Microsoft has historically been a price taker – meaning that they typically wait for Sony to cut first , however , they have n’t been in the position of having a cost advantage before , as they do now .
Putting Microsoft ’s cost advantage together with Sony ’s reticence to lose more money , it ’s easy to conclude that you will see Microsoft reverse course and be a price leader .
I believe that every 360 sold is one less potential PS3 sold – and vice versa – and expect Sony to behave rationally . "
The price at that value would see the 360 enter what Microsoft says is “ mass market ” price .
I agree with Pachter that an Xbox 360 price drop is indeed incoming and , with Sony stating they do n’t want to loose anymore money on the PS3 , could see the 360 run away with the majority of sales in the United States .

lead atom
That 's the provocative idea emerging from some recent studies , part of a broader area of new research that suggests some pollutants can cause harm that shows up only years after someone is exposed , according to a study by Dr. Brian Schwartz of Johns Hopkins and Dr. Howard Hu of University of Michigan .
The new work suggests long - ago lead exposure can make an aging person 's brain work as if it 's five years older than it really is .
If that 's verified by more research , it means that sharp cuts in environmental lead levels more than 20 years ago did n't stop its widespread effects .
"
We 're trying to offer a caution that a portion of what has been called normal aging might in fact be due to ubiquitous environmental exposures like lead .
The fact that it 's happening with lead is the first proof of principle that it 's possible , " said Dr. Schwartz , a leader in the study of lead 's delayed effects .
Other pollutants like mercury and pesticides may do the same thing , he said .

There are many people who want to see desktop Linux succeed , and there are many companies and independent projects working towards that goal .
Linux has very strong ties to the server and embedded markets , and device for device outweighs Windows in the world .
However , not everyone agrees trying to erode Microsoft desktop market share is the way to go for Linux growth , and one of those people is a chairman of Linspire .
Michael Robertson of Linspire thinks that pushing Linux onto the desktop has been a near - futile effort , claiming that the “ ecosystem ” of Windows on the PC is too complex to compete with .
That 's a far cry from the roots that Linspire came from .
As many of us remember , Linspire was once Lindows , and they prided themselves on making an easy to use desktop OS that catered specifically to people coming from Windows .
Instead , Robertson now feels post - PC devices , like ultra mobiles and low cost laptops , PDAs and others of their kind are where Linux needs to make its stand .
He 's got a point – Linux as a kernel and a platform has been very attractive to the manufacturers of these products .
Is the room for growth enough , however ?
Today several people noted that I am no longer on Techmeme ’s leader board .
Funny , lately I ’ve been reading TechMeme less and less and caring less and less about whether what I do appears there .
It ’s why I went to Washington DC .
I knew the other geeks like Mike Arrington would n’t link to those videos .
Why ?
Well , as Zoe Lofgren said in the conversation we had with her , politicians are boring .
I remember on a Gillmor Gang a few months back that Arrington announced that he was an entertainer .
He ’s right , and is one of the reasons why he owns the top of the Techmeme leaderboard .
Me ?
I ’d rather do something else than be an entertainer .
I want to have smart conversations and if that means I ’m not going to be on the Techmeme leaderboard anymore , so be it .
This week I was at Hewlett Packard hanging out with researchers who are working at the atomic level to find new ways to make memory and processors that will be far more important to all of us than whether or not there ’s some people standing in line waiting for the next iPhone .
But science is n’t sexy .
You wo n’t see our video of that on TechMeme either .
Nor will you see the video that we did with the CEO of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association that ’ll be up on Monday .
Nor will you see the WorkFast.tv video we did with Tim Ferriss .
In fact , out of all the videos I ’ve done this year I ca n’t think of one that ’s been on Techmeme .
Heck , my tour of CERN was n’t on TechMeme , nor was our visit to IBM ’s Research Center .
So , if I ’m not chasing Techmeme anymore , what am I chasing ?
FriendFeed and Twitter .
They are , together , where the audience that I really care about is hanging out .
Who do I care about ?
Early adopters who want to have conversations with smart people about smart things .
Well , because FriendFeed ’ers care about learning something new about the industry and not just getting entertained by the latest sensationalism .
Interesting that Dave Winer just shipped a new tech news site .
Why ?
He ’s disatisfied with Techmeme too .
Funny , too , that I was talking with a journalist from a major news organization a couple of weeks back .
He said “ we only get 1,400 visitors when we ’re at the top of Techmeme — that ’s statistically insignificant . ”
I answered back “ I am getting more visitors lately from Twitter and FriendFeed and the audience I get is more engaged and is usually reading Techmeme anyway . ”
But , just in case , FastCompany.tv is one of the advertisers on TechMeme now and I do read it a couple times a day just to see if I missed something ( it ’s been a long time , though , that it caught something that had n’t already been discussed over on FriendFeed ) .
As another example , look at the kinds of things I ’ve “ Liked ” on FriendFeed lately .
Now compare that to TechMeme .
Which one is more interesting ?
Why ?
It ’s OK if you say Techmeme is more entertaining .
It is .
But is that all you want out of your tech bloggers and journalists ?
If the North Pole becomes ice - free this summer — the odds for that are 50 - 50 , one scientist says — that does n't mean that the whole Arctic region will become an open ocean .
Mark Serreze of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado told The Independent , a London - based newspaper , " I 'd say it 's even - odds whether the North Pole melts out . "
The article , posted on the newspaper 's Web site Friday , generated some confusion as to what would actually happen at the North Pole , and in the Arctic Ocean as a whole , as the summer melt season gears up in the next few weeks .
In a telephone interview with LiveScience , Serreze explained that a melt - out at the North Pole would n't mean that all Arctic ice would melt .
Rather , the thin , newly - formed ice around 90 degrees latitude could melt away for a few days .
Such an event would be significant , he said , because any holes that have appeared in the ice at the North Pole up until now have been a result of winds pushing the sea ice around and creating cracks , not the melt - related processes that have taken hold in the Arctic in recent years .
Usually , the North Pole is covered with thick , perennial ice that forms over several years .
But during last summer 's record melt , which opened up the fabled Northwest Passage , a substantial amount of older ice melted .
( Typically only the thinner , first - year ice melts in the summer , while the thick , perennial ice survives . )
Average sea ice extent at the end of the summer was 1.65 million square miles ( 4.28 million square kilometers ) , almost 30 percent lower than the previous record low .
As winter cooled the Arctic waters , ice re-formed over the ocean , as it usually does .
But this newly formed ice is thinner , first - year ice , more susceptible to melting once summer comes around again .
As it happened , wind patterns and ocean currents over the last few months moved that newly formed ice smack over the North Pole , setting up the situation where at least a temporarily ice - free North Pole could form .
" It 's this symbolic thing , I think , " Serreze told LiveScience .
" This is where Santa Claus lives … it kind of hits you in the stomach . "
The North Pole is n't the only part of the Arctic Ocean covered with this newly - formed ice — a substantial part of the region is capped by this thin frozen veneer .
That " we 're going to lose a bunch of ice , " is more or less certain , Serraze said , but just where that melt will occur is " a roll of the dice . "
One factor affecting where and how much ice will melt this summer is the somewhat higher ice extent that re-froze this winter .
( While the winter extent was higher this year than last year , it was still about 390,000 square miles ( 1 million kilometers ) smaller than average — that 's equal to an area about the size of Texas and New Mexico combined .
Sea ice forms not by spreading out along the surface of the ocean , but rather as water just below the ice freezes onto the underside of the ice .
This means that more ice probably also means slightly thicker ice , said Josefino Comiso of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , which helps monitor sea ice coverage .
Thicker ice is more likely to survive the summer and become second - year ice , becoming thicker still in the winter .
The North Pole is also cooler than lower Arctic latitudes , meaning North Pole ice could better resist melting .
Even if it does , there 's still the possibility that winds could move the ice around so that a hole that formed at a lower latitude could be pushed over the North Pole , making it ice - free , Serreze said .
It 's these weather patterns that scientists will be watching in the coming weeks to get a better sense of what will happen in the Arctic this summer .
Serreze says that a warm spring season has put melting about on par with where it was at this point last year .
But other scientists say this summer 's melt is unlikely to be as spectacular as last year's .
" We may not see a record minimum at all , " said Tharston Markus , also of Goddard .
Scientists are monitoring the sea ice extent daily and say that after the main melt occurs over the next few weeks , they 'll have a better idea of what the minimum extent , which typically occurs in mid-September , might be .
For now though , all they can do is watch and wait .

Greetings .
Some offhand comments by Google 's Vint Cerf at a recent event seem to have a triggered a panicky " Vint Cerf proposes nationalizing the Internet " buzz that 's been ramping up fairly rapidly .
Holy BitTorrent , Batman !
Army paratroopers seen dropping into parking lots at AT&T and Comcast , while the Transportation Security Agency orders us all to remove our shoes before surfing the Web !
Settle down , everyone .
As usual with these kinds of stories , the truth is significantly different from the breathless buzzing .
Here 's how Vint described his thinking on this issue to me last night , presented verbatim .
And I 'll note right here that I agree 100 % with his analysis .
If the Internet is really the essential infrastructural and economic pillar that is claimed all around , it 's time that we started treating it that way .
- - - Comments From Vint Cerf
" In a NYC event called Personal Democracy Forum , the question of broadband access came up .
There is n't enough facilities based competition in broadband and in my opinion there is n't likely to be .
I expressed the opinion that perhaps the Internet should be treated more like the road system .
You do n't have multiple roads going to your house for example .
Instead , it is a common resource .
I said something like " maybe we should treat the Internet more like the road system . "
The discussion went on and the point was made that the incentives for the present set of broadband carriers ( basically the telcos and the cable companies ) stemmed from their origins as purpose - built networks .
Telephone nets were designed and built to deliver one service : telephony .
Cable systems were built for one purpose : to deliver television .
In that context [ and although it was not said , given the monopoly characteristics of each ] the FCC separately regulated them .
This worked reasonably [ some might disagree ] as private sector systems each oriented around a single service .
The rules were organized around how that service was to be provided including the network built to deliver it .
The Internet service , however , has been treated as a title I information service .
There is no regulation .
Moreover , the Internet is not purpose built for one application .
It is capable of supporting a wide range of applications .
A problem arises with the provision of Internet service via the telephone network and the cable network .
The carriers of these services seem to feel that because they own the resource and because the Internet service is unregulated , they can impose any rules they like and constrain users of the services however they wish .
There is inadequate competition to discipline this market .
If broadband service is essential to the national economy and to citizens , given the present means by which it is implemented , and given that it appears unlikely that the usual competitive pressures will lead to discipline among the competitors , perhaps we need new national rules to assure that the service is openly and equally accessible to any application provider and to all users .
Equal does not mean that everyone pays the same amount .
In particular , higher capacity might be priced at a higher rate .
Provision needs to be made , however , to deal with high cost ( to the provider ) areas using a new form of Universal Service or some other subsidy .
I would not rule out municipal networks that citizens decide to build through bond processes ( usually meaning the private sector is engaged to build and probably operate ) .
Some of us have termed this kind of open access rule making " horizontal " regulation since the openness is intended to be along the Internet service layer .
Applications and services provided above that layer can be highly competitive and provided by any application provider on the network .
In the UK , BT has been split into a wholesale Internet business and a retail business .
Anyone can buy raw Internet service at wholesale and then operate any application service above that .
Capacity is priced based not on bytes transferred but on maximum rates of use ( usually capped ) .
The idea is to provide new incentives for broadband Internet providers to keep the system open to new applications and to promote substantial competition , not at the facilities base but above the IP layer .
At present , the incentives do not favor such a posture . "

During the summer of 1991 , the United States military had collected artillery , tanks , Bradley fighting vehicles , conventional and unconventional munitions , trucks , etc at Camp Doha in Kuwait .
As result of carelessness , this weapons depot caught fire with consequent catastrophic explosions resulting in death , injury , illness and extensive environmental contamination from depleted uranium and conventional explosives .
Recently the emirate of Kuwait required the U.S. Department of Defense to remove the contamination .
Consequently , over 6,700 tons of contaminated soil , sand and other residue was collected and shipped back to the United States for burial by American Ecology at Boise , Idaho .
( Article continues below )
When Bob Nichols , an investigative journalist , and I contacted American Ecology we found out that they had absolutely no knowledge of U.S.
Army regulations and all of the medical orders dealing with depleted uranium contamination , environmental remediation procedures , safety and medical care .
They had never heard of Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for dealing with hazardous waste such as radioactive materials and conventional explosives byproducts .
The trans - shipment across the ocean , unloading at Longview , Washington State port , transport by rail , and burial in Idaho not only endanger the residents of these areas , but pose a significant agricultural threat through introduction of pests , microbes etc. foreign to our nation .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Sadly , the known adverse health and environmental hazards from uranium weapons contamination are in our own backyard .
The EPA has listed the former Nuclear Metals - Starmet uranium weapons manufacturing site in Concord , Mass . on the EPA ’s Superfund National Priority List because it poses a significant risk to public health and the environment .
Consequently , the community in which our nation was born on April 18 , 1775 , is now the location of America ’s own closed dirty bomb factory that will endanger the health and safety of the descendants of the Minutemen .
The previous delivery of at least 100 GBU 28 bunker buster bombs containing depleted uranium warheads by the United States and their use by Israel against Lebanese targets has resulted in additional radioactive and chemical toxic contamination with consequent adverse health and environmental effects throughout the Middle East .
Israeli tank gunners are also using depleted uranium tank rounds , as photographs verify .
Today , U.S. , British , and now Israeli military personnel are using illegal uranium munitions — America ’s and England ’s own “ dirty bombs . ”
The U.S. Army , Department of Energy , Department of Defense and British Ministry of Defense officials deny that there are any adverse health and environmental effects as a consequence of the manufacture , testing and / or use of uranium munitions .
They do so to avoid liability for the willful and illegal dispersal of a radioactive toxic material — depleted uranium .
The use of uranium weapons is a crime against humanity .
All governments must force cessation of uranium weapons use .
Israel should provide medical care to all DU casualties in Lebanon and clean up all DU contamination .
U.S. and British officials have arrogantly refused to comply with their own regulations , orders and directives that require U.S. Department of Defense officials to provide prompt and effective medical care to all exposed individuals .
They also refuse to clean up dispersed radioactive contamination as required by Army regulations .
Dr. Doug Rokke is the former director of the Army ’s Depleted Uranium Project .
It was his task to clean up the radioactive battlefields of the Gulf War .

Comment on this article
Bruce Haggard , an election commissioner in Faulkner County , Arkansas , is baffled by a problem that occurred with two voting machines in this month 's state primary elections .
The machines allocated votes cast in one race to an entirely different race that was n't even on the electronic ballot .
The problem resulted in the wrong candidate being declared victor in a state House nomination race .
" I do n't understand how it could possibly happen , " Haggard told Threat Level .
The problem occurred with two touch - screen voting machines made by Election Systems & Software , which were the only machines used in Faulkner County 's East Cadron B voting precinct .
Haggard says the night before the election , officials noticed that the electronic ballot on two machines slated to be used at East Cadron B was missing the State House District 45 race .
So officials printed up paper ballots to be used just for that race in that precinct .
Voters cast electronic ballots on the voting machines for other races , then cast paper ballots for the District 45 race .
At the end of the day , Dr. Terry Fiddler ( D ) had beat Linda Tyler ( D ) for nomination to the House seat with 794 votes to Tyler 's 770 .
But a post-election examination revealed that despite the fact that the electronic ballots on the two machines at the East Cadron B precinct did n't display the District 45 race , the machines recorded votes for that race anyway .
After some examination , officials determined that the machines had taken votes that were actually cast in a different race – the Cadron Township Constable race – and given them to the non-existent District 45 race instead .
Luckily , Haggard says officials were able to determine this is where the votes came from because the touch - screen machines produce a voter - verifiable paper audit trail .
Those paper trails showed correctly that there was no District 45 race on the ballot and , thus , that there were no votes cast on the machines for the District 45 race .
But memory cards taken from inside the machines , showed that the machines recorded votes in the District 45 race .
Officials were able to determine that those District 45 votes actually belonged to the Cadron Township Constable race because the same number of votes that were allocated to the District 45 race in the memory cards matched the number of votes that voters had cast in the Cadron Township Constable race , which appeared on the voter - verifiable paper audit trail .
" Somehow the recording software had tabulated it into the wrong race , " Haggard says .
" Thank goodness for the paper trail .
We went to the paper trail and could show how people actually voted . "
Haggard does n't have a clue how the switch could have happened but says that it was either a problem with the ballot definition file that election officials created before the election that tells the machines where to allocate votes or in the voting machine software itself .
Once the bogus votes in District 45 were subtracted from the totals , Fiddler lost 51 votes in the race , showing that Tyler had actually won the nomination for the House seat .
ES&S did not respond to a call for comment but Haggard says the company will be expected to come up with an answer about what happened .
He says the two machines in question have been sequestered in the county warehouse , and the county will be requesting help from the secretary of state 's office to conduct an examination with ES&S .
Haggard says the examination will likely occur next month .
Haggard says they have no plans to bring in an independent investigator , though he says he 's going to insist that ES&S examine the machines on site in his presence .
This is not the first time that ES&S voting systems have had vote - flipping problems .
In Ohio during last November 's general election ES&S tabulation software flipped the vote totals for two candidates .
Officials noticed the problem when they compared the vote totals produced from the memory cards to the totals that appeared on paper printouts from the machines .
ES&S machines in Ohio also had a separate problem last November when voters , among them the secretary of state , reported that their machine had dropped a candidate 's name from the race and displayed a gray bar in his place .
ES&S machines were also at the center of the controversy over the 13th Congressional District race in Florida in 2006 when more than 18,000 ballots cast in Sarasota County showed no vote cast in the CD - 13 race after hundreds of voters had complained that the machines failed to respond to their touch .
An investigation by the Government Accountability Office indicated that the machines likely were n't to blame in that case , though critics have questioned the thoroughness of that investigation .
CORRECTION : A previous version of this post said the race was for a state House seat .
It was actually a primary race for nomination to the state House seat election .

A desk was supposed to keep people away from the waxwork A man has been arrested after tearing the head off a wax figure of Adolf Hitler at a newly opened branch of Madame Tussauds in Berlin .
The 41 - year - old man was held after attacking the waxwork , only hours after the attraction opened on Saturday .
The inclusion of Hitler in the exhibition has aroused controversy in a country where Nazi symbols are banned .
But the exhibition 's organisers said they could hardly depict German history without portraying Hitler .
They said the waxwork depicted Hitler in the hours before his suicide , a defeated figure slumped in his bunker as the Red Army reached Berlin .
The Fuhrer was positioned behind a table , which was supposed to prevent visitors posing with the statue - or damaging it .
' Showing reality ' Police spokesman Bernhard Schodrowski said a security guard had been shoved aside by the attacker .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" He tried to prevent the man from acting but failed .
The suspect , from the Kreuzberg district , pushed the man aside and lunged at the Adolf Hitler figure and ripped the head off . "
Another visitor , who was not named , said the man went straight to the Hitler figure and stepped behind the desk .
" I heard a rumbling and then he tore the figure down off the chair .
The security was immediately there and tried to control him but it was n't easy , he defended himself .
Additional security staff took him away then and I had to leave the place , " he said .
The attacker was only the second visitor to enter the exhibition , according to one report .
The decision to include a figure of Hitler has been controversial from the start .
Erasing him from history is not going to bring the perished ones back
Stephen Kramer
Central Council of Jews in Germany Natalie Ruoss , of Madame Tussauds , said : " We did surveys while we were planning the exhibition on the street with Berliners and with tourists , and the result was quite clear that Hitler is one of the figures that they want to see .
" Seeing as we are portraying the history of Germany we could hardly have left him out ... we want to show the reality . "
Despite some criticism in the media , Stephen Kramer , general secretary of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , said he did not object to Hitler being shown , as long as it was done properly .
" Hitler should not become a tourist attraction but if this exhibition helps to some extent normalise the way of dealing with Hitler , as a kind of a demystification , let 's try it , " Mr Kramer told the AFP news agency .
" Erasing him from history is not going to bring the perished ones back , it 's not going to heal the damage that he did , the crimes that he did .
That would be counter - productive , " he said .
The waxwork museum also includes other German historical figures like Otto von Bismarck , Karl Marx , Beethoven , Bach and Einstein .
Foreigners featured include Winston Churchill , Mikhail Gorbachev and Tom Cruise .

What are these ?
That may have been the point of no return .
I , as is traditionally my role , answered that the nitrogen evaporates at the surface of the table , which provides a cushion of air for the drop to sit on , and thermally insulates the drop to minimize further evaporation .
So you see a drop dance around without boiling away , and without interacting with the table and getting slowed down or smeared out .
Then , I continued ...
I mentioned that the same principle makes it possible to dip a wet hand into molten lead , or to drink liquid nitrogen without injury .
I had done the latter several years earlier in a cryogenics lab , and remembered the physics behind how it worked .
Naturally , people around me were skeptical .
“ You can't drink the stuff ... it'll freeze your whole body ...
Remember ' Terminator 2 ? ' ” But I was sure of myself .
I had done it before , and I believed in the physics behind it .
So , naturally , I poured myself a glass and took a shot .
Simple .
Swallow .
Blow smoke out nose and mouth and impress everyone at the party .
Within about two seconds , I had collapsed to the floor , unable to breathe or feel anything other than intense pain .
Ambulance arrives .
Police arrive .
Trip to hospital .
Admission .
Try to explain to ER staff exactly how something like this happens .
Then I pass out .
Wake up next morning connected to many machines , some beeping , others performing more important functions like digesting my food and breathing for me .
Turns out that , in accordance with popular belief , you really should not drink the stuff .
I eventually learned a few things about liquid nitrogen .
Like ... while you can safely put it in your mouth , and blow neat smoke patterns , you should never ever ever swallow .
First off , the closing of the epiglottis prevents the nitrogen gas from escaping , so it is forced into your body instead .
Second , your esophagus naturally constricts around anything inside it , so , even if there is a thin protective gas layer , the esophagus will find a way to make contact with the liquid nitrogen .
Also turns out that my memory was flawed .
When I had done it six years ago , I put it into my mouth and did n't swallow .
Over time , that fine line between parlor trick and near fatal accident must have blurred .
On the subject of swallowing toxic items , have a look at this unnerving account of what happens when you swallow liquid nitrogen :

Puny but powerful , the itsy bitsy comma remains a foe to many folks striving to use good grammar .
The comma is among the most confusing and misused punctuation marks in English grammar .
Some people place a comma whenever they pause in their proofreading .
While this strategy is a good guide , it is not foolproof .
Some guys have a vague recollection of grade - school grammar and guess at the comma ’s proper placement .
The problem here is that the rules get muddled over time .
We see commas used incorrectly in print everyday , and for most of us , grammar school was a long time ago .
Many folks seem to add commas whenever the mood strikes them , while others avoid commas entirely .
For everyone who wants to overcome the comma , here are my 10 comma rules to remember .
1 . Use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by one of the following words ( known as coordinating conjunctions ) : and , but , for , or , nor , so , yet .
For example : “ She likes to read , and I like to write . ”
However , in the example “ I like to run and swim , ” no comma is needed because there is only one independent clause .
2 . Use commas after introductory clauses , phrases , or words that come before the main clause .
Do n’t put a comma after the main clause when a dependent clause follows it ( except for cases of extreme contrast , for example :
They said they were not sleepy , although they fell asleep immediately ) .
3 . Use commas to set off nonessential clauses , phrases , and words that occur in the middle of a sentence .
Use one comma before the nonessential information to indicate the beginning of the pause and one at the end to indicate the end of the pause .
To determine if the sentence element is essential , leave out the clause , phrase , or word , to see if the sentence still makes sense .
If it does , then the element in question is nonessential and should be set off with commas .
Here is an example of a nonessential clause :
The girl , who happened to be a member of the club , was late for dinner .
4 . Use commas to separate two or more coordinate adjectives that describe the same noun .
Coordinate adjectives are adjectives with equal status in describing the noun .
You can decide if two adjectives in a row are coordinate by asking the following questions :
Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written in reverse order ?
Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written with and between them ?
If you answer “ yes ” to these questions , then the adjectives are coordinate and should be separated by a comma .
Here are some examples of coordinate and non-coordinate adjectives :
She was a difficult , stubborn child ( coordinate ) .
They lived in a white frame house ( non-coordinate ) .
5 . Use commas to separate three or more words , phrases , or clauses written in a series .
For example :
The child enjoys playing baseball , reading comic books , and watching television .
6 . Use a comma prior to adding a quotation .
The coach instructed his team , “ You have the ability to win if you maintain your focus . ”
7 . Use a comma near the end of a sentence to separate contrasted coordinate ( equal status ) elements .
For example :
The girl said her favorite subject was history , not science .
8 . Use commas to set off items in dates March 13 , 1992 , was the day we became best friends .
( When using only the month and the year in a sentence , no comma is necessary .
For example :
My first trip to Florida in March 1992 is still vivid in my mind . )
9 . Use commas to set off geographical names .
For example : Charleston , South Carolina , is a city rich in history .
10 . Use commas to avoid confusion .
For example :
Tell the doctor , pepper is one of your asthma triggers .
Or better yet : Tell Christopher , Columbus discovered America .
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act provides the " exclusive means " for electronic eavesdropping within the US , a federal district court judge in California ruled yesterday , and explicitly supersedes the government 's claim that it may invoke the " state secrets " privilege to shield documents from court scrutiny .
The plaintiffs in the suit against the government , the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , now have 30 days to show — without recourse to secret documents — that they were targets of government wiretaps .
But the language of the decision also strongly suggests that if they do , any surveillance that occurred outside the bounds of FISA will be found unlawful , notwithstanding the president 's assertion of an " inherent authority " to ignore the law in the name of national security .
The Al - Haramain case has its origins in a government blunder that tore a rare hole in the veil of secrecy surrounding the National Security Agency 's surveillance programs :
The foundation was accidentally given a classified document , which the government has since reclaimed , showing that its directors ' telephone conversations had been intercepted .
An appeals court later ruled that , notwithstanding the inadvertent disclosure , that document should remain under seal , and the government has sought to invoke its privilege to protect state secrets in order to have the case dismissed .
But in yesterday 's 56 - page opinion , Judge Vaughn R. Walker ruled that in Section 1806 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , Congress provided specific procedures by which " aggrieved persons " may have sensitive information reviewed in camera by the courts , thereby preempting the common law protection for state secrets pertaining to the type of surveillance covered by FISA .
And more broadly , Walker insisted that FISA really does provide the sole , binding process by which the executive branch may conduct foreign intelligence wiretaps .
" Congress appears clearly to have intended to — and did — establish the exclusive means for foreign intelligence surveillance activities to be conducted , " wrote Judge Walker in his opinion .
" Whatever power the executive may otherwise have had in this regard , FISA limits the power of the executive branch to conduct such activities and it limits the executive branch ’s authority to assert the state secrets privilege in response to challenges to the legality of its foreign intelligence surveillance activities . "
There remains one last catch - 22 , however .
FISA trumps the state secrets privilege only in cases involving " aggrieved persons . "
But plaintiffs must prove that they are " aggrieved " without making use of the secret document they had obtained before the law will permit documents , and others concerning surveillance of Al - Haramain , to be used in court .
Exactly what standard of proof they must meet , however , is unclear because there is so little case law governing the question .
Jon Eisenberg , the attorney for the Al - Haramain Islamic Foundation , nevertheless notes that the judge " gives us some hints , " suggesting that the sort of independent evidence adduced in the high - profile surveillance lawsuits targeting telecom firms might be sufficient .
Eisenberg is optimistic that he can meet this hurdle .
" I think there 's compelling , unclassified circumstantial evidence , " he says , " that would lead any reasonable person to believe our clients were surveilled . "
Perhaps just as important is the judge 's implicit rejection of the idea that the executive branch has the power — perhaps , as some have argued , pursuant to the president 's Article II powers as commander in chief — to conduct surveillance outside the bounds of FISA .
Though the ruling does not directly consider this question , it does hint at how Walker , who was appointed by George Bush Sr. , would be likely to rule on the merits .
If FISA provides a real and binding limit on the surveillance power of the executive , after all , then it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the NSA 's secret program of warrantless surveillance was indeed illegal .
" If we get standing , " predicted Eisenberg , " we win . "
The ruling does not directly affect the more well - publicized class - action suits against telecoms complicit in the NSA 's surveillance , which are currently in limbo before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals — presumably pending next week 's vote in the Senate on a bill to grant the telecoms retroactive immunity for their actions .
But Kurt Opsahl , an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation who is litigating those cases , notes that the ruling " undercuts one of the talking points " that Democratic leaders have advanced as a rationale for endorsing the pending bill .
" A reason given for agreeing to the current form of the FISA bill , " says Opsahl , " was that the exclusive means language " — a provision reasserting that foreign intelligence surveillance must occur pursuant to FISA — " was part of the trade - off the Democrats had made . "
This ruling makes clear , as critics of the FISA amendments compromise have argued all along , that FISA is already the " exclusive means " of lawful surveillance , not a new concession won by Democrats in Congress .
And according to Opsahl , " this shows that the litigation can proceed under longstanding secrecy procedures that have worked for many years . "

A single typhoon in Taiwan buries as much carbon in the ocean -- in the form of sediment -- as all the other rains in that country all year long combined .
That 's the finding of an Ohio State University study published in a recent issue of the journal Geology .
The study -- the first ever to examine the chemistry of stream water and sediments that were being washed out to sea while a typhoon was happening at full force -- will help scientists develop better models of global climate change .
Anne Carey , associate professor of earth sciences at Ohio State , said that she and her colleagues have braved two typhoons since starting the project in 2004 .
The Geology paper details their findings from a study of Taiwan 's Choshui River during Typhoon Mindulle in July of that year .
Carey 's team analyzes water and river sediments from around the world in order to measure how much carbon is pulled from the atmosphere as mountains weather away .
They study two types of weathering : physical and chemical .
Physical weathering happens when organic matter containing carbon adheres to soil that is washed into the ocean and buried .
Chemical weathering happens when silicate rock on the mountainside is exposed to carbon dioxide and water , and the rock disintegrates .
The carbon washes out to sea , where it eventually forms calcium carbonate and gets deposited on the ocean floor .
If the carbon gets buried in the ocean , Carey explained , it eventually becomes part of sedimentary rock , and does n't return to the atmosphere for hundreds of millions of years .
Though the carbon buried in the ocean by storms wo n't solve global warming , knowing how much carbon is buried offshore of mountainous islands such as Taiwan could help scientists make better estimates of how much carbon is in the atmosphere -- and help them decipher its effect on global climate change .
Scientists have long suspected that extreme storms such as hurricanes and typhoons bury a lot of carbon , because they wash away so much sediment .
But since the sediment washes out to sea quickly , samples had to be captured during a storm to answer the question definitively .
" We discovered that if you miss sampling these storms , then you miss truly understanding the sediment and chemical delivery of these rivers , " said study coauthor and Ohio State doctoral student Steve Goldsmith .
The researchers found that , of the 61 million tons of sediment carried out to sea by the Choshui River during Typhoon Mindulle , some 500,000 tons consisted of particles of carbon created during chemical weathering .
That 's about 95 percent as much carbon as the river transports during normal rains over an entire year , and it equates to more than 400 tons of carbon being washed away for each square mile of the watershed during the storm .
Carey 's collaborators from Academia Sinica -- a major research institute in Taiwan -- happened to be out collecting sediments for a long - term study of the region when Mindulle erupted in the Pacific .
" I do n't want to say that a typhoon is serendipity , but you take what the weather provides , " Carey said .
" Since Taiwan has an average of four typhoons a year , in summer you pretty much can't avoid them .
It 's not unusual for some of us to be out in the field when one hits . "
As the storm neared the coast , the geologists drove to the Choshui River watershed near the central western portion of the country .
Normally , the river is very shallow .
But during a typhoon , it swells with water from the mountains .
It 's not unusual to see boulders the size of cars -- or actual cars -- floating downstream .
Mindulle gave the geologists their first chance to test some new equipment they designed for capturing water samples from storm runoff .
The equipment consisted of one - liter plastic bottles wedged inside a weighted Teflon case that would sink beneath the waves during a storm .
They suspended the contraption from bridges above the river as the waters raged below .
At the height of the storm , they tied themselves to the bridges for safety .
They did this once every three hours , taking refuge in a nearby storm shelter in between .
Four days later , after the storm had passed , they filtered the water from the bottles and analyzed the sediments for particulate organic carbon .
Then they measured the amount of silica in the remaining water sample in order to calculate the amount of weathering occurring with the storm .
Because they know that two carbon molecules are required to weather one molecule of silica , they could then calculate how much carbon washed out to sea .
Carey and Goldsmith did those calculations with study coauthor Berry Lyons , professor of earth sciences at Ohio State .
Carey cautioned that this is the first study of its kind , and more data are needed to put the Mindulle numbers into a long - term perspective .
She and Goldsmith are still analyzing the data from Typhoon Haitang , which struck when the two of them happened to be in Taiwan in 2005 , so it 's too early to say how much carbon runoff occurred during that storm .
" But with two to four typhoons happening in Taiwan per year , it 's not unreasonable to think that the amount of carbon sequestered during these storms could be comparable to the long - term annual carbon flux for the country , " she said .
The findings could be useful to scientists who model global climate change , Goldsmith said .
He pointed to other studies that suggest that mountainous islands such as Taiwan , New Zealand , and Papua New Guinea produce one third of all the sediments that enter the world oceans annually .
As scientists calculate Earth 's carbon " budget " -- how much carbon is being added to the atmosphere and how much is being taken away -- they need to know how much is being buried in the oceans .
" What is the true budget of carbon being sequestered in the ocean per year ?
If the majority of sediment and dissolved constituents are being delivered during these storms , and the storms are n't taken into account , those numbers are going to be off , " Goldsmith said .
As weathering pulls carbon from the atmosphere , the planet cools .
For instance , other Ohio State geologists recently determined that the rise and weathering of the Appalachians preceded an ice age 450 million years ago .
If more carbon is being buried in the ocean than scientists once thought , does that mean we can worry less about global warming ?
" I would n't go that far , " Goldsmith said .
" But if you want to build an accurate climate model , you need to understand how much CO2 is taken out naturally every year .
And this paper shows that those numbers could be off substantially . "
Carey agreed , and added that weathering rocks is not a practical strategy for reversing global warming , either .
" You 'd have to weather all the volcanic rocks in the world to reduce the CO2 level back to pre-industrial times , " she said .
" You 'd have to grind the rock into really fine particles , and you 'd consume a lot of energy -- fossil fuels -- to do that , so there probably would n't be any long - term gain . "

If there were signs of serious progress , that would be one thing , but there ’s not .
It has been in trouble for years and the GOP thought it was hysterical when they shot down the Clinton health care plan in the ’90s .
After that victory – and what a victory as we now see in the millionth study panning the state of health care in the US – they continued propping up their special interest friends in industry .
What continues to jump out in these studies is that the US spends the most money in the world yet receives so little .
Gosh , folks , who sees a problem here ?
Just like the GOP friends in other industries , they ’re doing just fine while the population gets so little in return .
In a real free market system – which we do n’t have despite what the GOP says – should n’t buyers be getting more for their money ?
And again , McCain thinks a silly tax credit will help ?
Seriously .
Worse still , he wants a similar program for our retirement plans though all with the guidance of Wall Street .
Oh to live in the Ivory Tower of nine or ten houses .

Put your hand up if you ’ve ever driven your car up to a gas pump only to notice after you ’ve parked that your gas cap is on the other side .
My brother , if your hand is up right now , you are not alone .
See , some cars I ’ve driven have the ol ’ gas hole on the starboard side and some on port .
Due to my unfortunate afflication with gasholenorememberititis , I ’m always parking the car the wrong way .
Sure , I try desperately to notice a little gas - cap bulge in the side mirror when I pull up , craning my head wildly in both directions , and generally pretty sure I caught quick glimpse of it as I pull in .
But then I get out , notice I messed up , pound my fist on the trunk , give a sheepish toothy grin to the attendant , and then have to pull off a quick and awkward seven - point - turn before anyone moves in to steal my spot .
It is a terrible thing .
But guess what ?
High fives all around the room , because there is hope for People Like Us .
Shockingly , I have recently discovered The Gas Arrow !
Yes , believe it , driving fans , because it truly exists .
The Gas Arrow is a little , tiny arrow right beside the picture of the gas pump , which tells you which side your car ’s gas hole is on !
I know , it ’s crazy .
And I guess whoever is responsible for marketing really dropped the ball on this one , because nobody I asked ( n=3 ) has even noticed this before !
Yes , just look at that Gas Arrow , head - nodding casually to the left or the right , a classy pal just trying to tip you off real subtle like .
It ’s like a flashlight in a storage closet , a lighthouse on a foggy pier , a finger pointing at what you ’re supposed to look at .
The great , noble Gas Arrow , telling you which way to park your stupid car .
So thanks Gas Arrow , for the big helper .
Until car companies start putting gas holes on both sides of the car or they invent a new wireless gas that lets you fill up through your radio , I think I can speak for all of humanity when I say that we love you and everything you stand for .
AWESOME !

That ’s right ladies and gents , Pearl Jam has commenced recording another studio effort , which will actually be their ninth studio album .
For this purpose they ’re working with producer Brendan O’Brien , guitarist Mike McCready told Seattle radio station KISW last Thursday ( May 1 ) .
Despite the fact that just “ four or five ” songs are complete so far , McCready said that the band hopes they will be able to release this album in 2008 .
Aside from Pearl Jam , Brendan O’Brien has also worked with Bruce Springsteen and Rage Against the Machine , but has n’t worked with the Seattle band since 1998 ’s “ Yield ” .
“ Brendan works really fast , ” bassist Jeff Ament has told Billboard.com .
“ He ’s a super pro .
I ’ve always felt , working with him , that he understood me as a bass player and that ’s not always easy .
A lot of producers are there to please the singer .
But I ’ve always had a great rapport with him .
I can tell him I want something to sound like the O’Jays or Led Zeppelin or PJ Harvey and he gets it . ”
“ We ’ve always been friends , ” said O’Brien .
“ They were great to me when we were making records together [ before ] , and we still remained very good friends … .
I still think they ’re a great band .
Eddie [ Vedder ] has one of the best , if not the best , voices out there .
When he sings , people believe them . ”
Pearl Jam is also about to embark on a 13 - date East Coast tour that runs from June 11 - 30 .
But what ’s really impressive is the fact that in an effort to support Portland , Ore. , U.S. Senate candidate Steve Novick , the band has set aside special tickets to its sold - out shows in New York , Camden , N.J. , and Washington , D.C. , that include donations to Novick ’s campaign .
So for all you voters out there , keep an eye out for Novick .

Police : Teacher Made Suicide Pact with Student A missing Buffalo teacher and eighth - grade student entered into a suicide pact .
July 11 , 2008  --
Police say a former Buffalo charter school teacher who disappeared with a male eighth - grade student last month made a suicide pact with the teen .
Cara L. Dickey , 30 , surrendered to Buffalo police Thursday on four charges , including felony counts of promoting a suicide attempt and unlawful imprisonment .
Arrest papers allege Dickey sent the 14 - year - old boy inappropriate text messages , picked him up on the afternoon of June 16 , drove him to numerous locations and supplied him with rum and over - the - counter drugs .
Police found both of them the next morning , the boy in a suburban mall and Dickey sleeping in her vehicle elsewhere .
Dickey was fired from her job at South Buffalo Charter School .
Dickey 's lawyer declined comment as she was released on $ 5,000 bail .
Obama meets U.S. commanders in Iraq Reuters
Published : Monday July 21 , 2008
Print This Email This By Dean Yates and Wisam Mohammed BAGHDAD - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama met Iraqi leaders and U.S. military commanders in Baghdad on Monday in a visit overshadowed by the question of when U.S. troops should go home .
U.S. strategy in Iraq and troop levels are central issues in the November election race between the first - term senator from Illinois and Republican candidate John McCain .
Obama flew into Iraq to assess security in the country , where violence has fallen to its lowest level since early 2004 .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said Obama did not mention his pledge to remove U.S. combat troops within 16 months if he takes office in talks with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
But in comments that suggest Iraq and Obama are not far apart on the issue , Dabbagh said the government had a vision of all foreign combat forces leaving by the end of 2010 if security conditions allowed .
" We cannot give any timetables or dates but the Iraqi government believes the end of 2010 is the appropriate time for the withdrawal of ( American ) forces , " Dabbagh told reporters .
On Sunday the Iraqi government had denied Maliki told a German magazine in an interview that he backed Obama 's plan to withdraw combat troops within 16 months .
The government said Maliki 's remarks to Der Spiegel were translated incorrectly .
There are more than 140,000 American troops in Iraq .
Obama said in very brief remarks he had a " very constructive discussion " with Maliki .
Television pictures showed the two men smiling and shaking hands before they sat down for talks .
Maliki suggested earlier this month setting a timetable for U.S. troops to leave Iraq , but has given no dates .
Obama has welcomed Maliki 's suggestion but some Iraqis insist that the army and police cannot go it alone and that a premature withdrawal of U.S. troops could open the door to the sort of violence that nearly tore Iraq apart not so long ago .
Indeed , Vice President Tareq al - Hashemi , a Sunni Arab , said he told Obama that while he agreed with a withdrawal timetable in principle Iraq 's forces needed to be ready .
" What about a security vacuum ?
What about upgrading the capacity of the Iraqi armed forces ?
...
We have to look all these requirements , " Hashemi later told reporters .
CHALLENGE OF IRAQ , AFGHANISTAN Obama visited Afghanistan over the weekend , the other big foreign policy challenge the next president will face .
He called the situation in Afghanistan " precarious and urgent " and said Washington should start planning to transfer more troops there from Iraq .
McCain has attacked Obama for not visiting Iraq recently to get a close look at conditions .
The Republican candidate has been to Iraq eight times while Obama 's only other trip was in January 2006 , a month before militants blew up a revered Shi'ite shrine in Samarra in an attack that plunged Iraq into vicious sectarian fighting .
Obama , who is visiting Iraq as part of a U.S. congressional delegation , was greeted at Baghdad 's airport by General David Petraeus , the U.S. military commander in the country .
He will hold formal talks later with Petraeus .
Obama has scheduled no news conferences in Iraq and his visit has been shrouded in secrecy for security reasons .
Trying to boost his foreign policy credentials , Obama will also travel to other countries in the Middle East and visit major powers in Europe this week .
Speaking on NBC's " Today Show " , McCain criticised Obama 's position on Iraq .
" I 'm glad that Senator Obama is going to get a chance for the first time to sit down with General David Petraeus and understand what the surge was all about and why it succeeded and why we are winning the war , " McCain said .
" I hope he will have a chance to admit that he badly misjudged the situation and he was wrong . "
U.S. President George W. Bush ordered 30,000 extra troops to Iraq in early 2007 to try to drag the country back from all - out war between majority Shi'ites and minority Sunni Arabs .
The last of those reinforcements depart this week .
The sharp cut in violence in Iraq has led Baghdad to become increasingly assertive about its own security capabilities .
Indeed , Maliki and Bush agreed last week to set a " time horizon " for reducing American forces in Iraq .
It was the closest the Bush administration has come to acknowledging the need for a timeframe for U.S. troop cuts .

Jumpin ' Jehoshaphat , this man redefines the term " being confused . "
He just nicely obliterated the right wing 's chances to smear Michelle Obama with that whole " she 's proud for the first time " stupidity .
Was n't that nice of him ?
The Politico : ( h/t Jed Report )
So a man finally got a question into McCain and he had a very different sort of question .
The questioner noted that he had been educated at Princeton and Harvard and made more than $ 300,000 a year .
" How can I be proud of my country ? " he asked .
Get it — he was mocking Michelle Obama and her statement earlier this year that her husband had for the first time in her life made her proud of her country .
Well , McCain either missed the joke or decided to ignore it and answer the question literally .
I think it was the former because the individual asking the question had a thick accent that sounded to be either Indian or Pakistani , perhaps suggesting to McCain a recent immigrant grappling with America 's image abroad .
" I 'll admit to you that it 's tough , it 's tough in some respects , " McCain said , seeming to lend credence to Michelle Obama 's observation .
McCain said America needed to be " more humble , more inclusive . "
He observed that one of the ways to be proud of the country was to look at our history — and the sacrifices U.S. troops have made abroad .
McCain let his questioner follow up and the individual repeated , but did n't clarify , his line .
In closing , McCain said he was proud of America in part " because of you and what you 've been able to achieve and accomplish . "

It is the best of times ; it is the worst of times�oil is up on U.S. optimism ?
***
Food riots in Africa �India targets food futures �doom and gloom has been overplayed �
***
Do n't bet against America , says the richest man in the world �when Friedman points out what an idiot you are , you know things are n't good �and more !
---------------------
It is the best of times �it is the worst of times .
This morning , oil is over $ 120 � and the price of gold is pushing back up to $ 875 .
That 's good news , say the headlines .
Oil is up because people think the United States will avoid a recession .
" Oil tops $ 120 a barrel as U.S. optimism rises , " says a headline in the Financial Times .
And many think the Hillary / McCain summer gas tax holiday concept may be implemented - which would encourage people to use more gasoline !
John �Hillary �good thinking .
Get people out on the road�using more fuel .
Great idea .
Even Thomas L. Friedman can see what vote - pandering imbeciles you are ( more below� ) .
Need we say more ?
But say more we will �because , on page 1 of the Financial Times is a photo of a mob in Africa �
What has stirred them to riot ?
The latest election result ?
Someone dissing their religion ?
No , high food prices !
It is the worst of times for people with big appetites and little money .
Many of them will go hungry .
And an empty belly is a dangerous thing .
First , people develop a " lean and hungry look . "
Then , they stab you in back .
Ah yes �predictably �inevitably �the world 's intellectuals , economists , yahoos , and pandering politicians are having trouble following the trail .
They ought to look down at their feet .
They would see the breadcrumbs �from the door of the Fed 's headquarters in New York �through the deep woods of subprime and leveraged derivatives �and right up the hill of soaring commodity and gold prices .
That 's right �the Fed is trying to keep the money and credit moving .
But it is going where it was n't supposed to go - into commodities , food , oil and gold .
Still , the experts can't see it .
Instead , they read the polls , watch the TV , and come to the wrong conclusion .
What is the cause of the rise in food prices , they ask ?
Speculators !
Another lead story today : " India targets food futures . "
India imagines that food prices are being driven up by greedy hedge fund managers .
It is considering a " blanket ban on food futures trading , " says the FT .
Why not ?
Nothing is too absurd or too counterproductive to escape the notice of the world improvers .
Just look at John McCain 's big idea - a " league of democracies . "
More about that coming up soon too �
For now , let 's stick with the financial news �
The big story seems to be the idea that , as our chief financial researcher in London , Theo Casey , put it : " doom and gloom has been overplayed . "
Since the drama of Bear Stearns , no other major financial firm has failed .
Quick action by the Fed and other central banks seems to have saved the world .
" Has the worst of the financial crisis passed ? " asked Le Monde yesterday .
" Yes , " said the world 's richest man over the weekend .
Warren Buffett told his shareholders that the " worst of the credit crisis on Wall Street is over . "
Maybe he 's right .
But let 's look at the numbers .
In 2006 , alone , nearly $ 7 trillion of new debt was issued worldwide .
Maybe double that amount in the entire five - year period - 2002 - 2007 .
So far , says Bloomberg , since the beginning of 2007 , less than $ 200 billion has been written off .
You can do the math yourself , but Fred Y.
Jones guesses that total losses so far probably do n't exceed 1 % of the debt sold in the last 5 years .
So far , so good , in other words .
This is the best of times .
The Fed has cut rates 7 times .
And it now takes on its balance sheet - as collateral for loans - the very credits that are likely to go bad �credit card debt , student debt , and even car loans .
It has only 200 basis points left , before it gets to zero , and there are approximately $ 10 trillion ( just guessing ) worth of credits that still could go bad .
If just 5 % of them went bust �the loss would be $ 500 billion .
Maybe the doom and gloom is underplayed .
Moving bad debt from the people who deserve it to the Bank of All the Americans - the Fed - does n't turn the bad credits into good ones .
It merely allows everyone to keep doing what they 've been doing �that is , to keep pretending that everything is all right .
But everything is n't all right .
Far from it .
And budding out in our brain is a little idea about why the situation can't be fixed �and why a major breakdown may be on its way �more to come�about how democracy and modern , state - guided capitalism really work .
Interestingly , Buffett is famously pro-America .
You bet against American business and you will go broke , he says .
But over the last 10 years , betting against American business was the best thing you could do .
The dollar sank �and foreign markets - particularly emerging markets - soared .
Buffett has n't missed the point .
He paid $ 4 billion for an Israel - based metalworking company in 2006 .
And now he 's coming to Europe to scout for opportunities .
He 'll no doubt want to stop by The Daily Reckoning headquarters in London for our advice .
Warren , look for the building with the golden balls .
We 're waiting for you .

" He must have hired a new ghost - writer because this is actually good , " writes colleague Byron King .
" On energy , Friedman is nailing it exactly . "
Thomas L. Friedman�writing in the New York Times : " �If you are going to use tax policy to shape energy strategy then you want to raise taxes on the things you want to discourage - gasoline consumption and gas - guzzling cars - and you want to lower taxes on the things you want to encourage - new , renewable energy technologies .
We are doing just the opposite .
" The McCain - Clinton gas holiday proposal is a perfect example of what energy expert Peter Schwartz of Global Business Network describes as the true American energy policy today : ' Maximize demand , minimize supply and buy the rest from the people who hate us the most . '
" This is not an energy policy .
This is money laundering : we borrow money from China and ship it to Saudi Arabia and take a little cut for ourselves as it goes through our gas tanks . "
*** Boris Johnson is the new mayor of London .
He 's also the former editor of the British magazine , The Spectator , for which we occasionally contribute an article .
Our old friend , Sue Easton , writing in Human Events has this to say about Boris : " He is somewhat of an odd duck .
Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson ( born in New York City in 1964 ) is the grandson of a liberal Turkish Muslim journalist who was welcomed into Britain as a political refugee during World War 1 .
Boris made his mark as the editor of the conservative magazine , The Spectator , and has been a regular guest on British telly .
Often portrayed as a buffoon by the media , Johnson was elected as the Member of Parliament for Henley .
The town is famous for its yuppie population , gentrified residents , their piles ( as aging mansions are known in England ) and for rowing races on the river that runs through it .
The Thames .
" When the prospect of becoming Mayor of London surfaced , by all accounts , Johnson decided on a course of self - discipline .
He found himself a stern group of advisers and put his Oxford education to work for him .
Of late , he 's taken to referring to his classical hero , Pericles , in campaign appearances .
Pericles had quite lofty ideals about civil life and responsibilities in ancient Greece . "
The nice thing about Boris Johnson is that he has a sense of humor .
Sue continues : " He says that if he does well , [ as mayor ] he might like to run for President of the United States someday .
He is ( technically )
Constitutionally eligible to do just that as he was born in New York City .
Of course , he'd have to reapply to renew his recently relinquished American citizenship . "
*** " I do n't think I 'm going to like it , " said Elizabeth yesterday .
She was referring to the next stage of her life - the empty nest stage .
It is the best of times and the worst of times at home too .
We have had children in the house for the last 25 years .
But , suddenly , the house may become strangely quiet .
Henry has heard from the colleges to which he applied and made his decision .
He might have stayed on with us in Paris and gone to medical school here ( where it would be free ! ) .
Instead , he 's going to the University of Virginia next year .
Meanwhile , after a year in London , our actress daughter , Maria , is headed for Hollywood .
We also have an older son in South America �and another daughter in London .
" Jules will be in Boston �Henry will be in Charlottesville .
Maria in California , " Elizabeth lamented .
" And now Edward is talking about going to boarding school .
If he goes , I 'll be an empty nester sooner than I planned .
I do n't know if I can stand it .
" Now I think of all those times I just wanted a little peace and quiet �I wished for some time to myself �some time when I did n't have to listen to children �did n't have to find their clothes or help them with their homework .
Now , I 'll have all the time I want �all the time to myself .
I 'll come home and there wo n't be any children waiting to ask me questions �or waiting for me to fix dinner .
I 'll be all by myself .
It sounds dreadfully lonely . "
" Do n't worry , " was our reply .
" Edward does n't really want to leave us .
He 's just trying out the idea to see how it sounds �and to see how we react to it .
If we seem to like the idea , he wo n't do it . "
" Yes , but I do n't like the idea .
I hate the idea . "
" Well , just try not to show it . "
Until tomorrow , Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning ---------------------
The Daily Reckoning PRESENTS : Managing currencies is as easy as understanding the principle of supply and demand , according to Nathan Lewis .
He also asserts that at some point in the not too distant future , people may begin to clamor for a solution to the world 's monetary problems .
Read on � THE KEY TO MANAGING CURRENCIES
by Nathan Lewis Managing currencies is simple if you understand the fundamental principle : supply and demand .
I told you it was simple .
The " supply " comes from the currency manager .
Today , that 's the central bank and Treasury Department or Ministry of Finance .
They produce base money , which is actually the only money in existence .
Base money is mostly coins and bills , and a little electronic bank reserves .
Every other sort of " money " is actually credit , not money .
The " demand " comes from everyone else , who is holding the currency , or , as is sometimes the case with the U.S. dollar today , choosing not to hold the currency .
I bring this up because , at some point in the not too distant future , people may begin to clamor for a solution to the world 's worsening monetary problems .
Perhaps , as inflation worsens , there will even be interest in a gold standard system .
At that point , there will have to be someone who can actually solve the monetary problems .
That person will have to understand the fundamental principle of currency management - supply and demand - because , if they do n't , their system will eventually collapse as well .
Probably sooner rather than later .
People have long believed that a currency " backed by gold " will remain stable , but there is no such guarantee .
If you take a mammoth amount of gold , and lock it in a vault , it does not emit magical energy waves that automatically manages the value of otherwise worthless paper currencies .
There are many methods of keeping a currency pegged to gold .
Some of them involve large hoards of gold , or even making coins of gold , and some do not .
However , all of them , if they are to be successful , have at their core the fundamental principle .
Which , as I mentioned , is supply and demand .
Indeed , if you understand this fundamental principle , you can peg a currency to gold even if there are no gold reserves at all .
Everyone knows that a central bank , or other currency manager , can " print money , " either electronically or physically .
It is not as well recognized that a currency manager can " unprint money , " or remove base money from circulation .
The currency manager does this by selling something , typically a government bond , and making the money received in payment disappear .
This happens nearly every day in the course of the Fed 's regular operations .
For example , the Fed has been rather vigorously lending money to banks .
The Fed " prints money " and lends it to the banks .
However , the overall supply of base money , according to the Fed 's statistics , has n't changed much .
This is because the Fed is " unprinting money " elsewhere to compensate for its direct lending .
Central banks do n't really control interest rates .
What they do is to print money and unprint money in a fashion that influences interest rates .
Or , a central bank could adopt a different operating mechanism .
During the early 1980s , the Fed printed money and unprinted money - in other words , altered the supply of money - in an effort to influence various credit statistics such as M1 or M2 .
A currency board system prints money and unprints money in an automatic fashion that keeps the currency pegged to another currency .
Typically , a currency board has a " reserve " of foreign currency , but this reserve is not necessary if supply is being properly managed .
If supply is not being properly managed , then the foreign exchange reserve is typically depleted in short order , and a crisis results .
A gold standard is essentially a currency board linked to gold .
Does n't it make more sense to peg to gold , the ultimate currency of mankind , rather than some government 's paper plaything ?
This used to be very obvious .
It seems that every gold standard advocate has their own special system , involving some idiosyncratic policy of reserve holdings or coin issuance .
They will work , if they are based on the fundamental principle .
If not , they would soon collapse .
My own idiosyncratic system is the gold standard that involves no gold at all .
There are no gold coins , and no government gold reserves .
Gold bullion is freely traded on the open market , just as it is today .
In my system , the currency manager ( governments today ) would adjust the supply of currency on a daily basis to maintain its value at the gold peg .
When the value is a little low , you unprint money .
When the value is a little high , you print money .
In effect , it is a currency board linked to gold .
The idea of a gold standard with no gold usually drives the traditional " gold bug " insane .
They are very attached to their piles of ingots and eagles .
I use it mainly as a teaching device .
When a person fully understands the fundamental principle - supply and demand - they say : " Yes , of course that would work . "
If they are still attached to the idea of locking gold in a vault , they think it 's ridiculous , because there 's no vault .
Because many gold standard advocates do not understand the fundamental principle , they fall back on another , more primitive principle , which is to use gold coins exclusively .
This system is best suited for a more primitive world .
Yes , gold or silver coins are better than a wheelbarrow of paper money when you 're trying to buy bread in a hyperinflation .
But consider : Warren Buffett just took part in a buyout by Mars Inc. of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. for $ 23 billion .
What if they had to make payment in gold ?
Would they put $ 23 billion of bullion in an armored car ?
In the ninth century , this is how businessmen in China made large commercial transactions .
The process of loading ships and wagons with silver coins was so cumbersome that they invented paper money , pegged to silver .
In 1910 , the gold standard centered on the British pound and the Bank of England encompassed the world .
At the time , the Bank of England held only 7.2 million ounces of gold .
This was only 4 % of all the gold held by governments and central banks in 1910 , and only about 1.2 % of all the gold in the world .
The Bank of England did n't have much gold , because they did n't need it .
They understood the principle of supply and demand .
When the U.S. left the gold standard in 1971 , the government held 291 million ounces of gold .
This had been depleted from 630 million ounces in 1942 .
Unfortunately , the Fed did not understand the principle of supply and demand .
They were printing money aggressively to pump up the economy , with the result that everyone ( especially the Bank of England and the Bank of France ) wanted to dump the excess paper back on the Fed and get the gold in return .
The system failed , even though the U.S. held forty times more gold than the Bank of England did in 1910 .
In a fairly short time , as central bankers ' embarrassment becomes total , people may again search for someone who can manage a currency like the Bank of England did in 1910 .
Prepare now , or we will have to bear further decades of monetary chaos and ignorance , instead of the Golden Age we deserve .

for The Daily Reckoning Editor 's Note :
You can also look to currencies to protect your portfolio from the falling U.S. dollar .
Our friends at EverBank offer a way to do that - with their World Currency Access Deposit Account .
Like FDIC protection against bank insolvency , access to your funds and the potential for capital appreciation - if the selected foreign currency increases against the U.S. dollar .
Attractive to many - given the fall of the dollar - loss of principal can occur if the selected currency loses value versus the dollar .

Potent as a marketing trend , humanization has long been scorned as scientific practice by researchers working in the behaviorist tradition of B. F. Skinner .
In “ Inside the Animal Mind , ” George Page summarizes the reasons : “ Since we can not get inside the animal ’s mind . . . and since the animal cannot report what ’s going on  not in a ‘ language ’ we can readily understand  all we have left are guesses and speculation fatally tainted by anthropomorphism . ”
Strict behaviorists focus instead on observable stimulus - response conditioning : for example , a puppy learning to sit to receive a treat .
Actions that cannot be explained this way are usually attributed to blind instinct .
As such , hard - core Skinnerian philosophy amounts to a perversion of cogito ergo sum : I ca n’t prove that animals think , therefore they do n’t .
In dealing with problem pets , veterinarians with a behaviorist bent do n’t concern themselves so much with what might be happening inside the brain of the animal or try to correct neurochemical imbalances with drugs .
Instead , a compulsive or anxious animal is seen as one that just needs to be better - trained .

The debate about animal minds is at least as old as Aristotle , who posited that men alone possess reason .
The 17th - century French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche wrote that animals “ desire nothing , fear nothing , know nothing , ” while Voltaire asked , “ Answer me , mechanist , has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel ? ”
Darwin ’s view was , Of course not .
In “ The Descent of Man ” he wrote , “ We have seen that the senses and intuitions , the various emotions and faculties . . . of which man boasts , may be found in an incipient , or even sometimes in a well - developed condition , in the lower animals . ”
The staggering assertion of Darwin ’s theory is that evolutionary continuity applies not just to bodies but to brains .
“ The difference in mind between man and the higher animals , great as it is , certainly is one of degree and not of kind , ” he wrote .
For much of the 20th century scientists willfully dismissed this line of thinking , which has been rekindled only in the past three decades with the rise of a field known as cognitive ethology .
The guiding belief is that while it is scientifically baseless to assume that animals think and feel just as we do , it is equally foolhardy to assume that they do n’t think and feel at all .
In laboratory experiments and field observations , practitioners have presented evidence of analogical reasoning by apes , counting by rats and the capacity of pigeons to distinguish the paintings of Picasso from those of Monet .
Researchers have demonstrated that animals can grasp basic abstractions like “ same ” and “ different ” and use mental flexibility to solve novel problems in the laboratory for which hard - wired instinct could n’t have prepared them .
It is impressive but perhaps unsurprising that a parrot was taught to categorize colors or that dolphins learned the syntactic distinction between “ take the surfboard to the Frisbee ” and “ take the Frisbee to the surfboard ”  we already tend to think of these animals as being smart .
More eye - opening are glimmers of cognition from way down the phylogenetic chain .
Research has shown that bumblebees can remember which flowers they have already visited and that two - inch - long cockroaches from Madagascar can tell the difference between a familiar person and a stranger .
( If the bug hisses loudly at you , it ’s time to introduce yourself . )
Cognitive ethologists have had more difficulty gathering evidence for animal emotion .
To any pet owner who has stroked a purring cat or watched a dog cavort when his chow hits the bowl , it seems intuitively obvious that animals experience feelings .
But intuition is n’t hard science  it ’s just more humanization .
Enter behavioral pharmacology , which has provided a tantalizing new window into the animal mind .
Dr. Nicholas Dodman , who pioneered the field and founded the Tufts University Animal Behavior Clinic , says that skeptics of the premise that animals have emotional states used to ask him how he could say that a pacing , hyperventilating dog was actually feeling anxious .
“ Well , how about this ? ” Dodman would reply .
“ We ’ll give him an antianxiety drug and see what happens . ”
THE GROUNDS OF THE CUMMINGS School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts sprawl over 640 acres of rolling greenery in central Massachusetts .
When I arrived to visit in March , one of the first things Dodman told me was that the campus used to be the site of a state mental hospital .
Like other facilities , it had been shuttered in the 1960s following the revolutionary discovery of drugs that treated schizophrenia and other disorders so effectively that many patients no longer required institutionalization .
“ Ironically , this paved the way for our school , our behavior program , and novel pharmacological treatments for animal behavior problems , ” Dodman said .
Or , as he later said , “ we traded one group of inmates for another . ”
Dodman , an Englishman , began his career in the early 1970s as a roving country vet in the tradition of James Herriot ; he went on to write a popular series of advice books for pet owners , the latest of which is “ The Well - Adjusted Dog . ”
In 1981 he moved to the United States to become a professor of anesthesia at Cummings .
Drugs interested him greatly but comatose patients , increasingly , did not , and he began to wonder : Could medications transform veterinary behavioral medicine just as radically as they had human psychiatric care ?
He says he quickly realized that the field was “ completely wide open , like virgin snow . ”
At a veterinary conference in the late 1980s , he presented his vision of the psychoactive frontier and “ saw jaws drop around the room .
It was like , ‘ Who is this strange masked man ? ’ ” Three decades later , “ it ’s almost mainstream for behaviorists to know something about pharmacology , ” Dodman says .

It 's been a long road , and I can assure you that 3.0 will be nothing like anything you 've ever played before .
We 'll be releasing manuals and information as release gets closer and closer , but I think everyone on the beta team will agree when I say the game is a blast .
We 'll be releasing 3.0 with our whole new gameplay , two full space scenarios ( es_aethra and es_nebular , both balanced to death ) , a total of 8 totally different ship classes , completely rebalanced weapons .
ES brings teamplay to a whole new level .
In fact here is a quote from one of our beta testers :
" I realized today that I have never , ever looked at my personal score in this version of ES .
Do you know what this means ?
Eternal Silence has reached the holy grail of online team - based gaming .
I think the reason for this is that the game makes teamwork very tactile , so I become absorbed in my team 's objectives . "
As a bonus , here are a couple of renders of two new turret models we added to the game just recently .
Both are modelled by Tweek and skinned by Safemilk , and I have to say they did a swell job .
These turrets will shoot at you from corvettes and capital ships .
Expect more news very soon .
We 're on the home stretch , it wo n't be long now !

Miley Cyrus & John Travolta to Sing Duet ... Say What ?
Miley Cyrus and John Travolta will be teaming up on Disney 's " Bolt Movie 3D " .
According to actress Kelly Preston , who is married to Travolta , the two may end up singing together in the animated movie .
The project is scheduled to hit theaters on Thanksgiving Day , November 26 , 2008 .
A TV star dog drinks martinis with starlets and showboats on sets until he is suddenly abandoned in his trailer in the Nevada desert where he meets up with a radioactive rabbit and a one - eyed cat who are trying to find new homes .
The film received a PG rating for mild crude humor .
Preston provided the duet tidbit at the Step Up Women 's Network 's Inspiration Awards luncheon at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Sunday .
She had high praise for Miley , calling her a sweetheart .
When asked about her recent Vanity Fair photos , Kelly had this to say :
All I know is that we know her personally and she ’s a really good girl with a great head on her shoulders . "
Miley was also busy over the weekend performing at Wango Tango Fest .
The event , put on by KIIS - FM 102.7 was hosted by Lindsay Lohan at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine , California on Saturday , May 10th .
Miley gave a hint that she is still trying to smooth over the Vanity Fair photo debacle when she made the following remark to her fans in the audience :
We 're all changing and thank you for helping me while I go through that . "
We 've got some great photos of the teenage phenom in action .

Indeed , 3 of the 4 suspects the FBI is investigating are employees of Fort Detrick , which is run by the Army .
This new information verifies that
" Fort Detrick is run by the United States Army .
It 's the most secure biological warfare research center in the United States , " a bioterrorism expert told FOX News . "

Some people are pretending that someone unconnected with the army bioweapons facility at Fort Detrick stole the anthrax .
However , as the above - quoted article states :
It is not very likely that someone could steal anthrax from the most secure facility in the U.S. , run by the Army .

More importantly ,
An older version of this page has been translated into Romanian .
On this page I give a quick overview of events browser compatibility .
This research is exclusively about when the events fire , and on which elements you can add event listeners .
The spec is relatively clear about the latter , but frequently vague about the former .
Thus it seems you ’re currently reading the definitive treatise on event firing .
I assume that you know the three event registration models ( traditional , W3C and Microsoft ) as well as event bubbling and capturing .
See also the mobile table .
This table contains all events in the Level 3 Events Specification , with the following exceptions :
In addition the table treats several events that are not in the spec but have been supported forever .

The spec is the thingy you should follow .
So follow it !
( Yes , I know I ’m shouting , but I ’ve been saying this since 2003 and nobody has ever paid my message the least attention ... well , Opera has done something , but it took fucking eight years . )
Mouseover and mouseout also fire when the user mouses over or out of a child element of the element you registered the events on .
Mouseenter and mouseleave do n’t .
Thus , they are the true equivalent of CSS : hover .
Once these events are supported by all browsers , creating dropdown menus will become a walk in the park .
It ’s the non-conforming browsers ’ fault that we still have to waste hours and hours on carefully distinguishing between important and unimportant mouseover and mouseout events .

はじめに
Nagiosで遠隔地にあるサーバの内部リソース を監視する方法として、NRPE( Nagios Remote Plugin Executer ) とNSCA ( Nagios Service Check Acceptor ) がある。NRPEはNagios監視サーバから遠隔サーバに対してリクエストを投げ
、遠隔サーバでのプラグインの実行結果を取得するのに対し、NSCAでは、遠隔サーバ側から送られてくるプラグインの実行結果を受け取り
、状態を取得する。NCSAはもともとは分散監視用に提供されている機能であり、遠隔サーバからチェック結果の通知が来なくなった場合のエラー判定をどうするのかといった問題がある
ため、遠隔サーバの監視にはNRPEを使った方が設定が楽だが、遠隔サーバとの間にファイアウォールがあって遠隔サーバへのアクセスが制限されていてNRPEが使えない場合に、その制限を回避するために使うことが出来る。
ここでは 、NSCAを使って遠隔サーバの内部リソースの状態を監視するための方法を説明する。以下の説明では、次の2台のサーバを例として扱う。
監視サーバ( monitor ) Nagiosが起動しているサーバ 遠隔サー バ( remote ) 監視対象となるサー バ
また、以下の記述で はFreeBSDとPortsシステムを使うことを前提としているので、ファイルのパス等は自分で利用するOS等にあわせて読み替えて欲しい。
遠隔サーバでの設 定
遠隔サーバには 、NagiosとNSCAクライアント(send_nsca)を最低限インストールする必要がある。FreeBSDの場合net-mgmt/nagios , net-mgmt/nagios-* , およびnet-mgmt/nsca-clientというPortsがあるので、それを利用するとよい。
内部リソースの監視のために、まずは遠隔サーバのNagiosで通常の監視と同じ設定を行う。その際、CGIインターフェイスについては監視サーバのものを利用するので設定は不要。通常の監視と同じなので、具体的な設定方法については省略する。
監視に必要な設 定
▼ Nagiosの設定
監視の設定が完了したら、/usr/local/etc/nagios/nagios.cfgを編集し、次の設定を確認(修正)する。
enable_notifications=0 メールによる通知を無効にする。通知は監視サーバ側で行うので、遠隔サーバでの通知は不要となる。 obsess_over_services=1 各サービスのチェックが終わった直後にocsp_commandオプションで指定されたコマンドを実行するための設定。 ocsp_command=submit_check_result 各サービスのチェックが終わった直後に実行するコマンド名。
▼ NSCAの設定
/usr/local/etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfgを編集し、NSCAの設定を行う。
password= [ パスワード ] encryption_method=3
passwordには、NSCAを使って通信する際のパスワードを入れる。人が覚える必要はないパスワードなので、長くてランダムな文字列を生成して入れるようにする。encryption_methodは通信で使う暗号化手法で、'3'はTriple DESになる。サンプル設定ファイルに数字と暗号化手法の対応があるので、適当に選んで設定すること。これらの設定は監視サーバのNSCAと同じにする必要がある。
ファイルの編集が終わったら、send_nsca.cfgの属性を変更する。パスワードや暗号化手法といった重要な情報が記載されているので、不必要なアカウントからは見えないようにする。
# chown nagios : nagios /usr / local/etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfg # chmod 440 /usr/local/etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfg
コマンド定義の記 述
次に、ocsp_commandで指定したコマンドsubmit_check_result
を/usr/local/etc/nagios/commands.cfg
の中で定義する。以下の設定をそのまま使えばよい。
# for nsca client define command { command_name submit_check_result command_line /usr/ local/ libexec/nagios/submit_check_result $ HOSTNAME $ '$ SERVICEDESC $ ' $ SERVICESTATEID $ '$ SERVICEOUTPUT $ ' }
コマンドファイルの作成
さらに、command_lineで指定した/usr/local/libexec/nagios/submit_check_resultを作成する。central_serverに監視サーバのホスト名を入れれば、そのまま使える。
#!/bin/sh central_server=" monitor " # Arguments : # $ 1 = host_name ( Short name of host that the service is # associated with ) # $ 2 = svc_description ( Description of the service ) # $ 3 = state_string ( A string representing the status of # the given service - " OK " , " WARNING " , " CRITICAL " # or " UNKNOWN " ) # $ 4 = plugin_output ( A text string that should be used # as the plugin output for the service checks ) # # Convert the state string to the corresponding return code return_code= - 1 case " $ 3 " in OK ) return_code=0 ;; WARNING ) return_code=1 ;; CRITICAL ) return_code=2 ;; UNKNOWN ) return_code= - 1 ; ; [ 0 - 2 ] ) return_code=$3 ;; esac # pipe the service check info into the send_nsca program , which # in turn transmits the data to the nsca daemon on the central # monitoring server /usr / bin / printf " %s\t%s\t%s\t%s
" " $ 1 " " $ 2 " " $ return_code " " $ 4 " | /usr/local/sbin/send_nsca $ central_server -c /usr/local/etc/nagios/send_nsca.cfg
Nagios不要 ? このsubmit_check_resultを使って % submit_check_result remote ' sample service ' 0 ' OK - sample service ' のようにコマンドを直接実行すれ
ばNagiosいらないんじゃね？と思ったあなた。正解です。ただし、そうした監視体制を整えるにはcronによる定期的なチェックなどの設定が必要になりますので、個人的にはNagiosのプラグインを書いてしまう方法をおすすめします。
ファイルを作成したら、属性を正しく設定する。誰でも実行可能にすると、遠隔サーバのローカルユーザから監視サーバにいたずらできてしまうので、遠隔サーバ上でNagiosを起動するユーザ(nagios)の所有とし、othersへの実行許可ビットは落とすこと。
# chown nagios : nagios /usr/ local / libexec/nagios/submit_check_result # chmod 750 /usr/local/libexec/nagios/submit_check_result
以上で遠隔サーバでの設定は完了となる。
監視サーバでの設 定
監視サーバには 、Nagios とNSCAサーバ( nsca)をインストールする必要がある。FreeBSDの場合net-mgmt/nagios , net-mgmt/nagios-* , およびnet-mgmt/nscaというPortsがあるので、それを利用するとよい。
監視に必要な設 定
▼ Nagiosの設定
/usr/local/etc/nagios/nagios.cfgを編集し、次の設定を確認(修正)する。
enable_notifications=1 メールによる通知を有効にする。異常が発見された場合の通知は全て監視サーバで行う。 execute_service_checks=<0/1>
もし監視サーバ側でNSCAによる受動的な監視以外の監視活動を行う場合は1、全ての監視結果をNSCA経由で受け取る場合は0にする。 check_external_commands=1 外部コマンドのチェックを有効にする。NagiosとNSCAは外部コマンドを通じて状態を取得する。
command_file=/var/run/nsca/spool/nagios.cmd 外部コマンドのパス。後述するnsca.cfg の" nsca_chroot + command_file " と一致する値にする 。
▼ NSCAの設定
NSCAは設定によりchrootした環境下で動かすことが可能になるので、ここではその機能を利用した設定を説明する。さらにFreeBSDのPortsバージョンでは、標準でTCP wrapperによるアクセス制限もできるので、これも後ほど設定する。
/usr/local/etc/nagios/nsca.cfgを編集し、NSCAの設定を行う。
nsca_chroot=/var/run/nsca command_file=/spool/nagios.cmd alternate_dump_file=/spool/nsca.dump password=[パスワード ] encryption_method=3
nsca_chroot=/var/run/nsca NSCAデーモンが起動時にchrootするディレクトリ。 command_file=/spool/nagios.cmd Nagiosのコマンドファイルのパス。実際のファイルのパスはnsca_chrootからの相対パスになる。 alternate_dump_file=/spool/nsca.dump
コマンドファイルが見つからない場合の監視データの保存先。 password=[パスワード ]
NSCA 通信用パスワード。遠隔サーバとあわせる。 encryption_method=3 NSCA通信暗号化手法。遠隔サーバとあわせる。
設定ファイルの編集が終わったら、遠隔サーバと同様にファイルの属性を修正する。
# chown nagios : nagios /usr / local/etc/nagios/nsca.cfg # chmod 400 /usr/local/etc/nagios/nsca.cfg
NSCA のchroot環境の準備
NSCAデーモンがchrootして実行される環境を準備する。
# mkdir -p /var / run/nsca/spool # chown -R nagios : nagios / var / run/nsca # mkdir /var/run/nsca/etc
/var/run/nsca/etc/hosts.allowを作成し、ホストベースでのアクセス制限を設定する。
nsca : remote : allow nsca : ALL : deny ALL : ALL : deny
1行目が遠隔サーバからのアクセス許可。" remote " の部分をアクセス許可したいホストやネットワークの記述に書き換える。2行目でそれ以外の前ホストからのアクセスを拒否。3行目はその他の全てのサービスについて、全ホストからのアクセスを拒否。このファイルはNSCA以外のサービスでは利用されないので、本来は不要。
サービス定義の記 述
監視サーバで遠隔サーバから受け取った結果を監視するには、監視サーバ側でもサービスの定義を記述する必要がある。
まず、サービスの定義が最低限ですむように雛形となるサービスの定義を記述する。
define service{ name generic - passive use generic - service active_checks_enabled 0 check_freshness 1 freshness_threshold 600 check_command service - is - stale register 0 }
active_checks_enabled 0 このサービスではアクティブチェックを無効にする。つまり、check_commandによるチェックは行わない。 check_freshness 1 鮮度チェック。一定時間遠隔サーバからの情報更新が無かった場合に警告が出るようにする。 freshness_threshold 600 鮮度チェックのしきい値(秒)
。10分間遠隔サーバから通知が無かったら期限切れとして、check_commandを実行する。 check_command service - is- stale 期限切れになった場合にのみservice-is-staleコマンドを実行する。
この定義の記述にある鮮度チェック関連の設定により、遠隔サーバからの通知が来なくなった場合の問題はある程度解決する。
次に、実際に監視するサービスの定義を記述する。
define service{ use generic - passive host_name remote service_description Current Load }
host_name , service_descriptionの名前は遠隔サーバ上での定義とあわせる必要がある。
コマンドの定 義
service - is- staleコマンドの定義を記述する。
define command{ command_name service - is - stale command_line $ USER1$/ check_dummy 2 ' CRITICAL : Service results are stale !' }
動作確認
設定が全て終わったら動作確認を行う。
デバッグの準 備
NSCA のデバッグ設定 /usr/ local/etc/nagios/nsca.cfgを編集して「debug=1」に変更する。通知内容が記録されたり、ログが肥大化したりするので、テストが終わったら必ず0に戻す。
/etc/syslog.confの設定
NSCAのログが/var/log/nsca.logに記録されるよう、/etc/syslog.confを修正
!nsca *.* /var/log/nsca.log
syslogdで再読み込み
# touch /var/log/nsca.log # /etc/rc.d/syslogd reload
/etc/rc.confを編集してNSCAを有効化
nsca_enable = " YES "
Nagios ( 再 ) 起動 Nagiosが起動時にコマンドファイルを生成するので、必ず先に(再)起動する。
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nagios ( re ) start
NSCA 起動
# /usr / local/etc/rc.d/nsca start
NSCAの通信テスト
遠隔サーバでsubmit_check_resultコマンドを実行してテスト
# /usr/local/libexec/nagios/submit_check_result remote ' service name ' 0 ' OK test ' 1 data packet ( s ) sent to host successfully .
監視サーバ側のログをチェック
Jan 1 00:00:00 monitor nsca[ xxxxx ] : Connection from < remote IP > port ##### Jan 1 00:00:00 monitor nsca[ xxxxx ] : Handling the connection ... Jan 1 00:00:00 monitor nsca[ xxxxx ] : SERVICE CHECK -> Host Name : ' remote ' , Service Description : ' service name ' , Return Code : ' 0 ' , Output : ' OK test ' Jan 1 00:00:00 monitor nsca[ xxxxx ] : End of connection ...
Nagiosによる監視テスト
監視サーバと遠隔サーバ でNagios , NSCA を再起動し、監視サーバに正しく表示されれば完了。下のサンプル画像では遠隔サーバのロードアベレージ、ディスク使用量、RAIDディスクの状態などを監視しており、サービス名の右にある「PASV」というアイコンがNSCAによるパッシブチェックであることを示している。

Why They Kill Their Newborns
By Steven Pinker
Killing your baby .
what could be more depraved ?
For a woman to destroy the fruit of her womb would seem like an ultimate violation of the natural order .
But every year , hundreds of women commit neonaticide : they kill their newborns or let them die .
Most neonaticides remain undiscovered , but every once in a while a janitor follows a trail of blood to a tiny body in a trash bin , or a woman faints and doctors find the remains of a placenta inside her .
Two cases have recently riveted the American public .
Last November , Amy Grossberg and Brian Peterson , 18 - year - old college sweethearts , delivered their baby in a motel room and , according to prosecutors , killed him and left his body in a Dumpster .
They will go on trial for murder next year and , if convicted , could be sentenced to death .
In June , another 18 - year - old , Melissa Drexler , arrived at her high - school prom , locked herself in a bathroom stall , gave birth to a boy and left him dead in a garbage can .
Everyone knows what happened next : she touched herself up and returned to the dance floor .
In September , a grand jury indicted her for murder .
How could they do it ?
Nothing melts the heart like a helpless baby .
Even a biologist 's cold calculations tell us that nurturing an offspring that carries our genes is the whole point of our existence .
Neonaticide , many think , could be only a product of pathology .
The psychiatrists uncover childhood trauma .
The defense lawyers argue temporary psychosis .
The pundits blame a throwaway society , permissive sex education and , of course , rock lyrics .
But it 's hard to maintain that neonaticide is an illness when we learn that it has been practiced and accepted in most cultures throughout history .
And that neonaticidal women do not commonly show signs of psychopathology .
In a classic 1970 study of statistics of child killing , a psychiatrist , Phillip Resnick , found that mothers who kill their older children are frequently psychotic , depressed or suicidal , but mothers who kill their newborns are usually not .
( It was this difference that led Resnick to argue that the category infanticide be split into neonaticide , the killing of a baby on the day of its birth , and filicide , the killing of a child older than one day . )
Killing a baby is an immoral act , and we often express our outrage at the immoral by calling it a sickness .
But normal human motives are not always moral , and neonaticide does not have to be a product of malfunctioning neural circuitry or a dysfunctional upbringing .
We can try to understand what would lead a mother to kill her newborn , remembering that to understand is not necessarily to forgive .
Martin Daly and Margo Wilson , both psychologists , argue that a capacity for neonaticide is built into the biological design of our parental emotions .
Mammals are extreme among animals in the amount of time , energy and food they invest in their young , and humans are extreme among mammals .
Parental investment is a limited resource , and mammalian mothers must '' decide ' ' whether to allot it to their newborn or to their current and future offspring .
If a newborn is sickly , or if its survival is not promising , they may cut their losses and favor the healthiest in the litter or try again later on .
In most cultures , neonaticide is a form of this triage .
Until very recently in human evolutionary history , mothers nursed their children for two to four years before becoming fertile again .
Many children died , especially in the perilous first year .
Most women saw no more than two or three of their children survive to adulthood , and many did not see any survive .
To become a grandmother , a woman had to make hard choices .
In most societies documented by anthropologists , including those of hunter - gatherers ( our best glimpse into our ancestors ' way of life ) , a woman lets a newborn die when its prospects for survival to adulthood are poor .
The forecast might be based on abnormal signs in the infant , or on bad circumstances for successful motherhood at the time -- she might be burdened with older children , beset by war or famine or without a husband or social support .
Moreover , she might be young enough to try again .
We are all descendants of women who made the difficult decisions that allowed them to become grandmothers in that unforgiving world , and we inherited that brain circuitry that led to those decisions .
Daly and Wilson have shown that the statistics on neonaticide in contemporary North America parallel those in the anthropological literature .
The women who sacrifice their offspring tend to be young , poor , unmarried and socially isolated .
Natural selection cannot push the buttons of behavior directly ; it affects our behavior by endowing us with emotions that coax us toward adaptive choices .
New mothers have always faced a choice between a definite tragedy now and the possibility of an even greater tragedy months or years later , and that choice is not to be taken lightly .
Even today , the typical rumination of a depressed new mother -- how will I cope with this burden ? -- is a legitimate concern .
The emotional response called bonding is also far more complex than the popular view , in which a woman is imprinted with a lifelong attachment to her baby if they interact in a critical period immediately following the baby 's birth .
A new mother will first coolly assess the infant and her current situation and only in the next few days begin to see it as a unique and wonderful individual .
Her love will gradually deepen in ensuing years , in a trajectory that tracks the increasing biological value of a child ( the chance that it will live to produce grandchildren ) as the child proceeds through the mine field of early development .
Even when a mother in a hunter - gatherer society hardens her heart to sacrifice a newborn , her heart has not turned to stone .
Anthropologists who interview these women ( or their relatives , since the event is often too painful for the woman to discuss ) discover that the women see the death as an unavoidable tragedy , grieve at the time and remember the child with pain all their lives .
Even the supposedly callous Melissa Drexler agonized over a name for her dead son and wept at his funeral .
( Initial reports that , after giving birth , she requested a Metallica song from the deejay and danced with her boyfriend turned out to be false . )
Many cultural practices are designed to distance people 's emotions from a newborn until its survival seems probable .
Full personhood is often not automatically granted at birth , as we see in our rituals of christening and the Jewish bris .
And yet the recent neonaticides still seem puzzling .
These are middle - class girls whose babies would have been kept far from starvation by the girls ' parents or by any of thousands of eager adoptive couples .
But our emotions , fashioned by the slow hand of natural selection , respond to the signals of the long - vanished tribal environment in which we spent 99 percent of our evolutionary history .
Being young and single are two bad omens for successful motherhood , and the girl who conceals her pregnancy and procrastinates over its consequences will soon be disquieted by a third omen .
She will give birth in circumstances that are particularly unpromising for a human mother : alone .
In hunter - gatherer societies , births are virtually always assisted because human anatomy makes birth ( especially the first one ) long , difficult and risky .
Older women act as midwives , emotional supports and experienced appraisers who help decide whether the infant should live .
Wenda Trevathan , an anthropologist and trained midwife , has studied pelvises of human fossils and concluded that childbirth has been physically tortuous , and therefore probably assisted , for millions of years .
Maternal feelings may be adapted to a world in which a promising newborn is heralded with waves of cooing and clucking and congratulating .
Those reassuring signals are absent from a secret birth in a motel room or a bathroom stall .
So what is the mental state of a teen - age mother who has kept her pregnancy secret ?
She is immature enough to have hoped that her pregnancy would go away by itself , her maternal feelings have been set at zero and she suddenly realizes she is in big trouble .
Sometimes she continues to procrastinate .
In September , 17 - year - old Shanta Clark gave birth to a premature boy and kept him hidden in her bedroom closet , as if he were E.T. , for 17 days .
She fed him before and after she went to school until her mother discovered him .
The weak cry of the preemie kept him from being discovered earlier .
( In other cases , girls have panicked over the crying and , in stifling the cry , killed the baby . )
Most observers sense the desperation that drives a woman to neonaticide .
Prosecutors sometimes do n't prosecute ; juries rarely convict ; those found guilty almost never go to jail .
Barbara Kirwin , a forensic psychologist , reports that in nearly 300 cases of women charged with neonaticide in the United States and Britain , no woman spent more than a night in jail .
In Europe , the laws of several countries prescribed less - severe penalties for neonaticide than for adult homicides .
The fascination with the Grossberg - Peterson case comes from the unusual threat of the death penalty .
Even those in favor of capital punishment might shudder at the thought of two reportedly nice kids being strapped to gurneys and put to death .
But our compassion hinges on the child , not just on the mother .
Killers of older children , no matter how desperate , evoke little mercy .
Susan Smith , the South Carolina woman who sent her two sons , 14 months and 3 years old , to watery deaths , is in jail , unmourned , serving a life sentence .
The leniency shown to neonaticidal mothers forces us to think the unthinkable and ask if we , like many societies and like the mothers themselves , are not completely sure whether a neonate is a full person .
It seems obvious that we need a clear boundary to confer personhood on a human being and grant it a right to life .
Otherwise , we approach a slippery slope that ends in the disposal of inconvenient people or in grotesque deliberations on the value of individual lives .
But the endless abortion debate shows how hard it is to locate the boundary .
Anti-abortionists draw the line at conception , but that implies we should shed tears every time an invisible conceptus fails to implant in the uterus -- and , to carry the argument to its logical conclusion , that we should prosecute for murder anyone who uses an IUD .
Those in favor of abortion draw the line at viability , but viability is a fuzzy gradient that depends on how great a risk of an impaired child the parents are willing to tolerate .
The only thing both sides agree on is that the line must be drawn at some point before birth .
Neonaticide forces us to examine even that boundary .
To a biologist , birth is as arbitrary a milestone as any other .
Many mammals bear offspring that see and walk as soon as they hit the ground .
But the incomplete 9 - month - old human fetus must be evicted from the womb before its outsize head gets too big to fit through its mother 's pelvis .
The usual primate assembly process spills into the first years in the world .
And that complicates our definition of personhood .
What makes a living being a person with a right not to be killed ?
Animal - rights extremists would seem to have the easiest argument to make : that all sentient beings have a right to life .
But champions of that argument must conclude that delousing a child is akin to mass murder ; the rest of us must look for an argument that draws a smaller circle .
Perhaps only the members of our own species , Homo sapiens , have a right to life ?
But that is simply chauvinism ; a person of one race could just as easily say that people of another race have no right to life .
No , the right to life must come , the moral philosophers say , from morally significant traits that we humans happen to possess .
One such trait is having a unique sequence of experiences that defines us as individuals and connects us to other people .
Other traits include an ability to reflect upon ourselves as a continuous locus of consciousness , to form and savor plans for the future , to dread death and to express the choice not to die .
And there 's the rub : our immature neonates do n't possess these traits any more than mice do .
Several moral philosophers have concluded that neonates are not persons , and thus neonaticide should not be classified as murder .
Michael Tooley has gone so far as to say that neonaticide ought to be permitted during an interval after birth .
Most philosophers ( to say nothing of nonphilosophers ) recoil from that last step , but the very fact that there can be a debate about the personhood of neonates , but no debate about the personhood of older children , makes it clearer why we feel more sympathy for an Amy Grossberg than for a Susan Smith .
So how do you provide grounds for outlawing neonaticide ?
The facts do n't make it easy .
Some philosophers suggest that people intuitively see neonates as so similar to older babies that you could n't allow neonaticide without coarsening the way people treat children and other people in general .
Again , the facts say otherwise .
Studies in both modern and hunter - gatherer societies have found that neonaticidal women do n't kill anyone but their newborns , and when they give birth later under better conditions , they can be devoted , loving mothers .
The laws of biology were not kind to Amy Grossberg and Melissa Drexler , and they are not kind to us as we struggle to make moral sense of the teen - agers ' actions .
One predicament is that our moral system needs a crisp inauguration of personhood , but the assembly process for Homo sapiens is gradual , piecemeal and uncertain .
Another problem is that the emotional circuitry of mothers has evolved to cope with this uncertain process , so the baby killers turn out to be not moral monsters but nice , normal ( and sometimes religious ) young women .
These are dilemmas we will probably never resolve , and any policy will leave us with uncomfortable cases .
We will most likely muddle through , keeping birth as a conspicuous legal boundary but showing mercy to the anguished girls who feel they had no choice but to run afoul of it .
Yes , There Will Be Armageddon : Government Goes Bankrupt ( July 24 , 2008 )
One financial Armageddon is entirely , easily predictable : the bankruptcy of government in the U.S.A. , at every level : Federal , State , County and City .
The prediction follows from very simple mathematics : entitlements which grow at 8 % a year cannot be supported by an economy which grows at 3 % or less .
This simple truth is already playing out .
San Diego is just one example .
Here is a report which lays out the basis of San Diego 's impending bankruptcy : structural deficits .
The same can be said of California , which managed to increase state spending by 44 % over the past few years even as the economy which must support those expenditures grew a total of less than half that rate .
This will sober you up , folks : CITY ATTORNEY ANALYSIS : CITY OF SAN DIEGO STRUCTURAL BUDGET DEFICIT
These benefits consisted of three rounds of retroactive benefits without funding which cost taxpayers $ 451 million .
In addition , pension officials gave away 8,000 years of pension credits to city employees for free , at a cost to taxpayers of $ 146 million .
Another major unfunded benefit was the Deferred Retirement Option Plan ( " DROP " ) .
It was supposed to be operated on a cost neutral basis .
However , the Citys outside actuary put the cost to taxpayers at more than $ 200 million .
Facing a billion dollar and growing pension deficit , City officials have traded away road repair , water security , and fire prevention to pay employees more to retire than to work .
The IBA described the problem as a structural deficit .
The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) described the problem similarly : the " City would have difficulty funding its future annual pension contributions unless it obtained new revenues , reduced pension benefits , or reduced City services . "
Year after year , the City has opted to cut services .
It has not raised revenues nor has it cut employee benefits .
Pension officials , with the blessing of high level City officials , have continued to issue rosy predictions .
The IBA Report has brought a much needed dose of reality to the situation .
In the report the IBA notes that since 2003 the City has had to annually implement budget reductions ( cut departmental budgets ) which translate into reductions in city services .
The City is caught in a structural deficit trap .
Total contributions from the City and City employees to the pension increased from $ 81 million in 2000 to $ 236 million in 2007 .
Total contributions during this period were $ 1.42 billion .
But over the same period $ 1.7 billion or $ 300 million more than contributions , poured out of the pension in benefits and costs .
These costs and benefits increased from $ 127 million in 2000 to $ 315 million in 2007 .
On - going pension expenditures consistently exceed on - going pension contributions .
Astute reader R. provides additional insight on public pensions : I read the latest article .
Are You Part of an Elite , and Don't Know It ? ( July 22 , 2008 ) .
A friend told me the other day that a fireman is getting $ 10,000 a month in a pension .
I hear this all the time .
Another friend says her 92 year old uncle gets $ 8,500 a month from being a fireman and he retired 45 years ago .
What people do not realize is this .
At today 's interest rates on cash at 3 % or so , You and I have to save up 3 million dollars to get $ 90,000 in income per year .
We also risk the chance of losing our capital by a fund failure or bank failure and more .
These government pensions are better than winning a million dollar lottery .
A million dollar lottery pays less than $ 50 K a year , and stops after 20 years , with no health care .
These pensions are like being a multi millionaire , like having saved , put away , 3 million dollars of after tax money .
And we know it would have taken many more millions in order to save 3 million after taxes .
These pensions make people millionaires , or as you said , Elite .
But the pensioners never had to save it up .
It is one thing to pay someone while they are working , but it is outrageous to pay them that much when they are not working .
And they are allowed to work elsewhere , collect other pensions , and earn income from other investments , while the taxpayer continues to support them ..
I have saved up quite a bit , and bought income producing assets , but have much further saving to go in order to retire with a decent income from my savings or estate .
When you understand investing and passive income , you realize that the goal in life is to create an estate that pays you income later in life .
You live off the income the money or estate generates .
You do n't spend your savings / capital .
Then you can pass income generating assets to your children , or whomever you choose .
So as I said , these pensions are like having millions in an estate that is producing income .
Something that I have scrimped and scraped and saved to achieve .
I rent a house now that prices are falling , and shop at garage sales .
I rarely buy liabilities that lose value .
Boat , RV , toys , etc .
I almost always buy used items .
Pensioners live much better than me , and drive brand new cars , boats , RV's and other liabilities .
Even better for example , a woman who marries a male government pensioner , and maybe soon for a man , LOL , is that a woman can come along and marry the government pentioner , then take the equivalent of half the future pension in a divorce , and pay no taxes on it like most divorces , or she can inherit the pension on his death after doing no work at all .
Taxpayers then support her for no work ever done .
It is insane .
The entire government has a spending problem , not an income problem .
Yesterday , my accountant told me I owe some more in taxes .
The mainstream media blames " the housing slump " for government shortfalls -- for example : States Slammed by Tax Shortfalls .
The problem is n't a tax shortfall , it 's a structural deficit between outlandishly generous pensions and healthcare benefits and what the economy can support .
I have often reprinted this little chart to graphically illustrate what bankruptcy looks like .
We all read these mind - numbing numbers -- unfunded Medicare obligations , $ 43 trillion , and so on -- and then move on to sports or celebrity gossip or the latest bread - and - circus political " news . "
That structural deficit can only be resolved by complete bankruptcy of government at all levels .
You can't fund $ 60 trillion with tax increases , or hope that some Oil Exporting Nation 's sovereign investment fund will loan us $ 60 trillion ( the Medicare shortfall alone is $ 43 trillion , but let 's not forget all those other promises to pay pensions and healthcare made by Federal , local and state governments ) .
That Medicare expenses outstrip the growth of the underlying economy can be seen in this chart :
As I have documented elsewhere , Medicare costs continue to climb at a rate far above the growth rate of the U.S. economy , and there is virtually no evidence to support the fantasy that adjusting a few parameters of payments or services will do anything to change that .
Medicare now costs over $ 500 billion a year , larger than any expense except Social Security ( which is supposedly self - funding via the FICA payroll taxes ) and the defense budget ( fighting two wars , global war on terror , etc. ) .
The trends are inescapable : Medicare will soon surpass defense spending , and then keep right on going .
Will anyone accept a reduction in their " right " to entitlements ?
Heck no .
Remember , " I earned this " and " it 's my right " and " I paid my taxes , I deserve this . "
Ahem .
Yeah , sure .
Whatever .
There is no way to gracefully cut off entitlements , and politically it is impossible .
That 's why it 's easy to predict bankruptcy is the only outcome : a point will have to be reached when the government simply can't tax or borrow enough money to meet its obligations .
At the Federal level , that will be reached when interest rates skyrocket and the interest on the Federal debt ( National Debt ) exceeds all expenses but Medicare .
The interest is already pushing $ 300 billion - - yes , half as large as the entire Social Security budget -- and it takes little imagination to see it doubling and then tripling as money becomes dear globally and our non-U.S. friends who have purchased all our debt finally tire of supporting our free - spending ways .
After all , every dollar they waste , oops , I mean invest , in U.S. bonds and mortgages ( debt ) is a dollar not invested in their own nations ' well - being .
Eventually their own people will demand that the surplus be invested in their own nation rather than propping up The Empire of Debt , a .k.a. the U.S.
At the local and state level , bankruptcy will become inevitable as soon as revenues are dwarfed by expenditures and pension / benefit promises .
The city of Vallejo has offered us the template which will be followed hundreds of times in the coming decade : recalcitrant public unions demand more taxes to cover the structural budget shortfalls and complain " the money 's gotta be here somewhere , " and after cutting services to the bone the city finally declares bankruptcy .
Look for this play to come to your town , city , county and state soon .
There will be plenty of half - measures and fantasy " solutions " along the way , of course ; here in California , the latest installment is a drastic pay cut for some state workers : Governor plans to slash state workers ' pay .
It 's not politics , it 's math .
As I noted in Is the U.S. Alcoholic , or Merely Schizophrenic ? ( July 15 , 2008 ) , we as a nation are in deep , inpenetrable denial about our fiscal binges and addictions to " borrowing our way out of debt , " i.e. " the hair of the dog that bit us . "
Open a spreadsheet and enter two columns of data .
Take $ 100 and calculate its growth over 20 years at 3 % .
Now calculate 8 % growth for 20 years .
The economy and tax revenues rose 75 % in 20 years to $ 175 .
The entitlements / pension / Medicare costs more than quadrupled to $ 431 .
No spin , no politics , nothing fancy : that 's how expenditures outrun revenues to the point that bankruptcy is the only possible endpoint .
Call it whatever you want - -" structural deficit " has a nice , clinical sound -- but anyone claiming there wo n't be financial Armageddon should fire up his / her spreadsheet and do the math .
There will be Armageddon , as sure as 2 + 2 = 4 . Bailout Alerts : Astute reader Mary R.H. recommended this Vanity Fair article on the Bear Stearns collapse : and offered this comment :
See page 7 of the article , about 1 /3rd down , where it says " At one point , Paulson had to sign a document confirming that , yes , in the event Bear defaulted on its securities , the American taxpayer would pay the tab . "
I absolutely froze when I read this .
I had to reread it several times to let the full weight of that message sink in .
We the common people who apparently have no rights left in this country and no say in legislated federal usury are going to pay for the ruling class to remain wealthy and in power .
" A GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE " ...
I do n't think so , not any more .
I would also suggest this absolute gutting of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by Paul Gigot : The Fannie Mae Gang ( Wall Street Journal )
New Readers Journal Essay : Back in the Village
( Chris Sullins , July 24 , 2008 ) Three articles by Charles Hugh Smith this year have garnered my attention .
The first was When Belief in the System Fades which struck a harmonized note for me as a former officer in the military reserve who had served in Iraq and recently resigned my commission .
The next two were The Art of Survival , Taoism and the Warring States and Where the Rubber Meets the Road .
I had really liked the Survival + theme in both articles with the emphasis on building human relationships within a small community and strengthening personal skills over the retreat to the isolated bunker filled with gadgets and guns .

Comcast to Stop Hampering File - Sharing Associated Press
Published : Thursday March 27 , 2008
|
Print This Email This BY DEBORAH YAO PHILADELPHIA ( AP ) -- Comcast Corp. , an Internet service provider under investigation for hampering online file - sharing by its subscribers , announced Thursday an about - face in its stance and said it will treat all types of Internet traffic equally .
Since user reports of interference with file - sharing traffic were confirmed by an Associated Press investigation in October , Comcast has been vigorously defending its practices , most recently at a hearing of the Federal Communications Commission in February .
Consumer and " Net Neutrality " advocates have been equally vigorous in their attacks on the company , saying that by secretly blocking some connections between file - sharing computers , Comcast made itself a judge and gatekeeper for the Internet .
They also accused Comcast of stifling delivery of Internet video , an emerging competitor to the cable company 's core business .
Comcast has said that its practices were necessary to keep file - sharing traffic from overwhelming local cable lines , where neighbors share capacity with one another .
On Thursday , Comcast said that by the end of the year , it will move to a system that manages capacity without favoring one type of traffic over another .
" This means that we will have to rapidly reconfigure our network management systems , but the outcome will be a traffic management technique that is more appropriate for today 's emerging Internet trends , " Tony Werner , Comcast 's chief technology officer , said in a statement .
The company initially veiled its traffic - management system in secrecy , saying openness would allow users to circumvent it .
But on Thursday , Werner said the company would " publish " the new technique and take into account feedback from the Internet community .
Comcast has been hampering the BitTorrent file - sharing protocol , which together with the eDonkey protocol , accounts for about a third of all Internet traffic , according to figures from Arbor Networks .
The vast majority of that is illegal sharing of copyright - protected files , but file - sharing is also emerging as a low - cost way of distributing legal content - in particular , video .
Peer - to - peer file - sharing " has matured as an enabler for legal content distribution , " Werner said .
" So we need to have an architecture that can support it with techniques that work over all networks . "
Comcast now says it is in talks with BitTorrent Inc. , the company founded by the creator of the protocol , to come up with better ways to transport large files over the Internet .
The companies said they want to work out these issues privately , without the need for government intervention .
FCC commissioners have indicated that they take the issue seriously , and commission Chairman Kevin Martin has voiced objections to secret traffic management .
For its part , BitTorrent acknowledged that service providers have to manage their networks somehow , especially during peak times .
" While we think there were other management techniques that could have been deployed , we understand why Comcast and other ISPs adopted the approach that they did initially , " Eric Klinker , BitTorrent 's chief technology officer , said in a statement .
Verizon Communications Inc. two weeks ago announced the results of a collaboration project with Pando Networks , another file - sharing company .
By sharing information with Pando , Verizon was able to speed up file - sharing downloads for its subscribers while reducing the strain on its own network .
AT&T Inc. , the country 's largest Internet service provider , has been looking at similar collaboration .
However , phone companies are in a better position than cable companies to deal with file - sharing traffic , since neighbors do n't share capacity on phone lines .
Time Warner Cable is experimenting with another way of managing traffic , placing explicit caps on the monthly downloads for new customers in Beaumont , Texas .
Subscribers who go over their allotment will pay extra , much like a cell - phone subscriber who uses too many minutes in a month .
Associated Press Business Writer Barbara Ortutay and Technology Writer Peter Svensson in New York contributed to this story .
It ’s hard not to get the sense that Joe Lieberman is just taunting Dems at this point .
Lieberman does n’t want to just burn the bridge to the ground , he wants to pour salt in the earth around the wreckage .
Wednesday , Lieberman joined a conference call coordinated by a right - wing House member to bash Barack Obama .
Yesterday , he announced the creation of what he calls a “ new grassroots organization , ” called , “ Citizens for McCain . ”
From the letter the McCain campaign distributed today ( no link available ) :
Citizens for McCain is an organization within the McCain campaign for people who put country before political party and support the candidate for President who has a proven record of bipartisanship .
As you know , I caucus with the Democrats as a United States Senator and was the Democrat Party ’s nominee for Vice - President of the United States against President Bush and Vice President Cheney .
But first and foremost , I am an American .
I have an obligation to do what I think is best for our nation regardless of political party .
A couple of things .
First , how far gone is Lieberman ?
In his letter to “ fellow McCain supporters , ” he uses the far - right , grammatically - wrong construction : “ Democrat Party . ” Pathetic .
Second , Lieberman calls Citizens for McCain a “ new grassroots organization . ”
It is n’t .
In fact , by all appearances , it ’s not an organization at all — it ’s just a gimmick of the McCain campaign , cooked up to collect money and addresses .
Campaigns come up with these gimmicks all the time , but for a sitting senator to announce that he ’s the “ chair ” of a “ new grassroots organization , ” when there is no actual organization , is pretty ridiculous .
Maybe Obama needs to back him up against another wall .
ジュニパーネットワークスは5月28日、タイ・バンコクにて「APAC J- Tech Forum」を開催。ユーザー提言として、NTTコミュニケーションズ（以下、NTT
Com） 先端IPアーキテクチャセンタ／担当部長の宮川晋氏が「IPv4アドレスの枯渇問題」に関しての講演を行った。
2010 年の冬には日本 のIPv4アドレスがなくなる
宮川氏は、まず日本のネットワーク事情やNTTグループを紹介。NTTグループは、売り上げ920億ドルで、米ベライゾンに次いで世界2位の通信事業者。NTT
Comは、運営するプロバイダOCNのバックボーンとして国内に160Gbpsのバックボーンを有し、日本―米国間は160Gbps、米国―欧州は29Gbps、アジア―オセアニアに52Gbpsの国際バックボーンを保有しているという。
日本全体のインターネット事情では、ここ数年ADSL／FTTH加入者が爆発的に増加したため、世界一のブロードバンド大国になったと紹介。2007年5月にはFTTH加入者が880万人を超え、2010年にはFTTHが2000万人、ADSLが1000万人にまで増加するとした。宮川氏は、「月額50ドル程度で100Mbpsが使える。これはネットワークベンダにとっては、まさにクレイジーな状態だ。しかも、まだ毎年70万人づつ増えていっている。このような勢いでユーザーが増加していけば、常時接続が基本となるブロードバンド回線においてIPv4アドレスが枯渇するのは当然ともいえる」と説明した。
宮川氏は 、 「 現在の勢いから考えると日本国内のIPv4アドレスがなくなるのは2010年。2010年の冬には確実に深刻な問題になる」と予測した。
IPv4アドレス枯渇問題を解決するためにはキャリアグレードNATが必須
以前からIPv4アドレスの枯渇を懸念していた日本のキャリアは、すでにIPv6に対応できるインフラを用意している。しかし、現実的に考えると、IPv4アドレスが枯渇するからといって、今後2年間で純粋なIPv6環境に移行するのはユーザーの負担を考えると難しい。
宮川氏が提案す るNATを使ったIPv4環境の概念図
そこで、宮川氏 はIPv4環境をユーザーに提供し続けるための方法として、アクセスコントロールの部分でNATを利用し、エンドユーザーにプライベートなIPv4アドレスを与える仕組みが必要だとした。
NTT Com 先端IP アーキテクチャセンタ／担当部長 宮川晋氏
しかし、この場合、1つのグローバルIPv4アドレスを複数ユーザーで共有しなければならないため、ポート数に限界がある。なぜなら、6万5535個のポートをユーザーで共有しなければならないからだ。もし、2000ユーザーで共有すると、一人当たり25〜30個のTCPセッションしか利用できなくなってしまうという。
これは厳しい数字だ。例え ばGoogle Mapsで米サンフランシスコ周辺を表示した場合、30セッション利用できる状況であれば普通に表示できるが、15セッションだと半分程度しか画像が表示されず、5セッションだと「サーバが見つかりませんでした」というエラーが出てしまう。そのほかの例だと、Yahoo!のトップページで10〜20セッション、iTunesで230〜270セッション、YouTubeで90セッション、楽天で50〜60セッション程度だという。
宮川氏はこの点について、 「画像は画像ごとにセッションを使うので、画像が多いとセッション数も多く必要になってしまう。また、Ajaxを利用している場合も同様だ。iTunesはiTunes
Storeでアーティスト画像が大量に使われているため、必要なセッション数が多いのだ。また、写真共有サイトなども同様に多くのセッション数を必要とする。また、昨今はiTunesやAcrobatなどの各種アプリケーションがオンラインアップデートのためにセッションを利用しているので、PCを立ち上げただけでセッションを数多く利用している」と説明した。
この問題を解決するためには、「 キャリアグレードなNAT」が必要だと宮川氏はいう。同氏のいうキャリアグレードNATに必要な要件は、「1万ユーザー以上対応し、1ユーザー当たり100セッション利用可能」「SOHOで利用しているルータのように、基本的にアプリケーションを妨害しないオープンな仕様」「高い可用性」の3点。このようなNATはまだ市場に存在しないという。
宮川氏は 、 「 早急に作ってほしい。一般的 にNAT は閉塞的で、余計な通信やアプリケーションを防ぐ傾向にあるが、キャリアで利用する場合、そのような仕様だと「○○のアプリケーションが利用できない」といったユーザーからの問い合わせ対応が大変だ。だから、基本的にすべてオープンなNATにしてほしい」と語った。
ただし、この宮川氏の提唱するNATを利用した場合でも、Googleのキャッシュがうまく利用できないなど、まだいくつかの問題点が残されているとした。

New Report Reveals
How the Failures of the International Community to Combat COVID - 19 Has Led to Dire Consequences for Millions of the Most Vulnerable
September 29 , 2020
British Airways is offloading thousands of suitcases to a warehouse in Italy in an attempt to cope with the backlog of 19,000 bags that failed to get on to flights amid the chaos at Terminal Five .
The airline said more than 400 " volunteers " – workers from other parts of the company – were helping to transport the mountain of luggage to a courier firm in Milan after T5 's supposed state - of - the - art automated baggage system was unable to process delayed suitcases .
From Milan bags will be sorted and either driven or flown to their owners .
" Delayed bags must undergo enhanced levels of security screening , " a BA spokeswoman said .
" Much of this must be done manually rather than using the automated baggage systems .
" Although most of the delayed bags will be sorted and reflighted at Heathrow , it is quicker for bags with European mainland addresses to go to Milan for sorting and onward transport than to wait for flights leaving Heathrow . "
She said using the Milan - based courier firm was standard practice for BA when dealing with a baggage backlog .
Although the bags take 24 hours to reach Milan by lorry , it can be quicker than by air because bags travelling by road do not have to be screened .
However , bags travelling to people on holiday are likely to reach the correct hotels only after the owners have flown home .
They may then have to be returned to Milan to be sorted again .
Bags belonging to passengers on domestic flights are being driven to Manchester and Scotland , where they will be sorted and dispatched to their owners .
BA said travellers whose bags were lost could claim for " immediate expenses " but did not define what that covered or say how much it would reimburse .
Passengers faced more misery yesterday as BA axed 50 more flights from T5 .
The airline said 32 flights would be affected today , bringing the total number of cancellations since the terminal opened to 430 .
However , BA said it expected 92 % of flights to be operating on Thursday .
Dear citizens of America ,
On behalf of my fellow countrymen in Britain , I 'm writing to express my dismay at the way your presidential election race has turned out .
For years now , whatever the state of our political scene , we 've been able to rely on your own to provide us with a warm feeling of superiority .
If we felt dissatisfied with our prime minister , we had only to glance your way to feel blessed .
Blair may have been shifty , Brown may be surly , but neither could be compared to their American counterpart without looking like political giants , men of lofty intelligence and virtue .
Even those who most passionately opposed the Iraq war could n't help but notice that Tony Blair made the case for it so much more eloquently than George Bush .
But now what have you gone and done ?
You 've nominated , as de facto leaders of your political parties , two men who make Gordon Brown and David Cameron look puny by comparison .
John McCain 's entire career reads like a very long message to Brown that can be approximately summarised as " This is how to do rough - hewn integrity " .
As for Cameron … well .
A few months ago he almost seemed charismatic .
But stand him next to Obama and suddenly he 's revealed for what he is : a posh David Brent ( that 's like Michael Scott , only English ) .
It 's not just our leaders - it 's our whole political culture you 're undermining .
We 're very comfortable characterising American politics as shallow , soundbite - driven , and personality - obsessed .
It makes us feel high - minded , Greece to your Rome , that sort of thing - even when we 're discussing our Home Secretary 's cleavage or watching Cameron and Brown swap flaccid insults across the despatch box .
But by god , you 're making it difficult for us .
For some reason you 've voted for two candidates who seem to actually enjoy discussing real political issues in detail .
When Obama had a little trouble with his pastor , did he do a hilariously mawkish interview with Oprah Winfrey , or dismiss the whole affair with a scorching soundbite ?
Sadly , no .
He made a long , complex speech about race in America .
Then – here 's the worst part – he put the whole 40 minutes of it on the web , and over four million people downloaded it .
Have n't you people got soaps to watch ?
As for McCain , he 's no better .
In a bid to escape the restrictive , reassuringly dumbed - down format of conventional TV debates , he 's challenged Obama to a series of town - hall meetings with fewer rules and no moderator .
What a show - off .
Obama 's response to this gambit ?
Fine , but let 's make them even less structured , and longer ; see you and raise the tone .
I mean , it 's appalling .
You 're in danger of making our political leaders feel like they should have a proper public debate , or give a high - profile speech that addresses difficult issues without offering easy answers .
Over the years , we 've also felt pretty smug at the way your politics is dominated by big business .
Every time we read about an MP fiddling his expenses we need only summon to mind a mental picture of some oil baron in a Stetson stuffing money into George Bush 's pocket to feel good about the smallness of our own corruptions .
But Obama 's campaign has raised hundreds of millions of dollars , not from fat corporate donors , but from ordinary people giving a few bucks at a time .
And they do n't even get a knighthood in return .
It 's just so … democratic .
In fact , it 's not just our sense of political superiority you 're damaging .
It 's our pride in being British , dammit .
What you may not understand is just how much of our national self - image is premised on the idea that your country is full of apathetic , stupid people .
We may not be the richest country in the world , or have the biggest army like you do .
What we have instead is an enduring sense that we are better , smarter , more serious people who do n't dominate the world any more only because to do so would be a bit try - hard .
So when we read about record numbers of Americans coming out to vote and volunteer for their candidate , to organize public events and knock on doors and distribute leaflets about the war and argue about the rights and wrongs of health policy , it makes us feel a bit … tired .
A bit tired , and to be completely honest , mildly depressed .
Let me appeal to your sense of history ( even though , of course , we all know you do n't have one ) : if you have any residual affection for your former landlords , please cease and desist with this vulgar public display of civic seriousness .
Or – if I might borrow your vernacular – enough with the grown - up politics already .
Yours faithfully ,
Ian Leslie
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Sen. Charles Schumer said Sunday the Bush administration is trying to " blame the fire on the person who calls 9 - 1 - 1 " by suggesting he had a role in one of the costliest U.S. bank failures .
Federal regulators with the Office of Thrift Supervision were " asleep at the switch " when it came to IndyMac 's " reckless " behavior , the New York Democrat complained .
" OTS ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system , so that there wo n't be other IndyMacs , " said Schumer , a member of the Senate Banking Committee , chairman of Congress ' Joint Economic Committee and the third - ranking Democrat in the Senate .
OTS announced Friday that it was taking over the $ 32 billion IndyMac and transferring control to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - and the agency pointed the finger directly at Schumer for the failure , accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that " expressed concerns about IndyMac 's viability . "
" In the following 11 business days , depositors withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion from their accounts , " the OTS said in a statement announcing the California - based lender 's takeover .
The statement included a quote from OTS Director John Reich saying , " Although this institution was already in distress , I am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process . "
Schumer 's letter on June 26 said he was " concerned that IndyMac 's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers . "
But after Friday 's statement , Schumer swiftly rejected any suggestions of responsibility for IndyMac 's collapse -- and in a Sunday news conference , he said " everything " in his letter was already known to the public .
" IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks , " he said .
" It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide , and like Countrywide , it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have .
Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we 're now in . "
The embattled Countrywide Financial Corp. was recently purchased by Bank of America .
Schumer argued that the " breadth and depth " of the problems at IndyMac were " apparent for years , and they accelerated in the last six months . "
But OTS , he said , " was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint .
" And now they are doing what the Bush administration always does : blame the fire on the person who calls 9 - 1 - 1 . "
The White House had no immediate response .
Schumer said OTS is " known as a weak regulator , " and added , " my job was to try and toughen them up and that 's what I tried to do . "
Sean Payton 's persistence finally won out .
The New Orleans Saints acquired Jeremy Shockey for a second - and a fifth - round draft pick in 2009 .
The deal was first reported by FoxSports.com .
" Jeremy is a player that we are excited to have on our roster .
He is someone I am familiar with as a player , " Payton said .
" He brings a skill set to the position that I feel will be a tremendous benefit to our offense . "
The Saints had been trying since February to acquire the disgruntled New York Giants tight end .
First , they offered a second - round pick .
Before the draft , they increased the offer to a second - and a fifth - round draft choice , but until a few days before the start of their training camp , the Giants felt he was too valuable to lose .
As Payton and Saints general manager Mickey Loomis did their last few minutes of office work before heading to Jackson , Miss. , for Wednesday 's start of training camp , they received a call from the Giants saying Shockey was theirs .
" Jeremy brought great energy to the game every time he stepped on the field , " Giants team president John Mara said .
" He had a close relationship with my father from the time we drafted him , and I had a couple of long conversations with Jeremy this spring and summer .
From those conversations , it was apparent to me that a fresh start was the best thing for us and for Jeremy . "
Even through the weekend , the Saints had tried to broker a deal for Shockey .
On Sunday , they tried to get in the middle of the Jason Taylor trade to see whether there was a way they could make a three - way deal that brought them Shockey , according to multiple sources .
Taylor went from the Miami Dolphins to the Washington Redskins for a second - round pick in 2009 and a sixth - rounder in 2010 .
Chris Mortensen reported that deal would have still sent Shockey to the Saints , with the Giants obtaining Taylor and the Dolphins still receiving the Saints ' second - and fifth - round picks in 2009 .
The Giants stalled the discussions because GM Jerry Reese wanted to talk to Taylor -- most likely to gauge his interest in playing beyond 2008 and to discuss restructuring his contract -- before he took the next step with the trade , Mortensen reported .
But the Dolphins would n't grant permission to the Giants to talk to Taylor because they did n't want Taylor to be in control of any deal .
Shockey , 28 , a four - time Pro Bowler , has 371 catches for 4,228 yards and 27 touchdowns in his six - year NFL career .
He grew disgruntled with the Giants because he wanted to be more involved with some downfield passing .
New York valued his run blocking .
The McCain campaign ( and much of the mainstream media ) keeps trying to keep alive the myth of McCain the Maverick , but it is clearly on life support , and getting a bit crazy .
In a conference call today , a McCain spokeswoman tried to compare McCain ’s bipartisan cred with Obama ’s , using the example of immigration reform :
It ’s fairly significant that Senator McCain worked on the immigration reform legislation while he was pursing the nomination of his party .
[ He ] reached across the aisle despite a heated primary campaign .
What ’s hilarious about this statement is that after McCain ’s legislation failed , he completely flip - flopped and has now said repeatedly that he does not support immigration reform .
Even right - wing blogs see it that way .
During the Jan 30 presidential debate , McCain said he would not vote for his own legislation .
In fact , if you take every example from the past 8 years where McCain has acted as a maverick and bucked his party ’s position , he has since done a screeching U - turn and now completely supports the party line :
What really amazes me is that they are now claiming that Obama is not bipartisan enough .
Yesterday , the McCain campaign released a memo saying :
There has never been a time when Barack Obama has bucked the party line to lead on an issue of national importance .
I do n’t get it .
I understand why McCain would want to claim that he is different than President Bush and his disastrous Republican policies , but attacking Obama because he has n’t distanced himself from the Democrats ?
Who cares ?
Besides , it ’s obviously false — Obama spoke out against the war in Iraq when Democrats were falling over themselves to support Bush ’s position .
To me , that ’s bucking the party line of both parties on an “ issue of national importance ” .
And you know , Obama was right .

Debate Over : It 's Hyperinflation ( and US Economic Collapse ) 2008-06-30 — ml-implode.com
By Aaron Krowne , IEHI Inc. ; ML - Implode.com founder .
The economy and to a great extent the world today is run by would - be economic seers and prognosticators , probably more so than ever before in history .
I say " would - be " , however , because their track records are rather spotty .
This contradiction should be no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the plentiful ( and well - deserved ) criticism of the Fed 's recent actions ( and statements ) , but many have also noted that it seems the Fed and its economic peers and groupies never seem to " get it right " .
There is a structural problem here , I would say ; I think it has something to do with the true objective of these people being political rather than predictive success .
The investment community , surprisingly , does n't do much better , and I include in that the " contrarian " crowd -- and to some extent even the Austrians .
This group has been preoccupied with an " inflation vs. deflation " debate for at least the last two years ( myself among them ) , and it shows no signs of letting up .
As I will argue below , I think there is now ample evidence to make the call one way or the other .
First , regarding prognostication , I want to share a little trick I use that works pretty well .
All you do is look at the current picture -- putting aside at least for hypothetical purposes one 's own pre-conceived ideas of the answer -- and make a genuine attempt to see the situation for what it is .
By " current picture " I mean actual data , though one does n't usually need to dig too deep into minutiae .
This is how the Mortgage Lender Implode - o- Meter came about and became such a success : with a basic understanding of the importance of housing finance to the US economy , I looked at a nascent trend of imploding , non-integrated mortgage lending shops , and said " that 's the end of that game . "
I then made a web site about it , and people were shocked !
Some caught on quickly , but amazingly ( or not ) , the mainstream took well over a half year to finally come to terms with the total upending of the housing market ( some still think the problem is just " subprime " , sadly ) .
A handicap I think a lot of the commentators have is that they do n't really invest or trade in a direct way corresponding to the theses they write extensively about .
In other words , they do n't " put their money where their mouth is " .
I always strive to do so -- and even when I do n't , I approach the economic prognostication game with the secondary question " so how should I invest ? "
If I can't answer that secondary question , then I probably do n't really know the primary answer either !
When I combine this discipline with looking at the current data in the most comprehensive way I can , and doing a little ( NOT a lot ) of extension of the current trends based on fundamentals , it rarely fails to point the right way .
It may not be super - precise , but it is silly to position onesself so that day - to - day or even month - to - month precision matters .
To reiterate : the trick is to clear one 's mind of bias and get the best reading possible on what is really going on now -- only then can one predict with any sort of accuracy .
Predicting the mortgage lending collapse was just one example .
But I 've pulled this trick before and again since : covering the big banks negatively and shorting them too , doing it all again when everyone said they were " bottoming out " ; ditto home builders , and going long gold and silver even though the pundits and " experts " have been " calling the top " for years .
There is more , but the current relevant areas for this article are essentially short US government finances ( at all levels ) and the dollar .
THE INFLATION QUESTION -- AND ANSWER
Getting back to the topic at hand , my current " contemporaneous tea - leaf reading " exercise focuses on the inflation question and government finances , and what I am seeing is not pretty .
Inflation first .
As far as I am concerned , the " inflation vs. deflation " debate is over : we are already at hyperinflation -- even though certain markets and measures of credit exhibit deflation .
If you want to quibble about the definition ( how " hyper " the inflation actually is ) , go somewhere else : my point is that we have embarked on the path from which there is likely to be no return , given the way the system works .
And the real kicker is : in response to the crisis , the system has n't changed .
The big glaring data point backing this argument is oil prices .
Oil prices in 2008 have shocked everyone , literally everyone , including me -- and that 's saying a lot since I 'm a " peak oiler , " and already believed high and increasing rates of inflation were in the cards for purely monetary reasons .
All the usual culprits and whipping boys have been trotted out and the public seems OK with this .
That 's too bad because the one thing that is different this time ; the only thing on the planet that could truly be the cause of the EXTREME price action in oil , are the actions of the Fed .
In specific I mean holding interest rates at the ungodly low rate of 2 % -- below even their own doctored inflation reading ( which is around 4 % ) ; and hell , below even their core inflation reading , which is a percent lower or so .
So the US Fed has deeply NEGATIVE real interest rates for the first time since ... well , since they LAST blew a horrible , stupid , gargantuan bubble ( in housing ) .
But they 've never been this deep , this negative , or coincided with this late stage of the dollar 's waning role as a global reserve currency -- or with total dollar - based financial market collapse .
I 've even heard commentators on CNBC -- CNBC , of all places -- say " the US basically has no financial economy right now . "
This is the exact sentence I had only previously thought to myself and shared with a few close associates beforehand .
You know it 's bad when " bubblevision " lets something like that slip .
When you add up all these factors , the radical move in crude can only be seen as the natural consequence of the similarly radical and disastrous actions of the Fed.
Global Peak Oil -- which probably really occurred back in early 2006 -- cannot explain the sudden parabolic move in oil in early 2008 .
Speculators ?
Manipulation ?
Please -- this is n't the first or only market to exhibit either -- and it's one of the most intensely - watched ( not just by regulators but by the meddling and shameless US Congress and the clueless scandal - mongering mainstream media ) .
Oil Market Supply Backdrop Extremely Tight -- Major Production Peaks Likely Passed
Many Austrian - leaning commentators have pointed to the tepid to slightly negative monetary base growth in the last year as evidence that the Fed is " not inflating " , therefore we could not be " experiencing hyperinflation " .
While this observation does have real practical implications , it misses a lot of what 's going on , and I think it is a gross misreading of Austrian economics -- which is in fact completely compatible with what I am arguing here .
To illustrate I 'd like to ask my friend Mike " Mish " Shedlock , who asserts that " we are in deflation , " what he does when he pulls up to the gas station pump .
Does he say " we are in deflation now -- just look how home prices are down about 20 % from their mid-2006 peak .
Therefore I demand you only charge me 80 % of mid-2006 ( $ 2.50 / gallon ) gas prices .
So here is $ 2.00 for a gallon ? " I do n't think so .
He probably intuitively senses that that would n't go over very well .
The basic reason this sort of Austrian " instant money quantity " reading is wrong is that plenty of money has already been created over the past 30 years , so there is really no need to " print " any more right now to get most of the bad effects !
PLENTY OF MONEY FOR ECONOMIC HAVOC !!!
A quick toy example illustrates the dynamic that is now in effect .
Let 's say there is $ 100 trillion of money , credit , derivatives , and all manner of exotic financial vehicles in the world ( in fact the latest count of derivatives alone is over $ 1 quadrillion , per the BIS , just so you know ) .
Now let 's say we hit a credit crisis , and $ 50 trillion of that money / credit / derivatives simply vaporizes .
Some who label themselves " Austrian " would say " ah - ha , we 've had 50 % deflation " !
Well , in a sense , maybe .
In fact , as part in parcel of the same crisis , a not - negligible chunk of that financial money ( for argument 's sake , say $ 1 trillion ) is likely to seek " safe haven " assets like government bonds , bidding down their yields .
We have indeed seen that recently .
This is actually seen as a " good thing " , because it " naturally " lowers interest rates ( providing banking system " relief " ) , and makes it cheap for government to borrow , much to the delight of our ruling guns - and - butter enthusiasts .
Indeed , you could call it " deflationary " , both in cause and effect .
Asset Backed Commercial Paper -- A collapsing / " deflating " market
But there is more to this picture .
Let 's say $ 1 trillion of the $ 50 trillion remaining instead heads for commodities .
Now we have some real fireworks , because commodities are a small and relatively tight market ( after all , there is a limit to the amount of real stuff being produced ) .
And virtually no one says this is a " good thing " ( commodities investors have learned to be quiet about it ) .
And the reason this phenomenon might happen much more than it would otherwise would be a central bank setting the main interest rate obscenely low -- especially NEGATIVE -- such that scarce , essential real stuff is a " no- brainer " bet .
So here you have deflationary causes producing dramatically inflationary effects .
Seems counter - intuitive , but this is really nothing new : it is historically called the " flight to real goods " , and it happens in every hyperinflation , ALONG WITH financial market collapse .
I believe what we are seeing here in oil , and to a great extent in most other basic commodities , is the FIRST EVER GLOBAL HYPERINFLATION .
This is happening historically now and in such a big way because the dollar is the de facto reserve currency -- and the first - ever fiat global reserve currency -- so the Fed 's actions are magnified beyond anything that has ever been seen before .
They are also eclipsing the effect of the rest of the G7 , which can't seem to decide if they will exercise restraint or provide cover for the Fed .
They are basically puppets of the Fed ( or have been -- there are signs of rebellion , especially from the ECB .
I would say this rebellion is inevitable , and it will spread ) .
But interest rates in the West , if they do start going up by way of policy , probably will not go up fast enough to match the inflation they have already unleashed .
And as long as the interest rates remain NEGATIVE in real terms ( irrespective of manipulated CPI statistics ) , the problem will get worse .
Hence the " hyper " : continued negative real rates alongside collapsing paper money markets ( along with supply and demand fundamentals ) will keep the tailwinds on prices for essential commodities .
Where else is the money going to go ?
REACTION & POLICY
As far as the official attempts we have seen thus far to solve the problem " by other means " ( that is , without admitting the fiat money system is rotten and ill - conceived to its core ) : the solutions put forth ( and in some cases already implemented ) are price caps , export limitations , increased margin requirements , jawboning , and ( a - la Senator Lieberman ) banning large - scale investment in commodities investment vehicles .
Some of these " solutions " actively exacerbate the problem ( price controls , export limitations ) by dismantling free markets .
Some will fail to solve it and create problems elsewhere : margin requirements and banning investment in commodities vehicles fall in this category .
They will simply remove the ability of the weak to benefit from commodity price increases and protect their wealth , PLUS make the problem worse shortly down the road by stymieing investment in commodities production .
And with regards to oil in specific , the greatest factor is out of the Fed 's control : the behavior of the producers .
They do n't have to go into the Western markets in order to react in a logical and self - interested way to the deterioration of the dollar : they can simply leave more crude in the ground .
There is already talk of this : the Fed had better watch it , or oil producer " portfolio allocation " will be added to the myriad of reasons there is less and less supply available for export to the US .
Or , less sensationalistically , they could just keep burning more of the stuff locally , by holding subsidies steady .
So I hope with the above I have convinced you at least that something new and hyperinflationary in nature is going on with oil prices .
If by some miracle prices were to correct back to $ 100 , not only would it likely be temporary , but extreme inflation would probably show up in some other commodity , or even ( God forbid ) precious metals .
The need to preserve these trillions of wealth from ailing areas of the financial economy is not going away any time soon .
It is going to get worse .
In fact , if the authorities had any brains , they 'd encourage investment in precious metals to divert immense pressure from food and energy .
No one ever starved from gold skyrocketing in price ; though it did end a political regime or two .
It is interesting to note that this hyperinflation lacks broad - based participation , unlike what happens in the classic " flight to safety " .
This is rather unsurprising given the narrow manner in which the inflation has manifested -- namely , not in wages , but distinctly in prices people pay for things they cannot avoid buying ( gas , food ) .
Most probably do n't even have any money to invest much of anywhere .
They 're just charging more gas on the credit card .
Instead , the proximate actors in this inflationary episode are foreign central banks , hedge funds , probably sovereign wealth funds , and other large investment outfits ( including the pension funds Lieberman wants to impoverish , since you know , they 're doing so well already ) .
I think this lack of broad - based participation , especially stateside , has thrown many observers for a loop .
But make no mistake : most of the dollars are participating in the flight to real assets ( or will be soon ) .
And by the way , I should mention that a " dollar rally " such as we are allegedly in does n't really matter unless it is also rallying against commodities , because all major currencies are in " competitive devaluation . "
Smoke and mirrors .
There is no dollar rally , unless you 're doing short - term trading of some garbagey fiat currency against the one that happens to be the most garbagey of them all .
But I would n't recommend that endeavor .
The Fed really goofed in setting all this up , which is why I say the system has failed to change in any meaningful way in response to the crisis .
Bernanke went to shocking extremes to attempt to stick to the old paradigm and status quo : the demented philosophy that lowering interest rates dramatically will cure all that ails the financial system .
But this ailment , supposedly a lack of " liquidity " , was obviously the symptom , not the disease itself .
The disease is insolvency , relative to the debt strangling our economy .
That is the key thing Bernanke refused to see .
So he insanely lowered interest rates and pawned off the Fed 's good china , hoping the prodigal sibling ( Wall Street ) would take the proceeds and get right back on its feet .
All this did was dig the Fed deeper , make barely a dent in Wall Street 's problems ( though buying a few months of time ) , and as we 've seen , send hundreds of billions ( if not trillions ) careening into the commodities markets .
Oops !
The ECB -- fiat money acolytes though they are -- have been slightly better though the crisis .
They 've been pawning off their own china as well , but at least they have n't done much lowering of interest rates -- so little additional fuel for a " carry trade " into commodities has come from their side of the pond .
They are right to criticize the Fed : if you are going to directly plug gaps in bank balance sheets with Fed cash and " zero - risk " securities , what is the point of lowering the interest rate ?
So I do n't buy the argument that Bernanke is " in a box " -- trapped between lowering interest rates and hurting the dollar , or raising them and killing the domestic economy .
This is a false dilemma because hurting the dollar was always stupid and reckless given the extent we rely on imports , and " saving the domestic economy " by keeping interest rates low was never going to work ( if the Fed even thought it would , they were pretty naive ) .
Nearly everyone ( including Wall Street , for its capital " injections " ) is already paying far higher interest rates than 2 % , so the Fed rate is a farce .
It needs to be raised to kill off the dollar decline and " carry trade " into commodities and other currencies .
THE US DOMESTIC ECONOMY ON THE PRECIPICE
That is a good segue into some discussion of the domestic economy .
As I mentioned way back up at the beginning of this rambling diatribe , I consider the government finances situation to be in utmost dire straits .
The situation is bad .
We are already hitting record federal cash deficits even as economic stimulus checks , more Iraq war appropriations , and potentially some housing bail - outs are just being thrown on the pile .
And that is just for starters .
To help plug the gap , the government has re-introduced 1 - year bills , to get a quick fix of financing .
If this works , of course , it just postpones the problems for one year -- but even 1 - year bills are not immune from the same diminishing bid for the dollar .
See the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee 's statements from late April .
Borrowing year to date is on track to hit the $ 400 - 500 billion range they mention .
The trade deficit is supposed to narrow going into a recession but ours seems to be once again worsening because of the collapse of the dollar and hyperinflation in commodities ( especially oil ) .
Also , we do n't make much that is fit for export .
This all keeps the need for financing up and crowds out Federal government borrowing .
And now the pain is manifesting for state and local governments : the bottom has really fallen out from the lack of housing - bubble - derived income , and years of erosion in local revenue and economic activity in favor of Federal uptake has suddenly become apparent .
Many non-Federal government finances are also being hit with losses stemming from the credit crunch .
Pension funds are widely being re-figured as horribly under - funded based on more recent valuations .
New Jersey is screwed ; my own city of Atlanta just announced they are short $ 150 M on pensions , and Vallejo , CA just went bankrupt largely because of the yawning burden of pensions and municipal salaries .
It is now getting so bad that the state and local governments are starting to appeal to the Federal government for help : major city mayors recently went to congress to testify about their infrastructure and financial crises ( the two are really the same problem ) and beg for help .
The latest housing bailout bill proposes billions to allow states to buy up foreclosed properties .
And this is likely just the beginning .
But the problem is : the Federal government does n't have any money .
It 's already deeply in the red , as we just discussed .
They can only provide money if they can borrow it , which is bound to reach its limits soon .
Where no limits are obeyed , there will be much more inflation , much faster .
Any borrowing the Federal government can do above and beyond the states is really only backed by inflation ( the ability to print more money to pay off the debt ) , but the world is beginning to question why bonds backed by little more than inflation should really be considered ' AAA ' .
That system did n't work so well in the US mortgage market .
What really worries me is all this talk now along the lines of a " new New Deal " .
In other words , we 'll just respond to all our problems with public works programs , all manner of bail - outs and hand - outs , and lots and lots of spending .
It 's a nice thought , especially where infrastructure is concerned .
But any attempt at anything like a New Deal now will simply run into the same financing problems that have gotten us into this mess in the first place .
The US dollar reserve currency system is ending , so the same system of borrowing backed by the dollar obviously cannot be the solution .
And a war will be no good for stimulus because , well , we already have one ( and it's now the most expensive war aside from WWII , and gaining fast ) .
Also worth noting is that many Depression - era programmes -- Fannie and Freddie , FHA , Social Security , to name a few -- are still in place .
In fact , Fannie and Freddie basically are the housing market right now .
So despite all this support , our system is breaking down .
There is something fundamentally wrong with it that needs to be fixed and reformed .
I would argue that that thing is the monetary system ( including both currency and banking ) .
We simply cannot keep having all this borrowing and debt be such a structural part of our system .
It always reaches a point of exhaustion and collapse .
We need sound money , which places natural controls on government spending and dramatically curbs mal - investment and bubbles .
But no one wants to talk about this fundamental problem and how to go about implementing the fixes .
Instead , the same old Great Depression non-solutions are being bandied about and offered up again .
This is silly for another reason : the New Deal did n't actually get us out of the Great Depression .
What got us out was World War II -- in part because of the stimulus factor , but more permanently , because it established the US 's unique position as a global reserve currency .
Obviously , neither is an option now .
Certainly US physical infrastructure needs to be overhauled , but who is going to procure the capital ?
Domestic sources are exhausted .
And what foreigner would want to put money into US infrastructure -- even if they earned decent dividends on it -- while the dollar still has lots of downside risk ?
So unfortunately , it looks like things will have to bottom out before possibilities like this open up .
And that means getting a lot worse .
My big worry at this point is that the US economy , for lack of a more euphonious wording , is headed for complete collapse due to failure of infrastructure as the coup de grace of financial stress .
Now we will see how critical that mundane thing , so taken for granted , is to even have an economy in the first place .
And of course , you can add lack of manufacturing capacity to our the list of infrastructure problems .
Previously I thought " severe recession " , and then " depression " to describe what we face , but neither now seems to do the situation justice .
An aspect of the trouble now beginning to figure prominently is the failure of American cities to function as laid out in their current form ... because of the new factor of people simply not being able to afford to drive their cars ( especially from home to work ) .
Kunstler has been writing about this for years .
In return he was considered a carnival side show ; a sort of amusing angry little man off in his own little world .
But now it looks like he was right .
In the above , you can see gas prices skyrocketing , and we all know this is hammering everyone but the rich .
Amazingly these prices are relatively stagnant compared to crude , but this situation probably will not last .
Exxon and Chevron ( " evil oil companies " they may be ) are exiting the gas station business , with their tails between their legs .
The next proprietors will of necessity not be so bashful about raising prices .
In the second chart , we see transportation energy consumption actually starting to fall .
This is not happening voluntarily , I assure you .
Again , there is little hope of this getting better before it gets much worse as long as the " solutions " proposed just exacerbate the underlying financial problems .
Some of the dramatic collapse in the US 's economic output has in fact already taken place ; it has just been papered over with debt , and bogus accounting that marks up that debt as if it were affirmative wealth .
A lot of that is about to be laid bare , as the real situation simultaneously gets a lot worse .
To end on a somewhat positive note , here is a sketch of a skunkworks program to save the US economy while there is still ( possibly ) a chance ; or at least hasten the recovery : End the Iraq war immediately .
If this is not done , I expect within a year there will be open debate on having to leave involuntarily because we are bankrupt .
We are now spending $ 1.1 trillion on the military in the budget ( see Chalmers Johnson ) , and possibly as high as $ 1.5 trillion with war appropriations .
This is obscene .
The entire defense / homeland security complex is an orgy of corrupt overcharging and objectively pointless contracts .
The war must be ended and the homeland security / military industrial complex downsized .
Stop trying to bail out the housing market ; shift priorities to simply keeping people off the streets .
Foreclosures should be turned into rentals , being effectively taken off the market .
Begin phasing out bubble - blowing measures , like the mortgage interest deduction .
Wind down the GSEs .
Begin transitioning to sound money .
In addition to being good for our citizens , it will be the only way to attract foreign investment any time soon .
And we will sorely need that investment for infrastructure .
Get rid of the tax on gold and silver , which is really yet another inflation tax .
Wind down social security by allowing people to start opting out .
Reduce medicaid and medicare to a level where they are not being heavily used for the middle class , at least for new enrollees going forward .
In fact , any " welfare " geared towards the middle class is by definition a disaster , a conclusion fully evident in the data and experience of the 20th century , but a lesson somehow not learned at all .
Cut back or possibly eliminate Federal income tax .
Most people should not have to pay it .
As Ron Paul had said , this would only require us to go back to the 1997 Federal budget , which is easily doable by cutting the above - mentioned programs .
Most people do n't realize that the 16th amendment was never intended as a tax on the wages most people earn ( " wages " were not considered " income " at the time ) .
This would be a huge shot of stimulus and bolster the middle class .
It would also give the states an opportunity to collect a bit more taxes so they could work on their infrastructure .

As for Germany , only 40 per cent of the population able to work does " real " ( i.e. " produces " s.th. ) work , so one could say that each working person is feeding one bureaucrat -- but when the fiat money is needed to pay the bureaucrats what will the bureaucrats do if there is no fiat money ?

In the last housing bear market , price declines also coincided with inflation in the CPI sense .

Something could be argued along the lines that ALL forms of credit and all securities should go into the monetary " count " that makes up the inflation vs. deflation call .
But then , by that metric , we ARE hyperinflating -- hence the quadrillion dollars of derivatives .

If you stick to what everyone means when they talk about " inflation " , I contend it is pretty obvious we are ramping up into something that looks very " hyper " .
When you connect the outcome with the dynamics ( flight from dollar financial markets ) , the thesis makes a lot of sense .

If that is the case , it would be inflationary , so it would just underscore my argument .
In essence , with all this laundering the Fed is just exchanging some credit deflation for eventual monetary inflation ( unless they 're real lucky and the whole crisis just " blows over " ) .

The organisers of the London Olympics are planning to pass on more than just the Olympic flag to the next host city when the games end in September 2012 .
Senior officials have opened talks with Chicago , one of the early favourites to host the 2016 games , which could result in the bulk of London 's main stadium being dismantled , boxed - up and shipped across the Atlantic to be rebuilt .
The Guardian has learned that 55,000 seats from London 's 80,000 - seat arena could be transported to Washington Park in the Illinois city and used to enlarge a planned , 7,500 - capacity community arena into Chicago 's main Olympic stadium .
The tactic of recycling the Olympic stadium has been billed as the first step in a new approach to the games , which could become more like a travelling circus to keep costs down and allow poorer countries to play host .
Baku in Azerbaijan , Rio de Janeiro and Prague are also bidding for the 2016 games alongside Tokyo , Madrid , and Doha in Qatar .
The plan could also raise tens of millions of pounds to help offset the rising costs of the London games which have quadrupled to £ 9.3 bn .
The cost of the main stadium has already risen from £ 280 m to £ 496 m .
A spokesman for London 's Olympic Delivery Authority said : " It is right that we should explore any opportunities that would recoup some of the cost incurred by the lottery and the public purse . "
David Higgins , chief executive of the ODA , last week began talks with his counterpart in Chicago and said he is willing to have the same discussions with other bidding cities in the coming months .
London 's deal with Chicago has become a possibility because both cities have decided to build main stadiums with small numbers of permanent seats while erecting giant seating scaffolds for the two weeks of competition .
Talks have focused on how London 's stadium might be bolted rather than welded together , ensuring the materials used allow it to function properly in another country and climate , and how sections might fit on a cargo ship .

It would be the first time in history that a stadium of this size has been moved .
Last year , 16,000 seats which had previously been used at the 2006 football World Cup in Germany were shipped to Barbados where they were used in the ICC Cricket World Cup .
" If we could box it up and ship it to the next games , that 's something that could benefit the Olympic movement , " said Doug Arnott , director of sports and operations at Chicago 2016 .
" We have had preliminary discussions about what London 's stadium design team are planning and how it might fit in .
This is to do with the responsible use of materials and trying to avoid leaving infrastructure that will burden a city . "
Chicago could include the plan to reuse London 's stadium in its bid documents which will be presented to the International Olympic Committee later this year .
A spokesman for the ODA said : " We have only held preliminary and very recent discussions with Chicago - at their instigation - covering some of the technical aspects of relocating so many seats , but it is obviously good news that there is already interest in re-using them .
We will also continue to explore options to relocate facilities within the UK as a priority wherever possible . "
HOK Sport , architects of London 's Olympic stadium , have deliberately designed the arena as a kit in part .
A permanent concrete bowl of 25,000 seats will remain in place for athletics , lower league football and rugby , but every other component could be sold on .
Chicago has made staging a low - impact games a core part of its bid .
It is using several existing arenas , including Soldier Field where the Chicago Bears NFL team play , and the Chicago Bulls ' basketball arena will host gymnastics and basketball .
" Chicago think this would be a coup for their bid , and would show they are putting their money where their mouth is on their commitment to sustainability , " said a source .
Last week Gordon Brown joined members of the International Olympic Committee at the site of London 's Olympic stadium in east London as building work began ahead of schedule .
The IOC gave London 's preparations a ringing endorsement but London 's mayor , Boris Johnson , has pledged to drive down costs .

...A Primer on the Doomsday argument ....
Rarely does philosophy produce empirical predictions .
The Doomsday argument is an important exception .
From seemingly trivial premises it seeks to show that the risk that humankind will go extinct soon has been systematically underestimated .
Nearly everybody 's first reaction is that there must be something wrong with such an argument .
Yet despite being subjected to intense scrutiny by a growing number of philosophers , no simple flaw in the argument has been identified .
It started some fifteen years ago when astrophysicist Brandon Carter discovered a previously unnoticed consequence of a version of the weak anthropic principle .
Carter did n't publish his finding , but the idea was taken up by philosopher John Leslie who has been a prolific author on the subject , culminating in his monograph The End of the World ( Routledge , 1996 ) .
Versions of the Doomsday argument have also been independently discovered by other authors .
In recent years , there have been numerous papers trying to refute the argument , and an approximately equal number of papers refuting these refutations .
Here is the doomsday argument .
I will explain it in three steps :
Step I
Imagine a universe that consists of one hundred cubicles .
In each cubicle , there is one person .
Ninety of the cubicles are painted blue on the outside and the other ten are painted red .
Each person is asked to guess whether she is in a blue or a red cubicle .
( And everybody knows all this . )
Now , suppose you find yourself in one of these cubicles .
What color should you think it has ?
Since 90 % of all people are in blue cubicles , and since you dont have any other relevant information , it seems you should think that with 90 % probability you are in a blue cubicle .
Let s call this idea , that you should reason as if you were a random sample from the set of all observers , the self - sampling assumption .
Suppose everyone accepts the self - sampling assumption and everyone has to bet on whether they are in a blue or red cubicle .
Then 90 % of all persons will win their bets and 10 % will lose .
Suppose , on the other hand , that the self - sampling assumption is rejected and people think that one is no more likely to be in a blue cubicle ; so they bet by flipping a coin .
Then , on average , 50 % of the people will win and 50 % will lose . 
The rational thing to do seems to be to accept the self - sampling assumption , at least in this case .
Step II
Now we modify the thought experiment a bit .
We still have the hundred cubicles but this time they are not painted blue or red .
Instead they are numbered from 1 to 100 .
The numbers are painted on the outside .
Then a fair coin is tossed ( by God perhaps ) .
If the coin falls heads , one person is created in each cubicle .
If the coin falls tails , then persons are only created in cubicles 1 through 10 .
You find yourself in one of the cubicles and are asked to guess whether there are ten or one hundred people ?
Since the number was determined by the flip of a fair coin , and since you havent seen how the coin fell and you dont have any other relevant information , it seems you should believe with 50 % probability that it fell heads ( and thus that there are a hundred people ) .
Moreover , you can use the self - sampling assumption to assess the conditional probability of a number between 1 and 10 being painted on your cubicle given how the coin fell .
For example , conditional on heads , the probability that the number on your cubicle is between 1 and 10 is 1/10 , since one out of ten people will then find themselves there .
Conditional on tails , the probability that you are in number 1 through 10 is one ; for you then know that everybody is in one of those cubicles .
Suppose that you open the door and discover that you are in cubicle number 7 .
Again you are asked , how did the coin fall ?
But now the probability is greater than 50 % that it fell tails .
For what you are observing is given a higher probability on that hypothesis than on the hypothesis that it fell heads .
The precise new probability of tails can be calculated using Bayes theorem .
It is approximately 91 % .
So after finding that you are in cubicle number 7 , you should think that with 91 % probability there are only ten people .
Step III
The last step is to transpose these results to our actual situation here on Earth .
Let s formulate the following two rival hypotheses .
Doom Early : humankind goes extinct in the next century and the total number of humans that will have existed is , say , 200 billion .
Doom Late : humankind survives the next century and goes on to colonize the galaxy ; the total number of humans is , say , 200 trillion .
To simplify the exposition we will consider only these hypotheses .
( Using a more fine - grained partition of the hypothesis space doesnt change the principle although it would give more exact numerical values . )
Doom Early corresponds to there only being ten people in the thought experiment of Step II .
Doom Late corresponds to there being one hundred people .
Corresponding the numbers on the cubicles , we now have the " birth ranks " of human beings  their positions in the human race .
Corresponding to the prior probability ( 50 % ) of the coin falling heads or tails , we now have some prior probability of Doom Soon or Doom Late .
This will be based on our ordinary empirical estimates of potential threats to human survival , such as nuclear or biological warfare , a meteorite destroying the plant , runaway greenhouse effect , self - replicating nanomachines running amok , a breakdown of a metastable vacuum state due to high - energy particle experiments and so on ( presumably there are dangers that we havent yet thought of ) .
Let s say that based on such considerations , you think that there is a 5 % probability of Doom Soon .
The exact number doesnt matter for the structure of the argument .
Finally , corresponding to finding you are in cubicle number 7 we have the fact that you find that your birth rank is about 60 billion ( that s approximately how many humans have lived before you ) .
Just as finding you are in cubicle 7 increased the probability of the coin having fallen tails , so finding you are human number 60 billion gives you reason to think that Doom Soon is more probable than you previously thought .
Exactly how much more probable will depend on the precise numbers you use .
In the present example , the posterior probability of Doom Soon will be very close to one .
You can with near certainty rule out Doom Late .
*
That is the Doomsday argument in a nutshell .
After hearing about it , many people think they know what is wrong with it .
But these objections tend to be mutually incompatible , and often they hinge on some simple misunderstanding .
Be sure to read the literature before feeling too confident that you have a refutation .
If the Doomsday argument is correct , what precisely does it show ?
It doesnt show that there is no point trying to reduce threats to human survival " because were doomed anyway " .
On the contrary , the Doomsday argument could make such efforts seem even more urgent .
Working to reduce the risk that nanotechnology will be abused to destroy intelligent life , for example , would decrease the prior probability of Doom Soon , and this would reduce its posterior probability after taking the Doomsday argument into account ; humankinds life expectancy would go up .
There are also a number of possible " loopholes " or alternative interpretations of what the Doomsday argument shows .
For instance , it turns out that if there are many extraterrestrial civilizations and you interpret the self - sampling assumption as applying equally to all intelligent beings and not exclusively to humans , then another probability shift occurs that exactly counterbalances and cancels the probability shift that the Doomsday argument implies .
Another possible loophole is if there will be infinitely many humans ; its not clear how to apply the self - sampling assumption to the infinite case .
Further , if the human species evolves into some vastly more advanced species fairly soon ( within a century or two ) , maybe through the use of advanced technology , then it is not clear whether these posthumans would be in the same reference class as us , so its not clear how the Doomsday argument should be applied then .
Yet another possibility is if population figures go down dramatically  it would then take much longer before enough humans are been born that your birth rank starts looking surprisingly low .
And finally , it may be that the reference class needs to be relativized so that not all observers , not even all humans , will belong to the same reference class .
The justification for relativizing the reference class would have to come from a general theory of observational selection effects , of which the self - sampling assumption would be only one element .
A theory of observational selection effects - of how to correct for biases that are introduced by the fact that our evidence has been filtered by the precondition that a suitably positioned observer exists to " have " the evidence - would have applications in a number of scientific fields , including cosmology and evolutionary biology .
So although the Doomsday argument contains an interesting idea , it needs to be combined with additional assumptions and principles ( some of which remain to be worked out ) before it can be applied to the real world .
In all likelihood , even when all details are filled in , there will be scope for differing opinions about our future .
Nonetheless , a better understanding of observational selection effects will rule out certain kinds of hypotheses and impose surprising constraints on any coherent theorizing about the future of our species and about the distribution of observers in the universe .

Fractal Fantasies Game : Official Page
" I believe that scientific knowledge has fractal properties , that no matter how much we learn , whatever is left , however small it may seem , is just an infinitely complex as the whole was to start with .
That , I think , is the secret of the Universe . " - Isaac Asimov , I. Asimov
Fractal Fantasies playing board ( degree 2 ) .
Empty locations for pieces denoted by black circles .
[ Rendering by my favorite artist , Teja Krasek ]
Beginners play with only a few nested rectangles , while grand masters play with many recursively positioned rectangles -- like Russian dolls within dolls within dolls .
Tournaments last for days .
The playing board illustrated here is called a " degree 2 " board , because it has two different sizes of rectangles within the large bounding rectangle .
Beginners usually start with a degree 1 board , and grand masters have been known to use a degree 20 board .
One player uses white playing pieces ( like stones ) , the other uses black .
Each player starts with a number of pieces equal to 1 / 2 the number of vertices ( dots ) on the board minus two .
For the board here , each player gets 19 stones .
With alternate moves , the players begin by placing a stone at points on the black dots that are empty .
As they place stones , each player attempts to form a row of three stones along any one of the horizontal sides of any rectangle .
This three - in - a - row assembly of stones is called a Googol .
When all the stones have been placed , players take turns moving a piece to a neighboring vacant space along one of the wiggly or straight connecting lines .
When a player succeeds in forming a Googol ( either during the alternate placement of pieces at the beginning of the game , or during alternate moves along lines to adjacent empty points ) then the player captures any one of the opponent 's pieces on the board and removes it from the board .
In some versions of the game , an opposing stone cannot be taken from an opposing Googol . )
A player loses when he or she no longer has any pieces or cannot make a move .
Mathematicians and philosophers will no doubt spend many years pondering a range of questions , particularly for boards with higher nesting .
Computer programmers will design programs allowing the board to be magnified in different areas permitting the convenient playing at different size scales .
They 'll all wish they had fractal consciousnesses allowing the contemplation of all levels of the game simultaneously .
Many of our friends have spent years of their lives pondering the following questions relating to Fractal Fantasies .
No one has succeeded in answering these questions for games with degree higher than 2 .
Various centers have been established and funded in order to answer the following research questions :
What is the maximum number of pieces which can be on the board without any forming a row ?
Is there a best opening move ?
If the large bounding square has a side one foot in length , and each successive generation of square has a length 1/6 of the previous , what is the total length of lines on the board ?
If a spider were to start anywhere on the board and walk to cover all the lines , what would be the shortest possible route on the board ?
How many positions are possible after one move by each player ?
How large would a degree 100 board have to be in order for the smallest squares to be seen ?
How many playing pieces would be used ?
What length of time would be required to play such a bizarre game ?

For example , Martin Stone from Temple University suggests a distributed version of the game played over the Internet .
He writes , " Imagine a multi-user recursive game server dedicated to the fostering of a greater intuitive understanding of recursive structures and permutations . "
David Kaplan from New York University points out that the game rules for the Fractal Fantasies are similar to a medieval game called Nine Man Morris played on a different playing board .
Paul Miller notes that the Fractal Fantasy Game was discussed at the Boston Chapter of MENSA .
He asks , " Can pieces of a Googol move out and back ( thus forming and reforming the Googol ) ? "
He suggests that the Googol pieces be allowed to move only if there is no other legal move .
Alternatively , if a player moves a piece out of a Googol , he should not be allowed to move it back into the same place on the next turn .
Michael Currin from the University of Natal ( South Africa ) suggests that the game be adapted to allow more than two players .
Finally , Brian Osman , a 15 - year - old from Massachusetts , writes :
I greatly enjoyed your description of the Fractal Fantasies in the March 1993 issue of BYTE magazine .
However , I point out that some of what you said is almost impossible !
I 've calculated the number of rectangles and " spots " for every size board , using the formula : [ 2 ^ ( N+1 ) ] - 1 , where N is the degree of the board .
From this , one can find the number of spots by simply multiplying by 6 .
Once you have this number , divide by two and subtract two to find the number of stones for each player .
You have stated that grand masters have been known to use boards of degree 20 .
I 've checked my calculations repeatedly , and this would require each player start with 6,291,451 stones !
Assuming each opening move ( only those to place your pieces ) took 2 seconds , the players would n't be able to move until 291.2708797 days after they started the game .
Am I missing something , or are your numbers as ludicrous as they seem to me ?
Please do n't take offense at this .
I still found your article very enjoyable .

Guide to a Good Rambling
Ralph van den Berg ( 11 June , 2008 ) Posted by :( 11 June , 2008 )
I thought this might be an interesting topic , now that Ramblings and comments are worth points .
Writing a good Rambling is not that difficult .
All you really need is a topic , and then just type away .
There are a few pointers I can give you that will hopefully get more people to read them .
After all , the reason for the Ramblings is to entertain / enlighten / educate / upset / please / annoy / tickle the minds of the readers .
First of all you should have an attractive title .
The title is usually the only thing the audience sees before they actually get to reading the Rambling .
Make it short , provocative , and interesting enough to encourage people to keep reading .
Long lengthy titles can make people bored .
Keep it concise and to the point , so that the reader knows to an extent what to expect .
Better titles can be a bit mysterious , to make readers curious as to what the actual Rambling contains .
The next step is to make your opening paragraph a bit catchy .
If your title is good enough to get people to start reading , you do n't want to scare them off with a lame beginning .
It 's a good idea to summarize some of the key points , or to elaborate on your mysterious title , to keep the reader curious about what 's to come .
Keep in mind that the first bit of your Rambling ( roughly the first 350 characters ) is often used as a preview .
On the main Ramblings page , for example , you 'll notice that .
For the rest of your Rambling , try to keep the reader interested .
There is always the chance that you 'll bore the hell out of them , and they 'll just give up and they will never see the end of your Rambling .
You can structure a sort of build up to a conclusion , which keeps the " punch line " at the end .
You almost have to metaphorically hold out a carrot on a stick to lead the reader all the way through your Rambling .
Keep the carrot close enough for them to keep motivated , but not too close that they 'll eat it .
Then you wo n't have anything to lead them on anymore .
Also try not to hold it too far away ; that 's when the reader will give up .
It helps to break up your Rambling into paragraphs with breaks in between .
This gives the reader some room to breathe and the Rambling does n't look so threatening as a humongous block of text .
The closing of your Rambling should try to get some involvement from the readers in the form of comments .
You can pose questions , or ask for opinions about particular thoughts you 've presented .
For instance , I will now ask you ( the reader ) if you have more tips about posting good Ramblings , because I 'm sure you know some .
Comments and suggestions are always welcome .
Have a nice day !

It used to be called “ the Jesse Jackson problem ” : Democratic presidential candidates fearing they would lose black votes if they got on Mr. Jackson ’s bad side , given the influence he accrued as a civil rights activist and his history - making races for the White House in 1984 and 1988 .
But if his recent critical comments about Senator Barack Obama prove anything , Democrats and political scientists said Thursday , it is that a Jesse problem these days can actually help a candidate like Mr. Obama  with white voters who have questions about whether Mr. Obama shares their values , and with black voters who see Mr. Jackson as a figure of the past .
Even Mr. Jackson ’s 43 - year - old son , Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois , went beyond repudiation to excoriate him  a poignant reminder that a real generational shift in power and leadership is under way in African - American politics .
Mr. Obama , 46 , has already overshadowed former President Bill Clinton , once a deeply popular figure among black Americans ; if anything , Mr. Obama seems likely to gain political dividends from Mr. Jackson ’s vulgar criticism of him for , as Mr. Jackson put it , “ talking down to black people ” in speeches about the responsibilities of absent black fathers .
“ This moment only reinforces that we have to let the younger guys take the lead in politics , that they know the issues of today , that we live in a far different world than 20 years ago , ” said Michael S. Dukakis , the Democratic presidential nominee in 1988 , when Mr. Jackson won a series of nominating contests , including those in Georgia , Michigan and Virginia .
Back in 1987 during joint congressional hearings into the Iran - Contra affair , Rep. Jack Brooks ( D - TX ) asked Lt. Col .
Oliver North , Reagan ’s point - man on the National Security Council :
Brooks : Colonel North , in your work at the N.S.C. were you not assigned , at one time , to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster ?
Brendan Sullivan [ North ’s counsel ] : Mr. Chairman ?
Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D - HI ) , immediately squelched Brooks ’ inquiry :
Inouye : I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area so may I request that you not touch upon that ?
Brooks : I was particularly concerned , Mr. Chairman , because I read in Miami papers , and several others , that there had been a plan developed , by that same agency , a contingency plan in the event of emergency , that would suspend the American constitution .
And I was deeply concerned about it and wondered if that was an area in which he had worked .
I believe that it was and I wanted to get his confirmation .
Inouye : May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage .
If we wish to get into this , I ’m certain arrangements can be made for an executive session .
Since those 1987 hearings , the “ arrangements ” alluded to by Sen .
Inouye about this prickly topic , Continuity of Government ( COG ) , have yet to result in an open hearing before relevant congressional committees .
Why ?
On March 31 , Peter Dale Scott posted an informative piece on CounterPunch asking that very question .
Why is Congress being sandbagged by the Bush administration on the thorniest of issues : the suspension of the U.S. Constitution and the potential declaration of martial law in the event of a “ catastrophic national emergency . ”
Scott writes ,
In August 2007 , Congressman Peter DeFazio , a member of the House Homeland Security Committee , told the House that he and the rest of his Committee had been barred from reviewing parts of National Security Presidential Directive 51 , the White House supersecret plans to implement so - called “ Continuity of Government ” in the event of a mass terror attack or natural disaster .
While it is certainly a reasonable proposition to most citizens that the federal government should be prepared for disasters , man-made or otherwise , throughout its history COG has been tainted by its proximity to repressive police measures directed against the population ( viewed as a hostile force to be “ contained ” ) , up to , and including the use of the bluntest of instruments : martial law .
Yet the Bush administration , driven by its desire to maximize power within the Executive branch , has used COG as a cover for creating a “ post - Constitutional ” police state .
After the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the White House moved quickly .
John C. Yoo , a Bush appointee in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) , wrote a 20 - page response to an inquiry sent to the office by White House Counsel Timothy E. Flanigan .
A Federalist Society veteran of the 2000 Florida recount battle that ended when the Supreme Court handed the presidency to Bush , Flanigan sought the OLC ’s advice on “ the legality of the use of military force to prevent or deter terrorist activity inside the United States , ” according to the New York Times .
Yoo responded how the Constitution ’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure might apply if the military used “ deadly force in a manner that endangered the lives of United States citizens . ”
Times reporter Tim Golden wrote :
Mr. Yoo listed an inventory of possible operations : shooting down a civilian airliner hijacked by terrorists ; setting up military checkpoints inside an American city ; employing surveillance methods more sophisticated than those available to law enforcement ; or using military forces “ to raid or attack dwellings where terrorists were thought to be , despite risks that third parties could be killed or injured by exchanges of fire . ”
It was all the ammunition the administration needed .
Yoo ’s memorandum handed the Executive branch virtual carte blanche for its “ Terrorist Surveillance Program , ” the Bush regime ’s odious “ public - private partnership ” amongst telecom corporations and the National Security Agency ’s ( NSA ) illegal monitoring of Americans ’ electronic communications .
Golden went on to report ,
Mr. Yoo noted that those actions could raise constitutional issues , but said that in the face of devastating terrorist attacks , “ the government may be justified in taking measures which in less troubled conditions could be seen as infringements of individual liberties . ”
If the president decided the threat justified deploying the military inside the country , he wrote , then “ we think that the Fourth Amendment should be no more relevant than it would be in cases of invasion or insurrection . ”
Could such “ infringements of individual liberties ” include the preventative detention of “ illegal immigrants , ” political enemies , or others deemed “ suspect ” by a “ Unitary Executive Theory ” that alleges the president possesses virtually unlimited power as “ commander - in - chief ” during a “ time of war ” ?
According to Bush regime acolytes , the answer apparently is “ yes . ”
Subsequent reporting last week by the Washington Post , after reviewing the declassified version of Yoo ’s memo confirm this analysis .
In early 2006 , Peter Dale Scott uncovered a $ 385 million open - ended government contract awarded a Halliburton subsidiary , KBR , from the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to provide “ temporary detention and processing capabilities . ”
Scott wrote ,
The contract — announced Jan. 24 by the engineering and construction firm KBR — calls for preparing for “ an emergency influx of immigrants , or to support the rapid development of new programs ” in the event of other emergencies , such as “ a natural disaster . ”
The release offered no details about where Halliburton was to build these facilities , or when .
…
After 9/11 , new martial law plans began to surface similar to those of FEMA in the 1980s .
In January 2002 the Pentagon submitted a proposal for deploying troops on American streets .
One month later John Brinkerhoff , the author of the 1982 FEMA memo , published an article arguing for the legality of using U.S. troops for purposes of domestic security .
The DHS contract to KBR followed the April 2002 creation of the Pentagon ’s Northern Command ( NORTHCOM ) , specifically empowered for domestic U.S. military operations .
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called this “ the most sweeping set of changes since the unified command system was set up in 1946 . ”
Scott , citing Rumsfeld ’s announcement , said that NORTHCOM is responsible for “ homeland defense and also serves as head of the North American Aerospace Defense Command ( NORAD ) ….
He will command U.S. forces that operate within the United States in support of civil authorities .
The command will provide civil support not only in response to attacks , but for natural disasters . ”
But state moves to entangle the American people in a seemingly inextricable web of repressive measures do n’t stop there .
In a follow - up article on KBR detention camp contracts , Scott described how the construction of these facilities are part of a long - term DHS plan titled ENDGAME , whose goal is the “ removal ” of “ all removable aliens ” and “ potential terrorists . ”
According to the Department of Homeland Security ,
Endgame is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) , Office of Detention and Removal ( DRO ) multi- year strategic enforcement plan .
It stresses the effective and efficient execution of the critical service DRO provides its partners and stakeholders to enforce the nation ’s immigration and naturalization laws .
The DRO strategic plan sets in motion a cohesive enforcement program with a ten - year time horizon that will build the capacity to “ remove all removable aliens , ” eliminate the backlog of unexecuted final order removal cases , and realize its vision .
…
Detention can be affected by unforeseen events occurring in other countries , such as natural disasters ( i.e. , earthquakes , hurricanes , etc. ) , war , and economic / political crises .
These events can produce a “ shock ” to DRO detention .
Such shocks can produce large numbers of illegal aliens , additional detention needs , and the inability to remove aliens from the U.S. back to countries in crisis .
Though these immigration emergencies are relatively short - term in nature , they can have a drastic and enduring impact on available detention space .
Commenting on ENDGAME , Scott wrote ,
Significantly , both the KBR contract and the ENDGAME plan are open - ended .
The contract calls for a response to “ an emergency influx of immigrants , or to support the rapid development of new programs ” in the event of other emergencies , such as “ a natural disaster . ”
“ New programs ” is of course a term with no precise limitation .
So , in the current administration , is ENDGAME ’s goal of removing “ potential terrorists . ”
It is relevant that in 2002 , Attorney General John Ashcroft announced his desire to see camps for U.S. citizens deemed to be “ enemy combatants . ”
On Feb. 17 of this year , in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations , Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld spoke of the harm being done to the country ’s security , not just by the enemy , but also by what he called “ news informers ” who needed to be combated in “ a contest of wills . ”
Two days earlier , citing speeches critical of Bush by Al Gore , John Kerry , and Howard Dean , conservative columnist Ben Shapiro called for “ legislation to prosecute such sedition . ”
But is the DHS ’ ENDGAME “ only ” a program for “ removing all removable aliens ” ?
Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle , environmental activist Lewis Seiler and former congressman Dan Hamburg ponder the real questions posed by such antidemocratic initiatives :
What kind of “ new programs ” require the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the union with the capacity to house perhaps millions of people ?
Sect. 1042 of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , “ Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies , ” gives the executive the power to invoke martial law .
For the first time in more than a century , the president is now authorized to use the military in response to “ a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , a terrorist attack or any other condition in which the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order . ”
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , rammed through Congress just before the 2006 midterm elections , allows for the indefinite imprisonment of anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on a list of “ terrorist ” organizations , or who speaks out against the government ’s policies .
The law calls for secret trials for citizens and noncitizens alike .
While the deployment of NORTHCOM and ENDGAME scenarios are singular features of the Bush administration ’s power - grab following the 9/11 attacks , its repressive architecture was built upon already - existing plans for suspending the Constitution and implementing a martial law regime .
During the urban rebellions of the 1960s and 1970s , the Pentagon drew up a series of blueprints for precisely those contingencies .
Variously code- named “ Cable Splicer ” and “ Garden Plot , ” the U.S. military and local police who served as Pentagon auxiliaries ( falling under the purview of the military ’s chain of command ) performed a series of exercises that envisioned the suspension of civil liberties , the rounding up of dissidents and their incarceration in detention camps for the duration of an ( unspecified ) “ crisis . ”
During the 1980s , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) was designated the lead agency that would implement Ronald Reagan ’s 1988 Executive Order 12656 , stating that COG procedures come into play in the event of “ any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological emergency , or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . ”
Some aspects of Reagan ’s Rex - 84 “ emergency preparedness ” operations advocated rounding up and detaining some 400,000 “ refugees , ” in the context , as Peter Dale Scott reported , of “ ‘ uncontrolled population movements ’ over the Mexican border into the United States . ”
Since then , but especially in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , the Pentagon has continuously updated–and trained for –their implementation .
Indeed , one can view the creation of NORTHCOM as perhaps the single most important “ mission critical ” link driving current COG planning .
According to researcher Frank Morales ,
Training under [ U.S. Army Field Manual ] FM 19 - 15 / Garden
Plot must be “ continuous ” and “ must develop personnel who are able to perform distasteful and dangerous duties with discipline and objectivity . ”
Dangerous to the local citizenry given that “ every member of the control force must be trained to use his weapon and special equipment ( including ) riot batons , riot control agent dispersers and CS grenades , grenade launchers , shotguns , sniper rifles , cameras , portable videotape recorders , portable public address systems , night illumination devices , fire fighting apparatus , grappling hooks , ladders , ropes , bulldozers , Army aircraft , armored personnel carriers , and roadblock and barricade materials . ”
COG is predicated on the assumption that the military will act as a “ force - multiplier ” for local law enforcement , which in this age of militarized policing are already highly - repressive organizations replete with military - grade firepower , but also “ less than lethal ” weaponry , equipment and “ special operations ” units better - suited for the battlefield than an urban setting in a typical American city .
While September 11 may have been the “ catastrophic and catalyzing event , ” referenced by the now - defunct Project for a New American Century , COG planning has been in the works for decades , as were Pentagon blueprints for the invasion and occupation of Central Asia and the Middle East .
Predating 9/11 , COG is viewed by elite policy planners as an instrument for the continuity of a repressive national security state , one targeting first and foremost , the American people .
COG , as an instrumentality for containing the internal threat , is predicated on defending the capitalist mode of production and the political / social relations of class society as it enters a period of profound crisis .
In terms of a repressive discourse , NORTHCOM , under Public Law 109 - 364 , or the “ John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 ” ( H.R. 5122 ) ( 2 ) , signed into law by president Bush on October 17 , 2006 , allows the chief executive to declare a “ public emergency ” and station troops anywhere in the U.S .
The law also permits the president to usurp control of state - based national guard units , even without the consent of the governor or local authorities in the affected region , to “ suppress public disorder . ”
Frank Morales , exposing the onerous nature of the law writes ,
President Bush seized this unprecedented power on the very same day that he signed the equally odious Military Commissions Act of 2006 .
In a sense , the two laws complement one another .
One allows for torture and detention abroad , while the other seeks to enforce acquiescence at home , preparing to order the military onto the streets of America .
Remember , the term for putting an area under military law enforcement control is precise ; the term is “ martial law . ” …
The law also facilitates militarized police round - ups and detention of protesters , so called “ illegal aliens , ” “ potential terrorists ” and other “ undesirables ” for detention in facilities already contracted for and under construction by Halliburton .
That ’s right .
Under the cover of a trumped - up “ immigration emergency ” and the frenzied militarization of the southern border , detention camps are being constructed right under our noses , camps designed for anyone who resists the foreign and domestic agenda of the Bush administration .
…
The historic and ominous re-writing of the Insurrection Act , accomplished in the dead of night , which gives Bush the legal authority to declare martial law , is now an accomplished fact .
In the absence of massive public opposition to existing martial law plans by the Bush regime or future U.S. administrations –Democratic as well as Republican –the prospect of America continuing as a free and open society is a mirage at best .

{ Ed Note :
All the way off topic , and so long it can't help but hijack the thread .
I copied it and am mailing it back to you so you can use it when there is an open thread , or on your own blog and can just link us to it .
-- 99 } { Ed Note : Oh , well , fine .
Brad was at a pitstop with broadband and chose to answer you , so I 'm putting it back in for you .
-- 99} Nice , this is a perfect thread for me to post on .
Claims have been made , falsely , that BradBlog became an internet force because of its coverage of the Clinton Curtis dog story .
There was AnonymousArmy at DailyKos running his mouth off about it being a planted story .
AA was also well - known for being right in the middle of the scripted election integrity forum rubbish .
There was also a " Fintan Dunne " who took the same angle .
Now the Clinton dog story is but one story .
And my condolensces go to Mr. Curtis , albeit years later .
There are other strange happenings on the internet which are tough to put into words .
There was the Jason Leopold thing , with saying Bush and Cheney had been indicted .
There 's this Wayne Madsen character who strangely enough gets linked to by Raw Story .
There is much more I could say as regards to other internet personalities who are linked .
In short , there has been a deliberate attempt to stymie freedom of association on the internet by raising noise to signal ratios .
There was someone named ~A who had a blog called Watching the Watchers .
He linked to many progressive sites including Brad 's Velvet Revolution and Raw Story .
Here is a wayback machine article written by ~ A called My personal experience with Bev Harris ' Caustic Personality .
If this link ever gets scrubbed , the paper was screenshot and is available at my humble forum .
To quote ~A : She is doing good work , and she is a patriot , do n't get me wrong .
I like what she 's doing , but the more I find out about her and the more I have to deal in the same space as her ( I 'm doing the fifty states voting irregularity research , not with her ) , the more I just do n't think she 's the right person to be doing what she 's doing .
Fifty state voting irregularity research ?
Was that like the work Steven Hertzberg did for his Votewatch campaign ?
Hertzberg was a prolific poster at " Fintan Dunne 's " forum .
" Fintan " has called Brad a CIA fake .
He has called Bev Harris a 9/11 CIA rat !
And here is where things get really strange .
One of ~A 's bloggers was Ron Brynaert , now executive editor of Raw Story .
Ron 's claim to fame is that he was a Jeff Gannon scholar .
I smell a rat , and I do n't think it 's Bev Harris .
So Ron Brynaert of Raw Story , why do n't you tell us what you know about ~A and his fifty state voting irregularity research which sounds suspiciously like Hertzberg 's Votewatch .
~A actually made a few posts a long time ago to BradBlogToo .
Maybe there is a way to figure this thing out .
So how ' bout it Brad , any comments ?
You do n't find this at all strange ?

To " quickly " answer Soc 's question , since I saw it before 99 has removed it , no , I do n't find any of the stuff you mentioned strange .
I do find some of it inaccurate , however , and as previously , always welcome you to e-mail me personally with any questions that I may be able to answer prior to posting unsupported , speculative stuff about folks .
Of the items you mentioned that I remember : I know " ~A " personally , as he used to work as an editor for RAW STORY while running Watching the Watchers .
He was very good at covering election fraud related issues while at RAW and over at WtW .
He is most definitely * not* Steven Hertzberg .
Jason Liepold did not report that " Bush and Cheney were indicted , " as you mentioned .
He reported that a source told him that a sealed ( vs. sealed ) indictment had been filed for Karl Rove .
Despite the smears against Jason , I 've found nothing to prove that he was wrong in his reporting .
To this case , that file ( which had been from Fitzgerald 's grand jury and was unusual for having both sides sealed ) has never been unsealed .
I would not link up to Wayne Madsen in anyway , as I find him to be exceedingly irresponsible , frequently wrong , and almost always working from unnamed " sources " .
The fact that an editor at RAW did so recently ( do n't know what story ) , is hardly a reason to suspect " something funny going on at RAW " .
Again , I know most of the folks who run the site * very * well , and they are all aces .
It 's fine to have suspicions , to be skeptical , or whatever .
That , as a matter of fact , is what I am " for a living " .
But it 's also nice to check what facts you can before offering random doubts about someone into the blogosphere .
At least when some of those doubts could likely be cleared up very quickly with a moderate amount of effort prior to posting unsubstantiated " questions " .
Now if you have questions about * me* , as I 've seen you post before , well , there 's little I can do to ease your worries .
If I 'm a " bad guy " then no matter what I say wo n't change your mind about that .
As you know , you are always welcome to touch base with me privately * first * ( as you have done before ) before risking smearing someone unwarranted here .
It 's always appreciated .
As is avoiding hijacking threads , which I presume is the reason 99 removed your post .
NOTE : I might not have done so , but she has clearance to monitor and moderate the comments section as she feels necessary and useful , and I support her in her volunteer efforts to do so .
She even takes unwarranted personal attacks from commenters ( which would not be allowed against other commenters ) , since she has that slight " bully pulpit " .
Though I commend her for taking it as well as she does , as many times as such attacks come at her completely unwarranted , and without substance in my opinion .
Hope that clears up your concerns , Soc .
If not , let me know via email if you wish .
Though please note I 'm on the road and not much online for the next couple weeks , so missing a lot of incoming mail of late .

Hi Brad , thanks for the information .
I do n't think I was making any accusations .
Some questions do remain .
What was that fifty state voting irregularity study ?
Why does ~A refer to election fraud as vote fraud ?
Why is Raw Story linking to Madsen ?
Sorry for getting that indictment story wrong .
Wow .
So it 's true that there were sealed indictments against Karl Rove ?
Where is the proof ?
I do n't see anything except truthout.org as a source .
Sorry for any excessive " tweaking . "

Just wanted to say I was there as well .
Clint did a fine job of focusing on how machines could be rigged on both a theoretical and practical basis .
What the legislators seemed unable to wrap their heads around was the unbelievable number of ways a system could be pre-rigged for disaster by vendors or semi-competent geeks within the the elections offices .
They kept wanting to know specific ways of rigging systems so that loopholes could be closed ... which is much like asked how to prevent a master mechanic from screwing with your car late at night while it 's parked out in front of your house .
I focused on how the certification processes had broken .
As one example , paragraph 77 c of the William Singer complaint contains specific , verifiable claims as to a major Hart software module being withheld from cert .
The Hart people spent had spent some time disparaging Singer as " disgruntled " and the like ; one of my opening points was that regardless of Singer 's motives or anything else , the objective claims he made should have been looked at either by the TX SecState 's office or the EAC .
The raw fact that they had n't is evidence of major negligence .
I then showed how two other vendors gamed cert by withholding software modules : Diebold 's WinCE touchscreen software and Sequoia 's " BPS " .
I discussed how AVS had withheld serious hardware modifications in the " Winvote " , the EAC had ignored my complaints ( complete with pictures that had been posted to BBV by AVS employees ) and how the EAC had blown me off until months later the new iBeta test lab blew the whistle on AVS over the same issue , destroying the company .
It 's nice that this blatant fraud was finally caught , it 's a fiasco that a citizen complaint to this effect was ignored .
Finally , I explained how public records reviews in Wharton County TX is showing that ES&S iVotronic machines are n't doing basic math correctly - I had reviewed audit logs for Debra Medina , party chair in Wharton County ( oh yeah : REPUBLICAN party chair ! ) .
And lest they think this was conspiracy theory material , you should have seen them groan when I pulled up the cert report by one of the TX state examiners of the ES&S system in Jan. ' 07 : Katherine Cole ( lawyer for the TX AG's office ) had noticed all the way back then that the machine could n't add right in a fashion real similar to Wharton County more recently .
Oooops .
The TX SOS office had rigged the state - level examination such that no one official observer ( six total ) saw the whole process ... each saw parts .
So the vote went down 4 to 2 to certify , when two reported problems that should have barred the machine .
Yeah .
They did n't like that .
I had laid out each company 's documents I 'd be citing on one of each face of a Compiz cube in Linux and spun the cube to get to each .
Freaked 'em out good .
It was also a way of establishing my " geek cred " without having to say anything .
If you do n't know what Compiz and " the cube " are , see also : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0QEySMTtII
It 's a way of having multiple " virtual desktops " and a way of rotating between them with a mouse - drag .
Looks seriously cool .
They needed a good shake - up and that helped .

Jim -
Thanks for that report !
Much appreciated .
When I learned that you and Clint and Bruce Funk and others would be there , I felt much better about my not being able to !
Socrates -
To answer your questions , which again , would be better appreciated via private email , so as not to hijack threads : I do n't think I was making any accusations .
Some questions do remain .
When you toss around names of perfectly innocent , decent , hard working folks , suggesting they might somehow be bad guys ( even though no evidence , other than your suspicions , exist ) you end up making accusations and smearing folks who should n't be .
If you 've got the goods , that 's one thing .
If you 're merely curious and have yet to do full due - dilligence , that 's another matter entirely .
What was that fifty state voting irregularity study ?
I do n't recall specifically , but as he was doing a lot of coverage of all of the problems that occured in ' 04 , right after the election ( when almost everyone else in the world was ignoring what had happened ! ) he was probably referring to exactly that .
Thank god he and RAW were there to join me in covering what almost nobody else at the time would dare !
Why does ~A refer to election fraud as vote fraud ?
For one : " Vote fraud " is technically correct , unlike " voter fraud " .
Eg. Clint uses " vote fraud " all the time , even though it drives me crazy since it 's so close to " voter fraud " .
For another , the GOP 's phony " voter fraud " strategy had not become clearly known until Spring of ' 05 , or so , when I outed Thor Hearne and the ACVR scam .
It took some time thereafter before people began to understand the diff between " voter fraud " and " election fraud " .
Even now , many well - meaning folks do n't know the difference , which is what makes the GOP scam so effective .
In and of itself , references to " vote fraud " ( or even " voter fraud " ) way back then mean absolutely nothing .
Which I would have explained to you via email before you smeared ~A by inference .
Why is Raw Story linking to Madsen ?
I already spoke to that .
I guess whoever the editor was who linked up to it , did n't understand that he 's a bad source .
They have many editors there , hire new ones all the time , and many learn things as they go .
Many who do n't know better believe Madsen to be credible .
So again , linking to him , in and of itself , means nothing as far as I 'm concerned .
So it 's true that there were sealed indictments against Karl Rove ?
Where is the proof ?
I do n't see anything except truthout.org as a source .
No , it 's true that there was an unusual Sealed v. Sealed case from Fitzgerald 's grand jury , and it's true that Leopold 's source told him that it was a Rove indictment .
That 's about all there was to the story at the time , and as Fitzgerald could n't speak about the sealed case , and as it became unsealed ( right around the moment that Rove was said to have cut a deal with Fitzgerald ) , the names of that indictment remain unknown .
Leopold , in my opinion , was inappropriately smeared in the bargain by both the Right and a huge portion of the supposedly - Progressive blogosphere .
There is still no evidence one way or another if he had the story right or wrong , and yet , the tarring has been very damaging to his work and reputation .
Hope that helps to clarify .
Please note : I 'm traveling so can't read every comment .
Even when I 'm home I can't always do so , but it 's even worse now .
Thus , please forgive any unanswered comments as I simply can't read and / or reply to every one of them .

I 'm sorry I " hijacked " your thread .
~ A actually did use the phrase " voter fraud . "
I sell a support our troops ribbon and some others , including a " voter fraud " ribbon .
I have n't smeared anyone .
By making blanket statements that I did , you are smearing me .
I do n't think you are doing it on purpose , but that 's the way it 's coming across , imho .
" fifty state voting irregularity study "
Who refers to covering election fraud in those terms ?
Where are the results of his " study ? "
Which I would have explained to you via email before you smeared ~A by inference .
I did email you and got nothing back .
Bev Harris gets smeared all the time .
You do n't seem too worried about that .
I now see BradBlog for what it is .
There is only free speech here if you post at the end of threads or leave just a few sentences .
And where did I smear Jason Leopold ?
It 's simply the truth that his story was utilized by astroturfers to portray the blogosphere as unreliable .
That 's the same kind of thing that is being done to yourself and others , yes me and many others included , that we are " annoying citizens who get on hobby horses . "
Thank god he and RAW were there to join me in covering what almost nobody else at the time would dare !
Funny how ~A is given credit while Bev Harris , the person he attacked , gets no mention .
This is a no - win situation for me .
If I try to comment in depth , I am hijacking threads .
If I do n't , then newbies and fence - sitters will continue to have no clue about the excessive convolution to be found on the internet , a portion of which is the noise that 's been planted on election fraud forums .
I get the hint .
I 'll go away like Dredd did .
The cards are stacked here .
I should have taken the hint when you showed zero interest in Steven Hertzberg posting at " Fintan Dunne 's " forum or with the deliberate aerosol dispersals going on over our heads .
" Dunne " is the one who called you out as a fake .
He also called Bev Harris a 9/11 CIA rat .
And Steven Hertzberg was his # 1 poster for quite a while .
If this post can remain , I 'd appreciate it .
You 'll never have to deal with me again .
I 'm sorry , but there is something missing at BradBlog .
And with you making apologies for Raw Story publishing Madsen , that is a sign to me to leave this place .

Do n't know how " the cards are stacked here " , when you 've commented on almost every thread for months on just about any topic you 've wanted to .
But if you want to make me , us ( BRAD BLOG ) into a " bad guy " too , I can't stop you any more than I could stop crazy Fintan Dunne , or answer to every nut case and / or actual bad guy out there on the Internet who wants to take shots at me or Bev or anybody else .
If I did , or if I tried , I 'd never have a moment to report on things that actually matter which , as you may or may not realize , takes an * extraordinary * amount of time and focus .
And even then , I fail miserably to cover all that I would like to , in the depth that I would like to .
All while bringing in almost no money to pay rent and buy food each month .
Not sure what else you 'd like from me , Soc , but I continue to do the best that I can .
And where it's not enough , I apologize , even if it 's all I have to give .

For what it 's worth , I think you 're for real .
I am not out to slander anyone .
I wish only to throw people under the bus who deserve it .
I believe in sunshine .
When I 've noticed odd things on the internet , I 've taken screenshots and put it out in public for consideration .
Thanks for letting me post on your blog .
It enabled me to back John Dean 's {not the famous one} uncovering of a sophisticated campaign to turn election integrity activists into " tinfoil hatters " and " grifters . "
I realise there are limitations to the internet as regards to communication .
There is also an existential element to our individual perspectives .
It can be very difficult , if not impossible at times , to reach consensus .
I do n't think " Fintan Dunne " is crazy .
I think he is a paid disinfo agent .
I doubt there is even a person with that name .
I will just say one last time that Fintan Dunne has called Beverly Harris a CIA 9/11 rat .
He also had an " article " in which he smeared you as being propped up as a leading election integrity voice solely because of your exclusive Clint Curtis coverage around the time when his dog got killed .
Strangely enough , AnonymousArmy at DailyKos ran with the same schtick .
The reason I ended up at your place was because I found out about Steven Hertzberg .
As folks are probably aware of by now , he was a prolific poster with Dunne and even did interviews with him , albeit anonymously .
He was exposed and proven to be " Navari " by a few others , then I took the ball and ran with it .
People like myself and Dredd , imho , simply get frustrated by our inability to get feedback on our amateur sleuth findings .
I think it is quite telling that Robert Hertzberg was one of the first politicians to push for funding of the electronic machines after the 2000 debacle .
Another reason why I am feeling especially down of late is because Keith Olbermann appears to be just another poser .
Folks are probably aware by now of his beatdown by Glenn Greenwald .
Finally , I am very bitter that no action is being taken concerning the deliberate tampering of our troposphere by " weather mitigation " aircraft .
You gave me the impression that I might be able to guest blog on it .
I thought it would be a good thing for accountability and exposure to have a " chemtrails " article on your forum .
Chemtrails have been proven real , just like the stealing of elections has also been established as being more likely than not the truth .
I think the one thing that bonds all the BradBlog people , from yourself to even the good lurkers , is that we all have a deep aversion to injustice .
I believe that the primary goal of the disinfo astroturf on the net is to make us all feel helpless and incapable of making a difference .
Everything gets turned into noise and enigmas .
I apologise for any discomfort I may have caused .
That was not my intention .
Perhaps I am a bit in over my head .
Take care and peace .

Nearly all degree courses in video gaming at British universities leave graduates unfit to work in the industry , campaigners warned today .
Leading figures in the video games industry , which is worth about £ 500 m to the economy each year , are unhappy with the 95 % of degree courses at UK universities that are unaccredited and fail to equip graduates with the necessary skills to build a career in the industry .
A new campaign - Games Up ? - which is backed by most of the UK 's gaming companies , urges the government to address a serious skills shortage in the sector that could see the industry move abroad to find more talent .
Of the 81 universities in the UK offering video gaming - related degrees , only four are accredited by Skillset , the sector skills council for creative media .
It accredits courses that ensure students are grounded in the core skills needed by the industry , such as programming , computer science and art .
Many students also undertake work placements , team - based projects and internships within industry to get experience at studios .
Skillset wants more universities to join the scheme to make sure graduates are properly recognised and supported by industry .
Industry research indicates graduates from accredited courses are more than three times as likely to get a job in the industry on completion of their course as graduates from other games courses .
The UK studio sector is facing a serious recruitment crisis , compounded by the decline in the number of maths , physics and computer science graduates , the campaigners warned .
They are calling on ministers to help industry create centres of excellence - similar to the model of government support for the London Film School - to improve standards of education , training and qualifications and to promote how important industry accreditation is for existing games courses .
They also recommend government - assisted work placements for games , maths , physics and computer science undergraduates .
David Braben , the chairman of Frontier Developments and campaign spokesman , said : " The games development sector is a jewel in the crown of the UK economy , made up of a large number of creative and highly - skilled people .
" However , we are facing a serious decline in the quality of graduates looking to enter the industry .
The dearth of maths , physics and computer science graduates is hitting us hard along with other core UK industries .
" The problem is compounded by the quality of so called specialist games degree courses ; 95 % of video gaming degrees are simply not fit for purpose .
" Without some sort of common standard , like Skillset accreditation , these degrees are a waste of time for all concerned . "
Jamie Macdonald , the vice - president of Worldwide Studios , Sony Computer Entertainment Europe , said : " We want to work with government to help equip our graduates with the skills they need to thrive in one of the most dynamic and profitable industries in the world .
" We are willing to work closely to support centres of excellence as finishing schools for graduates and provide real - world work experience via a government - assisted internship programme .
" We can also play a vital role in enticing younger students to persist with so - called " harder " subjects such as maths and science by showing that aspirational careers in video gaming are achievable . "
Over the past two years , UK - made games have generated nearly £ 4bn globally .
The studio sector employs nearly 10,000 staff in the UK : 4,200 work at the country 's 163 independent developers , 4,500 work for the 45 publishers , and the remainder are freelancers or work in services or technology companies .
It ’s being reported that Apple is offering a $ 44 dollar credit to Canadian iPod owners , which will total $ 3.54 million dollars .
The offer is being presented to settle a lawsuit over the battery life of iPods .
Owners of first , second , or third generation iPods who purchased their units before June 24 , 2004 are eligible for the credit .
Two lawsuits , one filed in Montreal , and another filed in Toronto , each claim that they rechargeable batteries in the devices died after only 3 hours of use , even though Apple advertised as much as 8 hours of use between charges .
As many as 80,000 Canadians could be eligible for a credit .
If you think you might be one of them , you can find more information right here .
By Mark Kinver
Science and nature reporter , BBC News
Santos and his band Massukos have performed around the world A Mozambican musician who campaigns for clean water and sanitation has been awarded a top environmental prize .
Feliciano dos Santos won a Goldman Environmental Prize for using his music star status to raise awareness about health , water and HIV / Aids issues .
The UN says diarrhoeal diseases kill an estimated 1.8 million people each year .
Santos will receive his award , described as the Nobel Prize of grassroots environmentalism , on Monday at a ceremony in San Francisco , US .
" I started using music when I realised that it was a good way to send a message and bring people together , " Santos told BBC News .
" Even when you play a loud radio , people are drawn to it .
Even when it plays sounds that are not about dirty water , they just want to listen to the sounds .
" I realised that music had this power , so for this reason we thought it would be good to mix it with what we wanted to achieve . "
Power of music
The 43 - year - old 's motivation was fired when he was young because he grew up in the northern province of Niassa surrounded by poor sanitation and dirty water .
Massukos ' song about latrines helps raise awareness among villagers
In 1992 , shortly after he had formed his band called Massukos , Unicef was running a project to promote slab latrines .
" We decided to release a little song to promote the slabs .
The lyrics were : ' Mothers , listen to me ; grandmothers , listen to me , she does n't listen to me .
The slab is so good ; the slab is easy to clean ' . "
As a result of the song , the demand for the latrines soared and the project struggled to cope with the number of people who wanted to get hold of one .
The success of the song prompted Unicef to approach the band to see if they would be interested in working for the project .
" I said no because we thought instead of doing this for Unicef , why not do this as a double project and use music to promote hygiene and sanitation , " Santos recalled .
Santos says music gets his message across while people enjoy themselves
In 1996 , he set up his own NGO called Estamos , which encouraged villagers in Niassa to improve their living conditions through better sanitation .
By using music , the group sang about ways to keep a clean , healthy home ; and helped people understand how poor sanitation had an impact on things like water and food supplies .
Estamos promoted low - cost , environmentally friendly sanitation that composted human waste into fertiliser .
Families that used the system reported fewer diseases , while the soil produced enough crops to not only feed everyone but left a small surplus that could be sold .
Hand wringing Wanting to build on the success , Santos explained how he seized opportunities to get his message across to a wider audience , even if it meant disregarding official protocol .
Poor sanitation affects water supplies , which in turn spreads diseases " A few years ago , I was trying to launch a ' wash your hands ' campaign .
" I sent a letter to the president to ask him , when he visited my province , if he would wash his hands and tell others to wash their hands too to have good health .
" But I received an official letter of rejection , so I sent more letters but they were rejected , too . "
Eventually , Santos had a chance to put his request directly to the president himself when the band performed at an official dinner .
" I just told him that I did not want any money , I just wanted him to wash his hands , " he explained .
" The guys who rejected my letters were also there and they just glared at me .
But I had the microphone , so no - one could stop me that time ! "
Crop harvests have increased where farmers have used human compost
His efforts were rewarded because the country 's prime minister came to his province to launch the nationwide awareness scheme .
He said that he even managed to persuade the nation 's top politician to sing one of his songs .
" The song contained the line ' wash , wash your hands ' , and the prime minister said to the people that if they wanted good health then they should listen to the lyrics ; I was so proud . "
Modestly , Santos said the $ 150,000 ( £ 75,000 ) prize money would not change his life but it would help focus attention on what was happening on the ground in Mozambique and Africa .
" It shows that even if you live in poor places , such as Niassa , you can have an influence on the world .
" Let 's not talk about the money , let 's do things that can change the world .
Do n't think about awards , think about quality of life .

What are these ?
Hundreds of thousands of people moved from farms to factories .
In 1870 , fewer than 8 percent of America 's adult population worked in a mill and only one in five lived in a place with 8,000 or more inhabitants ; a half century later , almost a third were in factories and almost a half lived in cities .
During this tumultuous span of time , New York City 's population swelled fourfold ; Chicago became ten times its former size .
In the 1870s , 280,000 immigrants entered the United States each year .
In the 1880s , 5.5 million came ; in the 1890s , another 4 million .
By the first decade of the twentieth century , the flow of immigrants , most of them destitute when they arrived , rose to a million a year .
According to a 1908 government study , almost three - fifths of the wage earners in principal branches of American industry had been born abroad .
Immigrants then constituted a higher percentage of the total American workforce than they would a hundred years hence .
As America and every other manufacturing nation began scouring more backward regions of the globe for potential markets , the term " imperialism " entered common speech .
Teddy Roosevelt asserted America 's imperial destiny in Latin America .
" Territorial expansion , " explained an official of the United States State Department in 1900 , " is but the by - product of the expansion of commerce . "
Britain and Germany equated their economic prowess with their nations ' global spheres of influence .
The British economist J. A. Hobson dourly predicted the logical end - point of such competition : Businessmen , he warned , opt for war when they have exhausted their home markets .
Like John Maynard Keynes three decades later , Hobson urged instead that advanced nations increase their domestic markets by making more of their citizens rich enough to buy domestically produced goods .
" If apportionment of incomes were such as to evoke no excessive saving , full constant employment for capital and labor would be furnished at home . "
But the world war Hobson feared would occur before enough citizens had the wherewithal to buy a substantial portion of what they produced .
In the first decades of the twentieth century , productivity again surged .
Sweatshops and mills were replaced by large manufacturing plants , inspired by Frederick Winslow Taylor 's new theories of " scientific management , " which broke down every factory job into highly specialized and repetitive steps .
Henry Ford 's assembly line became the model .
Not only could workers positioned along the line produce more cars in a shorter time but production could be concentrated in a few giant factories and materials could be bought in bulk at great savings .
In 1909 , Ford produced 10,607 cars ; in 1913 , 168,000 ; the following year , 248,000 .
By the beginning of World War I , much of American industry had consolidated into giant firms whose names became almost synonymous with America - Ford Motor , U.S. Steel , American Telephone & Telegraph , United States Rubber , National Biscuit , American Can , the Aluminum Company of America , General Electric , General Motors , and Rockefeller 's Standard Oil .
The size of such enterprises became an almost impregnable barrier to entry .
They dominated the American , and much of the world 's , economy for most of the twentieth century .
Of the Fortune 500 largest corporations in 1994 , more than half were founded between 1880 and 1930 .
A far smaller portion was founded during the long stable period between 1945 and 1975 , an important fact to bear in mind as the story unfolds .

I have received the following e-mail from Alex Kozinski ’s wife :
Mr. Frey :
My name is Marcy Tiffany .
I have been married to Alex Kozinski for over thirty years and we have raised three sons together .
First , let me thank you for making the effort to discover the truth about what happened , and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the stories that have been circulating about Alex .
Turning to the facts of the matter , the LA Times story , authored by Scott Glover , is riddled with half - truths , gross mischaracterizations and outright lies .
One significant mischaracterization is that Alex was maintaining some kind of “ website ” to which he posted pornographic material .
Obviously , Glover ’s use of the word “ website ” was intended to convey a false image of a carefully designed and maintained graphical interface , with text , pictures , sound and hyperlinks , such as businesses maintain or that individuals can set up on Facebook , rather than a bunch of random files located in one of many folders stored on our family ’s file server .
The “ server ” is actually just another home computer that sits next to my desk in our home office , and that we use to store files , perform back - ups , and route the Internet to the family network .
It has no graphical interface , but if you know the precise location of a file , you can access it either from one of the home computers or remotely .
Using the term “ website ” also gives the impression that Alex was actively aware of all of the material , when , in fact , it had accumulated over a number of years and he did n’t even remember that some of that stuff had been stored there or whether it had been put there by him or one of our sons , who also have access to the server .
Glover also wrote that “ the sexually explicit material on the site was extensive . ”
In fact , of the several hundred items in the “ stuff ” folder , the vast majority was cute , amusing , and not in the least bit sexual in nature .
For example , there ’s a program that lets you build a snowman ( no private parts involved ) .
There ’s a “ stress reliever ” that lets you take a virtual hammer to your desktop ( which I ’ve been using a lot lately ) .
There ’s a picture of freshly painted double - yellow lines that go right over road kill , with the caption “ not my job award . ”
There ’s something called “ cool juggle ” that shows a video of a guy juggling who drops a ball outside the frame and becomes a stick figure when he goes to pick it up .
There are over 300 individual items in the “ stuff ” folder , the vast majority of which are of this nature .
In addition , this folder contains about a half - dozen items that , while humorous , also have some kind of sexual aspect .
Most of these you have already identified on your website .
I would note that in addition to the “ stuff ” folder , which Alex and my sons used to store a hodge - podge of miscellaneous humorous items , we use to the server to store several dozen other folders that contain a lot of personal material .
For example , there is a folder that has copies of papers my kids have written in school .
There is another folder that has family photos .
There is a folder that has copies of articles that Alex has written .
Obviously , the advantage of using a server is so that we can access the material from other computers and also send family members and friends links that will allow them to see a specific item in a folder .
For example , this allows me to send links to my sisters so that they can see the latest photo of our grandchild .
This brings us to another falsity in the LA Times article .
The reporter describes the handful of comic - sexual items as follows : “ the sexually explicit material on the site was extensive . ”
He then includes graphic descriptions that make the material sound like hard - core porn when , in fact , it is more accurately described as raunchy humor .
One especially egregious misrepresentation is that there was a “ video of a half - dressed man cavorting with a sexually aroused farm animal . ”
In subsequent articles , including one in the S.F.
Chronicle , this has been described as a “ bestiality ” video .
In fact , as you reveal on your Blog , it is a widely available video of a man trying to relieve himself a field when he is attacked by a donkey he fights off with one hand while trying to hold up his pants with the other .
I would note that there is a version of this video on YouTube that apparently aired on the Fox channel .
Crude and juvenile , for sure , but not by any stretch of the imagination is it bestiality .
The fact is , Alex is not into porn – he is into funny – and sometimes funny has a sexual character .
The tiny percentage of the material that was sexual in nature was all of a humorous character .
For example , the “ women ’s crotches ” was one of the many “ camel toe ” series that is widely available on the net .
The insidious effect of these misleading descriptions is that even many of those who have come to Alex ’s defense have expressed the view that judges are entitled to look at “ porn ” if they choose , as if that ’s what was really going on here , when it is not .
I think that there is another very important piece of this story that has not received the attention it deserves , and that is the role of Cyrus Sanai .
Cyrus Sanai , a disgruntled attorney / litigant , has widely claimed credit for engineering this smear campaign .
In a 2005 decision , District Judge Zilly USDC Western District Seattle , describes Sanai ’s conduct in a case before him as “ an indescribable abuse of the legal process , unlike anything this Judge has experienced in more than 17 years on the bench and 26 years in private practice : outrageous , disrespectful , and in bad faith . ”
Judge Zilly references a decision by LA Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Grimes where she describes Sanai ’s conduct in a different lawsuit as follows : “ Plaintiff has proliferated needless , baseless pleadings that now occupy about 15 volumes of Superior Court files , not to mention the numerous briefs submitted in the course of the forays into the Court of Appeal and attempts to get before the Supreme Court , and not one pleading appears to have had substantial merit .
The genesis of this lawsuit , and the unwarranted grief and expense it has spawned , are an outrage . ”
Washington State Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Thibodeau also had a run-in with Sanai , who harassed him to the point that he had to recuse himself from Sanai ’s case .
I believe you have a copy of the transcript of that hearing .
( You may want to link to Overlawyered.com which has some additional details about how Sanai ’s conduct ) .
Sanai wrote a vicious attack against the Ninth Circuit panel ( Judges Leavy , Gould and Clifton ) that ruled against his efforts to get the federal court to take jurisdiction over his parents ’ ugly divorce case .
You can read his vitriol at www.ninthcircuit.us ( a website obviously designed so that people trying to find the Ninth Circuit website would stumble on his page instead ) .
Alex , who did not participate in the decision , wrote a public defense of the panel , and thus made himself a target .
Sanai apparently made it his mission to retaliate against Alex .
He managed to access our private computer and copy these files , which he then shopped around to reporters for months .
Finally , he got the LA Times reporter to print the story that set off this firestorm .
Sanai not only admits his involvement in all this – he brags about it .
As to how Sanai accessed our server and was able to rummage through our personal files , frankly we are still trying figure it out .
Apparently , if a person is able to find a link to an item in the “ stuff ” file , and he knows what he is doing , it is possible for him to reverse engineer his way into other items stored in that file without our knowledge or consent .
Although we typically would only send links to friends and family – who would be unlikely to do such a thing and who would certainly not try to injure us with what they found if they did – it is possible that a link to something in the “ stuff ” file became public , and Sanai used it to access the other material stored there .
Moreover , since there was n’t anything that remotely resembles a “ collection of porn ” stored there , we did n’t pay as much attention to the security risks as we obviously should have .
This is a sad and dangerous lesson to anyone who dares to stand on principle and publicly speak out against people like Cyrus Sanai , who are willing to stop at nothing to wreak his petty vengeance on a good and decent man like my husband .
It is even more disturbing that Sanai , who is a member of the bar and an officer of the court , can get away with attacking judge after judge after judge , in this fashion .
It is also an indictment of Scott Glover and the LA Times , who are willing to knowingly distort the facts and with cavalier disregard of the injury they are causing to the reputation of a brilliant and distinguished jurist , in order to sell a few newspapers .
And then , of course , there are the bevy of other purportedly respectable publications such as the San Francisco Chronicle , that are willing to repeat Mr. Glover ’s story , while adding embellishments and further mischaracterizations along the way .
This is apparently what now substitutes for responsible journalism .
While I ’m on the topic of responsible journalism , it has recently come to light that the LA Times learned about this material months ago , and sat on it until it would do the maximum damage .
Selecting the jury was a very grueling undertaking .
Over 150 potential jurors were screened for hour after painful hour on Monday and Tuesday .
Scores of men and women took the trip into the jury box , only to leave soon thereafter because they confessed themselves unable to view the materials .
A number of others disclosed embarrassing facts about themselves and their families in order to explain why they could not sit on this jury .
It was a difficult and painful process for just about everyone who was called into the jury box .
Finally , after considering 109 members of the panel , a jury was selected and sworn at the end of the day on Tuesday .
And Glover was present in court while all this was going on , biding his time .
Only on Wednesday , after the jury had started to hear the case – and jeopardy had attached – did the LA Times choose to “ break ” its story .
A newspaper – especially a major newspaper as the Los Angeles Times purports to be – is supposed to be a responsible member of the community , not a predator .
If the presence of certain files on a judge ’s computer is a truly a newsworthy matter , it would have been so months earlier , before Alex was assigned this trial , and certainly a few days earlier , before a jury had been chosen and the trial had commenced .
But what excuse is there for timing the story with surgical precision so as to do maximum damage to the judicial process ?
In doing so , the LA Times caused the effort of the court , the parties and the 150 citizens who answered the call of duty by reporting for jury service from near and far to go to waste , just to make a big splash .
This strikes me as worse than irresponsible .
On the brighter side , once again , it is the bloggers such as you , who are willing to look behind the story to discover the real facts .
One can only hope that through these efforts , the truth will eventually come out .

The vast resources of the Internet also make it easier to cook up a story .
'' Medical information is so readily available , '' Dr. Feldman said .
'' You can type the most esoteric ailment into a search engine and get back dozens of pages dealing with it . ''
It is , of course , easier to fool people who cannot see you or hear your voice : there is no need to shave your head or lose 50 pounds .
'' These patients have often injected themselves with bacteria , '' Dr. Feldman said .
'' Here , one can sit in one 's bathrobe and not have to engage in those grisly things and reap the same benefits . ''
The proliferation of newsgroups and chat rooms also offers a seemingly limitless audience for tales of woe .
Instead of wandering from hospital to hospital , people can click from one support group to another .
Some , pretending to be ill , have joined more than one , and some sign onto a single group more than once , using different names and acting out different roles .
In one case brought to Dr. Feldman 's attention , a 23 - year - old woman said she had an eating disorder and an abusive boyfriend she was hiding from and told people in a chat room that she was communicating with them via laptop from an intensive care unit .
At times she claimed to be in shock and typed garbled messages that alarmed visitors to the chat room , who became quite concerned about her .
One night she went so far as to have a stroke on line .
Her mother took over the laptop and issued progress reports , but then she , too , had to be admitted to the hospital .
Sometimes the father went on line as well .
The devil was in the details , and regulars in the chat room eventually began to realize that too much of the story did not make sense .
All the characters misspelled the same words in the same way , and a call to the hospital where the mother and daughter had supposedly been admitted revealed that the intensive care unit was not equipped for patients to plug in laptops .
Chased out of the eating - disorder chat room , the woman turned up in others , including one for sexual - abuse survivors .
She was found out and banished from that one , too , then joined another group .
When last heard from , she was dying of AIDS .
'' I do n't need to tell you how much pain this causes others who believe her , '' one of the people who had been deceived wrote to Dr. Feldman .
In the case of the monk with cancer , Dr. Feldman said , people in his support group began to wonder how somebody who was supposed to be so sick could find the energy to send so many messages .
Also , he seemed to be hanging on an awfully long time for a man with a lethal illness .
When a member finally confronted him in a personal E - mail message , he confessed that he was neither a monk nor a cancer patient .
He withdrew from the group and vanished , though he may well have surfaced elsewhere with a new user name and a new set of symptoms .
Stuffed Lego Robot
After being inspired by a drawing from his son , a designer for Lego created a stuffed toy based on the doodles .
Moko is n't the first designer to seek inspiration from the creative designs of children , however .
Previously we 've featured companies who create custom stuffed animals based on drawings submitted by users , even those that barely look like anything but scribbles .
We 've also seen another artist take art done by children and used high tech computer graphics to make them look more realistic .
Take a look :
The U.S. Constitution was written to afford U.S. citizens clear precise laws so that they might know their rights and secure justice in the courts .
However , the federal government 's increasing focus on the fraudulent " war on Terror " had led to an illegal expansion of government and reduced civil liberties for citizens under the color of law .
Now the House has just passed by majority vote a grant of privileged immunity for the Telecoms , guilty of spying on Americans .
This act of anarchy by Congress dishonors the United States .
For the Senate to approve this measure would be a criminal act .
Congress lacks Authorization to Grant Telecoms Selective Immunity
Article 4 , Section .
2 . Clause 1 : The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States .
All citizens are entitled to the same immunities .
Telecoms are not entitled to privileged immunities .
War on Terror is a Fraud Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 15 states : The Congress shall have Power to provide for calling forth the Militia to suppress an insurrection or to repel an invasion .
Article 1 , Section 9 states :
No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ;
Terror is not a crime .
It has no name , no face , and can not be caught and jailed .
It 's illegal to fund the war on Terror because terror is an emotion and not a tangible thing .
Given terror is invisible , it can not be fought .
A war against something invisible is absurd .
Fourth Amendment Prohibits Warrantless Searches
The online legal Dictionary states : " Federal and state criminal statutes provide for the punishment of persons convicted of fraudulent activity .
Interstate fraud and fraud on the federal government are singled out for federal prosecution .
The most common federal fraud charges are for mail and wire fraud .
Mail and wire fraud statutes criminalize the use of the mails or interstate wires to create or further a scheme to defraud ( 18 U.S.C.A. §§ 1341 , 1342 ) .

The Telecoms violated U.S. citizens ' Fourth Amendment rights .
Under the law , they must be prosecuted under the law .
Failure to prosecute criminals is condusive of anarchy .
U.S. citizens are not paying taxes to support anarchy .
A Republican Form of Government Article 4 , Section .
4 states :
The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government , and shall protect each of them against Invasion ; The Telecoms engaged in wire tapping while U.S. citizens talked on the phone .

One of the greatest steps forward that local communities have taken of late is the push to collect rainwater to offset your water use .
It is often an easy way to help out the environment and , in the long run , simply save water .
There do n’t really seem to be any catches to it either .
Rain falls from the sky , hits your roof and runs in to your drums or barrels or tanks .
If only it were that simple .
Notch up another one for the members of the Idiots Anonymous who have apparently been camping out in Bellingham , Washington .
Apparently , rainwater does n’t actually belong to individuals , but to the state as a whole .
Therefore , all the wonderful efforts of communities to collect water are actually illegal .
Not just frowned upon , or morally unethical , or shifty – all of which water collection is not – but actually illegal , so much so that in the future such legalities could be used in a court of law .
It comes down once again to the simple fact that humanity is doomed to an ever continuing cycle of idiot and misanthropic events and situations that will , eventually , simply wear down those of us with half a brain , and leave planet Earth populated by half - wits and mimes ( often the same thing ) .
This information is coming to us from the Bellingham Herald , who recently ran a story entitled “ Does saving rainwater violate state law ? ” by Jennifer Langston .
“ We ’re not going to start issuing permits for a pickle barrel in the backyard .
But what if it ’s four pickle barrels or a system that has 20,000 gallons of storage ? ” said Brian Walsh , a manager in the Department of Ecology ’s water resources program .
Mr. Walsh , manager of the Department of Ecology , who the hell cares if it ’s 2 million !
It is rainwater you simpleton .
It is wet water , falling from the clouds in the sky , on to roof ’s and paddocks which may very well be decked out with enough pickle barrels to quench the thirst of a small army , like Canada’s .
But unless someone is filling their aforementioned barrel from a river or other form of wet estuary , what right minded individual is going to attempt to enforce this law ?
According to Langston , Seattle has obtained a citywide water - right permit , which allows for rain to be collected from most rooftops in the city .
The “ most ” there refers to the few neighborhoods , mostly areas north of 85th street that see their stormwater empty into creeks and streams and lakes .
Just how is this stormwater making its way from Joe Bloggs ’ roof and backyard out in to the streets and gutters so that it can then run into whatever lake lies at the end of it .
How much rain is already soaked up by the grass that covers many a backyard ?
Is that grass acting illegally hogging all that water for itself ?
If this law is not soon revoked , then my faith in humanity will once again drop another few notches down .
And while Washington state lawmakers may not be out to please Joshua S. Hill of Melbourne , Australia , one can at least hope that they are going to try and use at least a modicum of common sense .
It ’d be a change , sure , but it ’s a change for the better !
Update – thanks to cchiovitti who , in the comments below , alerted us to the fact that Eastern Colorado also has similar restrictions on who owns rainwater .
Make sure to leave a comment if your state has decided to take a leave of absence from their senses as well .

Telescope mirrors made from lunar dust could help realize dreams of stargazing from the far side of the moon .
Creating gigantic lunar telescopes would normally carry an astronomical price tag , but NASA researchers used a mix of epoxy , simulated lunar dust and carbon nanotubes to demonstrate how to use materials already found on the moon .
" You can go to the moon with a few buckets , and build something far larger than anything a rocket can carry , " said Peter Chen , a physicist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
Orbiting vs. moon - based
Astronomers have argued about which is better in the future : building additional orbiting space telescopes such as Hubble or setting them up on the moon .
Both types of telescopes would be beyond the interference of Earth 's atmosphere , although the moon has the added advantages of being a stable platform with a far side shielded from Earth 's cluttered radio background .
On the other hand , getting to the moon represents more of a challenge than simply launching a space telescope .
However , the debate so far has been " limited by launching from the ground , " Chen told SPACE.com , because Earth 's gravity places both size and cost limits on what rockets can carry into space or to the moon .
The solution : Get much of the needed building material from the moon itself .
Chen had already started working with epoxy and carbon nanotubes to create " smart " materials that can flex or change shape when an electric current passes through , but ended up adding simulated lunar dust called JSC - 1A Coarse Lunar Regolith Simulant to the mix .
Chen used the resulting lunar concrete as the foundation of a foot - long disk , and poured more plastic epoxy on top of it .
Then he spun the mirror at a constant speed that formed the epoxy into a parabolic , slightly bowl - like shape as it hardened .
The mirror 's finishing touch came with a thin layer of reflective aluminum applied inside a vacuum chamber .
Making a Hubble - sized mirror would require bringing 130 pounds ( 60 kg ) of epoxy to the moon with 3 pounds ( 1.3 kg ) of carbon nanotubes and less than 1 gram of aluminum , according to Chen 's calculations .
Meanwhile , 1,300 pounds ( 600 kilograms ) of lunar dust could provide the bulk of the material .
The moon 's lack of atmosphere also suits the vacuum conditions needed to make the mirror .
Base considerations
Astronomers may imagine telescope mirrors half the size of a football field , but realizing such dreams depends heavily on whenever NASA returns human explorers to the moon and sets up a moon base .
Other challenges include getting the necessary manufacturing equipment to the moon , such as the spinning table on which the mirror gets created .
Future astronauts would also have to ensure that none of the free - floating lunar dust contaminates the mirror .
" It 's a great idea in principle , but nothing is simple on the Moon , " said James Spann , physicist heading the Space and Exploration Research Office at Marshall Space Flight Center , in a NASA statement .
Chen and his colleagues will try to scale up their demonstration by creating 1.64 - foot ( 0.5 meter ) and 3.28 - foot ( 1 meter ) mirrors using the simulated lunar dust .
They also plan to figure out ways to hone the quality of the finished mirror 's surface , and are already speculating about ways future explorers and robots could build even larger telescope mirrors on the moon — perhaps within an impact crater .
" It 's totally out - of - the - box , but it 's fun to think about , " Chen said .

Rivers which had been dry because lakes were formed upstream by the Sichuan quake , have now been re-flooded .
James Reynolds reports from Mianyang City in China .
CHICAGO , June 9 – The Chicago Tribune reports that executives of Alfred L. Wolff Inc. , a prominent honey importer based in Germany , have been arrested and held by U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement agents for illegally conspiring to import honey from China .
The honey laundering case is note worthy as it involves apparent criminal activities by American - based , rather than Chinese businessmen in trying to ensure that cheap product reaches the States , in what is regarded as a rising trend of American commercial disobedience towards government imposed anti-dumping measures .
In the Wolff case , honey was said to have been purchased from China , shipped to Russia , mixed with Russian honey , and then shipped to Chicago labeled as pure Russian honey – which does not carry anti-dumping penalties .
Other countries
Wolff have been alleged to have used as secondary destinations to get around the U.S. Department of Commerce ’s anti-dumping fees on Chinese honey include Australia , the Ukraine , Poland and Singapore .
The origin of honey can be detected by a signature chemical analysis that identifies soil residues within the honey itself , and once nine containers of Russian honey were actually identified as being of Chinese origin , the executives concerned were apprehended and are now being held at Chicago ’s Metropolitan Correction Center , though they have yet to be formally charged .
The incentive to bend the rules over anti-dumping legislation is certainly there .
Sixty percent of the United States annual consumption of honey is imported , according to the American National Honey Board , and China has traditionally been the world ’s largest exporter , mainly through state - owned enterprises that purchase honey from small farmers around the nation and then collectively process it .
It ’s big business – once the U.S. government imposed anti-dumping measures on China in 2001 , Russian exports to the United States soared from 130,000 pounds in 2003 to 7.3 million pounds in just three years – far beyond Russia ’s actual honey production capabilities .
Several things stand out concerning the issue , not least the actual effectiveness of Commerce Department anti-dumping measures against China subsequently encouraging illegal transshipments to occur .
Additionally , the obvious abilities of American businessmen to organize global supply chain structures is thus legally diminished as the demand of the American consumer for cheap product brings them into conflict with their own government .
Surely one also has to question how effective the U.S. Customs are at policing the issue on behalf of the Department of Commerce and what sense anti-dumping measures of this sort actually make .
Honey laundering , we suspect , is just the tip of a very large U.S. consumer driven rebuttal of the nation ’s anti-dumping measures affecting hundreds of commodities .
If so , quite how the U.S. Department of Commerce balances its policy of imposing anti-dumping on certain Chinese products against the consumer ’s desire to have them is a matter that remains , it would seem , an American , rather than U.S. - China conflict .

There are at least 200 US army deserters in Canada
A Canadian court has ordered the country 's refugee board to re-examine an American deserter 's rejected attempt for asylum in Canada .
The court ruled that the board made mistakes when it turned down Joshua Key 's claim for asylum .
Mr Key served in Iraq in 2003 before deserting to Canada with his family while on leave in the US .
The ruling could affect scores of other US soldiers sheltering in Canada who have refused to fight in Iraq .
Possible deportations
Joshua Key served in Iraq as a US combat engineer in Iraq in 2003 .
He claims that he witnessed several cases of abusive acts against civilians and the killing of innocent people .
While on leave at home in Oklahoma , he decided that he would not return to duty and took his family to Canada where he applied for asylum .
Although the Canadian refugee board found Mr Key credible , it rejected his application , saying that unless his claims of abuse constituted a war crime , they did not justify his desertion from the US army .
In its ruling , the federal court has disagreed with that analysis , saying that being forced to participate in military misconduct , even if it stops short of a war crime , may support a claim to protection in Canada .
There are at least 200 American war deserters in Canada and many face deportation after their asylum cases were also rejected .
Joshua Key 's lawyer said that the ruling may help their cases .
The Canadian government is reviewing the court 's decision and has not said whether it will appeal .
I recently posted about a bot - safe email link where I showed how you can use a series of obfuscated method calls through JavaScript to pop open a mail client with an address in the TO field , while still maintaining a decent sense of privacy .
In this post we will dive into how the actual obfuscation script works and how it can be extended .
I show how I use it in the bot - safe email link but the structure of the script is a good foundation for any JavaScript obfuscation needs .
Generating Function Names
The core part of the system comes from the generation of random numbers and letters .
Because of this we will use the following extensively :
/* * Generates a random letter , either upper or lower case . */ function randomLetter ( ) { //
Generate a letter between A - Z ( Ascii 65 - 90 ) or a -z ( Ascii 97-122 ) .
We // will randomly select between upper and lower case . if ( Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 1 ) == 1 ) { return String.fromCharCode(97 + Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 25 ) ) ; } return String.fromCharCode(65 + Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 25 ) ) ; } /* * Generates a random number between 0 and 9 . */ function randomNumber ( ) { return Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 9 ) ; }
These two functions are the enabling factor behind our method name generator :
/* * Generates a random function name that always begins with a letter and * is composed entirely of random numbers and letters and is of random * length . */ function randomFunctionName ( ) { //
Max function name length var maxLen = 25 ; // Generate a random number - this will be the length of our method .
We // will subtract one right off the bat to account for the first letter // in the method .
var len = Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * maxLen ) - 1 ; // Generate a random letter - functions can't start with a number so we // will always start with a letter .
var functionName = randomLetter ( ) ; //
Loop through and create the method name .
for ( i = 0 ; i < len ;i++ ) { //
Randomly select between a letter and a number if ( Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 1 ) == 1 ) { functionName += randomLetter ( ) ; } else { functionName += randomNumber ( ) ; } } return functionName ; }
Now a simple call to randomFunctionName ( ) will give a completely randomized , yet valid , function name between 1 and 25 characters in length .
We will use this extensively throughout the rest of the script .
Generating Methods to Obfuscate the Email Address
Next we need to write a method to randomly parse through the email address , splitting into sections that can be pushed into their own methods .
In addition , we will need to vary up the methods by which the method is created .
We will do this by going through a series of loops which split portions of the text out of the mail string , generate a function , and have the portion of the string return from the function in one way or another .
This method is a bit involved , so we ’ll just take a look at it then step through the parts of importance .
Please note that I have removed comments , spaces , and other things so that it will render better .
For the full code visit the actual script and view source .
function generate ( addr ) { var loc = " mailto : " + addr ; //
This will keep track of all the generated javascript code var functions = " " ; var methodCalls = " " ; var maxSplit = 3 ; var spos = 0 ; var epos = 0 ; var splitLen = 0 ; //
This is the number of method aggregations we want - min of 1 , max of 3 . var aggregations = Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 2 ) + 1 ; //
This holds a set of function names that may or may not be aggregated // into a single call through another method .
var functionSubset = " " ; // Split up the string into multiple parts in order to start breaking // it up into multiple methods .
Each one of these will become a part // of the main method call to recompose the email address .
var cnt = 0 ; do { cnt ++ ; //
If the length from the last split to the end of the string is // less than the max split then we will want to use that length // for the next split .
if ( epos > - 1 && loc.substring(epos).length <= maxSplit ) { splitLen = loc.substring ( epos ) .length } else { splitLen = maxSplit ; } //
Determine the length for the first split splitLen = Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * splitLen ) ; //
Grab the split spos = epos ; epos = spos + splitLen ; var str = loc.substring (spos , epos ) ; //
Create a function name and add it to the list of functions that // must be called by the mail method . var functionName = randomFunctionName ( ) ; if ( functionSubset.length >
0 ) { functionSubset += " + " ; } functionSubset += functionName + " ( ) " ; functions += "
function " + functionName + functionContents ( str ) ; //
Tracks whether we need to reset the aggregation variables or not var resetVars = false ; //
If there is only one aggregation then we will just add the method // to the emailMe ( ) method call list .
Also check to see if we have // aggregated enough to chop and create a method to hold the functions // we have created thus far . if ( aggregations == 1 || epos >= loc.length ) { //
Add the function call to the emailMe ( ) method . if ( methodCalls.length >
0 ) { methodCalls += " + " ; } methodCalls += functionSubset ; resetVars = true ; } else if ( cnt == aggregations ) { //
Get a function name for the aggregate function . var aggregateFunctionName = randomFunctionName ( ) + " ( ) " ; //
Add the aggregate function to the emailMe ( ) method call . if ( methodCalls.length >
0 ) { methodCalls += " + " ; } methodCalls += aggregateFunctionName ; //
Add the actual function functions += "
function " + aggregateFunctionName + " { return " + functionSubset + " ; } " ; resetVars = true ; } if ( resetVars ) { //
Reset the cnt and functionSubset and figure a random aggregations // number cnt = 0 ; aggregations = Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 2 ) + 1 ; functionSubset = " " ; } } while ( epos >= 0 && epos < loc.length ) ; functions = " // Remove this before placing code on page >>>
emailMe ( ) ;
// <<< Remove this before placing code on page
" + " function emailMe ( ) { window.location = " + methodCalls + " ; } " + functions ; document.frm.code.value = functions ; }
The methodCalls variable on line 6 simply accumulates the calls that will be made from the emailMe ( ) method .
That is , the emailMe ( ) method will ultimately contain “ return ” + methodCalls , as shown in the code block below .
The maxSplit variable on line 8 is used to determine how many characters are the maximum number allowed in each substring .
The number 3 was settled upon because it generally ensures that the entire email address cannot be in the same substring and it guarantees that the mailto : token will be broken into at least two parts .
The aggregations variable on line 15 signifies the number of functions that should be aggregated under a single function .
If this were set to 1 on each iteration then the result would be that the email Me ( ) method would call each function , adding the results of them all together to result in the email address :
function emailMe ( ) { return s 1 ( ) + s2 ( ) + s3 ( ) ; }
By having this evaluate to higher than one on some iterations , portions of the generated functions will be delegated to other method calls , making the email Me ( ) method need to call fewer methods directly :
function emailMe ( ) { return s 1 ( ) + a 1 ( ) ; } function a 1 ( ) { return s 2 ( ) + s3 ( ) ; }
Our loop to gather substrings actually starts on line 25 and will continue until the end of the string is reached .
Within this loop the actual parsing and function generation takes place .
Lines 31 - 38 determine how long the next substring should be , taking into account the remaining length of the string .
A random function name is then generated and the function is actually generated by a call to functionContents ( ) on line 53 , which we will go into with more detail shortly .
The actual function itself is placed within the functions variable for storage .
The generated function names are added to a functionSet variable that simply contains a list of function calls .
These will either be placed into an aggregate method or in the email Me ( ) method , as discussed above .
The code determines whether to add the function to an aggregate method , keep accumulating , or add it to the email Me ( ) method in lines 61 - 83 .
Finally , the last two lines of the function enable retrieval and testing of the generated code .
The first line creates a call to email Me ( ) that resides outside a function so when the block of code is sent through the eval ( ) function something actually happens .
The second line of code simply places the entire thing into the text area for viewing , editing , and copying .
Generating Function Contents
Now that we have broken the pieces of our mailto string up into many substrings and generated a function for each the next step is to fill in the contents of each function .
I chose to do this by having the actual loop itself call out to the functionContents ( str ) method , which then delegates off to a number of different techniques for returning the string .
The technique used is chosen at random , making each call to the functionContents ( str ) method capable of returning a different result .
Each of the methods is illustrative in nature and does n’t really do anything spectacular , aside from making the end product harder to read and parse with the human mind .
Here is the code :
/* * Generates the contents of each function by using one of a few random * techniques for obfuscating the internal data .
Every technique used * here must resolve back to a string if the function itself is called .
*/ function functionContents ( str ) { var technique = Math.round ( Math.random ( ) * 2 ) ; var f = " ( ) { " switch ( technique ) { case 0 : f += escapeFunctionContents ( str ) ; break ; case 1 : f += staticFunctionContents ( str ) ; break ; case 2 : f += evalFunctionContents ( str ) ; break ; } f += " } " ; return f ; } function escapeFunctionContents ( str ) { return " return unescape ( \ " " + escape ( str ) + " \ " ) ; " ; } function evalFunctionContents ( str ) { return " return eval ( \" if ( true ) ' " + str + " ' ; \ " ) " ; } /* *
One of a few ways the return values of a function is formulated .
This * method will simply return the passed string as a string .
*/ function staticFunctionContents ( str ) { return " return \ " " + str + " \ " ; " ; }
The first technique escapes the string in our script and uses the unescape ( ) method to return it to normal when the generated script is executed .
This will typically not have much of an effect unless there are special characters in the email address – this method was used more for illustrative purposes than anything else .
The second technique uses the eval ( ) function to evaluate a string .
In our case I simply have it evaluate an if statement that always returns true , resulting in the eval ( ) method returning the product of the true if statement , our substring .
The third technique simply returns the substring itself .
The techniques for generating the function bodies can be extended by simply adding a new function then updating the functionContents ( str ) method to take it into account as an option .
The GUI
We have the completed code and just need a way to launch and test it .
I created a simple form that invokes the generate ( str ) method and places the output into a text area in a form that it can be executed through an eval ( ) statement by clicking on the Test button .
< script > //
All the stuff we went over above ... </ script > < h1>McDonaldLand</h1 > < h3 > Get all your info from McDonaldLand < br / >< a href= " http://www.mcdonaldland.info ">www.McDonaldLand.info</a></h3> < form name = " frm " >
Enter the email address to be obfuscated : < input type =" text " name = " addr " value= " " />< input type=" button " value= " Generate Code " on Click= " generate ( this.form.addr.value ) " /><br/><br/> < textarea rows = " 20 " cols = " 60 " name= " code " ></textarea >< br/> < input type=" button " on Click=" eval ( this.form.code.value ) " value = " Test " / > </ form >
The Test
You can either follow along with the post ( I did n’t test this one out ) or you can copy the working script by viewing source ( I tested this thoroughly ) .
Either way the end result should be a page that will allow you to enter an email address , generate script from it , then test the script , all from the same page .
