GateHouse Media filed a lawsuit Monday against the New York Times Co. alleging copyright infringement after the NYT - owned Boston Globe frequently posted links containing headlines and the first sentences from articles on GateHouse ’s community news sites .
The lawsuit , if successful , could create a monumental chilling effect for bloggers , news sites , search engines , social media sites and aggregators such as Topix and Techmeme , which link to articles , display headlines and use snippets of copyrighted text from other sites .
Initiatives such as the NYTimes.com Times Extra , which displays links to related articles from other sites , could be shut down for fear of copyright lawsuits .
It could lead to a repudiation of one of the fundamental principles on which the Internet was built : the discovery and sharing of information .
In its complaint , GateHouse called the article links “ deep links ” because they do not link to the home page of the site .
The “ deep link ” language in the complaint is meant to invoke cases such as the Supercrosslive.com case , wherein a motorcross news site was successfully prohibited from deep linking to a competing site ’s streaming video file , which bypassed the site ’s advertising .
From a technological standpoint , Your Town Newton ’s article links would likely be considered deep links .
However , that does not necessarily mean the links are a violation of fair use principles .
The links to the articles , which contain as many as six advertisement positions , are rather different in nature from the links to streaming audio and media files in the Supercrosslive.com case , which were unable to contain advertising .
GateHouse ’s assertion is that the Boston Globe community site ’s use of the headlines cannibalizes GateHouse ’s content and causes it financial harm because readers gather news from the links and snippets on the Globe ’s site rather than visit GateHouse ’s sites .
Although not explicitly stated in the complaint , this means GateHouse likely believes the loss of readers from possible increased use of the Globe ’s site will not be offset by the readers brought in by its competitor ’s links .
If GateHouse were to have its way with its deep link argument , it would create a legal precedent that makes the act of linking to a copyrighted article illegal .
It could mean a crippling of sites such as Romenesko and the Drudge Report , which can bring in enormous amounts of readers while being primarily built upon links to someone else ’s expensive - to - create content .
But , if enforced , it would also cut off the voluminous flow of readers who arrive to news sites via search engines and aggregators .
That , too , has an effect on the bottom line .
In the end , we could see a long list of media companies flinging short - sighted lawsuits at each other , while suicidally pushing their content into black holes guarded by copyright law .

The tight - rope walk of using historical settings in games , and the enemies that exist inside those settings , is a tricky one .
One Joystiq writer , while watching game play from Call of Duty : World at War , was unable to continue viewing the game because of his feelings about the racial makeup of the enemy .
The writer describes his experience viewing the game as such : " It made me think about my grandmother , who as a little girl was shipped with her family from their farm in California to an internment camp in Arizona .
It made me think of her brother and brothers - in - law who were drafted into the United States military and fought , with pride , in the war in Europe .
It reminded me of the shame I felt as a child when teased .
An inheritance of lingering hatred . "
He then says he wo n't view any more from the game , or play it .
That 's a very personal thing based on someone 's life experiences , and I have no problem with it .
Then I read this , and my draw dropped .
" I have a very personal problem with demonizing the Japanese .
I do n't feel that way about the Nazis .
I draw a disconnect between Nazis and Germans as large as the divide between ' alien ' and human .
The Nazis have been transformed into monsters , which does not need to be justified in my gaming , " he wrote .
That 's an amazing sentence , and made me really think about how often the German people have been used as the bad guys in games .
The Nazi party was just that , a political party .
Saying there is a huge gulf between the German people and the Nazi characters would would be like saying it 's okay to kill Republicans in a game , but you have issues with Americans being the bad guys .
These two groups were never mutually exclusive , although they 're also not interchangeable .
The Nazis were n't monsters , they were people who did terrible things .
The party was huge , participation was nearly compulsory , and people tend to forget that not every German serving in the army worked in the camps .
They were people , and they were not unique ; studies show that more people than you think would be more than willing to kill if they were told it was okay by someone in authority .
As with most noteworthy instances of history being made , it was normal people in extraordinary circumstances ; there was nothing inherently evil about the way many German soldiers served .
Unfortunately , the German people are now always portrayed as monsters , killers , empty - eyed targets in game after game .
My son goes to a German language school , and it's not a rare thing for someone to crack a joke about World War II when they hear him speak the language .
We shudder at Nazi iconography because of the images we carry with us of the Holocaust and persecution from that time period , but even that reaction is limited and simplified .
Germans and Catholics were sent to the camps too , remember .
As were homosexuals and Romani .
The issue of creating bad guys in video games is an important one , and it's sad that conversations about World War II , the issues of responsibility and duty , and even the nature of evil get lost because we 're all so comfortable turning the very human people who fought on both sides of that war into either heroes or villains .
The one - note portrayal of German people is n't okay just because in your mind they 're alien , and having a gut reaction when you see a people you more readily identify with act monstrously should give you more of an understanding that just because someone does n't look like you , does n't mean that they are any less human , or that they do n't deserve to be placed in the proper place , within the proper context , of history .
Jockeying for Position in Ohio
The Ohio Republican Party today filed an amended complaint in its case against Secretary of State Brunner ( Ohio Republican Party v. Brunner ) .
This is the same case that the ORP earlier used as a vehicle for its arguments regarding the window for early registration and absentee voting , observers at in - person absentee voting sites , and mismatched voter information .
The ORP previously got court orders against Brunner 's actions regarding observers and mismatches , only to have those orders reversed on appeal .
[ Disclosure : I joined amicus briefs on behalf of voting and civil rights groups supporting the Secretary of State 's position and opposing that taken by the ORP on the window and matching issues . ]
The new amended complaint in ORP is similar to its prior complaint , but appears to include new allegations regarding the discretion vested in county boards of election when it comes to counting votes .
The apparent claim is that this discretion leads to the unequal treatment of voters from county to county .
Presumably , this claim would rely in part on the Bush v. Gore decision , arguing that such inter-county disparities violate equal protection .
I suspect that the real purpose of this lawsuit is to serve as a placeholder , in the event that Ohio turns out to be close enough to litigate .
The district judge assigned to the case , Judge Smith , is a Reagan appointee who has been quite sympathetic to the ORP 's position in its prior motions .
Thus , the ORP might well want to have post-election disputes steered toward his courtroom .
Now things get really interesting : I 've just learned that the Secretary of State has countered by moving to have the ORP 's case consolidated with an earlier pending case , Northeast Ohio Coalition for the Homeless v. Brunner ( NEOCH ) .
You can find the Secretry of State 's motion here .
The NEOCH case concerns Ohio's provisional voting and identification laws , and is pending before Judge Marbley , a Clinton appointee .
The Secretary of State 's motion to consolidate notes that one of the directives that the ORP now seeks to challenge through its case is Directive 2008 - 101 .
That directive was issued on October 24 , to resolve some of the issues in the NEOCH case pertaining to the counting of provisional ballots -- see this order in NEOCH , adopting and annexing the directive .
To the extent that the ORP seeks to challenge Directive 2008 - 101 , as paragraph 35 of its complaint indicates , this is quite clearly part of the NEOCH case .
Jamie Spears Slaps New Restraining Orders on Lutfi , Ghalib , Eardley
father , who is the conservator for his daughter and her business affairs , has gone back to court to obtain restraining orders against the singer 's former managerher former paparazzi boyfriendand the lawyer who previously tried to fight the conservatorship ,
According to Los Angeles Superior Court papers , the three men are not able to come within 250 years of Britney , her property or family members .
Jamie , after reviewing his daughter 's cellphone records , discovered that Lutfi and Ghalib were contacting Britney via numerous cellphone calls and text messages .
Jamie believes that Britney was ' innocently ' giving them information regarding her schedule .
They , in turn , were tipping off the paparazzi for financial gain .
Lutfi has apparently conveyed to Britney , through her hairdresser in late December , that he is close to breaking the conservatorship bond that has kept Britney under her father 's control .
The elder Spears , suspecting that Eardley and Lutfi are again working together in this regard , included the lawyer in his court request for retraining orders .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government ’s latest bank rescue , this time a multi-billion dollar lifeline handed to Bank of America , has led to more talk of what once would have been unthinkable -- European - style nationalization of major American banks .

Few see the government nationalizing the entire banking system the way Sweden did in the 1990s , but the U.S. is growing more willing to put significant pressure on the largest banks .
Over time , the government could exercise the same day - to - day control over major U.S. banks as with IndyMac Bank , a failed California thrift that the U.S. government operated for much of last year .
“ We ’re nationalizing banks one at a time now .
The real question is , will the biggest ones need to be nationalized ? , ” said Roy Smith , professor at New York University ’s Stern School of Business .
The U.S. banking system desperately needs capital .
Estimates of the shortfall range from $ 700 billion to more than $ 2 trillion .
That money will not come from the private sector as long as the pending losses are all but impossible to estimate .
Without private investors bailing out the sector , whose functioning is key to reviving an economy mired in recession , the U.S. government will have little option but to step up .
In earlier stages of the meltdown , the United States tried to penalize investors to the smallest extent possible when it intervened .
When Bear Stearns & Cos Inc failed , the government brokered a deal that ultimately resulted in Bear shareholders getting money , while debt holders lost nothing .
After that deal , regulators got tough , and let Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc fail .
Chaos ensued .
Two months later , when the market lost confidence in Citigroup , the government bought preferred shares and warrants , giving it exposure similar to owning shares without diluting shareholders .
The transition team of president - elect Barack Obama , who takes office on Tuesday , has said it will seek more concessions from banks seeking capital than the Bush administration did .
Lawrence Summers , director - designate of the National Economic Council , promised congressional leaders this week to limit dividend payments and executive compensation at banks that are bailed out .
And there are signs that Citigroup C.N is facing significant government pressure .
It has sold off a stake in the brokerage business that Chief Executive Vikram Pandit said he " loved " just a few weeks ago .
And the bank broke with the rest of the industry and supported bankruptcy legislation that detractors say will give consumers an incentive to file for bankruptcy .
People familiar with the situation said that regulators have been exerting more pressure on the bank since late November , when Citigroup got a second round of funding under the U.S. Treasury ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program .
That $ 20 billion was on top of the $ 25 billion that Citigroup and other banks received in October .
And Bank of America , which received more help from the government in an anticipated announcement late on Thursday , is expected to face more government scrutiny as well .
A FAR CRY
But this sort of quiet exertion of authority is a far cry from full nationalization , where the government seizes all or nearly all of a bank ’s shares , and makes day - to - day decisions and explicitly guarantees the company ’s liabilities .
There are reasons to question whether full nationalization of the biggest banks is likely any time soon .
Nationalizing just one of JPMorgan Chase & Co , Bank of America Corp , or Citigroup , which together have about half the assets in the banking system , would double the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet instantly .
That could weigh on the dollar , which has already fallen some 17 percent against the Japanese yen since August .
And if the government were to nationalize one large lender , shareholders would likely lose confidence in other marginal banks .
“ If you nationalize Citigroup , you ’ll have to nationalize 10 other banks .
It wo n’t just stop with one , ” said Marc Snyder , senior financial stock analyst at Symphony Asset Management in San Francisco .
The banking industry itself is obviously opposed to nationalization .
“ If it were n’t for the political power of the industry , nationalizing is what you ’d want to do .
It ’s almost a no - brainer , ” said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
But over time , the government will likely have little choice but to step in more completely , said Sean Egan , founding principal at rating agency Egan - Jones Ratings .
“ It ’s a slow - moving train wreck , and nothing can be done , ” he said .
A South Korean actress Ok So-ri reacts as she leaves from a court in Goyang , north of Seoul , South Korea , Wednesday , Dec. 17 , 2008 .
Ok was found guilty of her extramarital affairs with an opera singer , a news report said Wednesday , months after Seoul 's Constitutional Court upheld a ban on adultery .
[ Agencies ]
A South Korean court found one of the country 's most famous actresses guilty of adultery Wednesday , months after she tried but failed to have a law that makes extramarital affairs a crime ruled unconstitutional .
A district court gave Ok So-ri a suspended sentence of eight months , meaning she will not serve jail time , Yonhap news agency reported .
The court near Seoul gave
Ok 's lover a six - month suspended sentence .
A court spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
The sensational sex - and - celebrities case has been tabloid fodder for months , with Ok 's challenge to the adultery law adding extra spice .
Last year ,
Ok acknowledged during a news conference that she had had an affair with an opera singer friend of her husband for a few months in 2006 .
She stressed the affair was a result of her loveless marriage to actor Park Chul .
The 40 - year - old actress earlier this year filed a petition to have the adultery ban ruled an unconstitutional invasion of privacy .
But in October , the Constitutional Court upheld the ban , part of South Korea 's 55 - year - old criminal code .
Despite decades of Western influence , South Korea remains deeply conservative and is influenced by a Confucian heritage .
Those convicted under the anti-adultery law face prison sentences of up to two years , though few actually serve time .
Supporters of the adultery ban say it promotes monogamy and keeps families intact .
Opponents argue the law violates privacy .
Complaints have been filed with the Constitutional Court three times in 1990 , 1993 and 2001 to abolish the law , but the court has upheld it every time .
While women 's rights group were the ban 's biggest supporters in the past when the law was meant to keep philandering husbands in line , in recent years some husbands have begun pressing adultery charges on their unfaithful wives .
The number of adultery cases filed in South Korea has dropped in recent years , declining to 8,070 in 2006 from 12,760 in 2000 , according to the Supreme Prosecutors ' Office .
About 80 percent of those cases were dropped before formal charges were filed , largely because complaints were withdrawn .
Many Muslim nations have similar adultery laws .
Austria , Switzerland and some US states also have laws prohibiting extramarital affairs , according to the Korea Legal Aid Center for Family Relations , a government - funded legal counseling office .

Journalist Muntadar al - Zeidi , the new hero in Iraq , much of the Muslim world , and even among many in this country , is facing less than friendly treatment from the Iraqi military and , according to some news reports , the U.S. forces overseeing his custody ...
The Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at US President George W. Bush has a broken arm and ribs after being struck by Iraqi security agents , his brother told AFP on Tuesday .
Durgham Zaidi was unable to say whether his brother Muntazer had sustained the injuries while being overpowered during Sunday 's protest against Bush 's visit to Baghdad or while in custody later .
He said he had been told that his brother was being held by Iraqi forces in the heavily fortified Green Zone compound in central Baghdad where the US embassy and most government offices are housed .
" He has got a broken arm and ribs , and cuts to his eye and arm , " said Durgham .
And yes , as we noted in our coverage on Sunday , White House spokeswoman Dana Perino did , in fact , receive both a literal and symbolic black eye during the melee following the shoe toss .
In what would be dismissed as ridiculous heavy - handed Hollywood symbolism , had it been featured in a movie , Perino actually received a black - eye when she was hit during the fracas , in the eye , with a microphone ...
More photos here ...
In other shoe - throwing news , you can now throw virtual shoes at Bush in a number of online games , or you can send him some actual shoes via a new online campaign promising to give Bush the boot .
They all sound like good ideas to us !

U.S. troops to need search warrants under Iraq pact Security pact could stymie military efforts
Soldiers will need warrant to search , detain
THE WAR IN IRAQ
MAHMOUDIYA , IRAQ — U.S. soldiers preparing for raids study maps , examine photos of wanted men and check their weapons .
Starting next month , they 'll have to go see a judge .
For nearly six years , American troops have been free under a U.N. mandate to search any home and detain anyone deemed a security risk .
All that changes next month , when the mandate expires and a U.S. - Iraqi security agreement takes effect .
From then on , troops must obtain Iraqi warrants for searches and arrests — and U.S. officers say the requirement is one of the biggest headaches in complying with the new rules .
" It takes away the option of saying , ' Hey , this guy just came into town and we want him and we want him now , ' " said Capt .
Tom Smith , a company commander on his second tour in Iraq .
" For some of us who were here before , it feels a bit slow . "
U.S. troops are scrambling to learn the ins and outs of an Iraqi legal system with unfamiliar rules and procedures , a cumbersome bureaucracy and a shortage of judges after years of violence .
The Americans are having to turn to their Iraqi colleagues for help in navigating the system .
They 're also trying to improve it , working with the Iraqi investigators to enhance their evidence - gathering techniques , such as the use of biometrics and forensics .
The Iraqi government began requiring its own security forces to obtain warrants after a series of offensives in the spring against Shiite extremists drew sharp criticism from rival political parties complaining their members were being unfairly targeted .
In recent operations , that has meant flying judges from Baghdad to targeted cities to expedite the process .
The U.S. military is about to face the same rules .
The security pact states that as of Jan.
1 , American troops may not search homes or make arrests without warrants " except in the case of active combat operations . "
That will be a big change for the U.S. military .
The agreement was ratified by Iraq 's presidential council on Dec. 4 , and U.S. and Iraqi commanders are now meeting to lay out guidelines for how the new rules will work on the ground .
U.S. soldiers — particularly special forces — have in the past staged raids without consulting the Iraqis when going after time - sensitive targets .
Commanders have long been concerned about extremists infiltrating the Iraqi security forces .
" It 's a challenge and we 're working through it , " said Lt. Col .
Jim Bradford , commander of the 1st Combined Arms Battalion , 63rd Armor Regiment from Fort Riley , Kan .
" Warrants come from multiple locations and so we 're working through that as well . "
Suri Cruise Refuses to Wear Pants or Socks ( PHOTOS )
dished on his two year old daughter Suri with ET host .
He started out , as any doting father would , by saying that his little princess is truly a " Girlie - Girl " .
Then he expanded by saying , " She wo n't wear pants . "
Katie Holmes , currently appearing in the Broadway play All My Sons , is frequently photographed with her young daughter on the sidewalks of Manhattan .
We have seen Suri in any number of adorable dresses and usually the same pair of silver Mary Janes , although she occasionally wears a pair of black tap shoes .
More often than not , Suri is sockless and we 've seen multiple photos of the Hottest Tot all dressed up and barefoot .
Tom reports , " Kate finally got her in jeans the other day .
We put the pants on and walk away and the pants are off and the dress is on . "
Sounds like we know who is ruling the roost in the Cruise household .

Stardock knows PC gamers .
The company has been doing well by its core audience for quite some time now , and now has even more good news for the true believers : company CEO Brad Wardell has revealed that he is eying the classic PC franchises Star Control and Master of Orion for updates in the coming years .
Wardell revealed his plans to Gamasutra , saying that many of these classic franchises are n't getting the proper treatment that they deserve .
" I actually pitched Atari on a whole idea for a true successor to Star Control , " Wardell said .
A sequel to Star Control was in the planning stages for original developer Toys for Bob with Activision , but the plans have come to a stand - still .
Master of Orion would be another franchise on the company 's hit list .
" We 'd like to do a Master of Orion 4 , " said Wardell .
" It would be an updated Master of Orion 2 .
There would be more to it , but that would be the basis of it . "
Stardock 's track record indicates that the company is more than capable of resurrecting these franchises in a way that would resonate with PC gamers , but it seems that the big publishers may be unwilling to move .
One wonders if Stardock 's open stance on DRM and recent " Gamers Bill of Rights " have caused big - name publishers to shy away from the company , or if Activision just is n't sure it could release the game across five consoles and then release a sequel every eight months .
NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - New moms may be better able to return to their pre-pregnancy weight by exclusively breastfeeding their infants , according to new research .
“ The practice of exclusive breastfeeding helps mothers lose the weight accumulated during pregnancy and do that faster compared to those who do n’t practice exclusive breastfeeding , ” Dr. Alex Kojo Anderson , of the University of Georgia in Athens , told Reuters Health .
Anderson and colleagues compared pre-pregnancy and at - delivery weight , with weight at 12 weeks after delivery , among 24 mothers , aged 19 to 42 years .
Seventeen of these new moms exclusively breastfed their infants , while 9 mothers mixed - fed their infants using formula or a combination of formula and breastmilk .
According to the findings , published online in the International Breastfeeding Journal , during the first 4 weeks after delivery , mothers in the mixed feeding group lost more of their at - delivery weight than did mothers who exclusively breastfed .
However , from 8 to 12 weeks this trend reversed .
When Anderson ’s team compared the women ’s post - pregnancy weight loss according to their pre-pregnancy weight , mothers who exclusively breastfed lost more weight at 2- , 4 - , 8 - , and 12 - weeks after delivery than did mothers in the mixed feeding group .
This weight loss trend was evident in spite of the greater caloric intake and lower activity level among breastfeeding mothers , compared with mixed feeding mothers , the investigators found .
Moreover , “ the trend in percent body fat loss was statistically significant among exclusive breastfeeding mothers and not the other group of mothers , ” Anderson added .
“ Our results provide further evidence that exclusive breastfeeding promotes greater weight loss than mixed feeding among mothers even in the early postpartum period , ” Anderson and colleagues say .
Encouraging mothers to exclusively breastfeed their infants is one way to help these women avoid becoming overweight or obese , they conclude .

Connecticut ’s rebate program for home and business owners who purchase solar systems was so popular that the funds backing it are all used up only six months into the two - year funding period .
Until now , Connecticut ’s solar rebate program was one of the better run and most generous in the United States .
Since 2005 , more than $ 85 million has been doled out for 815 residential solar projects and 127 business and government projects .
Similar problems are popping up elsewhere , too .
In Maryland , for instance state officials had to put a freeze on their solar energy grant program and close the waiting list .
One might argue that the size of state - level solar incentives funds pale in comparison to the actual demand for solar installs .
So , while the programs are successful strictly in terms of their popularity , they are hindered by the fact that once funding runs out , people stop installing new PV systems .
The “ problem ” in Connecticut is that the current funding cycle runs from July 1 , 2008 , through June 30 , 2010 , but a 300 percent growth in purchases of residential systems for the second half of 2008 used up the entire $ 8.5 million .
Because the commercial program is likely to exhaust its two - year allotment of more than $ 18 million this spring , state officials have announced that they are no longer accepting applications for the solar rebate program , despite having originally thought they could accept new applications through January 15th .
Industry groups are concerned that unless money is injected into the program , the momentum built up over its four - year life will be lost , putting a pinch on the the dozens of companies and hundreds of jobs it created .
“ We do n’t want to be in position to put together all this wonderful momentum and then tell them we ca n’t sustain them : ‘ Go away , ’ ” Michael Trahan , executive director of Solar Connecticut told the New York Times “ That ’s a serious hiccup that will take years to fix . ”
But Connecticut ’s clean energy fund has not entirely dried up , only the nifty cash - back rebate part of it has .
There is still funding available as part of the Connecticut Solar Lease program .
Now , I know , leasing is not the same as owning and may not be for everyone .
But the no-money - down solar leases can obviously be more economically viable for people who could not otherwise stomach the substantial up - front cost of buying and installing a solar PV system – if there are such people in Connecticut .

FORT CARSON , Colo . 
For the past several years , as this Army installation in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains became a busy way station for soldiers cycling in and out of Iraq , the number of servicemen implicated in violent crimes has raised alarm .
Nine current or former members of Fort Carson ’s Fourth Brigade Combat Team have killed someone or were charged with killings in the last three years after returning from Iraq .
Five of the slayings took place last year alone .
In addition , charges of domestic violence , rape and sexual assault have risen sharply .
Prodded by Senator Ken Salazar , Democrat of Colorado , the base commander began an investigation of the soldiers accused of homicide .
An Army task force is reviewing their recruitment , medical and service records , as well as their personal histories , to determine if the military could have done something to prevent the violence .
The inquiry was recently expanded to include other serious violent crimes .
Now the secretary of the Army , Pete Geren , says he is considering conducting an Army - wide review of all soldiers “ involved in violent crimes since returning ” from Iraq and Afghanistan , according to a letter sent to Mr. Salazar in December .
Mr. Geren wrote that the Fort Carson task force had yet to find a specific factor underlying the killings , but that the inquiry was continuing .
Incredible footage of nature at its best .

" We were looking at two large bodies of fires that neither of us in our 33 - year careers had ever seen anything that enormous . "
– FDNY Chief of Safety Albert Turi – Source
" It was the most unbelievable sight I ever saw , up until that point .
I had been in some very busy units during my time in the fire department .
I broke in , in Engine 46 and Ladder 27 in the South Bronx when the South Bronx was burning down .
I was in Rescue 3 , which was extremely busy ; they covered the Bronx and Harlem .
And then as a lieutenant , I was in the Lower East Side when that was burning down .
As a captain , I was in Chinatown .
I saw some unbelievable fires in Chinatown .
What I saw pales in comparison ( sic ) to anything else I had seen previously . "

9/11 conspiracists desperately try to force reality to fit their beliefs .
Rational people know that wo n't work .
Conspiracists do n't care .
Their goal is to perpetuate the conspiracy theory , not to find the truth .
One of their most reprehensible methods – which I have spent hundreds of hours combating – is misrepresentation of 9/11 eyewitness accounts .
A dramatic and maddening example is the sad story of former FDNY firefighter John Schroeder , whose deeply confused account was egregiously misused by conspiracist interviewers who knew enough to clear up his confusion butto remain silent .
The most common conspiracist misuse of eyewitness accounts involves descriptions of loud noises in and around the Twin Towers .
" Controlled demolition " theorists claim that such descriptions indicate that explosive devices were at work in the towers , even , for some unfathomable reason , long before the collapses .
To them , all descriptions are literal and figures of speech do n't exist .
When Hursley Lever , who was in the north tower basement when flight 11 hit , said " I heard a bomb , " but then explained that he thought the noise was a transformer explosion and went back to work , conspiracists will focus on " bomb " and omit the rest .
In 2005 , north tower janitor William Rodriguez changed his story and began publicly claiming that he believes explosives were used in that tower , somewhere from one to seven seconds before flight 11 struck .
His new story is not supported by any evidence and is contradicted by eyewitnesses and by physical evidence .
Read about Rodriguez 's many false statements and his refusal to adjust his beliefs to the facts here In 2006 , " Scholars for Truth and Justice " members Gordon Ross ( a mechanical engineer ) and Craig Furlong wrote a paper in which they claim to have found seismographic proof that a large explosion occurred at the WTC , 14 seconds before flight 11 's impact .
While ignoring the obvious fact that this supposed massive explosion was undetected by every person and alarm there , and ignoring the fact that the seismographers who recorded and analyzed the data say it does not show explosions , Ross and Furlong based their entire paper on a laughably bad error : they misread the seismograph 's timeline .
This typical truther ineptitude passed " peer review " at Steven Jones ' Journal of 9/11 Studies , and the paper remains online and uncorrected , although its authors were advised of their error .
Such is the willful ignorance of these people who claim to stand for the truth .
( Note : Craig Furlong has since admitted his errors , retracted that claim , and joined the side of rationalism , but the paper remains online . )
What about explosions or sounds like explosions before the towers collapsed , as the fires progressed ?
Such would not be surprising , and perhaps would be expected .
During the huge fire in Madrid 's Windsor building ( during which the structural steel that was on the fire floors failed , leaving the building 's concrete core exposed ) , " Explosions could be heard within the building and authorities cordoned off a zone some 500 metres in diameter in case it should collapse .
" Needless to say , that building was not hit by an airliner , nor were explosive devices suspected to be at work .
In the towers there were partial floor collapses , falling elevators , likely debris falling down elevator shafts , fuel vapors igniting , bursting pipes , and perhaps steel failing , electrical systems shorting , and pressurized containers from the buildings and aircraft exploding .
None of these things would be surprising during such events .
As veteran firefighters said , Following are 16 WTC first responder descriptions of explosive noises well before the towers collapsed : " Sounded like bombs " – Keith Murphy " A huge explosion " – Gerard Gorman " Sound of popping and exploding " – Alwish Monchery " Explosions " – William Burns " Kept hearing these large boom , boom " – Rosario Terranova " Sounded like explosions . "
– Anthony Fitzgerald
" Like a shotgun going off " – Mark Meier " Sounded like explosions " – Wilfred Barriere " Sounded like bombs , like blockbusters " – John Murray " You could hear explosions " – Richard Smiouskas " Sounded like an M - 80 , that 's how loud they were " – Tim Pearson " Sounds like a shotgun " – Eric Ronningen " Sounded like an explosion " – John Morabito " There were lots of explosions " – Jeff Birnbaum " Under the assumption that the sounds were secondary bombs . "
– Andrew Rodriguez " Sounded like bombs .
Like a bomb going off .
I mean , it was huge . "
– FDNY Deputy Chief Peter Hayden
It would be dishonest of me to represent these accounts as anything but what they are : descriptions of bodies from the towers hitting the ground .
But members of the 9/11 " truth " movement have no such compunction about misrepresenting dozens of other eyewitness accounts .
David Ray Griffin , in his book , and Dylan Avery , in hisvideos , use the account of Teresa Veliz , whom they say was in the north tower , to support their claims that explosives were planted in the towers .
From
Veliz went down a staircase with a coworker to the concourse level .
In the mall , they got onto an up - escalator as the South Tower collapsed , causing a rush of wind which knocked them down .
In the pitch black , Veliz and her coworker followed someone carrying a flashlight :
" The flashlight led us into Borders bookstore , up an escalator and out to Church Street .
There were explosions going off everywhere .
I was convinced that there were bombs planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons .
I was afraid to go down Church Street toward Broadway , but I had to do it .
I ended up on Vesey Street .
There was another explosion .
And another .
I did n't know where to run . "
Mike Athemas , a 46 - year - old volunteer fireman , headed downtown once the bomb went off and did n't leave until midafternoon .
" Everywhere you turned , there was someone taking bodies out of the rubble , " he said .
Making matters worse , documents that had been blown from the building were catching fire and igniting vehicles outside the World Trade Center .
" There were 20 cars and trucks -- police cars and emergency vehicles -- on fire , " said Mr. Athemas .

" Then you could see little fires , like paper fires .
... I remember just walking up that block .
That first block , all the cars were on fire .
They were n't totally engulfed in flames , but there was fire on them and their tires were exploding .
Walking up that block , everything was quiet except for the explosions of tires and stuff like that . "
– Firefighter James Murphy , FDNY oral testimony transcripts
" On the southwest corner of Vesey and West , there was a parking lot that was just roaring .
Every car was transmitting to the next car . "
– Firefighter Kevin Monahan , FDNY oral testimony transcripts
" The Scott cylinders [ firefighters ' air packs ] and the oxygen cylinders were all letting go .
They were blowing up left and right . "
– Firefighter Todd Heaney , FDNY oral testimony transcripts
" We continued our efforts until the combination of dust , smoke , and secondary explosions along with reports of gas main leaks , bombs , small arms fire and buildings about to collapse forced us to again relocate further north on West Street . "
– PAPD Lt. Daniel Carbonaro , PAPD 9/11 after - action reports
The New York firefighter 's account on Thursday sounded like his worst nightmare .
" It was like snow flakes coming down , with no one around , " 53 - year - old Ernie Armstead said .
" The ambulance blew up , then the fire truck blew up , six police cars blew up , one after the other .
" I was in shock .
I was in smoke and the debris . "

Veliz was n't in the north tower then .
She was on the street and was describing eventsthe collapse of the south tower , as reported in Dean Murphy ’s book .
Note what Griffin and Avery dishonestly omit in order to give a false impression : What would have been exploding on the street after the south tower collapse ?
Many things :
The report above , which was written for the Associated Press on 9/11/01 , says " once the bomb went off , " but that is either a reporter 's misunderstanding in the heat of the moment , or a figure of speech .
The AP does not claim that any bombs were used .
The collapses , truther denial , Graeme MacQueen 's " 118 witnesses " paper
1 ) In discussing my " not a demolition " video , conspiracist " LastChild " insists that the enormous detonations that would have been necessary to do what the truthers say was done to the towers , were either drowned out by other noises or were somehow removed by the audio circuitry in all the video cameras that recorded the events .
He stands by this insistence despite the fact that my video shows many demolitions in which much smaller detonations are resoundingly captured by video cameras– and in every case they are much louder than the collapses themselves .
Then he arrogantly dismisses professionals who take the time to explain to him exactly why his claims are nonsense .
2) Conspiracist " thewholesoul " tells an outrageous lie : " the vast majority of firefighters testimony contend that explosives or secondary devices were used in the building . "
In fact , of the hundreds of firefighters who were on the scene , only one , John Schroeder , has claimed that he thinks explosives would explain the damage he saw .
As I detail in my paper linked at the top of this page , he made that statement only in 2007 , under very troubling circumstances , to interviewers who neglected to inform him that the " explosives " damage was caused by the collapse of the south tower – an event of which he was unaware .
3 ) Conspiracist " einsteen , " who is apparently a Dutch engineering student , made a short " counter " video to mine , in which the very first clip had fake audio of the north tower collapse , and in which none of the other clips contain anything like detonation sounds .
He then backpedals , says the " minor issue " of fakery has been removed , and says , " I do n't care about those distinct booms [ distinctly fake , that is ] , but the rumbling sound . "
When pressed to explain why a skyscraper collapse should n't make a rumbling sound , he remains silent .
Starting with the first week I got involved with 9/11 conspiracists , at least 20 times I 've asked them to describe what a skyscraper collapse should sound like , since they claim to know that it should n't sound like what we hear on the 9/11 recordings and what is described by hundreds of eyewitnesses .
Not a single conspiracist has answered that question .
4 ) Conspiracist and Swedish naval architect Anders Bjorkman , posting as " Heiwa , " first revises the laws of physics , then claims that photo and video evidence that plainly refutes his claims about the tower collapses are likely " Hollywood manipulations . "

And again .
And again .

Lessons not learned
Now , people have tried to get me to describe what it was like while the collapse was happening .
It was a montage of different sounds and experiences .
The sounds were a combination of sounds .
This building collapsed in what ’s called a pancake fashion .
In other words , one floor would hit another floor and would collapse that floor and then collapse the next floor .
And every time a floor would hit another floor , it created a loud boom and tremendous vibration .
The entire collapse of this 110 - story building took 13 seconds .
So it sounded like boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , boom , you know , like that .
And every time that happened , it shook the entire building .
It shook the whole floor .
So every time a floor would hit another floor , we ’d be literally bouncing off the floor .
We were being thrown around the stairway .
There was also this very loud sound of twisting steel all around our heads .
These massive steel beams and girders were just being twisted around our heads just like they were twist ties on a loaf of bread .
And a very loud , like a steel screeching sound , almost like a lot of trains coming into a subway station at the same time and all of them hitting their brakes at the same time .
There was tremendous air movement with the building coming down .
The air movement was so strong that one of my fireman was standing on the fourth floor .
You ’ve got to figure with his gear and everything on , he ’s well over 200 pounds .
He ’s about 180 pounds and with his gear , you gotta figure he ’s about 250 pounds .
This wind kind of picked him up and threw him down two fights of stairs .
We were getting hit with all kinds of debris .
Thank God it was nothing that was going to really hurt us , but after it was all over , it was almost like we kind of got mugged .
We were all bruised up and small cuts and things like that .
And then the collapse stopped .
In a day of first experiences for everybody , well here ’s another one .
I ca n’t believe we just survived that .
It was very quick and during the collapse you could n’t help but think that this is it .
It ’s over .
This is how it ends .
I kept waiting for that big beam to hit or that big piece of concrete to come down and crush us .
It never came .

In one of the most bizarre rationalizations attempted by a 9/11 truther , Dr. Steven E. Jones posits that the vehicles ( and somehowthe vehicles ) at the WTC may have been set aflame by " thermate residue . "
Dr. Jones , why not just strap on wings , rap your magic wand against the basement paneling three times , and proclaim that " bad pixie dust " was responsible ?
Conspiracists sometimes try to pass off a video snippet of a firefighter saying " there 's a bomb in that building " as referring to the towers .
It does n't .
The firefighter was standing outside Stuyvesant High School , which had been used as a staging area and was the site of one of the many false alarm bomb scares that day .
Many firefighters mentioned this in their oral testimonies .
First responders were trained to be on the lookout for secondary devices after a terrorist attack .
Stuyvesant was also the site of a reported gas main leak : another false alarm .
See videos of the Stuyvesant bomb scare here and here My video World Trade Center Not a Demolition shows how 9/11 truthers desperately try to hide the fact that there were no detonations at all preceding or during the three skyscraper collapses .
It also shows the wildly absurd explanations that many leading conspiracists give for easily - explainable events .
The wind created by the collapses pushed clouds of dust down the streets , as rational people would expect to happen .
Conspiracists say these dust clouds were " pyroclastic flows " – high temperatureevents .
I could give several hundred examples of similar truther retreat into denial and fantasy .
Four examples from the JREF forum , in the past week alone , are representative : These are desperate people , whose inability to face reality results in lying , dismissal of expertise , dismissal of evidence , refusal to answer simple questions , and retreat into fantasy .
They are excellent representatives of the 9/11 " truth " movement , which is nothing more than a club for intellectual cowards .
One of the most commonly - cited conspiracist works is Graeme MacQueen's " 118 Witnesses : The Firefighters ' Testimony to Explosions in the Twin Towers , " which is fittingly published in that compendium of breathtaking ineptitude , the " Journal of 9/11 Studies . "
MacQueen , who calls himself " a scholarly sort of guy , " reveals either his agenda , his incompetent scholarship , or both , in the title of his paper , which properly should be called " Firefighters ' testimony which includes words like " explosion " to describe events at the World Trade Center . "
Says MacQueen , " I believe most of the terms on which my research focuses , such as “ explosion ” and “ bomb , ” are less subject to ambiguity .
" Really ?
Let 's look at the accounts MacQueen includes of firefighters who use the words " bomb , " " explosives , " " secondary devices , " etc .
He lists 31 such accounts .
Here 's my analysis :
To date I have reviewed over 600 accounts by people who described what the tower collapses looked and sounded like .
Only 11 % used terms like " explosion . "
Again ( and this can't be stressed enough ) the recordings conclusively disprove the truther claims that explosive detonations brought down the towers , pulverized concrete to powder , and tossed tons of steel around the site like matchsticks .
That simply did n't happen .
Far too numerous to list here are the accounts of firefighters who were in the north tower when the south collapsed and had no idea what was happening because they could not see the other tower .
Almost all assumed that some other event was responsible for the tremendous shaking , noise , and wind they experienced , and their accounts , , reflect that confusion and those assumptions .
Those of us who did n't live through that terror can never know what it was like , but the following notes will give a small idea of the tremendous confusion and " fog of war " experienced by the first responders , as collected in the FDNY oral testimony transcripts
That paints a picture of massive confusion , ( which was enhanced by poorly - working FDNY radios , the abandonment of the OEM center in WTC 7 , and nearly nonexistent inter-agency communications ) .
Some first responders did n't know that planes had hit the buildings .
Some thought the second plane strike was a bomb blast .
Many thought the south tower collapse was a plane strike .
Some fleeing from the south tower collapse did n't know the building was coming down and thought an explosion had happened .
Some on the scene during and long after the collapses did not know that the towers had fallen .
Some did n't learn the sequence of events until days and weeks later .
Sixafter the 9/11 , John Schroeder did n't know that the south tower had collapsed before the north .
E.M.T. Patricia Ondrovic 's accounts are revealing .
She arrived on Vesey Street in her ambulance after the plane strikes and did not know that planes were responsible for the damage and fires she saw .
When the south tower collapsed , she heard a roar and saw people run , and instinctively ran also , but after only a few steps was caught by the debris cloud .
She did not know the tower was falling .
She tried to enter nearby WTC building 6 ( U.S. Customs Building ) but was waved away by security guards .
She saw flashes and heard popping noises along the ceiling of the lobby of building 6 and , even well after 9/11 , thought those were demolition explosives detonating .
As she headed west , she says an exploding car set her coat on fire .
Near the waterfront , she thought she saw a plane explode over New Jersey .
When she flagged down an ambulance , she asked to be driven out of the city .
She was terrorized .
Just as Teresa Veliz , on the street , was " convinced that bombs were planted all over the place and someone was sitting at a control panel pushing detonator buttons , " Patricia Ondrovic really thought she saw demolition explosives at work in building 6 .
Of course we know that did n't happen .
Demolition charges do n't make noises " They create enormous blasts and powerful pressure waves that would be deafening , unmistakable , destructive to property ( and certainly to windows ) , and likely fatal at close range .
There were security guards in the lobby where those flashes and pops were .
No one was killed there when the south tower collapsed .
The building stood ( although very heavily damaged by the north tower collapse and subsequent fires ) and afterwards was searched for victims , then examined by engineers to determine its stability and the best way to tear it down .
There was no attempted explosive demolition in building 6 , nor did bombs detonate there .
Ondrovic was simply confused .
Similar pops and flashes were seen low in the south tower as it collapsed from the top : perhaps these were electrical shorts .
The lesson for conspiracists ?
These accounts must be put in context and must not be used to support a fantasy that neither the first responders nor the audiovisual , seismic , or physical evidence support .
Grame MacQueen has not learned that lesson .
He falsely states , " Over 23 per cent of our group [ of 503 first responders ] are explosion witnesses . "
Further , his " explosion " category includes witnesses who describe the booming " pancaking " of floors as the collapses progressed , because the NIST investigation disproved floor " pancaking " as the cause of the collapse .
The proximate cause of the collapses was the failure of the east face of the south tower and the south face of north tower .
These failures caused the top sections of the towers to " pile drive " through the lower sections .
Out of ignorance or from a desire to deceive , MacQueen commits a common truther error : he conflates the cause of collapse initiation with the result of the continuation of the collapses , which of courseinvolve floors being sequentially pounded into each other by the huge , accelerating mass above .
FDNY Captain Jay Jonas , who survived in a 6th floor core stairwell of the north tower as the building collapsed around him , describes that experience : Again , to be clear : the collapses did n't start by floors breaking loose and pancaking into other floors , but floors were hit sequentially as the tops of the towers were pile - driven by gravity through the lower sections .
Below , a four - story tower section that " pancaked " into a block a few feet high .
Portions of the corrugated steel floor pans on which the floor concrete rested are visible .
Loose Change , MacQueen is content to publicly state that because all these FDNY first responders do not support the conspiracist claims , they all must have succumbed to " persuasion " to change their minds about what killed 343 of their brothers and friends and to never speak of it again .
real cause of the WTC collapses .
Contrast these ignorant conspiracist opinions with the reality of the firefighter unions ' public claims after a 2007 fire at 130 Liberty Street killed two firefighters :

Firefighters and their unions do n't hesitate to demand that safety issues be addressed .
At Farrell 's bar in Brooklyn , which is a firefighter and cop hangout , I asked one of New York 's Bravest how he would respond to someone who said the 9/11 first responders were keeping quiet about what killed their brothers .
He laughed , shook his head , and said , " There better not be a
These are despicable accusations , similar to conspiracy nut James Fetzer 's condemning structural engineers to " a special place in hell " because they obviously are keeping quiet about thecause of the WTC collapses .

I 'd put it through his fucking skull . "
At the center of Farrell 's back bar stands a cross made from WTC steel and a portrait of longtime Farrell 's bartender Vinny Brunton , a FDNY Captain with Ladder 105 , who died on 9/11 .
Finally , MacQueen states , " The oral histories show that many people who originally thought they had witnessed critical explosions were later persuaded that they had not , and it appears that the pancake hypothesis was the main alternative they were offered . "
The oral histories show no such thing .
MacQueen offers no evidence – none – to support this assertion .
Like Jason Bermas of , MacQueen is content to publicly state that because all these FDNY first responders do not support the conspiracist claims ,
– The Higgins family : Retired FDNY Captain Ed , FDNY firefighter brothers Joe , Mike , and Bob , and NYPD Sergeant Mike , whose son and brother Timothy died on 9/11 .
– Lee Ielpi , one of the most decorated firefighters in FDNY history and his son , firefighter Brendan , whose son and brother Jonathan died on 9/11 .
– Captain John Vigiano , whose firefighter sons John and Joseph died on 9/11 .
– Jimmy Boyle , retired FDNY union president , whose firefighter son Michael died on 9/11 .
– Chief Jim Riches , whose son James died on 9/11 .
– Chief Eddie Schoales , whose son Thomas died on 9/11 .
– Captain Bill Butler , whose son Jonathan died on 9/11 .
– Battalion Chief Joe Pfeifer , whose brother Kevin died on 9/11 .
– Lieutentant Tommy Brunton , whose brother Vincent died on 9/11 .
– Lieutenant Dennis O'Berg , whose son Dennis died on 9/11 .
– Lieutenant Paul Geidel , whose son Gary died on 9/11 .
– Fire Patrolman Mike Angelini , whose firefighter brother Joseph and nephew Joseph Jr died on 9/11 .
– The Harrell family , whose firefighter brothers Stephen and Harvey died on 9/11 .
– The Haskell family , whose firefighter brothers Thomas and Timothy died on 9/11 .
– The Langone family , whose firefighter brothers Peter and Thomas died on 9/11 .
Mr. MacQueen , Mr. Bermas , Alex Jones ( a professional conspiracist and Executive Producer of Loose Change Final Cut ) , and the other conspiracists who make these accusations will never have the nerve to tell these people that they really should care more about what killed their loved ones :

Following are excerpts from an interview with PLO Ambassador to Lebanon Abbas Zaki , which aired on OTV on November 7 , 2008 .
Abbas Zaki :
We consider the U.S. to be an enemy because its only strategic alliance is with Israel .
Interviewer :
How could you possibly accept your enemy in your land ?
Abbas Zaki :
What do you mean ?
We meet even with Israel .
Interviewer : How can you consider Israel to be your enemy , if you signed a peace treaty with it ?
Abbas Zaki : Allow me ...
This enemy ...
If I had the capabilities of the U.S. – would I be fighting it or negotiating with it ?
Interviewer : Israel ceased being an enemy once you signed a peace treaty with it .
I do n’t know how it could be your enemy .
Do you talk to the Israelis as if they were your enemies ?
Do you talk to Israel as a friendly or enemy country ?
Abbas Zaki :
An enemy country , which owes us certain things .
The heroic Vietnamese used to negotiate with the French , while they were slaughtering them .
Interviewer : I can assure you that in his speeches , Abu Mazen says the U.S. is a friendly country .
Abbas Zaki :
Well , this is n’t true .
Perhaps Abu Mazen , in his position , needs to use diplomatic language , but he is the greatest critic of the U.S .

Every American citizen and every American company can do at least ' one thing ' to help another person or company in their community
founders of Innoventum™ , Inc. announce the creation and kick off of the " Jobs for Millions " campaign ( http://www.jobsformillions.org/).
To combat the staggering number of U.S. job losses and help stimulate the economy , " Jobs for Millions " plans to create 500,000 new American businesses and help 500,000 existing American businesses grow through a collective effort .
Ms. Gosnell , business owner and attorney in the unique position of being both an advocate for the regular Joe looking for a job and also a high tech attorney for global software companies , states , " We need to create our own bailout . "
She continues , " We can participate in the recession , or we can participate in growth and take our country back " .
To jump start the campaign , Innoventum is donating approximately $ 200,000 worth of business training and coaching products in the form of scholarships to 250 businesses spanning all 50 states , 50 of which will be brand new businesses started from scratch .
The business training products being donated include Innoventum 's newly - released BizFast training course on starting and operating a business , their soon - to - be - released BizCert training course on obtaining and leveraging minority , woman , and veteran - owned business certifications , and their soon - to - be- released BizMarketing training course .
Existing and new business owners are encouraged to apply for the " Jobs for Millions " scholarships online at http://www.innoventum.com/scholarships.html.
Ms. Gosnell and Ms. Berkshire recognize the economic challenges squeezing the nation , but they also recognize the " power of one " .
" Every American citizen and every American company can do at least ' one thing ' to help another person or company in their community , " Ms. Berkshire adds .
" With just a tiny bit of effort from everyone , we can create 500,000 new companies and help 500,000 existing companies grow and prosper . "
Along these lines , " Jobs for Millions " is asking each American citizen and American business to follow their lead and help stimulate the economy in any of the following ways :
Successful Businesses : Thriving businesses can add at least one new job that they had not otherwise planned on adding .
If unable to afford to add a new job to their company , they can give away some of their products or services for free to one or more people , or offer some free training to their industry .
People with Existing Jobs : Current employees can give their employer or another business some extra work that they are not paid for .
They can also donate time to a charity or talents to train others in their community .
Or , they can start a business and work towards generating revenue and creating even more jobs .
Struggling Businesses : Companies that are struggling can still find a way to help others by giving away one or more of their products or services for free , or by providing free training in their industry .
Unemployed Workers : Unemployed workers can spend some part time hours helping another entity in their community who needs help but cannot afford to pay anyone .
This can still be accomplished while seeking another job .
Senior Citizens or College Students :
Those on fixed incomes can also help by donating time or talent to charities , homeless shelters , food banks , hospitals , or nursing homes .
The U.S. Department of Labor reports that both the number of unemployed persons ( 10.3 million ) and the unemployment rate ( 6.7 percent ) continued to increase in November .
Those numbers are expected to rise dramatically with the looming automotive industry bankruptcy .
In fact , according to research conducted by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington , D.C. , bankruptcy for one or more U.S. auto - makers would result in the loss of up to 3.3 million jobs in the U.S. within the next year .
Michigan alone could lose over 400,000 jobs .
Production shutdown could impact as many as 147,000 jobs in Indiana ( where Innoventum is headquartered ) .
The report lists possible job losses in each state and the District of Columbia .
About Innoventum , Inc .
Frustrated by the lack of free and affordable resources for business owners and people looking to start and grow businesses , Innoventum , Inc. was founded in 2007 by two attorneys , Denise Gosnell and Jynell Berkshire .

The current line on the Super Bowl has the Pittsburgh Steelers favored by about a touchdown or so over the Arizona Cardinals .
The line may shift slightly in the hours leading up to kickoff , but you know Pittsburgh will be a clear favorite .
For something a little different , the Over / Under has been sitting at about 46 ½ - 47 if you want to bet the total score .
Of course , that ’s not the whole of Super Bowl betting .
Not by a long shot .
Let ’s examine some of the more ridiculous bets out there .
Some are truly bizarre , and most require zero knowledge of football or anything really .
If you ’re a degenerate gambler these are for you ( A quick note for gambling novices :
If the money line is negative , such as - 145 , then you have to wager $ 145 to win $ 100 .
This works for any negative number , you wager that much to win $ 100 .
If the money line is a positive number , then you will wager $ 100 to win the money line .
For example , if the money line is +145 then you wager $ 100 to win $ 145 . ) :
First we have the Coin Toss ( BetUS.com )
Heads : - 105
Tails : - 105
And also the Team to Win Coin Toss ( BetUS.com )
Steelers : - 105
Cardinals : - 105
At least both heads and tails are the same odds .
It would n’t make sense otherwise .
So maybe there is some logic to this whole thing .
Alright then , let ’s move on to Super Bowl predictions …
If Barack Obama picks a team to win Super Bowl XLIII during the Super Bowl Pre-Game show , will the President ’s pick be correct ?
( SportsBetting )
Yes : - 160
No : + 130
Will Matt Millen pick the correct team to win Super Bowl XLIII during the Pre-Game Show ?
( Bodog )
Yes : - 225
No : +185
Are we really going to trust Matt Millen over Barack Obama ?
Would you trust Matt Millen on anything ?
If Millen ’s right and Obama ’s wrong , does the world end ?
Speaking of disappointments like Matt Millen , Here ’s Bill Bidwill …
What Color will Bill Bidwill ’s bow tie be ( Bill Bidwill must wear a Bow Tie on Camera during the game for wager to have action ) ?
( Bodog )
Red : - 600
Any Other Color : +400
Really , the less Bill Bidwill seen the better .
Alright , let ’s move on to the National Anthem …
During the Singing of The Star Spangled Banner will Jennifer Hudson Lip - Sync any part of the Song ? ( SportsBetting )
Yes : +115
No : - 145
The question here is , how do you actually know if you ’ve won ?
Can you see lip - syncing through your television ?
It might not be so obvious .
At least this next bet has a firm winner …
How Long will it take Jennifer Hudson to Sing the Star Spangled Banner ( from starting note to last note sung ) ?
( SportsBetting )
Over 2 minutes and 1 second : - 155
Under 2 minutes and 1 second : + 125
I like the over on that one , but that ’s just me .
So the National Anthem is over , which means we get Al Michaels and John Madden talking at us .
They may or may not say anything worthwhile .
Any bets on them ?
Sure !
How many times will Al Michaels and John Madden reference Ben Roethlisberger as Big Ben during the Game ( Pre Game and Halftime do not count towards wager ) ?
( Bodog )
Over 5 Big Ben References : + 140
Under 5 Big Ben References : - 200
What Super Bowl Game Betting Line will Al Michaels alluded to or mention first during the Game ?
( Bodog )
Point Spread : - 500
Total : +350
How many food items will John Madden mention during the game ?
( Bodog )
Over 1.5 : - 280
Under 1.5 : +220
Too bad we probably wo n’t get Madden talking about his six - legged turkey .
Maybe instead he ’ll mention his great Popcorn Popper ?
Probably a no on that one too .
Let ’s just move on from Madden and assume we make it to halftime .
How about some Bruce Springsteen bets ?
Bruce Springsteen 1st song of the Halftime show ?
( BetUS )
Born in the USA : Even
The Rising : +500
The Wrestler : + 700
Radio Nowhere : +800
I ’m on Fire : + 1500
Born to Run : + 200
Glory Day : + 250
Halftime is over !
And for those of you ’ve that watched , you were treated to another act that was more relevant twenty years ago than today .
That ’s okay , I do n’t listen to much music of today anyway .
To this point you might notice I ’ve largely skipped bets on the game .
Those are n’t ridiculous enough on the whole .
Except with the refs .
You never know with them , and this has been a bad year overall for referees , so let ’s throw this one in …
What will be the result of the first coaches challenge in the game ( Wager is official once either coach challenges a play ?
( Bodog )
Play Overturned : EVEN
Play Stands : - 130
Given some of the calls this year , I do n’t know what ’s a good bet here .
So let ’s hope there ’s no major controversies and just fast forward to the end of the game .
You know when the Gatorade showers start to commence .
Which brings us to …
Time on the Game Clock When the Winning Team Attempts to Dump Gatorade on Head Coach ?
( SportsBetting )
Over 45 Seconds left in 4th Quarter : - 135
Under 45 Seconds left in 4th Quarter + 105
Not a totally crazy bet , so let ’s get more in depth on this Gatorade issue :
Color of Gatorade dumped on the Winning Head Coach ?
( BetUS )
Lime Green : + 400
Yellow : + 200
Orange : + 500
Red : +500
Clear / Water : + 650
Blue : - 130
Or you can take slightly different odds at Bodog :
Lime Green : + 450
Yellow : + 200
Orange : +300
Red : + 550
Blue : +900
Clear / Water : +115
Just a note , “ clear / water ” has been the winner in each of the last three Super Bowls .
Might be worth a shot , even if I ’m personally hoping for blue .
And one last Gatorade related bet …
What side of the ball with the Players that perform the Gatorade Shower be from ( Players must be holding a part or piece of the bucket to be counted towards wager .
If there are players from both sides of the ball involved in the actual dumping of Gatorade then Wagers are No Action ) ?
( Bodog )
Offensive : EVEN
Defensive : - 140
Damn those offensive players hogging all the Gatorade glory !
Okay , now the game is over .
Still a few bets to cover .
First , let ’s start with the commericals .
They ’ve all aired .
So who ’s the winner there ?
Higher Rated Super Bowl
Ad on USA Today ’s annual Ad Meter ? ( BetUS )
Go Daddy.com : +800
Coca - Cola : + 450
Pepsi : +325
Anheuser - Busch / Budweiser : - 150
McDonald ’s : +700
Doritos : +350
Any Other : + 200
Bud ’s always a good bet , but not much money to be made on that one .
What about the ratings ?
What will the TV Rating be ?
( BetUS )
Over 42 ½ Neilson Rating : +115
Under 42 ½ Neilson Rating :- 155
These are supposed to be smaller markets .
Not exactly New York and Boston from last year .
Maybe the under is a worthwhile bet ( like I really have any idea what ’s a good bet here ) ?
Whatever the correct answer is , let ’s make sure not to forget about Brenda Warner …
How Many Times will NBC show Brenda Warner on TV during the Game ( Live pictures only , Any Taped Pictures or Past Video does not count towards wager ) ?
( Bodog )
Over 2½ : + 135
Under 2½ : - 175
Which brings us to the MVP .
Not who will win .
That ’s not ridiculous enough .
How about who he thanks ?
Who will the Super Bowl MVP of the Game Thank First ?
( Bodog )
Coach : +900
Does n’t thank anyone : + 500
Family : + 400
God : - 125
Teammates : + 200
BetUS :
God : - 150
Coach : + 800
Family : + 400
Teammates : + 200
Does not thank anyone : + 500
I think you know where Kurt Warner is going first if he wins ( Hint : it ’s God ) .
He may pushing the odds on God a bit since he ’s a prime candidate to win MVP .
Only Ben Roethlisberger has better individual odds .
If you think the Steelers will win , maybe this is one instance where you bet against God ?
That is if he does n’t smite you .
Well that wraps up our rundown of ridiculous Super Bowl bets .
If you ’ve gotten this far , here ’s a table of actual spreads and over / unders of all the Super Bowls :
The mind - boggling amounts of the bailouts Congress has passed and is still debating , plus shocking Wall Street frauds , seem to have plunged some lawmakers into a silly season .
Ohio state legislators this month held a surprise hearing on a resolution calling for a national constitutional convention , and then canceled a vote after dozens of citizens showed up to speak against it .
We already have a U.S. Constitution that has withstood the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for more than two centuries , and we do n't need a new constitution .
There is nothing wrong with the one we have except that politicians are not obeying it and judges are indulging in too much activism .
The idea that adding new words to the Constitution to require balancing the federal budget , or to give President Barack Obama a line - item veto so he can veto the extravagant spending he has already endorsed , is delusional .
The only thing more outlandish is the fanciful notion that a 2009 constitutional convention ( colloquially known as a Con Con ) could adopt such requirements while avoiding other mistakes .
The most influential players in any new Con Con would be Big Media , giving us round - the - clock television coverage .
The 2008 presidential campaign proved that the media consider themselves actors in the political process , not merely reporters .
Outside of a Con Con hall , demonstrators would hold court demanding constitutional changes .
These would be staged by gay activists and their opponents , pro-abortionists and pro-lifers , radical feminists , environmentalists , gun-control advocates , animal rights extremists , D.C. statehood agitators , those who want to relax immigration and those who would restrict it , mortgage defaulters and the unions -- all demanding consideration of amendments to recognize their claimed rights .
Article V requires Congress to call a new Constitutional Convention to consider " amendments " ( note the plural ) if two - thirds ( 34 ) of the states pass resolutions calling for it .
There are no other rules in the Constitution or in federal law to list or limit a Con Con 's purpose , procedure , agenda or election of delegates .
The whole process would be a prescription for political chaos , controversy , confrontation , litigation and judicial activism .
Just about the only thing we can predict with certainty is that it could not be secret from the media and the public , as was the original 1787 Constitutional Convention .
Many prestigious constitutional authorities say it is impossible for Congress or anyone else to restrict what a Con Con does .
The late Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote , " There is no effective way to limit or muzzle the actions of a constitutional convention .
After a convention is convened , it will be too late to stop the convention if we do n't like its agenda . "
Powerful and politically active pressure groups , from both the right and the left , are working for other significant constitutional changes , including changes in the First Amendment 's treatment of religion , term limitation and modifying our separation of powers ( which they call " gridlock " ) in order to move us toward a parliamentary form of government .
It is not credible that politically active groups would pass up the chance to force a Con Con to vote for their special interest .
It 's not believable that the powerful forces working to take away our right to own guns would overlook a golden opportunity to rescind the Second Amendment .
The confusion , uncertainty and court cases involved in a Con Con would make us look foolish in the eyes of the world .
A constitutional convention could not be the formula to restore respect for our government when a Con Con would start off making the world wonder if our American system of government will survive .
There is no public support across America for a constitutional convention .
A flurry of pro-Con Con activity during the Jimmy Carter administration died out .
No state has passed a Con Con resolution in the last 25 years .
During the 1980s , five states voted down a call for a Con Con , and three states repealed their earlier Con Con resolutions .
The miracle of our great United States Constitution is that it has lasted for 220 years , accommodating our great geographic and economic expansion and political problems , while preserving individual liberties .
We are now witnessing , following November 's election , how Americans are peacefully accepting a transfer of power from one party to the other .
I do n't see any James Madisons , George Washingtons , Ben Franklins or Alexander Hamiltons around today who could do as good a job as was done in 1787 , and I 'm very concerned about the politicians who think they can improve on our Founding Fathers .
Ohio state legislators will make themselves a national laughingstock if they persist in the foolish pursuit of a new constitutional convention .
OpenOffice.org 3.1 is 65 days away , and developers are finishing up more than 1000 issues targeted for this Microsoft Office killer packing an army of new features , enhancements , and bug fixes .
Antialiased drawings
By far , the most requested feature in this release is anti-aliasing , which smooths edges of diagonal lines .
On the left is OpenOffice.org 3.0 , and the right is OpenOffice.org 3.1 .
Both images are enlarged to show detail .
Drawing primitives ( including lines , circles , and charts ) are antialiased in Calc , Draw , Impress , and Writer .
Antialiasing is supported in editing and export modes , but not yet in full - screen mode .
Solid dragging
Drawing objects are further improved through the new solid dragging feature .
Before only a wireframe was shown ; now a 50 % transparent copy is painted .
Translucent selections in Writer
OpenOffice.org 3.0 brought eye candy for selections to Calc , and OpenOffice.org 3.1 brings the same eye candy to Writer .
Compare the un-highlighted text ( top ) to selections in Writer 3.0 ( middle ) and in Writer 3.1 ( bottom ) :
Chart axes and labels
When charting negatives values , Calc would always draw the axes and their labels at the outermost edges .
That 's unnatural compared to the way we were taught in school : the labels should cross the axes at zero .
Now there is a new set of options to place the axes and labels wherever is convenient .
Take for example this XY scatterplot ( shown in OpenOffice.org 3.0 without antialiasing ) :
In OpenOffice.org 3.1 set the position of axes and their labels in the new properties dialog tab called Positioning :
The result is a more familiar chart :
Outline levels
Technical writers can now can define outline level and numbering style independently for each paragraph ( or paragraph style ) .
This feature is useful for creating a sophisticated table of contents .
Replying to notes
OpenOffice.org 3.0 introduced notes in the margin , and in 3.1 collaborators can carry discussions through these notes .
Notice any text that is highlighted when the Reply option is selected becomes a citation ( like quoting an email ) .
Increase font size button
Two new buttons accelerate the process of increasing and decreasing the font size in Impress presentations .
Grammar checking
OpenOffice.org 3.1 incrementally improves the grammar checking infrastructure .
Version 3.0 allowed the LanguageTool extension to provide as - you - type - your - mistakes - are - underlined - in - blue grammar checking , and version 3.1 extends the spell checking dialog for grammar checking .
Overlining
You can be " overwhelmed , " so can you be " underwhelmed " too ?
Yes , and likewise to underlining , now you overline characters too .
Stranger yet , it turns out overlining has practical uses including repeating decimals , line segments , high energy physics , logic , and electronics
Hyperlinks management
When you type a web site address , OpenOffice.org automatically converts it to a clickable hyperlink .
Many people do n't know how to convert it back to regular text .
( The methods include Undo , CTRL+Z ; Default Formatting , CTRL+M ; and disabling URL recognition in AutoCorrect . )
Now there is a more obvious method : the context menu ( also know as a right - click menu ) features the new commands Open Hyperlink , Edit Hyperlink , Copy Hyperlink Location , and Remove Hyperlink .
Accept tracked changes
Collaborators will enjoy the new context menu facilitating acceptance or rejection of recorded changes .
Control slideshow media
Before OpenOffice.org would play any movies and audio when the slide opened , but Impress 3.1 can flexibly start , pause , and stop media using custom animation effects .
Sorting improvements
A - B - C - D - E - F - G.
You would think there is n't much left to do with sorting , but OpenOffice.org 3.1 brings no less than four improvements to sorting cells in Calc .
They are keeping cell notes with their contents , identifying the default column for the sort toolbar buttons , not sorting column headers , and stable sorting .
In previous versions , the unstable sorting would yield random results in certain situations .
Missing values
There is a new option to determine how missing values will be handed in charts .
Macros in Base
OpenOffice.org
Base gets a huge boost now that OpenOffice.org 3.1 allows macros in .odb files .
Furthermore , Base macros can be bound to events .
Helping it compete with Microsoft Access , Base developers will save time and enjoy new possibilities such as creating navigation forms ( called switchboards in Access ) .
SQL syntax highlighting
SQL is a first - class citizen in Base .
In OpenOffice.org 3.1 the SQL editor highlights SQL syntax , which is helpful for finding typos such as a missed quotation mark .
Relative database paths
The paths of spreadsheet and dBase files serving as databases can be stored relatively in .odb files .
This feature makes it easier to share these databases across machines , networks , and especially across operating systems .
See more new features in Base .
Internationalization
People whose native languages are Hebrew or Arabic will delight in OpenOffice.org 3.1's the RTL improvements .
Foremost , controls can now be RTL .
Also , prominent new buttons on the toolbar ( next to paragraph alignment ) make it easy to mix RTL and LTR text .
RTL settings are honored throughout OpenOffice.org — now including charts text elements , HTML export , Impress slide view , and page preview .
See also " RTL related issues fixed in OpenOffice.org 3.1 " .
Speed

Some companies press the algae like olives , physically squeezing the oil out .
Others apply compressed carbon dioxide , which vaporizes the lipids until the pressure is lowered and the oil recondenses away from the remaining cell .
Other methods include solvents that remove the lipids , or sonic waves that burst the algae and cause the oil to spill out .
The remaining parts of the algae cells can be used in other products , including animal feed .

High principal 's letter home to parents about student victims
Investigators say they do n't know what led a 24 - year - old Milwaukie man to allegedly fire on a crowd outside a popular underage downtown Portland nightclub Saturday night , killing two teenage girls in a Rotary Club exchange program and wounding seven others in what authorities say is the worst mass shooting in the city 's history .
Police Chief Rosie Sizer called the shooting " a random act of violence of the kind that makes you despair for America .
" Rotary International officials said they could n't remember any incident in the exchange program 's history that matched the level of violence inflicted on the group of foreign students Saturday night .
They called it a " tragic irony " that such a thing could happen to students who come to this country to foster world understanding and peace .
" I can't recall anything comparable to this at all , " said Wayne Hearn , a spokesman for Rotary International North America .
" The kids look at this as an experience of a lifetime .
Something like this is an aberration . "
Ashley Lauren Wilks , a 16 - year - old Clackamas High School sophomore who was set to spend her junior year in France or Spain , died at the scene .
Marta Paz De Novoa , 17 , from Arequipa , Peru , who was living with a host family in White Salmon , Wash . , died at OHSU Hospital .
Another exchange student was in critical condition .
The gunman , identified as Erik Salvador Ayala of Milwaukie , put the gun to his own head after shooting nine people .
He was in critical condition at Legacy Emanuel Hospital .
Suspect called quiet , video game fan
Erik Salvador Ayala was a quiet man with an interest in computers and video games , not guns or nightclubs , his friend and roommate said Sunday .
Ayala 's mysterious appearance and alleged shooting spree outside a downtown Portland club Saturday night shocked and mystified his friends , said Mike Delisle , Ayala 's roommate .
He said he had no idea why his roommate went downtown Saturday night and he does n't think Ayala knew any of the victims .
" It was a big surprise .
I did n't see it coming , " said Delisle , who attended Keizer 's McNary High School with Ayala .
" He was a quiet person .
He kept to himself . "
Ayala did not frequent dance clubs , such as The Zone , Delisle said .
Ayala was not a violent person , did not own a gun and never showed an interest in firearms , he said .
Ayala had worked for the state of Oregon as a contract employee about two years ago .
Since then he has worked for temporary employment agencies , Delisle said .
In high school , Ayala was in the McNary band and was a bit of a practical joker .
He kept to himself and was hesitant to show his emotions , Delisle said .
One of the things that brought him joy was playing video games such as " Resistance : Fall of Man , " in which an Army Ranger fights an alien race that is trying to take over the world , or " Left 4 Dead , " where the object is to slay fighting zombies .
Half a dozen criminalists converged on a Milwaukie apartment Sunday afternoon to shoot video , take still photographs and examine Ayala 's home .
The apartment is among 18 in four buildings that make up a small complex on Southeast 32nd Avenue .
The police said Sunday evening that Ayala , 24 , was the man who shot nine people Saturday night .
He shot himself afterward and was in critical condition Sunday night .
Earlier on Sunday , a police video photographer went alone into the small apartment for more than 30 minutes , then the other forensic officers , pulling on rubber gloves , entered as well .
Ayala 's neighbors said the complex draws students and other short - term tenants who generally do n't speak anything more than pleasantries to each other .
Esther Ramirez , 24 , who moved into the apartment directly above Ayala 's eight months ago , said she had seen a woman who appeared to be Ayala 's girlfriend coming out of Ayala 's apartment ; she said she thinks the girlfriend is deaf because Ayala communicated with her with American Sign Language .
Jake Moreland , 15 , and his mother , Renee , 48 , live in an apartment directly across a small courtyard from Ayala .
Renee Moreland said she saw police officers around the Ayala building well into Sunday morning ; she said she was stunned to know the possible reasons for the police interest .
" He was really quiet , " she said .
" I just can't believe this is happening . "
Records show that Erik Salvador Ayala once lived in Keizer at the same address as Salvador and Mildred Ayala in a one - story , ranch - style home in a working - class neighborhood .
No one answered the door at the white house with blue trim Sunday afternoon .
There was a car and a pickup in the driveway .
Neighbors say the Ayalas are a nice family , willing to help out if they can .
They are quiet , no complaints , said Sidney Mosley , who lives next door .
Mosley has lived in the neighborhood for two years and said the Ayalas were there when she moved in .
Mosley said she knows the mom does n't speak a lot of English .
There is a girl who goes to high school and boys living there , though Mosley does n't know how many boys or their names .
She thinks one of the boys works for Target .
Told that one of the sons may have been involved in a shooting in Portland , she said : " I would n't have thought anything like that . "
A neighbor across the street said she found it " incredibly hard to believe " that one of the boys from the Ayala family would be involved .
The neighbor did not want to be named and was not willing to give information other than to confirm that Salvador and Mildred Ayala lived across from her .
She said the Ayala kids have helped her out when her car was broken and also helped her with her computer .

Police located a car registered to Ayala on the east side of Southwest Fourth Avenue , across from the Multnomah County courthouse .
Half a dozen police also converged on Ayala 's Milwaukie apartment on Southeast 32nd Avenue on Sunday afternoon to search for clues .
The teens were among a group of 11 students from the Rotary District 5100 Youth Exchange program on a social outing organized by a host parent to celebrate a Guatemalan student 's birthday .
The exchange students came from France , Italy , Ecuador , Guatemala and Taiwan and were being hosted by families in Oregon and Washington .
Besides the two students killed , four other exchange students in the group were wounded .
" Apparently , they all felt the place they were going to go ( The Zone nightclub ) was well - established and a very reputable place , " said Chuck Itoh , chairman of the student exchange program .
By Sunday afternoon , parents of at least two of the foreign students wounded were en route to Oregon , while the Rotary Club was working to arrange housing and counseling for the students and host families .
Sizer extended her sympathies to the victim 's families .
" I think what we all want now is answers .
We are working to get those .
...
It 's the randomness as well as the scale that is outside of anything that we know of in the past . "
Rotary Club members , host families and school officials in at least two different states and families worldwide were devastated , struggling to understand how a celebratory night out could have turned so tragic .
" It 's deeply saddening for us .
One of our top priorities is always the safety and well - being of the youth exchange participants , " said Scott Bieber , youth protection officer for Rotary District 5100 , which encompasses northern Oregon and southwestern Washington .
" When something like this happens , it hurts us all , it saddens us all .
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of the deceased and the injured students . "
Police say they have n't found any connection between Ayala , who fired at least eight to 10 rounds outside The Zone on Southwest Second Avenue before shooting himself in the head , and the group of exchange students , who were waiting outside to get into the club .
Court records show Ayala had no criminal record in Oregon other than a speeding ticket in 2004 .
A teenage performer at The Zone , 16 - year - old Jalontae Howard , who was outside the club , was shot in the ankle .
The general manager of the nearby Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub , Brad Yoast , was shot in the stomach , possibly by a bullet that ricocheted , and had surgery overnight .
Never inside club
Police said the gunman walked to the Southwest Second Avenue block outside The Zone and started firing .
They did n't believe he was ever inside the club , and they did n't know of any relationship between him and any of the victims .
William Kennedy , 17 , with Team Promotions , was inside The Zone , talking beside the bar near the front entrance when suddenly he heard , " pow , pow , pow , pow . "
He said he ducked under a bar ledge , and when the gunfire subsided , he looked out front .
" I just see two girls down , laying outside .
Two pairs of feet by the front doorway , " Kennedy said .
" They had just been waiting outside on line to get in . "
He said he saw the club 's DJ outside administering CPR on one of the victims .
Kennedy said he heard at least five gunshots above the hip - hop music blaring inside .
" That 's scary stuff , " said Kennedy , as he dragged nervously on a cigarette outside the club shortly after the shootings .
David Little and his son Bryan of Gold Beach were at Kells after the Trail Blazers game Saturday night .
" We heard ' pop , pop , pop , pop and bam ... , " David Little said , thinking that the " bam " sound might have been the bouncer 's lectern falling to the ground outside .
He looked outside and said he saw a young man injured , likely the shooter .
" The young man was crouched down between two cars just outside Kells , " David Little said .
He said Kells ' bouncer shoved people inside the door of the bar .
Dominique Howard , 19 , was in The Zone at the time of the shootings .
He posted a MySpace bulletin asking for prayers for his brother , Jalontae , 16 , a Centennial High School student . : " i witnessed 2 girls get killed my head is going crazy im bugging out . "
John Plew , an owner of The Zone , was at the Blazers game with fellow owner Dan Lenzen when he heard about the shootings .
Plew said the club provides a safe place for kids to go and dance and called it a horrible , random event .
Jeff Vaudt , who lives in an apartment nearby , was watching a movie at home when he said he heard at least eight to 10 shots .
" It just had to be a good - sized gun , just by the sound of it .
They were deep , deep sounds . "
Customer screams
Viyarda Marson , a waitress at the E - San Thai Cuisine across the street from The Zone , said diners heard the shootings .
One customer stood up , screaming that she just saw a man shoot himself .
Marson said she saw the gunman fall to the ground .
At least one member of a wedding party that was being held above Kells later clamored for information from police officers about what had just occurred .
Matt Utterback , Clackamas High School principal , said at least five of the school 's students , including Wilks and an 18 - year - old critically injured Italian exchange student , Susy De Sousa , were at the club Saturday night .
He called Wilks an honors student who competed on the swim team and De Sousa a friendly spirit with a good sense of humor .
" This random act of violence has cut short a young life and threatened another , " Utterback said , referring to the two Clackamas High students .
" Such a horrific act is impossible to accept or understand . "
The Rotary District 5100 Youth Exchange committee met for three hours Sunday afternoon .
Members were focused on supporting students , host families and the parents of the deceased and wounded children .
Duane Vaubel , vice chair of the committee , called it an " extreme tragedy . "
" It should not have happened .
It 's an unavoidable situation from our standpoint , " Vaubel said .
The Rotary youth exchange organizers suspect the program might falter in the wake of the violence but remained committed to its future .
" I do n't think you can have a tragedy of this magnitude without having a certain amount of impact , " Bieber said .
" We 're going to work as hard as we can to minimize any negative effect it might have on the program because Rotary believes wholeheartedly in its commitment to advance world understanding , good will and peace .
We feel strongly that this exchange program does that . "
Though Central Precinct police have five officers and a sergeant dedicated to the downtown entertainment district , chief Sizer said it 's impossible to develop a patrol strategy for " something that is so unexpected , so random and so violent . "

Profiles of the shooting victims
Victims of Saturday night 's shooting include six foreign Rotary Exchange students and three Americans .
Three other exchange students attending Clackamas High School were with the group at the Zone but were not hit by gunfire .
Ashley Wilks , 16 , a sophomore at Clackamas High School , who was killed Saturday , was planning to spend her junior year in France .
Neighbors of the Wilks family said Ashley was a straight - A student who was planning to go on an exchange trip to France next year .
The girl was close to her older brother , Justin , who also attends Clackamas High .
The family moved to Happy Valley from Colorado a couple of years ago and likes to go skiing and rafting .
" I can't believe it , of all the people , so much promise , " said a neighbor who asked that his name not be used .
" She was like the ideal daughter . "
A 17 - year - old girl from Arequipa , Peru , who was killed , has been hosted since September by a family in White Salmon , Wash .
Janet McCutcheon , principal of Columbia High School in White Salmon , said she was a nice girl but quiet .
She was kind of shy because she had not quite mastered English and worried about making mistakes when she spoke .
McCutcheon said she believed that she had completed her schooling in Peru before coming to White Salmon but was listed as a junior at the high school , as are all foreign exchange students .
She went through the Portland Rotary Exchange program .
The school has an exchange student from White Salmon in the girl 's hometown in Peru .
Brad Yoast , 44 , general manager of Kells Irish Restaurant & Pub , was talking to security just outside the restaurant when he was shot in the stomach , possibly by a ricochet .
Lucille McAleese , owner of Kells , said he had surgery overnight .
She said he is expected to make a complete recovery .
Jalontae Howard , 16 , was recovering Sunday night after being shot in the right ankle .
Howard is a junior at Centennial High School and an accomplished dancer .
He and his older brother , Dominique , are both members of a krumping dance group called the Snubb Family .
They have performed all over the West Coast .
Jalontae Howard , the youngest in the group , is nicknamed " Looney Snubb " because of his comedic dance style .
The Snubb crew hang out frequently at the Zone and often participate in dance competitions .
His dancing is so popular at Centennial High , he told The Oregonian last year , that during lunch " they wo n't even let me eat .
They 're always asking me to krump . "
Krumping is a dance that started in California as an alternative to gangs .
Howard and his dance partners are all avowed Christians .
Anne Sophie Rialland , 16 , of Lebaule , France , is going to West Linn High School .
Rialland told her student newspaper that she lives with her parents , a 14 - year - old sister and two cats in her hometown .
She also said that her favorite food is French cheese and her favorite movie is " Lost in Translation . "
Her school in France was small , with only 100 students .
No hospital would confirm Sunday that she was a patient .
Susy De Sousa , 18 , from Italy , who is a senior at Clackamas High School , was shot multiple times and is critcally injured .
" This is a significant tragedy to our school community , " said Matt Utterback , principal of Clackamas High .
" It certainly is a tragedy to those families .
It 's unimaginable what those families must be going through right now .
Our goal is supporting our students and our staff , and we are making plans to do so . "
Utterback said he planned to notify students , parents and staff Sunday night .
Counselors will be available at the school starting today .
Ana Zambrano , of Puerto Viejo , Ecuador , is attending Glencoe High School in Hillsboro .
She is in fair condition at OHSU Hospital .
According to the Glencoe student newspaper , Zambrano was struggling with the language barrier , which , she said , made it hard for her to learn a different culture and make new friends .
She said she misses home .
She talked about being bored in Hillsboro and sometimes going to Portland to see a movie .
Gonzalo Mauricio Vasques Orozco , " Gonzo " from Guatemala , is going to high school in Hood River .
He was in fair condition at OHSU Hospital on Sunday after having surgery .
By the afternoon he had text - messaged friends .
Rotary Club of Hood River reported his arrival in its newsletter last fall .
Karen Ford of Hood River was his first host mother .
Reached by phone , Ford said Vasques Orozco now was staying with another host family , but she had been told he was OK although he was injured in the pelvic area .
Richard Polkinghorn , a vice principal at Hood River Valley High School , said he'd heard that Vasques Orozco should be well enough to be released today .
Polkinghorn said he'd been calling teachers to let them know what happened and help them prepare to speak with students .
A Taiwanese student was among the wounded , but his name was not available .

WASHINGTON -
The first big wave of change in the new Obama administration , a roughly $ 850 billion economic stimulus package , has brought out a swarm of Minnesota officials , businesses and special interest groups vying for a chunk of the nationwide infrastructure buildup .
With President - elect Barack Obama and the Democratic - led Congress poised to embark on the nation 's biggest building spree since the interstate highway system was built a half - century ago , road builders and building contractors from every corner of America are sharpening their pencils at the prospect of more work .
While the size of the stimulus is still being decided , some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about growing costs , which some see rising to as much as $ 1 trillion .
But with 1.2 million jobs lost nationwide this year , the uncertainty in Congress has lent only greater urgency to the pent - up demand for work .
" Minnesota contractors and our trained , skilled workforce are ready to build , " said Dave Semerad , head of the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota , which projects as many as 21,000 new jobs in the state , depending on the size of the stimulus deal .
" Now is the time to get going and build our infrastructure .
There is absolutely no benefit to waiting . "
Builders are n't the only ones looking for a piece of the action .
States , cities and nonprofit groups are looking for help , along with a host of industries suffering from the sharpest business slowdown in decades .
Minnesota mayors are looking for more than $ 805 million for roads , schools , libraries and other development projects , and state officials have identified about 200 transportation projects worth $ 950 million , with the potential for 23,365 new jobs .
But the competing interests in the economic stimulus pie have already prompted divisions in Congress , where some free - market Republicans are raising the specter of a giant spending spree and a return to old - fashioned pork - barrel politics .
One of the most outspoken is Rep. Michele Bachmann , R - Minn. , who has called for slashing corporate and capital gains tax rates instead .
" Reports are that a huge portion of this so - called stimulus will go to pork - barrel projects , " she said .
" And local officials , flush with bailout fever , already have their hands out . "
Making snow The U.S. Conference of Mayors recently gave Congress a list of 11,391 projects worth more than $ 73 billion , which could potentially create 847,641 jobs over the next two years .
The wish list includes nearly 300 Minnesota projects worth about $ 805 million .
Included is $ 1.3 million to rehab the 10th Avenue tunnel in Minneapolis , which was built before 1950 .
St. Paul is looking for $ 9 million for a " green learning " renovation at the Arlington Library and Recreation Center .
More than half of the request for Minnesota cities -- some $ 413 million -- is slated for projects in Duluth , in a district represented by Minnesota Democrat Jim Oberstar , chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee .
Oberstar is expected to have a large say in shaping the public works investments in the final stimulus package .
He has recommended an " earmark - free " system that relies on federal aid formulas .
That would direct just $ 208 million for Minnesota roads and bridges .
An aide to Oberstar said he had no hand in the mayors ' wish list , which includes a number of road and highway projects in his district , including $ 5 million to paint Duluth 's iconic Aerial Lift Bridge .
Also tucked in are $ 2 million for a lake - walk extension at Beacon Point and $ 6 million for snowmaking and maintenance facilities at Spirit Mountain .
The potential larding of the stimulus package has galvanized opponents such as Bachmann , who notes that the mayors ' " Main Street Economic Recovery " list includes such things as $ 4.8 million for a polar bear exhibit in Rhode Island and $ 1.5 million for a water slide in Florida .
But it is by no means certain that Congress will adopt the mayors ' recommendations , which also include $ 41 million worth of projects in St. Cloud -- in Bachmann 's district .
Most are basic road , energy and water projects , such as upgrades to a major wastewater facility .
Asked about the mounting costs , Oberstar promises that the transportation investments in stimulus plan will be able to stand up to public scrutiny .
" It 's going to be transparent , it 's going to be accountable , and it 's going to have benchmarks of reporting and measuring progress , " he said .
" If the rest of the stimulus initiative follows this pattern , we 'll have broad support . "
' Christmas tree ' Working on that support , Senate Democrats have vowed to make the stimulus package pork - free , meaning that as far as possible they will leave it up to state officials how to spend the money , rather than Congress .
However it 's divided up , the massive investment in transportation and infrastructure projects remains the major selling point , along with tax cuts , extended unemployment benefits , food stamps and aid for state Medicaid programs , which the National Governors Association pressed for last year under the leadership of Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty .
But Pawlenty , like some House GOP leaders , has recently taken a cool posture toward the stimulus package , noting that Washington -- which just pumped $ 700 billion into a Wall Street bailout -- is already headed for a trillion - dollar deficit .
Sen . Norm Coleman , a Republican , has warned against turning the stimulus plan into a " Christmas tree " for special interests .
Democrats say their main criterion is creating jobs to kick - start the stalled economy -- the sooner the better .
" We have to be prudent about what we do , " said Sen .
Amy Klobuchar , D - Minn .
" We 're not going to be able to fund every program somebody wants . "
Minnesota Transportation
Department officials say they have 200 road and transit projects that could be ready to start with 180 days .
But nobody 's taking anything for granted .
Under some formulations of the Democrats ' economic stimulus plan , the cutoff would be " shovel ready " projects ready to go in 90 days .
In one of our recent blogs called “ MySpace Affecting our Teens ” we mention how teenagers use the popular social network MySpace more for a popularity contest than anything else , which poses a risk .
These risks could range from sexual behavior to violence .
We all remember the Lori Drew cyberbully case that made headline news in which a teen committed suicide .
How can parents monitor their teenagers behavior when online using MySpace ?
It ’s difficult for any parent to police their teens 24×7 as they have other responsibilities to tend to .
The other challenge is that parents may become more complacent when they have teenagers that are 17 to 18 years of age , and may assume they should know better .
“ We found the majority of teenagers who have a MySpace account are displaying risky behaviors in a public way that is accessible to a general audience , ” said Dr. Dimitri Christakis of Seattle Children ’s Research Institute , whose studies appear in the journal Archives of Pediatric & Adolescent Medicine .
In one of two studies , Christakis and Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin analyzed 500 randomly chosen MySpace profiles of 18 - year - olds in 2007 .
Overall , 54 percent of the publicly available accounts they checked contained information about high - risk behaviors : 41 percent mentioned substance abuse , 24 percent sexual behavior and 14 percent violence .
Christakis said many teens are unaware of how public and permanent Internet information can be , while parents often do not know what their kids are up to .
We need educate our teenagers about the dangers of the internet , but also provide them the benefits as well .
We do n’t need another cyberbully case and certainly any public suicide , like the one recently displayed on justin.tv .
( CNN ) -- Don LaFontaine , the voiceover king whose " In a world ... " phrase on movie trailers was much copied -- and much parodied -- has died , according to media reports .
He was 68 .
LaFontaine died Monday at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles , California , according to ETOnline , " Entertainment Tonight 's " Web site .
He died from complications from pneumothorax , a collapsed lung that causes air to build in the pleural cavity , his agent , Vanessa Gilbert , told " ET . "
LaFontaine , who was born in Duluth , Minnesota , began as a voice actor in the mid-1960s while working as a recording engineer , according to his Web site .
His strong , slightly gravelly voice was featured on trailers for thousands of films , including " The Godfather , " " Fatal Attraction " and " Terminator 2 : Judgment Day . "
For a time in the late ' 70s , LaFontaine was the official voice of Paramount Pictures .
His favorite work was one he did for the 1980 film " The Elephant Man , " he said in interviews , but whether the film was Oscar - caliber or a bomb waiting to blow , he handled every assignment equally .
Watch LaFontaine at work »
" My philosophy is that you have to really believe what you 're reading , even if you think the film 's a piece of junk , " he told Swindle magazine .
" Even the worst picture is someone 's favorite film , and that someone is the fan I am always talking to . "

He also provided the voice for hundreds of thousands of commercials , for companies including General Motors , Ford , McDonald 's , Coca - Cola and many others , according to his Web site .
Slideshow : LaFontaine doing " Godfather II , " " Friday the 13th " »
The good - humored LaFontaine was willing to poke fun at himself , particularly in a recent ad for Geico insurance , in which he gave dramatic flair to a woman 's story about her car accident .
He also voiced the trailer for " The Simpsons Movie , " in which his descriptions were mimicked by commentary from the film 's characters .
Do n't Miss Don LaFontaine 's official site
But LaFontaine was most famous for popularizing the phrase " In a world ... , " used by seemingly dozens of movies determined to create an otherworldly atmosphere .
LaFontaine told CNN that the scripts gave him the cues for his delivery .
" They dictate how they want to be read , " he told " Showbiz Tonight " in 2005 .
" It 's pretty much straightforward stuff because you know the context of the film generally going in .
If it 's something like ' King Kong , ' you have a pretty good idea of how you`re going to say it .
It 's going to be a big adventure thing .
And I let the [ script ] more or less guide what I 'm going to say . "
He added that there was no secret to his movie trailer work : " I really think this is one of the few industries where everything is right up there , " he told CNN .
" What you see is what you get . "
Still , he noted , it 's not like he could use his movie - trailer voice everywhere .
" If I tried to use that voice in public , " he said , " they 'd be calling security . "
LaFontaine is survived by his wife , actress and singer Nita Whitaker , and three children , Christine , Skye and Elyse .
Now , economic forecasting is an inexact science , to say the least , and things could turn out better than the report predicts .
But they could also turn out worse .
The report itself acknowledges that “ some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action . ”
And I ’m with Lawrence Summers , another member of the Obama economic team , who recently declared , “ In this crisis , doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much . ”
Unfortunately , that principle is n’t reflected in the current plan .
So how can Mr. Obama do more ?
By including a lot more public investment in his plan  which will be possible if he takes a longer view .
The Romer - Bernstein report acknowledges that “ a dollar of infrastructure spending is more effective in creating jobs than a dollar of tax cuts . ”
It argues , however , that “ there is a limit on how much government investment can be carried out efficiently in a short time frame . ”
But why does the time frame have to be short ?
As far as I can tell , Mr. Obama ’s planners have focused on investment projects that will deliver their main jobs boost over the next two years .
But since unemployment is likely to remain high well beyond that two - year window , the plan should also include longer - term investment projects .
And bear in mind that even a project that delivers its main punch in , say , 2011 can provide significant economic support in earlier years .
If Mr. Obama drops the “ jump - start ” metaphor , if he accepts the reality that we need a multi- year program rather than a short burst of activity , he can create a lot more jobs through government investment , even in the near term .
Still , should n’t Mr. Obama wait for proof that a bigger , longer - term plan is needed ?
No .
Right now the investment portion of the Obama plan is limited by a shortage of “ shovel ready ” projects , projects ready to go on short notice .
A lot more investment can be under way by late 2010 or 2011 if Mr. Obama gives the go - ahead now  but if he waits too long before deciding , that window of opportunity will be gone .
One more thing : even with the Obama plan , the Romer - Bernstein report predicts an average unemployment rate of 7.3 percent over the next three years .
That ’s a scary number , big enough to pose a real risk that the U.S. economy will get stuck in a Japan - type deflationary trap .
So my advice to the Obama team is to scrap the business tax cuts , and , more important , to deal with the threat of doing too little by doing more .
And the way to do more is to stop talking about jump - starts and look more broadly at the possibilities for government investment .
Sarah Palin cut Barack Obama some slack today .
" I know Obama loves America , " she said during a brief give - and - take with reporters aboard her campaign plane .
She continued , " I 'm sure that is why he 's running for president .
It 's because he wants to do what he believes is in the best interest of this great nation .
... I do n't question at all Barack Obama 's love for this great country . "
Our colleague Mark Silva at the Swamp has more on what Palin had to say .
But whereas the Republican vice presidential candidate attested to Obama 's patriotism , a GOP surrogate -- in a television appearance this evening bound to make the rounds on the Internet -- was n't willing to concede that point .
Indeed , before Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota was done , she raised the specter of the days of Joe McCarthy , suggesting an investigation of whether some of her Capitol Hill colleagues are " pro-America or anti-America . "
Emulating Palin , we 'll cut Bachmann some slack .
She was parrying questions from Chris Matthews on his MSNBC " Hardball " show , which is not for the faint of heart .
Still , she did not necessarily have to keep stepping deeper and deeper into the hole he kept digging for her .
Initially , they were discussing Obama , with Matthews quizzing her about the Republican - backed " robo calls -- viewed by many as over the top -- that play the Bill Ayers / terrorist card against the Democrat .
Bachmann says of Obama : " I 'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views . "
Then she says : " I think the people that Barack Obama has been associating with are anti-American , by and large . "
Matthews wonders if that includes Democratic leaders , such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
" I 'm not going to say if they 're anti-American or pro-American , " Bachmann says .
Pressed by Matthews about members of Congress in general and whether , in essence , their patriotism should be called into question , Bachmann takes the bait .
She calls on the media to launch a " penetrating expose and take a look ... at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-American or anti-American . "
She adds : " I think people would love to see an expose like that . "
We wonder if Bachmann truly comprehends what she endorsed at that moment .
At any rate , here 's the interview in full :

The Gadget : Not to be confused with the original In - Ear Headphones , Apple 's new In - Ear Headphones have been redesigned from the ground up with balanced audio powered by two drivers in each ear .
It also comes with a remote and microphone that 's compatible with the iPod Nano 4G , iPod touch 2G , iPod Classic and iPhone 3G ( kinda ) .

Price : $ 80
The Verdict : After a history of offering lackluster earbuds , Apple has come through with a product that sounds really good and is reasonably priced , all things considered .
The balanced sound and dual drivers makes all the difference in the quality factor .
While not necessarily thumpy , the bass has a nice resonance without drowning out many of the high end intricacies found in jazz or electronic music .
The midrange audio is relatively flat and does n't overpower your ears , which is nice because it allows the high end noises to really stand out , letting you hear things you do n't get from your car or computer speakers .

To see how they stacked up in the headphone scheme of things , I tested them against a pair of standard iPod headphones , the premium Zune headphones , and the Shure SE110s , the winner of our earphone battlemodo .

• Unsurprisingly , the Apple In - Ears outclassed the normal iPod earphones in every category , providing superior sound and comfort .
• The Zune Premium Headphones v2 , which are very good for only costing $ 30 - $ 40 , had bass that was a bit punchier , but could not compete against the mids and highs of the Apple In - Ears .
If you really like bass or a lower price , you might favor the Zune headphones , which more than get the job done .
But on sound quality alone , the Apple In - Ear headphones are superior .
Advertisement
• Compared to the Shure SE110s , the Apple In - Ear headphones do n't quite match up .
It 's not a stark difference between the two , but the SE110s are superior in almost every category , from bass , to high end clarity .
Part of that is because the Apple In - Ears do n't have the noise isolation capability , and partly because they 're just not quite as good .
And though theyre $ 40 cheaper than the SE110s MSRP , you can find the SE110s at some online outlets as low as $ 75 .
As far as remote capabilities go , I tested the Apple In-ear headphones with an iPhone 3G and a first gen iPod touch ( neither of which are officially supported .
As Apple claims , the audio works fine with both devices .
Neither the remote or the mic work with the iPod touch 1G at all , merely reducing it to a pair of headphones .
On the iPhone 3G , you can't use the volume .
You can still play / pause a song , answer / end a call , change tracks and make use of the microphone .
But all of those work perfectly fine on the iPhone .

Overall , the Apple In - Ear Headphones are a quality product at a fairly reasonable price .
They sound great , and work as expected .
That said , unless you really need a remote on your headphones ( or just want to show the world you 're a card - carrying member of the Cult of Apple ) , there are still a couple of better values out there .
Still , Apple 's latest headphone offering is not a bad choice .

John McCain is going to come out of this election just fine .
Steve Schmidt is going to pack his bags and leave forever , Rick Davis is going to apologize to Mr. McCain for being such a disaster and then , hopefully none of us ever have to see , listen to or even hear about Nancy Pfotenhauer ever again .
But Sarah Palin is going to stick around .
Her SNL character played perfectly by Tina Fey was right on the money when she said " I am not goin ' anywhere .
And I 'm certainly not goin ' back to Alaska . "
We may not have to deal with the entire McCain Campaign anymore , but we are certainly going to be exposed to more Sarah Palin .
Whether she sticks around for more than six months or not is another question for another time , but for the short - term , we 're stuck with her as she takes center stage in the coming , internal battle for the GOP 's soul .
That internal battle is another topic for another time , but the smart money is not on the Palin faction of the party .
Six months , a year from now , Palin will likely be an unfortunate footnote in Presidential politics .
She 'll be remembered more for Tina Fey 's ability to impersonate her .
She 'll be the " ' Wasilla Hillbilly ' looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast " .
She 'll be the wildly unprepared and uninformed " Hockey Mom " caricatured with a fake Disney movie trailer .
Some might feel bad for Governor Palin , but the real tragedy is for the people of Alaska .
They are n't going to come out of this Election season looking too good .
The problem for Alaskans with those of us in the Lower - 48 is that we 're susceptible to these stereotypes about the people of The Last Frontier because we do n't know any Alaskans .
Less than one of every 330 Americans is an Alaskan , and how often do they wander down here ?
Not very .
With no direct contact with Alaskans , all us Lower - 48ers have to go on is who we see in the media , and hardly anyone of any fame what - so - ever is from there .
Apparently Curt Schilling was born there , but he grew up and played high school baseball in Arizona .
Also the singer Jewel is from Alaska .
Other than those two , all I could come up with is the first female Iditorod winner , Libby Riddles - sorry Alaska , we do n't keep a very close eye on the dog mushing scene down here .
The point is , before the 2008 Election most of us could not name a single person from Alaska .
But now , many of us can name four .
In addition to Gov. Palin , the names Don Young , Ted Stevens and Mike Gravel are going to ring a bell for anyone who watches the news .
This foursome of Alaskan politicians is all we have to base our opinion of our northern - most countrymen on .
And what can we determine ?
That all Alaskans are either crazy ( Mike Gravel ) , corrupt ( Don Young and Ted Stevens ) or some sort of " Fargo " - like , hillbilly , religious - nut that has some bizarre form of Tourette 's which forces her to spit out " Maverick " and " Joe the Plumber " every 15 seconds .
Let 's start with Mike Gravel ( D - AK ) - being the most like - able of the group , he is no doubt the nuttiest .
Gravel is the former Democratic Senator from Alaska who was one of eight other Democrats to lose to Barack Obama during the 2008 Presidential Primaries .
While Gravel can put a smile on your face , he has also completely gone off the deep end - or at least the shallow end of a pond .
The video below is an actual real commercial that Gravel produced during his 2008 campaign - and yes , that guy is the real Mike Gravel - you really need to watch the whole thing :
In fairness to Senator Gravel , here 's a more traditional ad he ran on CNN :
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) and Don Young ( R - AK ) are two members of Alaska 's Congressional delegation .
Stevens is a U.S. Senator and Young is Alaska 's only U.S. Representative in the House .
What do the two men have in common besides being members of Congress from Alaska ?
Serious corruption charges against them .
In Steven 's case , he has been found guilty on seven felony counts .
Young still remains under investigation with close ties to fallen and corrupt Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff .
Having two thirds of a Congressional delegation either under FBI investigation or convicted of a felony reflects poorly enough on a state .
Stevens and Young , however , reflect even more poorly on the State of Alaska than they otherwise would for two reasons .
One , the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain 's running mate , while the governor herself was under investigation for ethics violations .
The pick shined a new light on matters that , until then , were fading out of the headlines .
Two , and much more damning to the people of Alaska , is that Young won re-election this year quite handily and Ted Stevens appears to have won his re-election despite the fact that he became a convicted felon just a week prior to The Election .
Re-electing a known felon and his associate does n't look to good to the rest of us .
Finally , there 's everyone 's favorite " Hockey - Mom " , Sarah Palin .
Since
The Election is over , and we 've already covered plenty of Palin 's hate - filled , idiotic and outlandish moments , there 's no reason to rehash all of that .
But , the caricature of Sarah Palin that was created this year is going to stick to Alaskans for some time to come .
From Tina
Fey to her real interviews with Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric , from her real - life appearance on Saturday Night Live to continuing for five minutes with a radio show 's prank phone call before figuring it out , Sarah Palin truly earned herself the name " Wasilla Hillbilly " .
Of course it is n't fair to label all Alaskans this way , but these are the people they have elected to represent them .
In the case of Mike Gravel , he really never did anything wrong , nor did he do anything stupid .
He just happens to be a bit eccentric and he was used in this piece ( as he has been in many other scenarios ) as some comic relief .
In all seriousness , however , the remaining three , all of whom currently hold office in Alaska , are offensive to most of the rest of the nation .
When the voters of Alaska ignore felony charges , they ignore an FBI investigation and they ignore a woman 's clear lack of understanding about the world around her , it leaves a bad taste in everyone else 's mouth .
Sure we 've all elected some bad apples , but why so many in Alaska , and why allow them to continue once they 've been exposed as bad apples ?
There were a lot of great things that happened in this country on Tuesday Night , but while the majority celebrated a big victory , there were a minority of losers as well .
Sadly , for the Land of the Midnight Sun , the biggest losers in this election were the people of the great State of Alaska .
17 . Can you extract human DNA using this protocol ?
Yes , in theory .
The same basic materials are required , but the protocol would need to be scaled down ( using smaller volumes of water , soap and alcohol ) .
This is because you 're not likely starting the protocol with the required amount — 1/ 2 cup — of human cells !
That means that you will not extract an amount of DNA large enough to visualize with the naked eye .
If you wanted to see it , you would need a centrifuge to spin down ( to the bottom of the tube ) the small amount of DNA present in the sample .
18 . What can be done with my extracted DNA ?
This sample could be used for gel electrophoresis , for example , but all you will see is a smear .
The DNA you have extracted is genomic , meaning that you have the entire collection of DNA from each cell .
Unless you cut the DNA with restriction enzymes , it is too long and stringy to move through the pores of the gel .
A scientist with a lab purified sample of genomic DNA might also try to sequence it or use it to perform a PCR reaction .
But , your sample is likely not pure enough for these experiments to really work .
19 .
How is DNA extraction useful to scientists ?
When do they use such a protocol , and why is it important ?
The extraction of DNA from a cell is often a first step for scientists who need to obtain and study a gene .
The total cell DNA is used as a pattern to make copies ( called clones ) of a particular gene .
These copies can then be separated away from the total cell DNA , and used to study the function of that individual gene .
Once the gene has been studied , genomic DNA taken from a person might be used to diagnose him or her with a genetic disease .
Alternatively , genomic DNA might be used to mass produce a gene or protein important for treating a disease .
This last application requires techniques that are referred to as recombinant DNA technology or genetic engineering .
20 .
Can I use a microscope to see the DNA that I extract ?
Unfortunately , a microscope will not allow you to see the double helical structure of the DNA molecule .
You 'll only see a massive mess of many , many DNA molecules clumped together .
In fact , the width of the DNA double helix is approximately one billionth of a meter !
This is much too small to see , even with the most powerful microscope .
Instead , a technique called X - ray crystallography can be used to produce a picture of the DNA molecule .
It was by looking at such a picture ( taken by Rosalind Franklin ) that James Watson and Francis Crick were able to figure out what the DNA molecule looks like .

In this forum I have argued that Alan Greenspan 's low - interest - rate policy after the dot - com bust and 9/11 attacks sowed the seeds for our current recession and the housing bubble .
I have also criticized the alternate theory that a foreign " savings glut " was the true culprit , rather than the Fed .
In the present article , I want to deal with a few empirical objections to the case against Greenspan .
That is , several different economic analysts are familiar with the theory that " the Fed did it , " and they claim that the facts just do n't add up .
In the space below , I hope to demonstrate that the evidence against Greenspan is indeed damning .
Greenspan 's " Smallish " Injection ?
One argument advanced in the attempted exoneration of Greenspan is that he did n't really pump that much money into the credit markets .
For example , popular blogger Megan McArdle writes ,
Both right wing Austrians and many liberals have a common theory of how all this happened : Alan Greenspan dunnit .
The mechanisms by which he accomplished his foul task are different in the two cases , of course .
Austrians , and many other free - market types , believe that by lowering short - term interest rates after 9/11 , Alan Greenspan made the housing bubble , and its eventual bust , inevitable …
Here 's the problem : if markets are so great , how come the entire system can be brought low by a smallish injection of short - term capital ?
( emphasis added )
Brad DeLong makes a similar claim in his critique of Larry White , whom DeLong praises as the " best of the Austrians . "
( DeLong does not tell us who the best - looking Austrian is , though I hope to at least be nominated . )
DeLong writes ,
Moreover , I do not think that Larry White has gotten the part of the story that he does cover right … .
From the start of 2002 to the start of 2006 the Federal Reserve bought $ 200 billion in Treasury bills for cash .
This $ 200 billion reduction in outstanding bonds and increase in cash surely did lead to an increase in demand for private bonds .
But recall the magnitudes here .
We have $ 2 trillion of losses on $ 8 trillion in face value of mortgages that ex post should not have been made .
Are we supposed to believe that $ 200 billion of open - market purchases by the Fed drives private agents into making $ 8 trillion of privately unprofitable loans ?
Not likely .
I can see how monetary contraction can make previously profitable loans unprofitable .
But I see no way that this amount of monetary expansion can force private agents to make that amount of unprofitable loans .
The magnitudes just do not match .
Similarly , David Henderson and Jeff Hummel write that monetary growth was tamed during the years of the housing boom , and so Greenspan can't be the culprit :
A better , although now unfashionable , way to judge monetary policy is to look at the monetary measures : MZM , M2 , M1 , and the monetary base .
Since 2001 , the annual year - to - year growth rate of MZM fell from over 20 percent to nearly 0 percent by 2006 .
During that same time , M2 growth fell from over 10 percent to around 2 percent and M1 growth fell from over 10 percent to negative rates .
Admittedly the Fed 's control over the broader monetary aggregates has become quite attenuated , for reasons elucidated below .
But even the year - to - year annual growth rate of the monetary base since 2001 fell from 10 percent to below 5 percent in 2006 and by June of 2008 was around 1.5 percent , despite Ben S. Bernanke 's alleged reflation .
When all of these measures agree , it suggests that monetary policy was not all that expansionary during 2002 and 2003 under Greenspan , despite the low interest rates .
Greenspan Presented in a Less Flattering Light
I realize that these disputes may just further convince some readers that economics is not a science but rather an ideological contest in which each side throws its own set of lying statistics at the other .
But even so , I will now use the same underlying data as the writers above , to reach the opposite conclusion : Greenspan allowed the monetary base to grow quite rapidly precisely when the housing boom shifted into high gear , and precisely when interest rates collapsed .
Before proceeding , I want to remind readers that my story is the textbook explanation of how the Fed operates .
It is the writers above who are downplaying the Fed 's ability to push down interest rates or to " stimulate " ( however temporarily and artificially ) the economy .
During the boom years , Greenspan and his fans wanted to take credit for his " merciful " low rates which allowed the United States to avoid a painful recession , but now Greenspan and his defenders want to claim that he was an innocent bystander in the face of Asian thrift and shortsighted bankers .
In any event , on to the data , this time presented by the " prosecution " as it were .
First , let 's take McArdle and DeLong 's discussion of the injection of base money , and how it was too insignificant to cause the effects we have seen .
According to DeLong , there was a $ 200 billion injection through open - market operations , and yet we have to explain $ 2 trillion in losses .
Well , my first thought is that — as DeLong no doubt teaches his principles - of - macro students — our fractional - reserve system has a built - in multiplier .
In particular , if the required reserve ratio is 10 percent , then a given injection of new reserves ( through Fed purchases of securities ) allows up to a tenfold increase in the quantity of new money .
So with that rule of thumb , a $ 200 billion injection would be expected to have an impact of … $ 2 trillion .
Now let me anticipate an obvious response from DeLong .
He could say , " OK fine , but that still makes no sense .
Why would expanding the quantity of money by $ 2 trillion lead private investors to make so many bad loans ? "
That 's a good question , but it 's different from the issue of magnitudes .
Even if Greenspan flooded the economy with $ 100 trillion in new money , it does n't automatically follow that investors should make dumb lending decisions .
My point here is simply that this alleged ( by McArdle and DeLong ) quantitative mismatch is in fact perfectly adequate ; Greenspan injected a lot more than a " smallish " amount of short - term capital , once we recall the nature of our fractional - reserve system .
Now when it comes to Henderson and Hummel , look again at their actual quotation above : they are trying to prove that monetary expansion was nothing unusual in 2002 and 2003 , and to do this they quote the starting and ending annual rates of expansion in 2001 and then in 2006 .
But this is a bit like saying Keanu Reeves in the movie Speed did n't drive recklessly , because , after all , the bus 's velocity was lower when he got off than when he first got on .
To know if Greenspan had a tight or loose monetary policy during 2002 and 2003 , it 's not enough to know that the policy in 2006 ( when the boom was winding down , after all ! ) was lower than in 2001 .
For the following chart , I have taken the annual averages of the monetary - base series ( as compiled by the St. Louis Fed ) , and plotted the growth rates :
There are a few interesting features of the above graph .
First , note that the growth rate in 2002 ( 8.7 % ) was higher than in 2001 ( 5.6 % ) .
( Henderson and Hummel may have given the opposite impression , because of the units involved .
The base bounced around like crazy because of huge injections and then drainages because of Y2 K and 9/11 . )
Second , note that the base growth in 2002 was about as high as any year from the 1970s , except 1979 ( when base growth was 9.2 % ) .
Everybody in this debate agrees that the 1970s were characterized by excessively loose monetary policy .
It is hard to see then how Greenspan 's behavior during the serious onset of the housing boom can be described as moderate .
Before leaving this section , I should acknowledge that the graph above does seem puzzling in one respect : the growth in the base during the early 2000s is admittedly large by historical standards ( even compared to the 1970s ) , but it is obviously not unprecedented .
In particular , there were larger spikes during the 1980s and 1990s .
This is true , but I would remind the reader that there was a massive real - estate bust and stock - market crash in the 1980s as well , and of course the dot - com bubble in the late 1990s .
The Austrians would blame those unfortunate events on the Fed ( as well as other contributing causes ) too .
Mortgage Rates Not Unusual ?
The last claim we 'll analyze in this article is made by the excellent Chicago economist Casey Mulligan , who writes ,
Another version of the subsidy hypothesis says that public policy encouraged low mortgage rates , which raised housing prices .
I believe that housing prices would not have gotten so high if mortgage rates had been higher , but low mortgage rates may not explain why 2006 housing prices were so high relative to housing prices in 2003 or 2008 .
30 - year fixed - mortgage rates were around six percent per year for most of the boom , and continue to be about six percent .
No one is denying that there must be some endogeneity to the explanation of the housing bubble ; after all , the federal - funds rate right now is just as low as under Greenspan , and nobody expects a housing bubble to develop .
But again , I think Mulligan 's breezy claims about mortgage rates might give the reader a false impression .
He is making it sound as if mortgage rates really have nothing to do with the onset of the boom , because after all they " were around six percent for most of the boom . "
But in fact , the fall in mortgage rates fits in very well with the serious onset of the boom .
The following chart plots the 30 - year conventional mortgage rate against year - over - year increases in the S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Index :
Conventional 30 - Year Mortgage Rates ( Blue , Left ) vs. Year / Year Percentage Growth in Home Prices ( Red , Right ) ( monthly data )
Thirty - year mortgage rates plummeted from about 8.5 % in mid-2000 to below 5.5 % three years later .
The connection certainly is n't robotic , but this period also saw a spike in monetary base growth ( thus leading us to suspect Greenspan 's influence , not just Asian savers ) and the acceleration in the housing boom .
On this last point , consider that mortgage rates dropped from about 7 % down to about 5.5 % from April 2002 to April 2003 .
Even with perfectly rational neoclassical consumers , that would be expected to raise home prices about 17 % .
And lo and behold , over this same period the home price index rose about 14.5 % .
In a follow - up post in the same Cato Unbound symposium , Mulligan makes an odd claim in his disagreement with White :
Perhaps Professor
White would argue that market participants expected short term interest rates to remain low for much longer than a couple of years .
If so , he is on shaky ground .
First , such a claim is at odds with long - term interest - rate data .
As I indicated in my article , long - term mortgage rates were not low during the housing boom .
It 's not hard to find commentary from those years recognizing the low short - term rates were not expected to last .
( emphasis added )
Again , this is one of those casual claims in the debate over the housing bubble that is liable to mislead some readers .
Check out the following chart of 30 - year mortgage rates :
As the chart above indicates , mortgage rates during the peak of the housing bubble were the lowest in the entire 37 years for which the St. Louis Fed keeps records .
Perhaps Mulligan had in mind inflation - adjusted mortgage rates , but if so we 're stuck , because we do n't yet know what the correct , inflation - adjusted rates on 30 - year mortgages were for any mortgages granted after 1978 .
I ask the reader to once again look at the chart above .
Is it really such a leap to think that perhaps Fed manipulation of interest rates might have something to do with the housing bubble ?
Conclusion
Some Austrians are concerned that empirical exercises such as I have performed above will fall into the mainstream habit of aping the physicists , rather than developing a priori theories .
However , we all know what the logical , verbal arguments of Mises and Hayek are , regarding the boom - bust cycle caused by central banks .
The critics are claiming that this story does n't fit the facts .
Hence , the only way to respond is to argue that the Misesian theory really does fit the facts .
Despite claims to the contrary , it appears that Alan Greenspan 's ultralow interest rates — which went hand in hand with monetary growth rates comparable to those of the 1970s — were at the very least a large contributing factor to the housing boom .
I feel confident in claiming that the housing boom would not have occurred if money and banking had been left in the hands of the private sector , as opposed to the state - organized cartel that we currently " enjoy . "
101 Reasonable Doubts About Mormon Claims
In the first " History of the Church , " written by Oliver Cowdery and Joseph Smith in 1834 , there is no mention of Joseph Smith 's " first vision " ( where God the Father and Jesus appeared and told him that all churches of the day were " abominations " ) , even though the church leaders today insist that this vision is the basis and beginning of Mormonism .
Mormons believe that Adam and Eve were the first human beings on earth .
This contradicts all scientific evidence showing that there have been humans for many thousands of years before the traditional time for Adam .
B. H. Roberts , a General Authority of the church until his death in 1933 , studied the Book of Mormon extensively and concluded that Joseph Smith could have authored it himself , using as a source the 1825 book A View of the Hebrews by a protestant minister .
( MORE ) Although Mormons claim that they are " family oriented , " they exclude non-Mormon family members - even parents - from weddings in the temple , since only " worthy " Mormons are allowed to enter a Mormon temple .
( MORE ) Mormon women are limited to a secondary role in the church and in the family : they are not allowed to hold any priesthood office ( which is required to exercise any authority ) ; they are to be obedient to their husbands ( or , if unmarried , to their fathers ) ; their ideal role is to bear children and to be a homemaker .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon says that wheat and barley were mainstay crops in ancient America .
This is false .
Only in Europe were those crops known and cultivated .
And the actual staple crops grown in ancient America are never mentioned in the Book of Mormon : beans , sweet potatoes , squash , manioc , peppers , breadnut , fruits .
One of the most highly praised human traits in Mormonism is " obedience . "
This is also one of the characteristics of a cult .
( MORE ) Mormon scripture ( D&C 84:86 , 91 ) says that true missionaries from God will not rely on their own money or supplies ( " purse or scrip " ) for support , and this will be a test to distinguish them from false missionaries .
Modern Mormon missionaries now rely on themselves for support ; i.e. , they do " carry purse [ and ] scrip . "
Although Joseph Smith claimed to be able to translate ancient documents by the power of God , he was unable to identify the papyrus obtained from Mr. Chandler correctly as pagan Egyptian funerary scrolls from the time of Christ ( as identified subsequently by professional Egyptologists ) , but rather declared that they were a book written by the Patriarch Abraham two thousand years earlier , and from them " translated " the Book of Abraham .
( MORE ) The " United Order " was a series of revelations in the 1830s under which Mormons were to turn over all their property to the church , which would then make the members " stewards " and " equal . "
It was based on the apparent practice in the New Testament church where the Christians " held all things in common . "
( Acts 4:32 - 37 ) This Order was to be " everlasting " ( D& C 82:20 , 104:1 ) .
It lasted only briefly , although the church attempted to implement it several times , both in Ohio and in Utah .
The Book of Mormon says that the people of ancient America had chariots ( wheeled vehicles ) .
The wheel was unknown in ancient America .
Mormons believe that God was once a man like us , and became God , although many passages in their own scriptures say that God never changes .
Mormons emphasize the uniqueness of Joseph Smith 's story of his visitations by heavenly beings and his miraculous production of long sacred texts .
However , such things - although unusual - are not unique .
Other examples of people who claimed to have had angelic visitors and produced sacred texts : Ann Lee , Emanuel Swedenborg , James J. Strang , Baha-ullah , Mohammed , John Newbrough , Edgar Cayce , Helen Schucman , Levi H. Dowling , the anonymous author of the " Urantia " books , and many others , including many religious contemporaries of Joseph Smith ( see , for example , Fawn Brodie , No Man Knows My History , p 22 - 23 ) .
Joseph Smith claimed that his telling others of his " first vision " in 1820 caused him to be persecuted .
There is no contemporary evidence that he was persecuted for such a story .
None of his enemies seem to have been aware of such a claim at the time .
The Book of Mormon ( 2 Nephi 29:3 ) uses the word " Bible " at a time ( about 590 B.C. ) when there was no such concept .
Mormons waver on the ultimate authority for doctrine between the Bible , Mormon scriptures , statements of former Mormon prophets , statements of living Mormon prophets , and individual " revelation " - apparently depending on what they think gives them authority to believe what they want to believe .
All of those sources are often mutually contradictory .
The story of the cattle - herding serpents in the Book of Mormon ( Ether 9:31 - 33 ) is an absurd " tall tale . "
Mormons disagree on where the actual events of the Book of Mormon took place in America .
Some - including many Mormon prophets now deceased - say throughout both North and South America ( the " hemispheric model " ) , others - including many church scholars - say in a small area in Central America and southern Mexico ( the " limited geography model " ) .
The recent prophets , who are supposed to be inspired by God and " know all things , " have declined to make any statement on the issue .
The church did not acknowledge the role of church leaders in the massacre of 120 innocent people in 1857 at Mountain Meadows until the 150th anniversary of the event , when a church spokesman said that the church had " deep regret " for the role that " local " Mormon church leaders played in the massacre .
The church emphasized that the statement was not to be understood as an apology .
( MORE ) Mormons teach that there are many gods , and that humans can become gods , even though many scriptural passages both biblical and Mormon , say that there is only one God .
The Book of Mormon says that the horse was used as a beast of burden or draft animal in ancient America .
This is false .
The ancient Americans had no beasts of burden or draft animals , and especially not the horse .
( The Incas domesticated the llama , but not until long after Book of Mormon times . )
Brigham Young , supposedly a divinely inspired prophet , taught that Adam was actually God the Father .
This idea is repudiated by the present - day church as false .
( MORE ) Originally the terms " eternal marriage " and " celestial marriage " as used in D&C 132 meant " plural marriage , " as interpreted by the 19th century Mormon leaders .
Now the church has changed the meaning so as not to imply polygamy , although the terms were introduced in the revelation which authorized polygamy .
The church today claims that the divine plan for marriage is one man to one woman .
But D&C 132 is still scripture , and still authorizes a man to marry more than one woman at a time .
Joseph Smith asserted that Mormons believe in obeying and sustaining the law ( Articles of Faith 12 ) , but he continually flouted the law , as in his establishing the illegal Kirtland Bank ( for which he was found guilty and fined ) and his entering into illegal bigamous ( polygamous ) relationships .
( MORE ) Joseph Smith claimed that he told his family about his " first vision " in 1820 , in which he said that God and Christ had told him that he should join no church at that time because they were all false .
However , several family members did subsequently join the Presbyterian church , and Joseph Smith applied to join the Methodist church in 1828 , thus casting doubt on whether he had had the vision as claimed .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon is supposed to be the " word of God " and translated correctly ( unlike the Bible , which Mormons believe to be the word of God only so far as it is translated correctly - Articles of Faith 8 ) .
But over 3000 changes and corrections have been made in the text since it was first published .
Many were corrections of grammar , but others changed meaning and even doctrine .

The earliest accounts of Joseph Smith 's1823 angelic visitor ( who told him about the gold plates ) say that the angel 's name was " Nephi . "
Only later was the name changed to " Moroni . "
Both are important characters in the Book of Mormon , but they are very different , and supposedly lived a thousand years apart .
The Book of Mormon teaches that a dark skin is a " loathsome " curse from God , imposed for one 's unrighteousness ( or the unrighteousness of one 's ancestors ) , and that righteous living will cause a person 's dark skin to become white and " delightsome . "
This is scientifically nonsense .
Some Mormon scriptures say that God has a physical body ( e.g. D&C 130:22 ) ; others say that God is a spirit ( Alma 28:26 - 28 ) .
Although the official version of the translation of the gold plates says that Joseph Smith used the " Urim and Thummim " ( two stones set into a bow attached to a breast plate ) as the vehicle for inspiration , most witnesses to the process said that he used the same " peepstone " that he had used for many years for treasure - hunting , by placing it in his hat and then covering his face with the hat so as to exclude light .
Until 1978 the church excluded from the priesthood and from the temple any member who had " Negro " blood .
Now the church claims that it was never " racist . "
( MORE ) Mormons teach that the process of going from the pre-existent life as spirit offspring of God requires obtaining a body , following all of God 's commandments in this life , being resurrected with a perfect physical body and proceeding to godhood .
No satisfactory explanation is given as to how the third member of the Mormon godhead ( the Holy Ghost ) can have status as a god but lack a physical body .
Brigham Young , in all his sermons , mentions nothing about Joseph Smith 's " first vision . "
In one of his few references to the visionary beginnings of Mormonism he asserts that God did not appear to Joseph Smith , but rather sent an angel .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon portrays Lehi as a devout Israelite ( a prophet ) , but he is completely ignorant of which tribe he belongs to ( 1 Nephi 5:14 - 16 ) .
This would be extremely unlikely .
The Mormon " endowment " ceremony , introduced by Joseph Smith soon after he had been initiated into Freemasonry , had many similarities to the Masonic initiation ceremony of his day .
( MORE )
Although the divinely inspired " Word of Wisdom " ( D&C 89:5 ) condemns wine as harmful , recent research shows that drinking one or two glasses of wine daily has a beneficial effect on the health .
Many of the revelations which Joseph Smith received up to 1833 were published that year in the Book of Commandments .
They were later re-published in the D&C ( 1835 ) , but only after major revisions to many of them , even though God had certified the original versions as " true . " ( MORE ) Mormon archaeologists have been unable to identify any New World site conclusively as a site mentioned in the Book of Mormon .
Many present Mormon doctines and practices are at odds with the teachings found in the Book of Mormon ( MORE ) .
When Mormon leaders announced in 1890 that the practice of plural marriage was ended , it was a lie .
Church officials continued secretly to perform plural marriages and to enter into them for about sixteen years .
The Apostle Paul said that a deacon should be married and the head of a household .
But most Mormon deacons are boys only twelve to fourteen years old .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon says that elephants were a useful domestic animal in ancient America ( Ether 9:19 ) .
This is impossible because there were no elephants in America at that time .
It may be that Joseph Smith included elephants in the Book of Mormon because a woolly mammoth skeleton had recently been found in America , and this led some people to think that elephants were known to the Indians ' ancestors .
However , the mammoth ( or mastodon ) had become extinct about six thousand years before the events in the Book of Mormon are dated .
Joseph Smith frequently received revelations through visiting angels .
No leader of the church has had angelic visitors for many years .
Such lack of revelation was prophesied as a sign of apostasy ( Micah 3:5-11 ) .
Mormons claim that the " endowment " ceremony of the temple was restored by Joseph Smith after having been " corrupted " - particularly by the Masons , who deleted many " plain and precious parts . "
Ever since it was first introduced the Mormons have continued to change it , by deleting many essential parts of the original version .
( MORE ) .
The D&C says ( 116 , also 78:15 and 107:53 - 57 ) that the Garden of Eden was in Missouri , but the Book of Moses ( PoGP , supposedly written by the prophet Moses , 3:10 - 16 ) says it was near the River Euphrates , which to Moses and his hearers meant the river in present - day Iraq .
The Book of Mormon claims to be the story of devout Jews in America , but demonstrates almost no knowledge of Jewish laws and customs ( Passover , the Feasts , clean / unclean observance , etc. ) .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon says that one must be saved in this life - after you die , it 's too late ( Alma 34:32 - 35 ) .
But Mormons spend much time and effort in baptizing dead non-Mormons in proxy ceremonies so that they can be saved in the afterlife .
Joseph Smith secretly " married " over thirty women , some of them mere teenagers , others with husbands still living .
Many of these liaisons he kept secret from his wife Emma , as well as from the general church membership .
( MORE ) The Book of Mormon describes the people of ancient America as having domestic cattle .
This is false - the ancient Americans had no domestic cattle .
The one prayer which Jesus commanded his disciples to use ( the " Lord 's Prayer " ) is almost never used by Mormons .
The " Word of Wisdom " ( D&C 89:8 ) recommends using tobacco as a poultice for bruises , and for sick cattle .
This has no medical basis in fact .
The Book of Abraham describes Egyptian sacred places in Babylon ( Abraham 1:8 , 20 ) .
This is historically false .
The church teaches that homosexuality is a personal choice ( and therefore a willful sin ) .
This is contrary to almost all scientific research on homosexuality .
A basic teaching of the Book of Mormon is that the American Indians are descendants of Israelites who arrived in America about 600 BC .
Anthropologists have shown that there is no Hebrew ancestry in native Americans , who are rather descendants of immigrants from eastern Asia who came to America at least 15,000 years ago , long before Book of Mormon times .
( MORE ) Mormon scripture says that God lives near the star " Kolob " ( Abraham 3:3-10 ) .
Mormons are unable to identify that star with any known star .
Mormons believe that marriages performed in a Mormon temple are for " time and all eternity " - that is , the couple will be in a married state in heaven .
But Jesus said that this is a false idea - there is no married state in heaven ( Matt 22:23 - 30 , Mark 12:18 - 25 , Luke 20:27 - 36 ) .
Joseph Smith was supposedly a prophet , and he made many prophecies , most of which failed .
( MORE ) Mormons believe that anyone can verify the truth of Mormonism by praying to God for confirmation ( Moroni 10: 4 .
This is not a testable means of obtaining information , especially in light of the fact that many other religions make the same claim , and apparently are confirmed as true by the same method .
The Book of Mormon ( Jacob 2:24 ) says that God considered the multiple wives of David and Solomon to be an " abomination . "
But the D&C ( 132:38 - 39 ) says that it was not wrong .
Mormons claim that their church is patterned after the early church of Jesus ' apostles , but there are major differences .
( MORE )
The gold plates from which the Book of Mormon was supposedly translated , containing the sacred records of devout Jews , were written in a form of Egyptian , not Hebrew , according to the Book of Mormon .
That is extremely implausible , in view of the attitude of Jews toward their language and its sanctity , and their hatred of all things Egyptian .
Also , there is no other historical example of Jews keeping sacred or historical records in Egyptian .
Mormons believe literally in the Bible story of the Great Flood .
There is no credible evidence that there was such a world - wide flood .
Mormons assert that they no longer practice polygamy and that it is no longer church doctrine .
However , the D&C still contains the revelations authorizing it and commanding it ( Sections 132 and 131:1 - 4 ) , and present - day Mormon men , under certain circumstances , can be married to more than one wife for the afterlife .
Mormons consider the present president of the church to be a prophet , and consider his pronouncements to be God 's word .
According to many experts on religious cults , this is one of the signs of a cult .
Many Mormons assert that the reason polygamy was practiced in early Utah was because there were not enough men to provide husbands for worthy women .
This is historically false - Utah census records for the 19th century show that Utah had a considerable excess of men .
The Book of Mormon ( Ether 1:33 ff ) portrays the Tower of Babel and the confusion of languages that occurred there as historical fact .
No linguistic scholar accepts the Babel story as a historical event or as the origin of the world 's different languages .
Joseph Smith taught that one of the tests of whether a revelation was really from God was its consistency with previous revelations : if it contradicted previous revelations , it was not from God .
Many of his revelations , and the revelations of many of his successor prophets , have indeed contradicted previous revelations .
The Book of Mormon ( Book of Ether 6 ) describes a 344 - day oceanic voyage by the Jaredites in small submarine - like " barges " with only two air holes ( one in the top and one in the bottom , i.e. , only one usable at a time ) .
These boats contained not only people , but livestock of many kinds , apparently with enough food and water that no landfall was necessary .
This is completely impossible .

In the 1980s a master forger named Mark Hofmann was able to sell numerous forged documents to the church leaders .
The documents purported to be early writings by prominent Mormons which would put the church in a bad light .
The church bought them in order to avoid their becoming widely known .
The supposed prophets of God were apparently not warned by God that they were being duped .
( MORE ) In the 1840s Dr. John C. Bennett joined the church and became Joseph Smith 's closest associate .
Joseph Smith was not warned by God that Bennett was a scoundrel and adulterer , having abandoned a wife and children .
The Book of Mormon describes the ancient Americans as fighting with steel swords .
Neither steel nor metal weapons were known in ancient America .
Joseph Smith claimed to have seen in vision both the prophet Elijah and the prophet Elias ( D&C 27:6 - 9 ) .
He apparently was unaware that in the Bible those two names refer to only one prophet ( one is the Hebrew version of the name , the other Greek ) .
( MORE ) Prophet Gordon B. Hinckley in several interviews for news media has said that he did not know much about whether the church teaches that God was once a man .
But this has been a fundamental teaching of the church for many years .
Either Hinckley was woefully ignorant about his own church 's doctrines , or he was lying .
( MORE ) " Zion 's Camp " ( the 1834 Mormon military expedition sent from Ohio to Missouri to protect Mormon settlers there ) failed utterly , even though it was organized pursuant to revelations to Joseph Smith .
One of the important factors causing its failure was that over one third of the army contracted cholera .
Joseph Smith was at a loss as to how to deal with the disease , and God did not tell him how to prevent its spread ( it could have been prevented if God had told Joseph Smith to boil all the drinking water ) .
Mormon scripture says that the Christian gospel ( belief in Jesus Christ , his atonement , necessity of baptism , etc. ) were known to Adam and to subsequent Old Testament prophets .
There is no corroborating evidence of this .
Mormons are unable to give a satisfactory explanation of why it was so important for the angel to preserve and guard the gold plates and for Joseph Smith to obtain them , since Joseph Smith usually did not even have the plates present in the same room in order to dictate the Book of Mormon text to his scribes .
In the official version of Joseph Smith 's " first vision " he states that it occurred in 1820 as a result of his being moved by a large religious revival in the area to wonder which church was the true church .
There was no such religious revival in the area between 1817 and 1824 .
This throws doubt on the entire chronology of events as depicted by Joseph Smith .
( MORE ) Joseph Smith produced an " inspired translation " of the Bible .
It was not a translation in any sense , but rather his own corrections and additions to the King James translation , made without consulting any ancient texts or manuscripts .
His changes are not supported by any non-Mormon biblical text scholarship , and in fact preserve many of the errors which biblical scholarship has since discovered in the King James version .
Church historians are unable to provide any contemporary documentation for the restoration of the Melchizedek priesthood through a visit to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery by the resurrected apostles Peter , James and John , even though it is this event upon which the church claims to have its highest authority .
The original text of the Book of Mormon was supposedly engraved on metal plates , a slow and laborious process .
The translation , however , is frequently wordy , verbose , repetitive , characteristic of something dictated .
( MORE ) Mormon scripture says that the earth has ( will have ) a " temporal existence " of seven thousand years ( D& C 77:6 - 7 ) .
This is contrary to all scientific evidence about the age of the earth .
Mormons teach that a rape victim has " lost her chastity " ; a woman should fight off her attacker or be killed in the attempt .
Thus , young Mormon women are taught that their chastity is more valuable than their life .
The result is that a Mormon woman who survives a rape is made to feel guilty , and is thus victimized again , this time by her church .
The Book of Mormon contains many lengthy passages almost identical to passages in the King James translation of the Bible , including some of its mistranslations .
Mormon scripture asserts ( D&C OD - 1 ) that God would not allow any president of the church to " lead [ it ] astray . "
God would " remove [ him ] out of his place " rather than permit that - presumably by causing his premature death .
Joseph Smith was removed at the height of his power , at the age of 39 , when he was being accused by many Mormons of leading the church astray with his polygamous doctrines , his megalomania and his financial schemes .
One could assume that God " removed " him and that he was indeed leading the church astray .
The Book of Mormon describes a detailed monetary system based on various pieces of gold and silver ( Alma 11:4 - 20 ) .
There is no evidence that any such system was ever used in any ancient American civilization , whose economies were based entirely on the barter system .
The most common exchange currency of the Mayas and Aztecs was cocoa beans , which are never mentioned in the Book of Mormon .
Mormon scholars and prophets disagree on the location of the Hill Cumorah , where two great battles in the Book of Mormon took place .
Some insist it was in Central America or southern Mexico , but others insist it was in New York state .
The proponents of the Mexican location cite the impossibility of the New York view .
Their opponents cite the fact that Moroni and Joseph Smith identified the New York location specifically .
Mormons often obtain a " patriarchal blessing " when in late teens or early twenties .
This is a solemn blessing pronounced by an ordained " patriarch " telling the recipients about what life holds for them if they are obedient Mormons .
It also tells the person from which tribe of Israel that person is descended ( usually Ephraim or Manasseh ) .
The blessing is recorded and transcribed for future reference .
This is just a form of fortune - telling .
Many blessings are vague and worded very conditionally .
Those which are more specific are often not verified by events .
Many of the astronomical ideas in the Book of Abraham are similar to those in popular scientific books of Joseph Smith 's time , and have proven incorrect .
The long passages in the Book of Mormon copied from Isaiah seem to serve no purpose , since God would not have to provide them in the Book of Mormon to the audience for the Book of Mormon ( the people of the 19th century ) - they were already available in the Bible .
Mormonism 's view of gender is that there are only two ( male and female ) .
This is no longer considered scientifically accurate , since geneticists now recognize that some people are born with sexual traits of both genders , and surgery is needed to adjust the physical body of such a person to conform to one gender or the other .
( See the website of the Intersex Society of North America . )
If Mormon , such persons are denied entrance to Mormon temples , and thus are denied the possibility of attaining the highest degree of Mormon heaven .
In Mormon theology " Lucifer " is the revealed name of Satan .
Although many Christians also believe that , the idea is due to a mistaken translation of the passage in Isaiah ( 14:12 ; also Book of Mormon 2 Nephi 24:12 ) , a mistake which occurred only when Isaiah was translated into Latin in the fourth century AD , long after the alleged date that Nephi was writing .
( MORE ) Although Mormon scriptures and Mormon sermons denounce lying , and although Mormon scriptures say that any message that is not given " in the spirit of truth " is not from God ( D&C 50:17 - 18 and D&C 129:7 ) , Mormon leaders have not hesitated to lie to the membership and to the public about their history , their doctrine , and their practices .
( MORE ) The Mormon temple ceremony ( the " endowment " ) includes rituals in which participants learn four secret handshakes ( " tokens " ) and four secret passwords ( the " names " of the tokens ) which will be needed to gain entrance to heaven .
Not only is the idea absurd and unscriptural , but it overlooks the fact that many former Mormons have learned them as well .
The question naturally arises as to whether knowing the secret tokens and their names is really sensible or necessary .

When Martin Harris took home the first 116 pages of the manuscript for the Book of Mormon in order to demonstrate to his skeptical wife that he was justified in financing the book 's publication , the pages disappeared .
Smith was frantic .
He soon received a revelation ( D&C 10:1 - 19 ) telling him not to re-translate that portion of the plates , since " wicked men " would alter the original translation and use it to cast doubts on Smith 's work .
That explanation does not seem to make sense , since any alterations on a manuscript would be obvious .
The more likely explanation is that Smith knew he was unable to reproduce the same text word - perfect .
One must also wonder why God did not realize that Mrs. Harris had simply burned the manuscript in order to put an end to her husband 's involvement .
According to Mormon scripture ( D&C 84:19 - 22 ) no man can see God unless he has the Melchizedek priesthood .
This revelation was given in 1832 .
The priesthood was supposedly restored at some unknown date in 1829 or 1830 .
But Joseph Smith claimed in the 1830s to have seen God in 1820 , long before he received the priesthood .
( The implication is also that no woman can ever see God , since women cannot hold the Mormon priesthood . )
Two elements of Mormonism combine to teach children to lie .
First , they are taught that they should strive to be perfect .
Then they are required to be interviewed in private by a church authority ( usually the local bishop ) as to whether they are " worthy " for the next advancement .
If they tell the truth about their failings they risk not being able to advance .
If they lie , they are advanced .
But their advancement is then accompanied by feelings of guilt or by a realization that lying is the way to advance .

There is considerable evidence that the Book of Mormon was originally simply a money - making project , the latest in Joseph Smith 's attempts to find wealth by seeking buried treasure .
One telling item of evidence is that Joseph Smith attempted to sell the rights to the book after it was published , but could not find a buyer .
It seems odd that Joseph Smith remembers very precisely the date of the visitation of the angel Moroni ( or was it " Nephi " ? - September 21 , 1823 ) , but he is unable to give a date for his claimed 1820 vision of God and Christ ( " early in the spring " PoGP , JS - H 1:14 ) nor an accurate date for the momentous visitation by Peter , James and John , when they restored the Melchizedek priesthood .
( Mormon historians can only date that event as sometime in 1829 or early 1830 . )
In 1843 six brass plates with strange characters engraved on them were found in an Indian burial mound near Kinderhook , Illinois .
They were taken to Joseph Smith , since he claimed to be able to translate ancient writings .
He wrote in the Mormon newspaper Times and Seasons ( April 1843 ) that they were a history of the person with whose bones they had been found , who " was a descendant of Ham , through the loins of Pharaoh , king of Egypt . " ( History of the Church , 5:372-379 ) .
The plates were an elaborate hoax , although many Mormons continued to cite them as corroboration of the Book of Mormon , as late as the 1949 edition of the History ( 5:378n ) .
( MORE ) Mormons insist that the name of true church of Christ must include his name , citing 1 Cor 1:11 - 15 and 3 Nephi 27:3 - 8 .
But on May 3 , 1834 , the original name of the church ( " Church of Christ " ) was changed to " The Church of the Latter - day Saints , " thus deleting any reference to the name of Christ .
It retained that name until April 1838 , when it was renamed " The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints " ( D&C 115:3 - 4 ) .
Applying the Mormons ' own test , their church was then not the " true " church for almost four years of its early history .
Although the truth is not subject to popularity votes , it is interesting that there are probably more people who have left the Mormon church than there are now active ( practicing ) Mormons .
These are primarily people who were raised as Mormons or who converted to Mormonism , but who left it .
Rather than being ( as the official Mormon press releases claim ) " one of the fastest - growing religions " , its growth is stagnating , and its membership numbers are artificially inflated to disguise the hemorrhaging membership .
( MORE ) Yes , that is already the promised 101 , but the list goes on !
When a visitor to Nauvoo showed Joseph Smith the ancient manuscript of a collection of psalms written in Greek , Joseph Smith identified it incorrectly as containing " Reformed Egyptian " writing .
( Henry Caswell , The City of the Mormons , London 1842 . 35 - 43 , cited in Grant Palmer , An Insider 's View of Mormon Origins , Salt Lake City 2002 , pp 34 - 36 . )
The Mormon sacred undergarment has a marking over each nipple , one in the shape of a compass , the other a square .
They also appear in the Mormon temple on the " veil of the temple . "
These two symbols are of course the well - known Masonic symbols , where - in the context of building crafts - they make sense .
They seem quite out of place in Mormon theology , and an obvious borrowing by Joseph Smith .
Nor are they mentioned in any Mormon scripture .
Numerous Bible passages ( Ex 28- 31 ; Num 3:7 ; Neh 7:63,65 ; Heb 7:12 - 14 ) clearly say that only Levites can offer sacrifices .
No Levites are mentioned as accompanying Lehi from Jerusalem .
Yet according to the Book of Mormon , sacrifices were offered by Lehi ( 1 Nephi 5:9 ) and his descendants ( Mosiah 2:3 ) .
By what authority , then ?
D&C 131 and 132 contain the " new and everlasting covenant " of marriage , announcing the twin doctrines that the correct form of marriage , according to God , is marriage for eternity performed by one holding the " keys , " and that it is also polygamous .
D&C 132:3 - 6 says that whoever receives this law and does not obey it will be damned .
The doctrine was not " new , " but rather claimed to be a restoration of the polygamy of the Old Testament patriachs .
Nor was it " everlasting , " since the church abandoned polygamy only fifty years after this revelation , and now excommunicates any Mormon who feels obligated to obey this commandment .
The Book of Abraham says ( 1:26 - 27 and 1:20 - 22 ) that descendants of Ham cannot hold any priesthood , and that all Egyptians are descended from Ham .
Until 1978 this was interpreted to ban anyone with even a single " drop " of Hamitic ( Negro ) blood .
Most Mormons claim that they are descended from Ephraim or Manasseh , sons of Joseph , based on their individual patriarchal blessings .
Since the mother of those two sons was Asenath , the daughter of Potipherah , priest at On ( Genesis 41:45 , 50 ) , who was undoubtedly Egyptian , it would appear then that no such Mormon was entitled to hold the priesthood ( until 1978 at least , when the church chose to disregard this passage of scripture ) .
The Book of Mormon frequently condemns secret " combinations " ( societies ) and the taking of oaths of secrecy .
Yet an essential part of the Mormon temple 's endowment ceremony is an emphasis on the secrecy of the oaths taken during the ritual and its other details .
The explanation in the Book of Mormon for writing the important records in Egyptian ( Mormon 9:32 - 33 ) is that it would have required too much space on the precious gold plates to write in Hebrew .
This does not make sense , since Hebrew is a very concise language , using consonants almost exclusively , compared to Egyptian , which required a large number of complex characters and would have been unsuitable for engraving in limited space .

Chinese Girl Has Basketball for a Body
Qian Hongyan , who was forced to use half a basketball as her prosthetic body , has inspired millions recently with her ambition to compete as a swimmer in the 2012 Paralympics in London .
Qian swims about 2000 meters a day and trains really hard .
“ Qian Hongyan studies hard .
She never grouches in training although she was confronted with many difficulties at the beginning , ” her coach said .
The 10 year - old was injured trajically in an auto accident when she was only 3 years old .
To insure her survival , the doctors were forced to amputate her legs .
Qian ’s family , living in Zhuangxia , China , was unable to afford modern prosthetics and instead used a half a basketball to get around on .
Once on the ball she uses two wooden props to help her move around .
Qian now has a pair of proper prosthetic legs , but still says she likes to use the basketball from time to time as it is easier for her to get in and out of the pool with .

I do n't see why punk rockers feel they have to waste their time like this .
Bad Brains is an awesome band though .
Richard and Dimitra Anderson found lots of money in a pair of boots she bought at a resale shop recently .
She was showing some of the cash at their home Friday , December 5 , 2008 .
For Jim Stingl column .
Rick Wood / RWOOD@JOURNALSENTINEL.COM
MILWAUKEE , Dec. 7 ( UPI ) -- A Wisconsin woman says she found a wad of cash in a pair of boots she purchased at a thrift store .
Dimitra Anderson said she found the undisclosed amount of cash when she tried a pair of boots and found a sock with a bank envelope inside each of the boots , the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported Sunday .

The newspaper said Anderson bought the boots for $ 3 , and did not mention the cash she found to the clerk .
Anderson and her husband Rick contacted the Journal Sentinel for help in finding the loot 's owner .
If they can't find the person , the couple say they plan to donate the money to charity .
" I knew I was n't going to keep it , no matter how much it was .
If it 's going to be mine , it 's going to the Rescue Mission or the Humane Society , " Dimitra Anderson said .
Another Core !
The Next generation of Multi - core processors is finally on the shelves , dubbed ' Core i7 ' .
It uses the new Nahelum micro-architecture .
But is it really the time to upgrade ?
Lets digg in !
Core i7 has a lot of changes , but inherits the same processing efficiency of the older Intel 's Core based processors ( like Core 2 Quad ) .
This is what to expect :
Four Cores with Hyperthreading , upto 40 % improvement in Performance than older generation processors .
Large 8 MB L3 cache
Integrated memory controller giving more bandwidth to applications .
Addition of 7 new Instructions for Multimedia , giving boost to Online Video - streaming .
High Power Dissipation ( 50 % more than the previous generation )
Support for upto 12 GB Memory , and DDR3 1333 MHz Compatibility
The new processor is targeted mostly for servers , but Deskop computers can also use it for great processing power .
Video Encoding , gaming and other performance hog applications are going to take most of its advantage .
However , its not compatible with older desktop boards ( It uses socket 1366 ) .
The only problem is the increased Power dissipation , but that will decrease with time as the series mature .
It seems to be a perfect processor for an upgrade !
Lets wait until AMD comes with an alternative and the prices goes down .
Overall , its a great step in Desktop Performance !

Jeremy Piven abruptly quit his $ 15,000 a week gig in the Broadway revival of David Mamet ’s Speed - the - Plow last week , when his doctor claimed he had mercury poisoning from all of the sushi he ’d been eating .
For this story to be true , he would be the first human in recorded history * to get mercury poisoning from eating sushi in this country .
Is it time to contact the Guiness Book of World Records or is this story a little fishy ?
While none of us knows Mr. Piven ’s actual medical condition and can only go by what has been reported in the news , this theatrical story is fueling a lot of fears that sushi can cause mercury toxicity .
That makes it worthwhile to bring some science to the sensation .
For the investors in the Broadway production , believing this popular food myth could cost them $ 3.5 million .
If , instead , they believed in science , they would know that it is biologically unfeasible for someone eating fish and seafood commercially available in the United States , or any developed country today , to eat so much to get mercury poisoning .
For the 2002 FDA scientific meetings on methylmercury , scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Human Nutrition Information Services tried every possible combination — heavy fish consumption , eating commercial fish varieties with the highest methylmercury levels or any combination of measured levels , repeatedly eating the same fish , etc. — and try as they might , after 100,000 iterations they found it implausible for an adult woman to eat so much purchased fish to put herself or their unborn baby anywhere near dangerous levels of methylmercury .
How likely is it that Mr. Piven somehow came up with the magical 100,001th iteration ?
For more than 30 years , researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center , in Rochester , New York , have closely followed populations eating large amounts of fish , including Samoans , Peruvians and residents of the Seychelles , and found no associated adverse effects in adults or children .
Even people with the highest per capita consumption of fish in the world , the Seychelles , where the children get 10 to 20 times more methylmercury than U.S. children , the researchers have tested them for more than 14 years now , evaluating every possible measure of health , developmental and neurological function , and found no detectable adverse effects — let alone mercury toxicity .
And , not to split hairs , any Japanese sushi aficionado knows that sushi refers to the bite - size delicacies with vinegared rice .
Sashimi is the raw saltwater fish .
The sushi angle makes this a fishy tale that does n't fly .
Some news stories have reported his doctor saying that the Chinese herbs ** he was taking could have contributed to is “ mercury toxicity . ”
Well , that might be possible … theoretically , if he ingested two Chinese herbal balls a day that also happened to be tainted with mercury .
In a letter to the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine , the level of mercury sulfides ( not the form of mercury found in fish ) reported in some herbal balls imported from China in 1995 could potentially be a health risk , according to the authors .
These Chinese herbal balls are used among traditional herbalists , they noted , for conditions such as rheumatism , apoplexy ( uncontrolled bleeding in the brain ) and cataracts .
Mr. Piven appears a bit too young and healthy to turn to such large amounts of Chinese herbs to treat things like that .
A search for reports of recent U.S. recalls of Chinese herbs for mercury contamination came up empty .
The FDA has sent out warning letters to various Chinese herbal suppliers , though , for making illegal and unsupported medical claims that their herbs are effective for cancer .
Health Canada reported in April that Singapore health authorities had recalled several Chinese herbs , used for treating things like constipation and inflammation , for exceeding permissible levels .
But none of those products were found to have been imported and for sale or in the Canadian marketplace .
With the source of his purported diagnosis of mercury toxicity a medical mystery , it ’s far more likely he does n’t really have “ high ” mercury levels at all .
Popular mythologies about mercury scare a lot of people , but fears are n’t grounded in science .
As with most fears of contaminants , mythologists not only fail to explain ( or understand ) the different types of mercury , but the difference between the benchmark dose and the reference dose in levels measured in the body .
The benchmark dose is the lowest amount considered safe from any effect over a lifetime of daily exposure in the most sensitive population of children , as Dr. Joseph Jacobson , of Wayne State University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences ’ Committee on Methylmercury explained .
The FDA and EPA then add an arbitrary ten - fold safety cushion to that , to arrive at a “ reference dose ” — which the FDA uses for regulatory reporting ( called its “ Action Level ” ) .
This safety cushion is not a threshold where there is any possible health risk ; but it is what those trying to scare the willies out of us often use to define " high . "
Those investors could solve the mystery with a simple blood test and confirm that “ high ” definition .
Many alternative practitioners make their living testing people ’s hair , urine or blood for chemicals and substances that we all naturally have in our bodies , attribute them to general symptoms we all naturally have , and then offer “ treatments . ”
When researchers from the Harvard Medical School studied people who had been told they were “ mercury toxic ” after getting tests done at spas and integrative medicine clinics , they found that none of the people actually had mercury toxicity .
The doctors cautioned that regular and heavy fish eaters may have higher mercury levels , but they ’re still not at levels associated with any health problems .
Other fishy aspects of this story
As ABC News reported , his doctor is the medical director of Peak Wellness of Greenwich , Connecticut .
He told ABC News that Piven ’s levels of mercury were nearly six times normal and that he is now being treated with dietary supplements to help clear the mercury from his body .
Wonder what dietary supplements he ’s prescribed , since actual mercury poisoning is n’t treated with supplements .
Mr. Piven ’s mercury levels were reportedly tested after he complained of extreme fatigue and weakness , but that ’s not the presenting symptom of mercury toxicity , according to the CDC , either .
While David Mamet reportedly laughed about Mr. Piven , saying he was leaving the show to “ pursue a career as a thermometer , ” it ’s possible that Mr. Piven is a victim .
He may have come to believe he really is suffering from mercury poisoning .
The nocebo effect frequently explains physical symptoms experienced by people who have come to fear some contaminant or exposure is dangerous or been told that they have been exposed .
It ’s more common than people realize .
And no one is immune from its effects , as a recent episode of House dramatized .
Peak Wellness is an integrative medicine clinic offering alternative modalities and contract clinical trials .
It is headed by Piven ’s doctor , Dr. Carlon Colker , M.D. With impressive credentials and affiliations , Dr. Colker may be most known as a bodybuilder , television personality , and author of Extreme Muscle Enhancement and The Greenwich Diet .
Does anyone remember this fad diet book from 2000 ?
You can now get a copy of The Greenwich Diet on Amazon for a penny .
It was another low - carb , high - protein diet that promised extraordinary weight loss , body fat loss , increased energy levels and healthier cholesterol levels .
There were complicated rules , detailed lists of foods and meal plans that were supposed to change your metabolism and make your body a fat - burning machine .
Dieters were told to avoid pasta , rice , potatoes , baked goods , fruits ( except apples ) , all pork products , and soy .
The most critical part of the diet was dietary supplements : whey protein ( as found in Cheese Wiz ) supplements , which were said to build muscle ; and essential fatty acid supplements , which were said to lower blood pressure and act as a diuretic and improve digestion .
And then there ’s the water — our bodies contain about 12 gallons of water and yet most people are permanently dehydrated , Dr. Colker claimed .
Dehydration is the primary reason fat women do n’t lose weight , he said .
Dr. Coker , who was appointed chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board of Health Sciences Group , Inc. , a neutraceutical and functional food supplement company , has had a bumpy past .
Back in 1999 , Cytodyne Technologies , which made the dietary supplement Xenadrine RFA - 1 , laced with ephedra , commissioned Dr. Colker and Peak Wellness to conduct a clinical trial showing its effectiveness .
The paper was presented as an abstract at a 1999 meeting in Albuquerque , New Mexico , of the American Society of Exercise Physiologists and later published in the online Journal of Exercise Physiology .
Only 23 of the 30 participants completed the 8 week trial , which claimed that those in the supplement group had an implausibly greater body weight and fat loss than those taking the placebo with no adverse health effects .
In 2003 , he was sued in three states for falsifying data in the clinical study to hide the dangerous effects of the dietary supplement .
According to the New York Times , the lawsuits alleged that he and Peak Wellness clinic ran fraudulent tests , altered the results and hid dangerous adverse reactions suffered by test subjects .
Forbes later reported that the San Diego Superior Court ruled against the dietary supplement company in the class action lawsuit , saying that Dr. Colker lacked credibility and ordered the dietary supplement company to pay $ 12.5 million to California consumers .
Hopefully , Mr. Piven will feel better soon and get the best medical care .
A second opinion might also help .
Anytime we ’re given a diagnosis that has serious consequences , it never hurts to get a second opinion from an independent medical professional .
While this story is ongoing , the take home lesson for us is already clear .
Follow the science and not let ourselves get caught up , without sound evidence , in scary news of yet another danger lurking out there .

* The only cases in the scientific literature of mercury poisoning from eating fish on record were from fish tainted after an industrial chemical accident in Minamata Bay , Japan in the 1950s , which resulted in fish with methylmercury levels 40 to 1,000 times higher than the fish Americans , and most people around the world , eat .
** As the ATSDR at the CDC reports : “ Some religions have practices that may include the use of metallic mercury .
Examples of these religions include Santeria ( a Cuban - based religion whose followers worship both African deities and Catholic saints ) , Voodoo ( a Haitian - based set of beliefs and rituals ) , Palo Mayombe ( a secret form of ancestor worship practiced mainly in the Caribbean ) , and Espiritismo ( a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico ) .
Not all people who observe these religions use mercury , but when mercury is used in religious , ethnic , or ritualistic practices , exposure to mercury may occur both at the time of the practice and afterwards from contaminated indoor air .
Metallic mercury is sold under the name " azogue " in stores called " botanicas . "
Botanicas are common in Hispanic and Haitian communities , where azogue may be sold as an herbal remedy or for spiritual practices . ”
But Mr. Piven is reportedly taking Chinese herbs and there are no reports that he has changed his religion to Voodoo or similar ancient form of worship .
In August , Boston researchers reported that 20 % of Indian Ayurvedic herbal formulas sold via the internet contained lead , arsenic or mercury metals , but those are n’t Chinese herbs , of course .
Winter Wonderland Germany Sinks into Spectacular Deep Freeze
Temperatures in Germany fell as low as minus 25 degrees Celsius on Monday night and the weather is expected to remain Arctic for several days .
The country is covered in a spectacular sheet of snow and ice .
Commuters are complaining , but Berlin Zoo 's polar bear Knut is having a whale of a time .
Clojure is surrounded by hype these days .
The word on the streets is that Clojure is the Next Big Thing .
It has access to the largest library of code and it proposes a nice solution the to the concurrency problem .
Lots more has been said ...
But I have n't seen a lot of code .
So I set out to make a small but meaningful program in Clojure to get a sense of it's potential .
I give Clojure two thumbs up , and I think you 'll do too .
The Mona Lisa Problem
The program I present tries to paint Mona Lisa with a small number of semi- transparent colored polygons .
It does so by using Darwin 's theory of evolution to evolve programs that draw Mona Lisa .
Here 's the simplified algorithm :
1. Generate an initial population of programs
2 . Take the n best programs of the current population
3. Create Children from the best programs by mating and mutating them
4 . Replace the current population with the n-best and the children programs
5. Repeat from 2 until satisfied
See my more complete java version for details and do n't miss Roger Alsing 's seminal post .
Clojure is Lisp
Lisp code can be treated as data .
That makes evolving programs painless .
My Genetic Algorithm simply evolves lambdas .
Running the evolved programs is a matter of calling 'eval .
The program is side - effects free ( almost ! ) .
The majority of the program is functional .
There are only two sources of side - effects :
1. Drawing on the canvas
2. Handling the GUI
Clojure is Java
It can be distributed and run anywhere .
Clojure is compiled to Java bytecodes .
Clojure can use Java objects directly without wrappers .
I was able to create a cross- platform GUI in a few lines with Swing .
Let me illustrate this by creating an object deriving from JPanel that overides the paint method to draw a green rectangle .

I painlessly parallelized my code because it is side - effects free .
Clojure provides primitives that can parallelize functional code .
The bottleneck of the application is calculating the fitness of each individual of a population .
In functional terms , it is expressed by mapping each individual to it 's fitness using ' with ' function as it's first argument and the population as it's second argument .
Clojure provides the ' function to make that mapping parallel .
It divides the work between worker threads and it uses as many of them as you have CPU cores .
Thus , writing functionaly allowed me to parallelize my code by adding one '' character .
See clojure .
parallel
Performance was n't a concern when I wrote the application .
I tried to keep it simple .
After all , that is the purpose of using a high - level language .
Surprisingly , the fitness function ( the bottleneck ) runs faster in Clojure than in Java .
Unfortunately I do n't have time to dig into this now .
Here 's a graph comparing the run time the fitness function in Java and Clojure .
The measure is the average of 25 samples of 100 runs of the fitness function in each language .
Here 's the benchmark for reference .
Lambdas are not garbage collected .
Yes .
That means lambdas can be the cause of memory leaks .
As described by Charles Nutter , each lambda in Clojure is an anonymous class in Java .
The problem is that classes are never garbage collected .
They reside in a special place called the PermGen .
No need to say , my program quickly fills up the PermGen .
The only solution for now is to extend the PermGen .
I do n't think this is a problem for most applications though .
EDIT : As of r1232 , lambdas created in eval can be GCed .
Thanks to Christophe Grand for pointing it out .
Let 's see what your favorite language can do .
The challenge is to write a small program that solves the Mona Lisa problem using Genetic Programming .
Show us some code !
Some of the languages I 'd like to see are Haskell , Factor , Potion , Ioke , Erlang among lots of others .
Do n't forget to leave a link in the comment section of this post .
Here 's the github repository .
Please read the source code with syntax highlighting on github .
The following is thecode listing for theonly .
I am not an academic .
In fact , as far as computer science goes I have never been an academic .
My background is in mathematics .
Nevertheless , I try to read a lot of papers .
I ’m interested ( albeit currently only in an armchair way ) in programming language implementation and theory .
I occasionally feel the need to implement a cool data structure for fun or profit .
And , most importantly , I need to for my job .
I work on SONAR .
As such a great deal of what I do is natural language processing and data mining .
It ’s a fairly heavily studied field in academia and it would be madness for me to not draw on that fact .
Eventually I ’d like to feed back into it too – we do a bunch of interesting things in SONAR and I ’m reasonably confident that we can isolate enough of it into things we can share without giving the entire game away ( we need to sell the product after all , so giving away the entire workings of it is non ideal ) .
I ’ve got to say .
It ’s a pretty frustrating process .
Part of the problem is what I ’ve come to refer to as the “ Academic firewall of doom ” .
Everything lives behind paid subscriptions .
Moreover , it lives behind exhorbitantly priced paid subscriptions .
Even worse :
None of the ludicrous quantities of money I ’d be paying for these subscriptions if I choose to pay for them would go to the authors of the papers .
The problems of academic publishing are well known .
So assuming I do n’t want to pay the cripplingly high fees for multiple journals , I have to either rely on the kindness of authors in publishing their papers on their own websites ( a practice I ’m not certain of the legal status of but am exceedingly grateful for ) , or if they have not done so pay close to $ 100 for a copy of the paper .
Before I know if the paper actually contains the information I need .
Another unrelated problem which is currently being discussed on reddit in response to an older article by Bill Mill is that very few of the papers I depend on for ideas come with reference implementations of the algorithms they describe .
I understand the reasons for this .
But nevertheless , it ’s very problematic for me .
The thing is :
Most of these papers do n’t work nearly as universally as one might like to believe .
They frequently contain algorithms which have been … let ’s say , empirically derived .
Take for example the punkt algorithm which I ’m currently implementing ( which has an implementation in NLTK , which at least gives me confidence that it works .
I ’m trying not to look at it too much though due to its GPLed nature ) .
It starts out with a completely legitimate and theoretically justified statistic to do with colocations .
That ’s fine .
Except it turns out that it does n’t work that well .
So they introduce a bunch of additional weightings to fuzz the numbers into something that does work and then through experimentation arrive at a test statistic which does a pretty good job ( or so they claim ) .
That ’s fine .
It ’s how I often work too .
I ’m certainly not judging them for that .
But it does mean that I ’m potentially in for a lot of work to reproduce the results of the paper ( hopefully only a couple of days of work .
But that ’s a lot compared to firing up the reference implementation ) for very uncertain benefits .
And additionally it means that if it does n’t work I do n’t know whose fault it is – mine or the algorithm’s .
So then if it does n’t work I have to make a decision whether to spend time debugging or to cut my losses and run .
It should also be noted that negative results are , for whatever reason , the overwhelming majority .
I ’ve written enough similar things that actually work ( at least some of which are based on papers ) that I choose to believe that at least not all of these are due to my incompetence .
So , to recap , I ’m in a situation where in order to find out if any given paper is useful to me I need to a )
Spend near to $ 100 if I ’m unlucky and b )
In the event that the paper actually does contain what I want , take several days of work to implement its results and c )
In the common case get negative results and even then not be certain about the validity of them so potentially spend more time debugging .
So the common case is designed in such a way as to cost me a significant amount of money and effort and is unlikely to yield positive results .
You can understand why I might find this setup a bit problematic .
Toyota has long been the shining example of success within the global car industry , taking market share year after year from primarily the Detroit auto makers .
But while Toyota remains in far better shape than the Detroit auto makers , they too are starting to suffering .
After being for years one of the most profitable companies , in the world , they now looks set to report an operating loss in the year ending March 2009
And the trend is in fact even worse than this full year number suggests , as they were profitable at the beginning of the year , the loss is even greater at the end of the year , and suggests an even bigger loss next year , unless the situation suddenly improves .
There are two reasons for this reversal of fortunes .
First , the car industry is one of the most cyclical and as Toyota 's gain in market share has ended , meaning that its sales particularly in the U.S. is plummeting .
The other reason is the extreme strength of the Japanese yen .
While Toyota has moved more and more of its production outside Japan , it is still a large exporter of cars from Japan to the rest of the world .
And as the yen is up some 25 % against the U.S. dollar this year , and even more against most other currencies .
A 1 yen gain against the U.S. dollar will reduce its profit by 40 billion yen ( $ 450 million ) , meaning that the 23 yen gain against the U.S. dollar this year alone will reduce its profit ( increase its losses ) by roughly $ 10 billion .
And as Toyota like others use futures and as much of the gain has come lately , we 've only seen a small part of the pain for Toyota from this .
And add to that the losses from the yen 's even greater strength against most other currencies .
Toyota is well capitalized so it will be some time before they face the threat of bankruptcy , like GM and Chrysler .
But they are certainly heading for big losses in the coming year (s ) unless the global slump ends and / or the yen quickly weaken significantly .

Hilty confirmed that the date occurred , but that her heart was still broken from her split with Good Charlotte star Benji Madden , whom she dated for nine months .
When questioned on her ' relationship ' with Clooney , Hilton said it was just a " group of friends and she is very single . "
She also loves Lucky Charms because they are magically delicious .
Yeah , we made that last part up , but come on .... is she trying to ruin George 's reputation ?
Do you really believe that George would hook up with Hilton ?
Although on second thought - he has been pictured very intoxicated recently .
Benji showed Paris what friendship is all about and she is still calling him her " best friend " and says that he was the sweetest person she ever dated .
We really want to go back and find a video of Paris talking about Stavros Niarchos and a few other loves of her life but the archives were way too big so you will just have to take our word for it - same old story , different guy .
Sorry Benji ... we 're not saying you 're not totally the " sweetest " and all , but your ex-girl is a habitual man wrecker and uses that line over and over again .
We found a video of Paris in Sundance being interviewed and yes , it might just happen to be the most nauseating video we have today , but check it out .
When asked if there was anyone she would like to meet , she said no ... she knows everyone .
Check out the video below .

Commissioner Joaquin Almunia predicts recovery from late 2009
The eurozone economy will shrink 1.9 % in 2009 and grow by only 0.4 % in 2010 , the European Commission has forecast .
The Commission said in a statement that the whole European Union was facing a " deep and protracted recession " .
Unemployment in the the 16 countries using the euro is expected to exceed 10 % in 2010 , up from 7.5 % in 2008 .
The commission hopes it will be possible " to create the conditions for a gradual recovery in the second part of 2009 " in the eurozone economy .
Economy Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement it would be achieved through " measures to stabilise the financial markets , the easing of monetary policy and the economic recovery plans " .
The commission said annual inflation in the 16 countries using the euro would be 1 % in 2009 and 1.8 % a year later .
' Continued fall '
As events unfolded late last autumn , it became increasingly clear that the EU would not be spared a deep and protracted recession
European Commission statement
According to official figures , the eurozone has been in recession since September of last year .
" As events unfolded late last autumn , it became increasingly clear that the EU would not be spared a deep and protracted recession , " the commission said .
It added that " the outlook is for a continued fall in GDP throughout the first half of this year " .
Different vews
Analysts gave different opinions on the commission 's latest forecast .
Sunil Kapadia at UBS
Bank said : " On the growth figures for 2009 , it 's a pretty fair assessment " .
However , Gilles Moec at Bank of America said it was more pessimistic than the Commission , forecasting a contraction of 2.6 % in 2009 .
Last week , Germany became the latest country to unveil an economic stimulus package worth about 50bn euros ( $ 67bn ; £ 45 bn ) to kick - start Europe 's largest economy .
Eurozone 's key interest rate is now at 2 % , its lowest level since December 2005 .
A SPECK of the mineral zircon that ’s older than any yet found on Earth has been recovered from a rock sample brought back by Apollo 17 astronauts .
The grain has helped pinpoint the age at which the molten moon solidified .
Lunar zircons were not studied at the time of the Apollo missions because the technology to date them did not exist , says geologist Clive Neal of the University of Notre Dame , Indiana .
“ It ’s serendipitous to find this , and really emphasises the [ value ] of sample returns , ” he says .
Until now , the zircon found in lunar rocks was between 3.90 and 4.35 billion years old , the same as the oldest zircon found on Earth .
But many of these lunar grains came from low - lying areas on the moon , where the crust had been resurfaced after being melted by meteorite impacts .
The new sample , found by Alexander Nemchin at Curtin University of Technology in Perth , Australia , and colleagues , is 4.42 billion years old , and came from the lunar highlands .
That means it crystallised after the crust first solidified , within 100 million years of the moon ’s formation ( Nature Geoscience , DOI : 10.1038 /NGEO417 ) .

The grain sets limits on the moon ’s age , says Dianne Taylor of the University of California , Los Angeles , who has studied similar samples .
The moon is thought to have formed from debris ejected by a giant impact between Earth and a smaller body between 10 and 100 million years after the formation of the solar system , 4.57 billion years ago .
Taylor reckons the lunar crust formed within 90 million years of the impact , which tallies well with the age of the zircon .
Zircons from Earth tell the story of a fast - cooling planet that developed a solid crust within 200 million years of formation from the solar nebula , says John Valley at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , whose group dated the oldest terrestrial samples .
“ It ’s reasonable that there would be something older from the moon than on Earth , ” he says , because the smaller moon cooled more quickly after the colossal impact .
Solarmer Energy Developing Plastic Solar Cells for Portable Electronics
January 23rd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Plastic solar cells are coming soon to a portable gadget near you thanks to University of Chicago researchers and Solarmer Energy .
Solarmer ’s prototype plastic cell measures 8 square inches and is expected to have 8 percent efficiency as well as a three - year lifespan .
Until now , plastic solar cells have only been able to reach 5 to 6 percent efficiency .
The key to the Solarmer cell ’s increased efficiency is a semiconducting material dubbed PTB1 that converts sunlight into electricity .
PTB1 ’s active layer is only 100 nanometers thick ( the width of 1,000 atoms ) .
Solarmer expects to have a commercial - grade prototype ready later this year .

Thus it is difficult to be precise about the number of people who have been beaten in the three days since the policy was declared , but it clearly runs well into the hundreds and perhaps higher .
Accounts from Palestinian districts indicate the policy has in fact been in effect for more than a week .
For the most part the beatings have occurred in refugee centers , which are now closed to journalists by the army , or in remote villages .
They often occur at night .
The army is not giving out specific information .
'' There is a lot of broken hands from clubbing , and also some broken legs , '' said an official of Medical Aid , a Palestinian organization that provides medical treatment in the West Bank and Gaza .
'' The number is really huge , including both men and women , certainly hundreds . ''
'' We are deeply shocked by the evidence of the brutality with which people are evidently being beaten , '' said Angela Williams , the acting director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in the Gaza Strip .
'' We are especially shocked by the beatings of old men and women . ''
She said two men , one 85 years old , the other 75 , had been treated at the Jabaliya center in Gaza for head injuries after being beaten .
The clinic there also treated 12 members of a single family , between 10 and 54 years old , after severe beatings , she added .
The new policy has thus far drawn little political or other criticism from Israelis .
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir defended the policy , saying it was not Defense Minister Rabin 's policy alone , but '' decided upon and instituted by the Government as a whole . ''
Wide Coverage in Newspapers
Israeli newspapers have begun extensive coverage of the policy , including interviews with military commanders , who stress the effectiveness of the beatings but express worries about the effects on troop morale , and with Palestinians who have been beaten .
Traditionally , this might be the type of comic that I create before announcing I have some ridiculous disease yet , no , I 'm just in a maudlin and introspective type of mood at the moment .
Feel free to blame the season , which would n't be inappropriate , but I think more directly it 's the lack of physical activity , exposure to the environment , and just in general moving .
This is where the whole " bodies at rest tend to stay at rest " metaphor gets applied .
Do you guys know the trick to know what a preposition is , and how to avoid using them to end sentences ?
You take the last word of your sentence and plug it into here : " The rabbit ran ____ the hill . " and if that sentence makes sense then it's a preposition and you should n't be using it .
For example : " What did you step on ? " is poorly formatted because " the rabbit ran on the hill . "
Now technically it 's incorrect but no one really says things like " On what did you step ? "
So it 's usually never that big of a deal anyway .
I just thought the whole rabbit thing was interesting .
Where 's my hasenfeffer ?

Colbert welcomes
Fox token liberal Alan Colmes as ' new sidekick ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 6 , 2009
Print This Email This Commentator Alan Colmes has left his slot as token liberal on the Fox show formerly known as Hannity & Colmes .
Instead he is set to take up a new role as the liberal sidekick on Comedy Central 's Colbert Report .
Or maybe not .
Stephen Colbert , who plays a Hannity - like figure on his own show , welcomed the mild - mannered Colmes on Monday to the temporarily renamed Colbert & Colmes , telling him , " I look forward to hearing your responses to my opinions -- which can be any of the phrases on this list . "
" Right again , Stephen ! " Colmes read out from the list .
" Booyah !
Brilliant insight , Stephen ! "
Colbert then proceeded to ignore Colmes -- even running graphics over his face -- as he launched into a segment on the Democrats ' reluctant to accept Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich 's designation of a replacement for Barack Obama 's former Senate seat .
" Clearly Democrats are racists , " Colbert suggested .
" The only reason they supported Barack Obama for president was to get him out of their all - white Senate .
Notice how they 've given him his own separate but equal branch of government ? "
Things went downhill at the end of the show , however , when Colmes started attempting to talk back , beginning with Colbert 's comment that " we 're also saying goodbye to President Bush , currently on his legacy tour -- and what a legacy it is ! "
" Yes , " Colmes put in , " and we 'll be spending the next number of years cleaning up his ' legacy . ' "
As Colmes continued to argue and poke holes in Colbert 's analogies , Colbert became more and more frustrated , finally yelling , " I hate you !
I 'm firing your ass , Colmes ! "
Colmes offered no protest but simply extracted payment for the full five weeks specified in his contract and gleefully hurried off the set .
He then yelled " Booyah !
Colmes away , " turned into a bat , and flew off .
The Associated Press contacted Colmes and reports that he has " returned to his human self . "
" It was very well done , " Colmes eulogized about the short - lived Colbert and Colmes .

Across the board , the 2009 economic news is bad for Germany .
Unshipped goods and containers are piling up at the Hamburg port as Germany Faces Worst Post - War Economic Downturn .
Germany is facing its biggest economic decline since the Second World War with Chancellor Angela Merkel 's government saying Wednesday it expects Europe 's largest economy to contract by 2.25 per cent this year .
Germany 's Economics Minister Michael Glos and Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck released the latest data on Wednesday , revising their prior 2009 forecast down sharply from last October 's prediction of 0.2 percent growth .
Since then , German exports have declined precipitously and are expected to be down 8.9 percent for the year .
Joblessness to increase
At same time , the Berlin government 's annual economics report predicts rising unemployment as a result of the global economic slowdown .
The number of people out of work is expected to climb by 500,000 to 3.5 million before the end of the year .
That would push the German unemployment rate back up to 8.4 percent , according to the ministers ' report .
German consumers remain skeptical
Adding to the bad financial news , a Forsa Institute survey published on Wednesday revealed that a majority of Germans remain skeptical of Chancellor Angela Merkel 's second 50 - billion - euro ( $ 66 billion ) stimulus package .
In fact , 59 percent dismissed the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros ( $ 3,200 ) as an incentive to car buyers who trade in older vehicles for more environmentally friendly automobiles .
Only 11 percent said they would even consider accepting the offer .

Is Germany Turning Into A Planned Socialist Economy ?
As part of her efforts to combat the economic crisis , German Chancellor Angela Merkel is increasing the state 's influence in the market , buying holdings in banks and bailing out individual industries and companies .
Is Germany turning into a planned economy ?
The government in Berlin is undergoing an astonishing change of heart .
Only a few weeks ago , Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke out against " arbitrary , unfocussed economic stimulus programs " and large - scale government intervention in the real economy .
She made it clear that under no circumstance should " the government acquire permanent new responsibilities in the economy . "
But now , suddenly , it seems like the public sector 's economic intervention cannot be forceful enough for the administration .
Last week , Merkel introduced the biggest economic stimulus program in German postwar history , as well as giving her blessing to a series of government interventions into companies and industries , the likes of which the country has not seen since German reunification .
The government has acquired a 25 percent share of Frankfurt - based Commerzbank , and it plans to purchase a majority stake in the ailing Munich - based mortgage lender Hypo Real Estate .
It is looking into providing assistance to the highly leveraged Schaeffler Group , based in the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach , and has made several hundred billion euros in additional guarantees available to companies .
With its investment and lending programs , the Merkel administration is promoting questionable merger projects , turning itself into something of an über - entrepreneur in many industrial sectors and , by placing the state - owned KfW in a key position , promoting precisely the financial institution that acquired the reputation of being " Germany 's stupidest bank " during the financial crisis .
" With this economic stimulus package , Germany is moving a step closer to the French approach to industrial policy , " warns Bert Rürup , chairman of the German Council of Economic Experts .
Jon Stewart tries to make the case that MSNBC is drifting as far leftward as FOX has always been rightward .
I 'll admit that some of the comparisons are pretty damn accurate ... although the Olbermann / Hannity might be going a tad bit too far .
On the similarities between O'Reilly and Chris Matthews
" Last month 's election marked a poltiical sea change in America .
But what about news - wise ?
Clearly FOX news will no longer be the mouthpiece of this new administration .
who will step up to full that gap ? " [ glowing MSNBC Obama commercial ]
Subtle .
But you know , MSNBC , it 's not as simple as soaring music and a full scale embrace of the candidate 's slogan .
If you wanna be the administration 's news source of choice , you 're going to need foot soldiers .
For instance , you 're going to need a freakishly over - sized , ruddy - faced Irish multi-millionaire who still clings to his blue collar roots .
I can't tell you how happy I am that Stewart threw in that jab at Doocy at the end .
Absolutely love it .
And he's got a great point at the end there about MSNBC 's documentary marathons .
While CNN and FOX were covering the Mumbai attacks , MSNBC held strong with a full days worth of specials about local newscasters getting attacked by unwilling subjects .
C'mon , Peacock !
Robot innovation continued its relentless advances during 2008 .
In this post we would like to showcase some of our favorite robots and robot videos of the last year or so .
This review is heavily slanted to consumer robots and research robots .
Perhaps in the future we can do a review of industrial robots .
Given the sheer number of robots that are out there we know there will be several excellent robots that we have overlooked in this review .
If you know of any really awesome robots or robot videos that we have missed please let us know and we will consider adding them to this post .
So without further delay , lets take a look at some of the best robots and robot videos of 2008 ( maybe some are from 2007 too ) , broken down by category :
Soccer
Check out this impressive video of the 12th Kondo Cup Robotic Soccer competition :
Humanoid
Earlier we reviewed the nao robot from Aldebaran Robotics here at the hub and this robot is just totally awesome .
The nao robot is the official robot for this year ’s robocup in China :
The I -Sobot is an incredible humanoid robot .
This is one of the smallest bipedal robots out there , with a height of only 6.5 inches and a weight of only 12 ounces .
The I - Sobot is the winner of the Japan Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry ( METI ) “ Robot of 2008 ” award .
Most amazing is that this robot costs less than $ 300 .
Such sophistication in a consumer robot at such a low price speaks volumes about the progress being made in robotics .
The I - Sobot people needs to talk to the Nao robot people about how to make awesome marketing videos .
It is really hard to find videos that do justice to this amazing robot .
Anyway , here are the best videos we could find :
Self Assembly
The ISI Polymorphic Robotics Laboratory at USC has a fantastic robot called the Superbot that is capable of numerous modes of motion and is made of several autonomous units that can be manually assembled or sometimes automatically self assembled .
Excellent videos below :
Below is a video of a self healing robotic chair .
This robot is n’t very useful , but the concept of a robot that can be broken to pieces and then reassemble itself in this fashion has wide potential :
Rugged Terrain
Boston Dynamics makes some of the best robots in the world for traversing rugged terrain .
Watch the video below and see how this amazing quadraped called “ Big Dog ” can go up hills with rocks and mud and anything else in its path .
The best part is about 30 seconds into the video where someone kicks the walking robot as hard has possible .
The robot is able to maitain balance and continue walking much better than a human could do .
The robot is capable of carrying over 300 lbs of cargo and would seem to be useful for army missions , planetary exploration , and several other situations :
Ornithopters
An ornithopter is an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings .
Check out this awesome slow motion video of a butterfly ornithopter in action :
Also , check out what is one of the smallest ornithopters around .
The Ifly Vamp in retail stores for less than $ 40 :
I can’t read japanese , but these guys seem to have some pretty amazing stuff :

Music
Check out this robot playing the violin :
And this one playing the flute :
Exoskeleton
Impressive exoskeleton suit called the HAL ( Human Assisted Limbs ) increases a human ’s strength by 5 times :
A worthy addition to this list is the anybot :
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia ’s government resigned on Wednesday after Dmitry Medvedev was sworn in as the country ’s new president .
Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov signed an order for the government to resign , the official www.government.ru
Web site said .
It is standard procedure for Russian cabinets to step down when a new president takes office .
Former president Vladimir Putin has said he will serve as Medvedev ’s prime minister .
I finally got around to porting my actor process ring code ( Erlang , Scala ) to run with the Kilim library tonight .
Kilim is a Java library for lightweight message - passing .
The three main things to know about are Tasks , Mailboxes , and @pausable .
In Kilim , actors are replaced with Tasks , which are just lightweight runnable objects that serves basically the same role .
Mailboxes are designed for multiple - producer , single - consumer access just like Erlang and Scala actor mailboxes .
In Kilim though , Mailbox is just a class and Tasks do n’t necessarily have a Mailbox or could even have more than one .
Mailboxes are also generic and typed by the kind of message they should receieve .
This opens up new ways to compose Tasks and Mailboxes into a broader range of structures .
Messages are typically simple ( potentially mutable ) classes .
Finally , there is an annotation called @pausable .
This is used to specify that a method can be paused , continuation - style , during pausable calls ; sleep and yield are two provided hooks and the mailbox get / put methods are also pausable .
@pausable is also used to mark classes for instrumentation .
That leads me to the compile - time weaver .
After you ’ve compiled your classes , you need to run a compile - time weaver to modify the bytecode so that the continuation - style pausing is available .
At runtime , pausing is used to schedule a large number of actors over a small number of kernel threads .
In all , this is a really interesting set of features that adapts the Erlang / Scala actor model into the statically typed world of Java pretty nicely .
From a usage point of view , it ’s kind of a pain .
Compile - time weaving sucks rocks as it puts a kink in every tool chain plus there ’s nothing happening that could n’t be done at runtime with a Java agent , as far as I can tell .
I also had a lot of time to get the Weaver to run on my first stab at the code .
It was far from obvious that the error messages were indicating I had forgotten @pausable on the non-Actor classes .
Fortunately , I know enough about ASM to tell what I was missing .
And once I got it running I got some weird NoSuchMethodErrors due to incorrectly specifying @pausable on methods that did n’t need it .
These bumps did n’t bother me too much though – this is a new project and I understand that it ’s early for that kind of help .
Now to a little code .
This is really pretty much a port from the Scala code into Java , which was pretty close .
I broke the code ( previously in one file ) into Ring ( the main code ) , Message , TokenMessage , NodeActor , and TimerActor .
You ’ll notice there is a LOT more code with the Java version than the Scala or Erlang versions .
[ source : java ]
import java.util.ArrayList ;
import java.util.List ;</p>
import kilim .
Mailbox ;
import kilim .
pausable ;
@pausable
public class Ring {
public static void main ( String arg [ ] ) {
new Ring ( ) .startRing ( Integer.parseInt( arg[ 0 ] ) ) ;
}
public void startRing ( int n ) {
List nodes = spawnNodes ( n , startTimer ( ) ) ;
Mailbox mailbox = connectNodes (n , nodes ) ;
mailbox.putnb( Message .START ) ;
try { Thread.sleep(100000000 ) ; } catch ( InterruptedException e ) {}
}
private TimerActor startTimer ( ) {
TimerActor actor = new TimerActor ( new Mailbox ( ) ) ;
actor.start ( ) ;
return actor ;
}
private List spawnNodes ( int n , TimerActor timer ) {
System.out.println(“ constructing nodes ” ) ;
long startConstructing = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ;
List nodes = new ArrayList ( n+1 ) ;
for ( int i=0 ; i<n ; i++ ) {
nodes.add ( new NodeActor( i , new Mailbox ( ) , timer.getInbox ( ) ) ) ;
nodes.get ( i).start ( ) ;
}
long endConstructing = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ;
System.out.println( “ Took ” + ( endConstructing - startConstructing ) + ” ms to construct ” + n + ” nodes ” ) ;
return nodes ;
}
private Mailbox connectNodes ( int n , List nodes ) {
System.out.println(“ connecting nodes ” ) ;
nodes.add(nodes.get ( 0 ) ) ;
for ( int i=0 ; i<n ; i++ ) {
nodes.get(i).connect(nodes.get(i+1).getInbox ( ) ) ;
}
return nodes.get(0).getInbox ( ) ;
}
}

It ’s very important that the Ring class is marked @pausable or the weaver wo n’t work .
Now the message classes .
I defined some immutable singleton messages in Message and a mutable TokenMessage : [ source : java ]
public class Message {
public static final Message START = new Message ( ) ;
public static final Message STOP = new Message ( ) ;
public static final Message CANCEL = new Message ( ) ;
}
public class TokenMessage extends Message {
public final int source ;
public int value ;
public TokenMessage ( int source , int value ) {
this .source = source ;
this .value = value ;
}
}
[ / source ]
And here ’s the node actor translated into a Kilim Task ( note the @pausable annotation on the execute ( ) method , which is defined in Task ) : [ source : java ]
import kilim .
Mailbox ;
import kilim .
Task ;
import kilim .
pausable ;
public class NodeActor extends Task {
private final int nodeId ;
private final Mailbox inbox ;
private final Mailbox timerInbox ;
private Mailbox nextInbox ;
public NodeActor ( int nodeId , Mailbox inbox , Mailbox timerInbox ) {
this .nodeId = nodeId ;
this .inbox = inbox ;
this.timerInbox = timerInbox ;
}
public Mailbox getInbox ( ) {
return this .inbox ;
}
public void connect ( Mailbox nextInbox ) {
this.nextInbox = nextInbox ;
}
@pausable
public void execute ( ) throws Exception {
while ( true ) {
Message message = inbox.get ( ) ;
if( message.equals ( Message .START ) ) {
System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis( ) + ” ” + nodeId + “ : Starting messages ” ) ;
timerInbox.putnb( Message .START ) ;
nextInbox.putnb(new TokenMessage ( nodeId , 0 ) ) ;
} else if ( message.equals ( Message .STOP ) ) {
//System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis( ) + ” ” + nodeId + “ : Stopping ” ) ;
nextInbox.putnb( Message .STOP ) ;
break ;
} else if ( message instanceof TokenMessage ) {
TokenMessage token = ( TokenMessage ) message ;
if ( token.source == nodeId ) {
int nextVal = token.value+1 ;
if(nextVal % 10000 == 0 ) {
System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis( ) + ” ” + nodeId + “ : Around ring ” + nextVal + ” times ” ) ;
}
if ( nextVal == 1000000 ) {
timerInbox.putnb( Message .STOP ) ;
timerInbox.putnb(Message.CANCEL ) ;
nextInbox.putnb( Message .STOP ) ;
break ;
} else {
token.value = nextVal ;
nextInbox.putnb( token ) ;
}
} else {
nextInbox.putnb( token ) ;
}
}
}
}
}
[ / source ]
And for completeness , here ’s the Timer Actor : [ source : java ]
import kilim .
Mailbox ;
import kilim .
Task ;
import kilim .
pausable ;
public class TimerActor extends Task {
private final Mailbox inbox ;
private boolean timing ;
private long startTime ;
public TimerActor( Mailbox inbox ) {
this .inbox = inbox ;
}
public Mailbox getInbox ( ) {
return this .inbox ;
}
@pausable
public void execute ( ) throws Exception {
while ( true ) {
Message message = inbox.get ( ) ;
if(message.equals ( Message .START ) && ! timing ) {
startTime = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ;
timing = true ;
} else if ( message.equals ( Message .STOP ) && timing ) {
long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis ( ) ;
System.out.println ( “ Start= ” + startTime + ” Stop= ” + endTime + ” Elapsed= ” + ( endTime - startTime ) ) ;
timing = false ;
} else if ( message.equals ( Message.CANCEL ) ) {
break ;
}
}
}
}
[ / source ]
To compile and weave , you ’ll do something like this : [ source : java ]
$ export KCP=$KILIM/libs/asm-all-2.2.3.jar:$KILIM/classes
$ javac - cp $ KCP -d bin src /*. java
$ java - cp $ KCP kilim.tools .
Weaver -d ./bin ./bin
$ java - cp $ KCPL ./ bin Ring 100
[ / source ]
And finally the results , here in comparison with Erlang and Scala 2.7.3/JDK 1.6 :

' House of horrors ' mother jailed for torturing her six children with years of incest and sex abuse
A mother who subjected her six children to years of incest and sexual abuse was jailed for seven years .
The 40 - year - old alcoholic , from Roscommon , Ireland , admitted she was the worst mother in the world after she put her youngsters through a harrowing catalogue of neglect , including forcing her 13 - year - old son to have sex with her .
She is the first woman in the history of the Irish state to be convicted of incest .
The woman , who can not be named to protect her children , was sentenced to seven years after pleading guilty at Roscommon Circuit Court to 10 charges , including two of incest , two of sexual abuse and six of neglect and wilful ill - treatment and neglect of the children between 1998 and 2004 .
Abuse :
The six children lived in fifth with dead rats and mice , and were not fed properly ( posed by model )
The court heard that social workers were called in as far back as 1996 .
Health chiefs tried to take the children into care in 2000 but a group , described in court as a Catholic right - wing organisation , helped the mother financially and she won a High Court case blocking the care order .
The offences took place at the family 's three - bedroom bungalow in Co Roscommon , which was dirty , strewn with rubbish , cold , damp and had dead rats and mice inside and out .
Judge Miriam Reynolds told the court that the children had been failed by everybody .
' Any possibility of them having a normal and proper life has been stolen from them by this woman who called herself their mother , ' the judge said .
' They feel guilty .
They feel they did something wrong .
I can assure them that they did not . '
The judge has also suggested that new laws may be needed to deal with incest cases involving mothers .
' The children have to know that this is wrong and that their mother was punished for it .
She must be punished for it , ' she told the court .
Judge Reynolds imposed 10 sentences ranging from 18 months to seven years - the longest term for sexual assault - all of which will run concurrently .
The children were aged between six and 15 when the offences took place .
Shocking victim impact statements from the youngsters were read to the court , detailing how they were not fed properly , their clothes were not washed and the range which heated the home was only lit once a month .
The mother , who suffers from depression and asthma and has a drinking problem , would routinely go to a pub in the evening at around 6 pm , leaving the children alone , only returning home when she was drunk in the early hours of the morning , one of her sons said .
He explained how he and a brother cared for the younger children and their mother would come home at between 3 am and 4 am , very drunk and arguing .
His sister , now aged 12 , said the home was scary when her mother was drunk , she was bullied at school and other children called her smelly .
In an interview with Gardai in 2006 , the mother admitted that her children were often blue with the cold , only had dinner twice a week and had lice crawling around their heads and bodies .
' It was a house of horrors ... with bells on , ' the mother said .
Did anybody else catch the ridiculously yellow Mormon puff piece that ABC News ran last night ?
One of the saddest excuses for journalism ever .
ABC was invited by the Mormons to come visit , without a camera , some new small temple they built in some town in Utah .
Yes , are you getting the “ news ” angle of the story – come visit a small church in the middle of nowhere , and do n’t bring a camera – stop the presses !
So ABC ’s Dan Harris dutifully showed up and did a broadcast parroting the Mormon ’s own talking points about how they were just a bit player in Prop 8 in California ( they provided half the funding and actually turned it around from a loss to a victory , but who ’s counting ) .
And for all you Jews , you ’re gonna love this one – the Mormons , ABC informs us , offer everyone the choice of converting to Mormonism on death .
Yes , that “ choice , ” ABC failed to mention , is one of the biggest controversies surrounding the Mormon church for over a decade .
They do n’t let you choose to convert , they forcibly convert you against your will , and have specifically been targeting dead Jewish Holocaust victims for forced conversion – and , even better , they promised to stop converting dead Holocaust victims to Mormonism , and then secretly kept doing it .
ABC did n’t bother mentioning any of this .
All they did was parrot the Mormon line .
And show us video of a new Mormon temple in the middle of nowhere .
Now that ’s news .
" There is this paranoid , over - the - top concern about paedophilia and child molestation - that it is not safe to leave children with men , " she said .
" These themes are running through society to such an extent that attitudes have become skewed and our anxiety does ultimately discriminate against men .
This puts men off from working in primary schools because they are concerned about how they will be viewed and what parents will think of them .
We have to challenge these negative and unhelpful belief systems . "
If a guy even put this on , that would pretty much guarantee disappointment for the lady .
Quality over quantity , but at least try for double digits .

George S. Patton , America ’s greatest combat general of the Second World War , was assassinated after the conflict with the connivance of US leaders , according to a new book .
The newly unearthed diaries of a colourful assassin for the wartime Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) , the forerunner of the CIA , reveal that American spy chiefs wanted Patton dead because he was threatening to expose allied collusion with the Russians that cost American lives .
The death of General Patton in December 1945 , is one of the enduring mysteries of the war era .
Although he had suffered serious injuries in a car crash in Manheim , he was thought to be recovering and was on the verge of flying home .
But after a decade - long investigation , military historian Robert Wilcox claims that OSS head General “ Wild Bill ” Donovan ordered a highly decorated marksman called Douglas Bazata to silence Patton , who gloried in the nickname “ Old Blood and Guts ” .
His book , “ Target Patton ” , contains interviews with Mr Bazata , who died in 1999 , and extracts from his diaries , detailing how he staged the car crash by getting a troop truck to plough into Patton ’s Cadillac and then shot the general with a low - velocity projectile , which broke his neck while his fellow passengers escaped without a scratch .
Mr Bazata also suggested that when Patton began to recover from his injuries , US officials turned a blind eye as agents of the NKVD , the forerunner of the KGB , poisoned the general .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Mr Wilcox told The Sunday Telegraph that when he spoke to Mr Bazata : “ He was struggling with himself , all these killings he had done .
He confessed to me that he had caused the accident , that he was ordered to do so by Wild Bill Donovan .
“ Donovan told him : ‘ We ’ve got a terrible situation with this great patriot , he ’s out of control and we must save him from himself and from ruining everything the allies have done . ’
I believe Douglas Bazata .
He ’s a sterling guy . ”

I ’ve heard quite a few times about how Git would be broken if someone found an easy way to create SHA - 1 collisions .
A few years ago , after some attacks against SHA - 1 were published , Linus explained that the security model of Git does n’t depend on the hashes being cryptographically secure ( although he said that it was a bonus and also mentioned a few possible problems ) .
There was an interesting thread in the Git mailing list about this topic : Starting to think about sha-256 ?.
Speaking UNIX
Opening Windows with Cygwin
Cygwin provides a complete UNIX shell — from awk to zcat — on Windows

If you 're a regular reader of this column , you 've likely now mastered much of the UNIX lingo .
Colloquialisms such as " pipe the output , " " kill the process , " and " use a wildcard " — strange phrases to the uninitiated — should be familiar and comfortable .
Frequently used acronyms API : Application programming interface
Application programming interface IT : Information technology
Alas , UNIX is n't the only tongue spoken in the machine room .
IBM ® mainframe folks speak cants of " z , " such as IBM z/OS ® and System z9 Virtual Machine ( z / VM ) ; harried embedded systems developers jabber in eCos ; and still others chit - chat in various argots of UNIX , such as Linux® , FreeBSD , Sun Solaris , and Mac OS X. Modern information technology is a latter - day Babel .
Of course , a great many also speak the Windows vernacular , although most are versed only in Windows ' point - and - click patois .
After some 20 - odd years of revisions , the predominance of Windows users have forgotten the arcane DOS dialect .
Indeed , compared to a UNIX shell , the Windows COMMAND utility is woefully underpowered ; hence , UNIX users typically find Windows a frustrating platform .
Moreover , Windows can be especially vexing for UNIX software developers accustomed to an expansive and rich set of command - line tools .
To UNIX developers , using Windows is akin to visiting a strange and foreign land .
Luckily , Cygwin ( see Related topics ) provides a familiar destination within Windows , like finding a McDonald 's in France .
( Royale with cheese , anyone ? )
Cygwin is a UNIX - like shell environment for Windows .
It consists of two components : a UNIX API library to emulate many of the features that the UNIX operating system provides , and adaptations of the Bash shell and a plethora of UNIX utilities to provide the familiar UNIX command - line interface .
The former component is provided as a Windows Dynamic Link Library ( DLL ) .
The latter component is a collection of individual programs — many built from source code unchanged from UNIX — based on the Cygwin DLL .
Combined , the two give you all the comforts of your UNIX home directory , sweet home .
In this month 's Speaking UNIX column , you install Cygwin , explore its command - line interface ( CLI ) , and build open source software not included in the standard Cygwin distribution to experience how easy it is to port ( at least some ) UNIX applications to the emulation environment .
Version details
As of this writing , the current version of the Cygwin DLL is 1.5.25 - 15 .
You can install Cygwin on any recent , commercial version of Windows except for Windows CE .
( However , support for Windows 95 , Windows 98 , and Windows ME will be obsolesced in an upcoming release of Cygwin . )
The examples and figures shown in this article are based on Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 3 ( SP3 ) running under Parallels version 3.0 on an Apple MacBook in Coherence mode .
Installing Cygwin
Unlike other software presented here , Cygwin uses the Windows Installer .
The Cygwin setup.exe file installs the software anew and is re-used any time you want to add , change , or upgrade components of your Cygwin configuration .
Open a browser on your Windows system , and point to http://cygwin.com/setup.exe to download the Cygwin installer .
The installer itself is very small ( about 600KB ) , because the bulk of the Cygwin software is subsequently downloaded during the setup process .
After your download succeeds , perform the following steps to install Cygwin :
Run the Setup program .
Figure 1 shows the Cygwin welcome screen .
Figure 1 .
The first of many dialog boxes presented during Cygwin setup Click Next to advance to the next screen and choose the type of installation you want to perform .
Click Install from Internet .
Click Next , then choose an installation directory .
The window in which you configure your installation is shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 . Cygwin installation options
In most cases , the recommended installation options are suitable , but you can customize with a few caveats :
Do not install Cygwin in the root directory of your Windows system , such as C :
It 's best to install Cygwin in its own subdirectory , such as the default — C:\cygwin — or perhaps C: \Program Files\cygwin .
( The target directory , whatever you choose , becomes the root directory — the / — of your emulated UNIX environment .
For example , if you install to C:\cygwin , the virtual /usr / bin can actually be found in C:\cygwin\usr\bin . )

( The target directory , whatever you choose , becomes the root directory — the — of your emulated UNIX environment .
For example , if you install to C:\cygwin , the virtual /usr / bin can actually be found in C:\cygwin\usr\bin . )
Do not choose Just Me for the Install For option .
for the option .
Set the Default Text File type to Unix to maximize compatibility with existing files and files stored on other UNIX machines .
Click Next .
In the window that appears , choose a directory in which to store the data Cygwin requires .
Do not choose the Cygwin directory you selected in the previous step .
If possible , create or choose a directory on a drive with at least 1GB of free space .
Click Next again , and choose the type of Internet connection you use .
Direct Connection is typically apropos .
Click Next again .
In a moment , Cygwin downloads its list of current mirror sites and prompts you to choose one , as shown in Figure 3 .
When in doubt , choose a site within close proximity .
Figure 3 .
Choose the installation site you feel is reliable or is in close proximity
After a brief delay , the installer displays a complete list of available categories and packages .
Figure 4 shows a partial catalog .
Click on a plus sign ( + ) to expand the corresponding category ; click a " loop " to cycle between Skip ( which omits the package ) and all available versions of the respective package .
If Cygwin provides multiple versions of a utility , pick the instance that meets your requirements .
By the way , the B column , if selected , downloads the binary package ; if the S is selected , the source is downloaded , too .
Figure 4 .
Choose the packages and instances that best suit your needs
More than 1,000 packages are available within Cygwin , so choose only the categories and packages you need .
( Installing all of the Cygwin bundles takes up more than 800 MB of disk space . )
After all , you can always add an entire category or a single package in the future : Simply re-run the Cygwin installer .
( You can also remove or update a package at any time with the same installer . )
To quickly determine whether your favorite UNIX utility is available within Cygwin , search the Cygwin package list ( see Related topics ) .
When you 've chosen the tools you want , click Next , and the download process begins !
The status bars reflect each package download , overall download headway , and disk usage , respectively .
Figure 5 is a snapshot taken during installation on my test machine .
Figure 5 . Cygwin downloads a great deal of software , so be patient Finally , the Setup application installs the software and ( optionally ) adds shortcuts to your Start menu and desktop .
Click Finish .
Launch Cygwin by using the Start menu or by double - clicking the Cygwin icon ( if you installed those shortcuts ) , or you can execute the Cygwin script found in your Cygwin directory ( such as C:\cygwin\Cygwin.bat ) .
Figure 6 shows Cygwin as it starts the first time :
It creates your home directory , seeds shell startup files , and presents the prompt .
You can now run UNIX commands !
Figure 6 . Presto !
Now you can use UNIX commands in Windows !
For example , try ls - a or type touch .
The latter command indicates that touch is the executable / usr / bin / touch .
The best of UNIX in Windows ( and vice versa )
Cygwin is a near - complete emulation of the UNIX shell within Windows .
In fact , it marries the two operating systems quite nicely .
For example , run the command df -h to display an inventory of free disk space on your " UNIX " machine .
Figure 7 shows the result .
Figure 7 .
Is that a UNIX file system on Windows or a Windows file system on UNIX ?
Yes !
As mentioned earlier , the Cygwin installation directory acts as the root directory of your virtual UNIX system .
Cygwin simply maps subdirectories in its installation directory to familiar UNIX equivalents .
It also provides the Windows drives as individual volumes , such as / cygwin / c .
You can use such a virtual path to launch Windows programs .
Try it : Type / cygwin/c/ Program\ Files / Internet \ Explorer / IEXPLORE.EXE to launch Windows Internet Explorer® from the command line .
( You can also use the Tab key to automatically expand elements of the path . )
By the way , if you want to convert a Windows path name to its UNIX equivalent or vice versa , try the built - in command cygpath .
By default , cygpath produces the UNIX path name .
Use the -w option to produce a Windows path .
$ cygpath -w / cygwin/c/Program\ Files / Internet \ Explorer / IEXPLORE.EXE
c:\Program Files \Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.EXE
Other niceties provide helpful bridges between the two environments :
Cygwin provides its own lpr ( / usr / bin / lpr rather than Windows ' own LPR.EXE ) to print from the UNIX emulation directly .
Simply set the PRINTER environment variable to a Cygwin UNC such as \\server \printer_name or // server / printer_name — either slash direction works , as in all other parts of Cygwin .

Simply set the PRINTER environment variable to a Cygwin UNC such as \\server \printer_name or // server / printer_name — either slash direction works , as in all other parts of Cygwin .
Symbolic links created with ln -s in Cygwin are interpreted as shortcuts in Windows .
Reflexively , Windows shortcuts are interpreted as symbolic links .
Further , you can use a Windows shortcut to launch a UNIX command with parameters .

Further , you can use a Windows shortcut to launch a UNIX command with parameters .
And because you have a full Bash shell at your disposal , you can use all the aforementioned compatibility features ( among others ) to write UNIX shell scripts to maintain Windows !
For example , you can use UNIX find to hunt for data on your drives .
Here 's a tip : it 's common to use spaces in a Windows file name .
To preserve an entire file name ( remember , UNIX arguments are separated by white space ) , be sure to use find - print0 and its companion , xargs - 0 .
As mentioned at the onset , you can add , remove , and update Cygwin categories and packages at any time by ( re-) running the Cygwin installer .
Let 's add a few software development packages to prepare for building additional code from source , as you typically do on a traditional UNIX system .
Run the Cygwin setup.exe application again , and march through the initial dialogs until you return to the Select Packages window , shown in Figure 4 .
Expand the Devel category , and use the recycle control to select the highest - numbered versions of the following :
autoconf2.1
automake1.10
binutils
gcc-core
gcc4-core
gdb
pcre
pcre-devel
After making all selections ( which may automatically choose additional packages to satisfy dependencies ) , click Next to start the update .
As before , the download and installation process may take some time — the development packages tend to be quite large .
In the meantime , open a browser window and point to http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.11.4.tar.gz to download the latest source code of the GNU wget utility .
( If you have n't used it before , wget is a command - line tool to download virtually anything .
For more information about this tool , see Related topics ) Using Cygwin , copy the file to your home directory in Cygwin , and expand the tarball .
Listing 1 shows the contents of the tarball .
Listing 1 . Contents of wget - 1.11.4.tar

When the Cygwin download and installation process finishes , click Finish .
You should now be ready to build the wget utility from source .
$ cd wget - 1.11.4 $ ./ configure configure : Configuring for GNU wget 1.11.4 ... creating po/Makefile $ make gcc - I. ... $ make install ...
/usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ./wget.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1/wget.1
$ type wget /usr / local / bin/ wget
To test the new utility , run it within Cygwin and the download the wget source code :
$ /usr/local/ bin/wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/wget/wget-1.11.4.tar.gz
In a moment , you should have a new source tarball .
It 's easiest to pull utilities from the Cygwin repository using the Cygwin installer , but you can build source you download — or your own source code — within Cygwin .
The full suite of UNIX development tools , including the most popular scripting languages , are available within Cygwin .
You can even build native Windows WIN32 applications with the UNIX compilers and tools found in Cygwin if you do n't have something like Microsoft Visual Studio® .
( These applications will not run on UNIX .
To build a Windows application to run on UNIX , consider WINE .
See Related topics for more information . )
Familiar , powerful , and useful
Cygwin is n't a perfect emulation of UNIX , but it 's a comforting surrogate .
The documentation for the core components is good and especially forthcoming , describing limitations in the emulation DLL and security risks .
If you want to port a complex UNIX package to Cygwin , consult the Developer 's Guide ( see Related topics ) to measure Cygwin 's support for your API needs .
Perhaps the best feature of Cygwin is its integration with Windows .
To boost productivity , drop to Cygwin and use its UNIX - like command line to manipulate the system .
One suggestion : Extend your shell PATH variable to include subdirectories in Windows ' Program Files to launch any binary in your path by simply typing its name .
Better yet , Cygwin can manage multiple jobs in the same window .
Press Control - Z to suspend a running job ; type bg and fg to run a job in the background and foreground , respectively ; and type jobs to manage the list of jobs .
Of course , Cygwin also redirects input and output and pipes output from one command to another .
Cygwin :
It 's better than a Royale with cheese .

Israel is responsible for " large and indiscriminate human atrocities " in Gaza , and the world medical establishment is a silent accomplice in the bloodshed , The Lancet medical journal says .
In an editorial released ahead of publication next Saturday , the British health journal said Israel , by hitting civilians and wrecking medical infrastructure , had carried out attacks that were " unjustified and disproportional . "
" We find it hard to believe that an otherwise internationally respected , democratic nation can sanction such large and indiscriminate human atrocities in a territory already under land and sea blockade , " The Lancet said .
" The collective punishment of Gazans is placing horrific and immediate burdens of injury and trauma on innocent civilians .
These actions contravene the fourth Geneva convention . "
The editorial also blasted " national medical associations and professional bodies worldwide , " accusing them of keeping silent as the destruction unfolded .
" Their leaders , through their inaction , are complicit in a preventable tragedy that may have long - lasting public - health consequences not only for Gaza for also for the entire region , " it said .
More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed , and at least 4,580 injured , since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead on December 27 , the head of emergency services in the territory , Muawiya Hassanein , said on Wednesday .
Israel says the operation aims at quelling rocket attacks by Hamas militants that threaten civilians living in an arc of southern Israeli towns .
The Lancet focuses on publishing medical research , but it also has a tradition of outspokenness on political issues that touch on health , such as the Iraq war and government policies on AIDS .

Currently silicon - based solar cells are flooding the market .
Industry pundits can foresee a hopeful future for low - cost , flexible solar cells .
If we can make solar devices other than silicon based materials then they can be used for all sorts of applications beyond just the traditional solar panels on house rooftops .
It will be great if we can have solar cells for portable electronic devices too .
Luping Yu , Professor in Chemistry , and Yongye Liang , a Ph.D. student , both at the University of Chicago , and five co-authors are working to develop a new semiconducting material called PTB1 , which converts sunlight into electricity .
The University accredited the patent rights to the technology to Solarmer last September .
The license covers numerous polymers under development in Yu ’s laboratory , confirmed by Matthew Martin .
He is a project manager at UChicagoTech , the University ’s Office of Technology and Intellectual Property .
A patent is pending .
Solarmer Energy Inc. is spreading its wings in this direction .
They are willing to incorporate technology invented at the University of Chicago .
The commercial - grade prototype will be completed at the end of this year .
It will be of eight square inches ( 50 square centimeters ) and lifetime of three years .
This plastic solar device will have the efficiency of eight percent .
This eight percent efficiency will give an edge to the Solarmer Energy Inc. over its competitors .
Dina Lozofsky , vice president of IP development and strategic alliances at Solarmer states , “ Everyone in the industry is in the 5 percent to 6 percent range . ”
Engineering expertise of Solarmer ’s device with Yu and Liang ’s semiconducting material , push the material ’s efficiency even higher .
Solarmer is based in El Monte , Calif. , and was founded in 2006 .
They come forth to commercialize the technology developed in Professor Yang Yang ’s laboratory at the University of California , Los Angeles .
The company is developing flexible , translucent plastic solar cells that generate low - cost , clean energy from the sun .
The active layer of PTB1 is around 100 nanometers in thickness and the width is nearly 1,000 atoms .
If we want to produce a small amount of the PTB1 material it will take considerable amount of time , and the whole procedure will be multi-step process .
But still the biggest advantage of this technology lies in its simplicity .
Several products are being synthesized in other laboratories in the USA but the competitive advantage lies in the steps of production too .
Other devices need far more extensive engineering work for commercial viability .
“ We think that our system has potential , ” Yu said .
“ The best system so far reported is 6.5 percent , but that ’s not a single device .
That ’s two devices . ”
The Canadian Press
TORONTO - The federal and Ontario governments have agreed to provide up to $ 3.3 billion for the Canadian auto industry , but the bailout comes with the potential for thousands of job cuts .
Federal Industry Minister Tony Clement said late Friday the two Canadian governments have agreed to provide the equivalent of 20 per cent of the US $ 14 billion that the Bush administration is considering in emergency aid for General Motors , Ford and Chrysler .
Clement said the main restructuring will be done in the United States , but Canada is also prepared to provide help to save the troubled industry , which employs hundreds of thousands of people in direct and spinoff jobs in Ontario .
" What we are signalling here tonight , both the governments of Ontario and Canada , is that we want to be part of the solution as well and it will be commensurate with the production that takes place here in Canada . . . about 20 per cent . "
Clement told reporters .
That works out to about US $ 2.8 billion or C$ 3.3 billion at current exchange rates , of the proposed US $ 14 billion American bailout package .
The Detroit Three currently employ more than 30,000 people at car assembly and parts plants in Ontario .
If the U.S. carmakers cut that number of jobs in North America as they restructure their huge operations , a 20 per cent proportional cut in Canada could mean the loss of 6,000 direct jobs and more in spinoff employment at suppliers and other businesses .
GM , Ford and Chrysler have already cut thousands of jobs from their Ontario operations under earlier streamlinings , including GM plans to close a pickup truck plant in Oshawa in May and a transmission plant in Windsor in 2010 .
Clement emphasized that the aid package is not a " blank cheque " for the industry .
" This is about conditional support based on their long - term plans , based on them working with the parts suppliers , based on the unions being at the table , based on the United States continuing to be part of the solution , so there are some conditions , " he said .
The minister added that Canadian support is contingent on the U.S. passing its own aid package , but added he expects the Bush administration to announce its own bailout plan " very soon " after the U.S. Senate rejected an earlier proposal .
" The federal and the Ontario governments are prepared to move quickly if and when the Americans approve a support package , " Clement said .
Clement would n't give any details Friday of how the funding would be divided between the federal and Ontario governments .
The Canadian Auto Workers union welcomed the commitment .
" This is a very positive announcement by the two governments , " said Jim Stanford , a CAW economist .
" I think this will help to get the log jam rolling in the U.S. "
There will be more auto jobs lost in Canada , but Stanford would n't speculate on specific numbers .
" Hopefully with the governments moving as quickly as they are , this will prevent the worse case scenario , which would be a total meltdown of the auto industry , " he said .
Ford 's Canadian arm also praised Clement 's announcement .
" The Canadian and Ontario governments have demonstrated strong leadership in the decision to support the country 's auto sector , " Ford said in a news release issued Friday .
The move by Canadian politicians comes after the U.S. Senate late Thursday rejected a US $ 14 billion plan , endorsed by President George Bush and congressional Democrats , that would have provided quick loans to the Detroit automakers .
On Friday , GM , Ford and Chrysler were talking with the administration and the U.S. Federal Reserve about how they could still get the billions of dollars they say they need to survive .
The talks included conditions that automakers would have to meet , said GM spokesman Greg Martin .
The administration said no decisions had been made on the size or duration of the new bailout plan , or what type of concessions might be demanded from the struggling automakers , their workers , stockholders or others .
Both the federal and Ontario governments had been reluctant to hand out any aid without first seeing the details of a comparable U.S. package so they can match any conditions and provide a proportional amount of funding .
The need for some form of aid seemed to increase in urgency Friday as domestic and Japanese automakers in Canada announced they will cut production and extend temporary layoffs .
General Motors ( NYSE : GM ) said it will shut down virtually all of its North American plants for January , cutting another 250,000 vehicles from its first - quarter production schedule by temporarily closing 21 factories .
Some production , however , will continue at GM 's plants in Ontario , said Stew Low , spokesman for General Motors of Canada .
The Oshawa , Ont. , truck plant will be down during the first week of January but has no more scheduled down time until the middle of March , Low said .
Gary Coad , a father of two with twins on the way , said Friday was his last day of work after he was laid off from GM's Oshawa plant .
He said he'd be willing to do whatever he could to keep his job , including taking a pay cut .
" Jobs are so hard to come by I would do whatever they want , " he said .
But he remained optimistic .
" I think it 'll eventually come around , " he said .
" Not like it used to be , but I think I 'll be back here in a couple of years .
I 'm very optimistic that way . "
Meanwhile , Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co. said it is cutting more production in North America as it adjusts to lower demand , but does not plan any layoffs in Canada .
Lewenza said the CAW has not yet been asked to make any specific concessions , unlike the United Auto Workers , who were widely blamed Friday for the U.S. Senate 's defeat of the aid package when they rejected upfront pay and benefit concessions .
He added that wage cuts for autoworkers wo n't solve the financial problems of the Detroit Three , but said he 's willing to work with the automakers to develop a solution to their woes .
The Detroit Three automakers had been seeking a total of $ 6.8 billion in loans and credit lines from Ottawa and Ontario , saying they need some of that money before the end of the year as they struggle with a worsening economy .
The automakers have said that without a bailout , they will soon run out of cash and could collapse .
Chrysler could declare bankruptcy within " a few days " if the White House fails to intervene and provide automakers with emergency funds , and GM will likely follow suit , according to one industry analyst .
This would set off a chain reaction that would put thousands of Canadians out of work , Joe D'Cruz , a professor at the University of Toronto 's Rotman School of Management , said in an interview .
" It 's going to be a very turbulent environment , " D'Cruz said .
" It is going to trigger a really wide - scale set of changes in the Canadian automotive industry . "
This year will be remembered not just for one of the worst financial crises in American history , but also as the moment when economists abandoned their principles .
There used to be a consensus that selective intervention in the economy was bad .
In the last 12 months this belief has been shattered .
Practically every day the government launches a massively expensive new initiative to solve the problems that the last day 's initiative did not .
It is hard to discern any principles behind these actions .
The lack of a coherent strategy ...
“ Our goal at CODA is to create a system of care that uses evidence - based practices at just the right dose and just the right time , ” Mr. Hartnett said .
“ As with many chronic diseases , figuring out dosage and timing are critical . ”
For some addicts , a standard program may not help at all , according to Anne Fletcher , who for her book “ Sober For Good ” interviewed 222 men and women who had been clean for at least five years .
“ A lot of these people overcame an alcohol problem on their own , or with the help of an individual therapist , ” Ms. Fletcher said .
To complicate matters in Oregon , the state mandate has stirred a kind of culture clash between those who want reform — academic researchers , state officials — and veteran counselors working in the trenches , many of whom have beaten addictions of their own and do not appreciate outsiders telling them how to do their jobs .
“ I ’m a counselor , and I ’d be defensive , too : ‘ What do you mean , all this stuff I ’ve been doing my entire life is wrong ? ’ ” said Brian Serna , director of outpatient services at Adapt , who has traveled the state to monitor the use of scientific practices .
“ So the challenge is to build a bridge between what the science says is effective and what people are already doing . ”
One way to do that , some experts now believe , is to combine evidence - based practice with “ practice - based evidence ” — the results that programs and counselors themselves can document , based on their own work .
In 2001 the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health began giving treatment programs incentives , or bonuses , if they met certain benchmarks .
The clinics could earn a bonus of up to 5 percent , for instance , if they kept a high percentage of addicts coming in at least weekly and ensured that those clients met their own goals , as measured both by clean urine tests and how well they functioned in everyday life , in school , at work , at home .
By 2006 , the state ’s rehabilitation programs were operating at 95 percent capacity , up from 50 percent in 2001 ; and 70 percent of patients were attending regular treatment sessions , up from 53 percent , according to an analysis of the policy published last summer in the journal Health Policy .
“ We basically gave them a list of evidence - based practices and told them to pick the ones they wanted to use , ” said Jack Kemp , former director of substance abuse services for Delaware , in an interview .
“ It was up to them to decide what to use . ”
For those who are trying not to use , it does n’t much matter how rehab services are improved — only that it happens in time .
“ Honestly , you just do n’t care how or why something works for you , ” said Ms. Hatton , the 25 - year - old from Myrtle Creek , Ore .
“ Just that it does . ”
A reader sent me a link to a video and site called bewarethedoghouse.com that is supposed to be a joke but seems anything but .
The video and site are connected to the jewelry store inside JC Penny .
I 'm surprised that they did n't realize how ridiculous and sexist their little video was .
If you want to skip it , it basically shows a man giving his wife a vacuum cleaner for Christmas and he is sucked into a doghouse where other men who have given " sexist " gifts are sent .
One man is sent before a tribunal of women to decide how to get out of this torture chamber and is given advice by the women on how to stay out of the doghouse .
At the end of the video , there is a warning to men , " Stay out of the doghouse this holiday " with the implication that buying jewelry is the only way to do this .
Is this funny ?
I do n't think so .
I agree with one of the Youtube commenters who states : " If this is meant to scare young men like me out of ever getting married , it 's working ! "
Here is the video : Update : Another reader sends the same link to the video and adds : " I 'm thinking if the genders were reversed in this ad , they 'd be burning J.C. Penney 's to the ground in every mall in America . "
No , there never would have been an ad like this one up to begin with .

It seems that no one is immune to letting an SSL certificate expire .
Not even VeriSign , the largest provider of SSL certificates .
On January 23rd , 2009 , VeriSign forgot to renew an SSL certificate for pip.verisignlabs.com .
Though this is n't the first big company to forget to renew an SSL certificate ( Google , Linked In , Yahoo , and the BBB have all let certificates expire ) , it is the first known SSL certificate provider to do so and the biggest provider of them all .
SSL certificate expiration can be a problem for anyone .
SSL Shopper tries to help with this by allowing expiration reminder emails to be sent for particular certificates ( just enter the domain name on the certificate into the SSL Checker and click the Reind Me button ) but bigger companies may need to use some kind of certificate lifetime management solution like Venafi's Server Encryption Manager , or Entrust 's Certificate Management Service .

My friend Melanie loves to watch the Discovery Channel and share what she has watched with others .
The problem is she can never get the story straight .
Her latest tale is about Yellowstone Park sitting on top of a supervolcano that has been dormant for 6,000 - ish years .
She said the supervolcano is showing signs its active .
Is there any truth to her tale ?
— Tina
Yeah , Melanie screwed up some details : it ’s been 600,000 - ish years since Yellowstone ’s supervolcano has gone off full blast , not 6,000 .
She got the drift , though .
It ’s a question of when , not if .
A supervolcano is one that explodes in ( natch ) supereruptions .
Definitions vary , but usually we ’re talking a magnitude - eight ( M8 ) eruption : one trillion metric tons of ash and other debris filling at least 100 cubic miles , typically upchucked over the course of about a week .
Picture 1,000 Mount Saint Helenses , or 8 Tamboras .
Besides causing regional devastation , supereruptions affect global climate .
An Indonesian super 74,000 years ago kicked off a thousand - year drought that some contend caused a human population crash .
Yellowstone is both a supervolcano and a hotspot ; the two do n’t always go together .
A hotspot is the business end of what ’s known as a mantle plume , a stream of magma that rises hundreds of miles through a channel in the earth ’s crust .
The Yellowstone plume head , 50 miles underground , is several hundred miles wide .
Over time , the hot head melts the overlying crust , forming a smaller magma chamber .
Yellowstone ’s magma chamber is just a few miles down and contains partially melted granite viscous enough to trap gas , allowing pressure to build .
Periodically the pressure cracks the surface , ejecting gas and disintegrated rock into the surface world .
After about a tenth of the chamber ’s contents have erupted , pressure falls and the show ’s over .
Reheat and repeat .
The Yellowstone hotspot has produced dozens of large eruptions over the past 16 million years , the last three within the Yellowstone volcanic field : two supers and one M7.4 lightweight that created 68 cubic miles of debris .
They left overlapping giant calderas , or craters , each 10 to 50 miles wide .
Since filled with lava and eroded , the calderas went unrecognized till the 1960s .
These three big eruptions were 640,000 years ago , 660,000 years earlier , and 800,000 years before that .
See a pattern ?
Lurid reports suggest we ’re overdue , but the pattern is illusory .
Over the past 4.5 million years , large Yellowstone eruptions have come at irregular intervals of 300,000 to 2.4 million years .
Furthermore , a series of smaller eruptions ( relatively ; one was Krakatoa - esque in magnitude ) between 170,000 and 70,000 years ago ejected as much material as a super — perhaps enough to relieve the pressure for a while .
Yellowstone has been eruption - free for 70,000 years , neglecting occasional steam explosions .
Two centers of resurgence within the last caldera , where the land heaves up and down several feet over the course of decades , bear watching , but there ’s no sign of imminent trouble .
What ’s the chance of a supereruption anywhere in the world in the next 50 years ?
Estimates range from one chance in 1,000 to one in 10,000 — hardly cause for panic .
When it does happen , though , a lot of people are going to be toast .
A supereruption could kill tens of millions .
Within 10 to 50 miles of the next Yellowstone vent , you ’ll be Pompeiiized beneath thousands of feet of hot ash .
Ash and associated toxins could devegetate a third of the lower 48 ( including some of the world ’s most productive farmland ) for years or decades , leading to mass starvation .
Grim , but so unlikely that the U.S. Geological Survey lists Yellowstone as only the 19th most dangerous American volcano .
Pimples like Kilueha , Saint Helens , and Rainier top the list .
Elsewhere , some giant calderas are frightfully close to urban areas .
Lake Taal in the Philippines is only 40 miles from Manila .
In Italy the rim of Campi Flegrei lies only five miles from central Naples .
The last near - supereruption there came 35,000 years ago ; a much smaller one killed 24 in 1538 .
Pizza napoletana on my next Italian tour ?
Sure .
But make mine to go .
Triumph of the Straight Dope
By Dave Hitt on Jan 30 , 2009 in Atheism , Featured , Religion , Things Atheists Didn't Do
I ’ve been collecting these for a while , and there ’s so much nonsense and evil done in the name of religion I ’m thinking of setting up a separate blog for it .
But until / unless I do , here ’s a very incomplete list of things superstitious people have done in the name of their religion , from the silly to the horrific .
No atheist would be silly enough to believe their their prayers caused the price of gasoline to drop by twenty cents .
An Oregon couple refused to take their 16 year old son to the hospital for a urinary blockage which could have been easily treated .
Instead , they prayed until he died .
They were not atheists .
Gail Williams , a 34 year old British Aid Worker , was gunned down by two Taliban holy men who claimed she was spreading Christianity .
( Since women are only worth half as much as men in Islam , do you have to shoot two of them for Allah to count it as one kill ? )
It was a priest , not an atheist , who told his parishioners they could n’t receive communion if they voted for Obama .
When a mullah criticized suicide attacks , he was murdered by other members of the “ religion of peace . ”
It was n’t atheists , but Armenian and Greek monks who got into a fistfight at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem .
If they were Sholin monks we could have seen some cool martial arts moves , but then it would n’t have been so entertainingly spastic .
Orthodox Jews , not atheists , have been beating and stoning women for wearing pretty clothes , and attacking stores that sell devices that can access the internet .
Islamic authorities in Malaysia , not atheists , issued a fatwa banning yoga .
An Islamic clerik in Melbourne says it ’s OK to rape your wife and beat her .
It was n’t atheists who held an Angolan woman prisoner for months , until she died .
In Atlanta a Pakistani immigrant , not an atheist , strangled his 25 year old daughter with a bungee chord becuase she wanted to end her arranged marriage and had gotten involved with someone else .
He is a Muslim , not an atheist .
The same goes for Waheed Alla Moammad ( whose name really covers his religious ass ) who tried to stab his 19 year old sister to death for going to clubs and an wearing immodest clothing .
Yaser Able Said , also a Muslim , murdered his two teenage daughters for having boyfriends .
Those stories and others are here .
When Anwar Salameh and Hassan Salameh , Muslims , not atheists , were convicted of murdering their 21 year old sister becuase she had a secret romantic relationship , they complained that their sentences were too severe becuase their family was bereaved .
Is there an Arabic word for chutzpah ?
The father who beat his daughter before shooting her to death for talking on Facebook was not an atheist .
The Jordanian man who shot his pregnant sister in the side of the head three times for “ family honor ” was n’t an atheist either .
A city counsel in the UK allows employees to look at sites about Christianity , Islam , Hinduism and other religions but blocks Atheist sites ..
Although the article does n’t specify the beliefs of the dingleberries who made this decision , it ’s a safe bet they ’re not atheists .
Christians , not atheists , killed an eight year old autistic boy trying to cure him of demonism .
In Russia , two Jehovah ’s Witnesses , who are definitely not atheist , brutally murdered 13 people to help cleanse the world of sin .
In Nigeria hundreds of people were killed in riots between Muslims and Christians fighting over the results of a local election .
Also in Nigeria , hundreds of children have been killed , and hundreds more have been brutally tortured by their parents , who believe they are witches .
Forty Hindu Men , not atheists , beat up eight women for being in a pub .
They are part of a Hindu morality police , and despite public outcry , vow to keep doing it .
Mormons , not atheists , contributed about half the money spent to pass Proposition 8 , which made gay marriage illegal .
Mormons , of course , have always taught that marriage should be between one man and one wo… .
Oh , wait … never mind .
Kwara State Police have arrested a goat for car theft .
They insist it was an armed robber who tried to steal a car and then turned himself into a goat to escape .
That ’s enough for now , but I ’m barely halfway through the links I ’ve collected .
I ’ll revisit it again in the near future .
The first Things Atheists Didn’t
Do post can be found here .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli tank fire killed up to 40 Palestinians at a United Nations school in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , medical sources at two Gaza hospitals said .
Two tank shells exploded outside the school , residents said , spraying shrapnel on people inside and outside the building , where hundreds of Palestinians had sought refuge from fighting between Israeli soldiers and Hamas militants .
Reuters journalists filmed bodies scattered on the ground amid pools of blood and torn shoes and clothes .
A donkey also lay on the ground in its own blood .
In addition to the dead , several dozen people were wounded , the hospital officials said .
The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports .
Doctors said all the dead were either people sheltering in the school or residents of Jabalya refugee camp , in the north of the Gaza Strip .
A separate Israeli air strike near another U.N. school earlier on Tuesday killed three Palestinians , medics and witnesses said .

A definition of sin is doing what is wrong or not doing what is right according to God 's rules ( 1 John 3:4 ) .
If God says " Do not lie " and you lie , then you have sinned .
If God says " Do not steal " and you steal , then you have sinned .
According to God , sin separates you from Him ( Isaiah 59:2 ) .
I want my children to have a positive view of human nature
If you teach a generation of children that they are sinful creatures by nature , that left on their own they are morally corrupt , deserving of eternal torment in Hell , that they are not to be trusted to think their own ( selfish , evil ) thoughts , all of this can become - has become - a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Whole segments of hte population grow up with a negative self - image , thinking they really area rotten , in need of a savior or father figure .
They are told they are " bad " , so they act like it .
I want my children to understand that people are different and that 's okay
I want my children to understand that making a poor decision does not make you a bad person
I want my children 's decisions to be guided by reason , openness , and love , not a dictated closed set of values
Along with the usual secular values ( such as appropriate tolerance / intolerance , morality , critical thinking , appreciation for reason and science ) , do n't forget to impart social graces , playfulness and humor .
We have made a careful and important decision to raise our children without religion .
There are many many reasons for this , but I want to focus on one of them in my post today : .
According to All About God Christian teachings talk about the seven deadly sins ( lust , gluttony , greed , sloth , wrath , envy and pride ) , the Ten Commandments ( which you must follow or you have sinned ) and other sins that come out of the apparent word of God ( e.g. homosexuality ) .
I reject the concept of sin and I will not teach my children about sin .
Here is why ... I mentioned in another post that I am reading Parenting Beyond Belief .
I generally read one essay each time my kids are in the bath .
I get to do a bit of reading while keeping an eye on them as they play in the bubbles .
The essay that I was reading yesterday by Dan Barker talked about the pessimistic view of human nature that many religions have : I will not teach my children that we are all sinners .
I will teach them that people are generally good .
That they want to be nice and do nice things .
That they will help you if you ask .
If my kids see this as the rule and see not so nice behaviour as the exception , then hopefully peer pressure will help turn them into good people .
I want them to think it is natural to be nice to others .
The problem with the concept of sin , which is one that is used in many religions , is that each religion has its own list of sins and while there are some common veins across all of them , there are also huge differences .
I certainly have values that I want to pass on to my children , but I want them to understand that those are my values , those are not THE right values .
Other people believe other things and value other things and that is fine .
I would be okay with other people talking about sin if they only applied it to their own lives and did n't project it onto others .
When one person or group of people project their values onto others and tell them that they are right or wrong as a result , or even worse , they are going to hell , I think that creates a dysfunctional society and is what leads to some of the horrid wars we have seen over the years .
Let me tell you the story of Mikey 's lunch .
Mikey was a 6 year old kid at a day camp that I worked at .
Most of the kids there were Jewish , but it was not a religious camp .
Mikey was of italian descent and came to camp one day with a slice of pepperoni pizza .
One of the boys in his group saw his pizza and told him he could n't eat it because it was n't kosher .
He brushed it off , until another and yet another little boy in the group chimed in and agreed .
And then they came up with lots of grand ideas about what would happen to him if he ate that piece of pizza , no doubt things mentioned to them by their parents or religious leaders .
So Mikey cried and cried .
He cried because he was hungry .
He cried because he was embarrassed .
He cried because he did n't understand why his mother wanted to poison him .
But there was nothing wrong with Mikey 's pizza .
Mikey was Catholic , so he can eat pepperoni pizza .
Personally , I reject many of the things that Christians call sins .
I think pride in your own accomplishments is important .
I believe that sexual orientation is defined by nature and that some people are heterosexual , some are homosexual and some are somewhere in between and none of them are better than the other .
I enjoy being slothful sometimes and do n't feel guilty about it .
I think white lies are fine in some circumstances and just part of common courtesy .
I covet , yes I covet , and it helps motivate me !
My values are different from the values that many Christians or Jews or Muslims have chosen .
I 'm okay with that as long as they do n't tell me or anyone else that they are wrong for being different .
We 're all different , and that 's okay .
In the same essay I quoted above , Barker goes on to explain that it is better to tell children that they are okay the way they are .
This is a concept that is emphasized over and over again in Alfie Kohn 's Unconditional Parenting .
He explains that children need to know that they will be accepted even if they screw up or fall short .
I know that Christians say that God loves everyone unconditionally , but when he calls them " sinners " it is certainly a different message that gets conveyed .
Kohn explains in his book that if you tell your child that you love him unconditionally , but then tell him he is bad for doing X , Y or Z , you are sending a mixed message .
Sure , there are consequences of poor decisions .
And we need to live with those consequences .
As Warren Buffet said : " It takes 20 years to build a reputation & five minutes to ruin it .
If you think about that , you 'll do things differently . "
This is what I want my children to think about when making decisions , not the threat of going to hell if they make a bad choice and also not the idea that they can make that bad decision go away by looking for salvation .
There are real consequences in real life and we need to live with those .
I also know that sometimes good things come out of decisions that can be considered sins .
Committing adultery is detrimental to a relationship .
The consequence is that people can get hurt and the marriage may split up .
However , I do n't think it makes someone a bad person and sometimes good things come out of adultery .
I was struck by this when listening to Kellylee Evans speak on the CBC on Ottawa Morning on November 7 .
She mentioned that she and her brother are 3 months apart in age , that they are from different mothers because her father was " bad " .
She says that she explores the concepts of good and bad a lot on her new CD ( " Good Girl " ) that is being released early next year because good things sometimes come out of bad things and she would n't have been born if her father was n't " bad " .
Anyone that has listened to her music cannot deny that she is a good thing .
I respect everyone 's right to pass on the values that they think are important to their children .
But as soon as they start saying that something is bad or sinful for everyone , versus just being wrong for their family , then I think this starts to create barriers .
So if I 'm not going to teach my children about sin , what am I going to do ?
Here I 'll quote another essay from Parenting Beyond Belief , this time by Emily Rosa : I think this makes more sense than expecting them to be guided by a list of rules that was created a very long time ago .
I mean if I was going to create such a list , I would at least update it from time to time .
Should n't it be a sin not to recycle or to waste energy , for example ?
Okay , so maybe an abstract interpretation of the seven deadly sins could be applied there , but really I 'd rather my kids act out of logical reasoning rather than following a list of rules .
I also want my children to be open and tolerant .
I want them to embrace peoples ' differences .
I want them to get to know people from different cultures , different religions , different sexual orientations , different socio- economic groups , and and son on .
And I do n't want my children to pass judgment on the others or to have judgment passed on them .
Finally , I want my children to act out of love .
I want them to be empathetic towards others .
I want them to treat people well because they care about those people and do not want to hurt them , not because they are commanded to do onto others as you would have them do onto you .
The starter guide in my last entry practically gives you an intro to the 960 framework as well .
The names are different , but the approach is the same .
Though 960 is a bit more complex .
. container-x , and both " first " and " last " classes ( named alpha , omega , pretentiously enough ) .
I decided to checkup on a drupal groups thread that discussed CSS frameworks AFTER I hit publish .
As it turns out , a 960 theme is on its way to drupal core .
I think 960 is a fine system , and I also think CSS frameworks are still * new * enough of an idea that we do n't need to put all our marbles in one ( like we did with jQuery -- and thank god we did [ Konstantin Kaefer , thanks you for not listening to me in GSOC , when I told you to consider working within Drupal 's GPL requirements . ] .
I think its great that we 're moving to get a framework into drupal , and 960 may be the one .
Given my history with the whole jQuery thing , I can't ask that you take my preference of blueprint THAT seriously .
BUT ....
960 vs Blueprint
Blueprint is simpler : I like that blueprint 's containers never change .
I do n't need either a grid of 12 , or a grid of 16 . 24 works fine for me .
There 's also only a " last " class , as opposed to 960's " alpha " , and " omega " 's .
What 's the difference between grid - 6 , and container - 6 ?
Can grid - 14 fit two container - 7 ?
I 'm too lazy to look up the answer since I 've never once run into a problem where blueprints system was n't as flexible as I needed .
Especially since the designer and I work together , and we tend hold off on the design until we have all the content .

Blueprint gives a damn about typography : 960 's creator says says " I have n’t gone out of my way to establish a vertical rhythm for text , as is described in the Baseline article on ALA .
It ’s not that I do n’t see the value in it , I do .
I think it ’s an awesome idea , and a noble pursuit .
However , it is fragile .
All it takes is for a content editor to upload an arbitrarily sized , 173 pixel tall image , and all the subsequent elements are off - beat . "
I fail to see what I gain from losing this feature in blueprint .
Especially given I use imagecache , and know exactly what to do when an image is 173 tall : fix it .

Blueprint has a community of active contributors , and the frameworks is evolving quite noticeably : 960 appears to be the work of one guy .
Now , mathematically , it can be argued that 960 is superior in terms freedom ( 12 , and 16 have quite different properties ) .
However , I think that freedom can be a bad thing .
In fact , it opens the door to the dreaded inner platform effect -- where a framework becomes a poor replica of the language it intended to replace .
Overall , I think getting 960 into drupal core is a big win .
I 've yet to find a reason to use 960 instead of blueprint , but who knows ... maybe we 'll give 960 a jolt that makes it the jQuery of CSS .
In any case , Drupal is ahead of the pack in recognizing that value of a CSS framework over the standard / semantic inquisitions who are apparently too busy blogging , and boring audiences at web conferences to understand the clear gain that comes at the small cost of having a class named " span - 6 " .
( what is the cost , exactly ?
the bytes ?
or that I do n't have to look up a stylesheet to see what 's going on ? " )
This is particularly true with Drupal .
Lots of sites we build already have 16 different .tpl.php files between all the views we 're using .
I actually prefer a bit of presentation in my markup in these cases .
Not mention , with the slew of classes like " views - row - odd views - row - first views - row - 1 " already in the markup , " span - 2 " seems like a pebble in the sea .
Carrie " Kat " Mock was described by everyone who knew her as a sweet person and a dedicated mother .
So it was concerning when on the morning of July 19 , 1981 , Carrie did n't answer her phone .
Her family and friends , concerned that multiple calls were going unanswered contacted the Stamford Police to help find her .
Carrie Mock had last been seen by one of her sisters , Mary McClain , the night before .
They had gone to a Westside club ( I have n't been able to find the name of the club ... yet ) on Richmond Hill in Stamford .
Both had left before midnight .
Mary McClain was the last known person to see her sister alive .
Shortly before 6 PM on the 19th , the family 's worst fears were realized .
Three young boys found Carrie Mock 's partially clothed body .
She was found on the grounds near the Brunswick School in Greenwich .
An autopsy determined she had died from strangulation with stab wounds in her neck .
The clothes found with her were not what she had been wearing when …
An Ann Arbor teenager who police say killed his girlfriend 's pet rabbit in retaliation was arraigned Monday on a felony animal cruelty charge .
Andre Duane Watley , 17 , is accused of killing Midnight , the pet bunny of his 17 - year - old girlfriend .
Police say the two quarreled at her home Sunday after she confronted him about drug use .
Watley was charged with one count of killing or torturing an animal , punishable by up to four years in prison , and misdemeanor counts of disrupting communication with police and domestic violence .
Police reports say Watley yanked the phone from the girl 's hands as she called police and then punched her .
Detectives say Watley was retaliating against the girl after she used a baseball bat to smash two bongs used to smoke marijuana .
According to police reports ,
Watley seized the bat after a brief struggle and struck the rabbit once on the head after knocking its cage off the bed .
" It was very unnecessary because he had no reason to kill this animal , but for retaliation , " Ann Arbor Police Detective Dave Monroe said .
Ann Arbor police caught Watley running from the girl 's home .
Watley told police he had been living with the girl and her mother - who was n't home at the time - for less than a year .

He said the argument started over his cell phone use and told police the girl began striking him , so he threatened to kill the rabbit if she did n't stop .
When he was arrested for domestic assault , Watley , who was covered in sweat , responded , " For a rabbit ? , " reports said .
He remained at the Washtenaw County Jail Monday afternoon on $ 7,500 bond .

The Detroit Three auto makers are in financial trouble for a wide array of reasons , but not because they do n't make fuel efficient cars .
They do .
Consumers just do n't want to pay that much for them .
Consider the Ford Focus , recently redesigned and outfitted with nifty technology that allows you to control your phone or your iPod by talking to the dashboard .
It 's the best - selling compact car from a Detroit brand .
The typical Focus currently sells for about $ 15,500 , according to transaction data from the Power Information Network .
That 's well below Ford 's average revenue per vehicle in North America – just $ 23,376 in the just - ended third quarter .
It 's also $ 3,371 per vehicle less than the average selling price of the Honda Civic , the benchmark in this class in the U.S. market .
( See a chart . )
General Motors Corp. has a similar problem .
Its best selling compact car , the Chevy Cobalt , sells for $ 4,192 less than a Civic , based on average selling prices collected by Power Information Network over the past ten months .
Chrysler LLC 's main compact model , the Dodge Caliber , does somewhat better .
During the past ten months , the chunky Caliber hatchback has sold for an average $ 1,717 per vehicle less than the average Civic .
That looks good compared to Ford and Chevy until you look at sales volumes .
Caliber sales through the end of October are less than half the sales of the Focus .
The Focus , in turn , attracted only 175,958 buyers between Jan. 1 and Halloween , compared to 304,297 buyers for Civics in the same period , according to sales figures compiled by Autodata .
Fifteen million a people a year who travel by air or sea between Britain and the Irish Republic will face formal passport checks for the first time in more than 80 years , under immigration legislation published today .
But no compulsory passport checks are to be imposed on the 224 - mile land border between the republic and Northern Ireland , although ad hoc " intelligence - led " immigration checks will be carried out by mobile teams of Border Agency staff .
Ministers say the proposal in the citizenship and immigration bill will " plug a critical gap " in Britain 's border security as they introduce the multibillion pound " electronic border " over the next five years .
The programme will enable travellers to be checked against watch lists before they get on the plane or ferry .
The legislation will bring to an end the common travel area between the republic and Britain , which dates back to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922 .
Apart from limited attempts to control the land border during and after the second world war the common travel area has been a free movement zone for more than 80 years .
A Home Office impact assessment published alongside the bill acknowledged the possibility of large queues building up as a result of the introduction of the passport checks , particularly at Welsh ferry ports for those coming from Ireland .
Officials hope to minimise such delays .
At the same time as the legislation was published in London yesterday , the Irish government announced that it will introduce its own new border control system from next year .
The Irish justice minister , Dermot Ahern , said the Irish border information system would also screen for illegal migrants by checking travel data collected by airlines and ferry companies before departure and checking it against watch lists .
A British proposal to introduce passport checks for those who fly from Belfast to the rest of the UK was dropped after strong opposition from Conservatives and Ulster Unionists .
The imposition of border controls will however also apply to those who travel between Britain and the Isle of Man , Jersey and Guernsey .
The citizenship and immigration bill introduces radical reforms to British citizenship , including the introduction of a requirement for migrants to speak English and obey the law if they want to get a British passport .

The wife of a man whose assisted suicide was filmed for television has defended a programme about his death .
Motor neurone disease sufferer Craig Ewert , 59 , from Harrogate , died in Switzerland , having been helped by the controversial charity Dignitas .
The Sky TV programme about Mr Ewert has been branded a " reality TV " stunt .
But Mary Ewert told the Independent newspaper it would help people " face their fears " about death .
Sky has also defended the programme .
Dr Peter Saunders , director of the campaign group Care Not Killing , said the show was a " cynical attempt to boost television ratings " .
Lady Finlay , a professor of palliative care , said : " This programme is broadcasting something which is very private , which is someone dying and which is illegal in this country .
" I think it also perpetuates a myth that , somehow , to have a good death you have to end your own life and that is just completely untrue . "
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme American father - of - two Mr Ewert died in September 2006 after drinking a mixture of sedatives and using his teeth to turn off his ventilator .
The former academic allowed his death to be filmed for a documentary , Right to Die ? , made by Oscar - winning director John Zaritsky , which is due to be shown on Sky Real Lives later .
His film shows
Mr Ewert outlining his options as " death , or suffering and death " .
Before his death , Mr Ewert said : " I 'd like to continue .
" The thing is that I really can't .
" When you are completely paralysed , ca n't talk , can't walk , can't move your eyes , how do you let someone know that you are suffering ? "
In a letter he wrote to his two adult children , who feature in the programme , he said : " This is a journey I must make .
" At the same time I hope this is not the cause of major distress to my dear , sweet wife , who will have the greatest loss , as we have been together for 37 years in the greatest intimacy . "
' Taboo ' Prime Minister Gordon Brown told parliament : " These are very difficult issues and we should all remember that at the heart of any single individual case are families and people in very difficult circumstances who have to make for themselves very difficult choices , none of us , none of us would want to go through that . "
But he added : " On specifically the programme itself , I think it 's very important that these issues are dealt with sensitively and without sensationalism .
" I hope broadcasters remember that they have a wider duty to the general public and of course it will be matter for the television watchdogs when the broadcast is shown . "
Writing in the Independent , Mrs Ewert said : " For Craig , my husband , allowing the cameras to film his last moments in Zurich was about facing the end honestly .
" This was n't a film about him personally .
He was keen to have it shown because when death is hidden and private , people do n't face their fears about it .
" They do n't acknowledge that it is going to happen , they do n't reflect on it , they do n't want to face it .
That 's the taboo . "
Parents speak of son's suicide Should suicide be televised ?
Mr Zaritsky told BBC Radio Four 's Today programme : " I think it would be less than honest if we were to do a film about the process of assisted suicide and not actually be able to see the ultimate , you know , act as it were .
" Otherwise we'd be left open to charges that the death was unpleasant , or cruel or was n't even done willingly .
" And by putting it out there in its entirety , people can judge for themselves . "
Barbara Gibbon , Head of Sky Real Lives , said : " This is an issue that more and more people are confronting and this documentary is an informative , articulate and educated insight into the decisions some people have to make .
" I think it 's important that TV broadcasters , and particularly Sky Real Lives , can stimulate debate about this issue through powerful , individual and engaging stories and give this subject a wider airing . "
Public interest Media regulator Ofcom said it did not act on any programmes until after they had been transmitted .
A spokesman said : " All UK broadcasters must adhere to the Broadcasting Code which sets standards for the content of TV programmes .
" The code contains clear rules about the portrayal of self - harm and suicide in order to protect people from harm .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Life is precious but I also believe that if this is shown , hopefully it will start an informed debate Lynda , Edinburgh " We would look at the programme and assess it against the code to see whether we need to take it further . "
Although suicide is no longer a crime in England and Wales , aiding and abetting suicide is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison .
There have been no prosecutions so far of relatives of more than 100 UK citizens who have gone to the Dignitas clinic .
On Tuesday , the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled that prosecuting the parents of a 23 - year - old Worcester man who killed himself in a Dignitas clinic was " not in the public interest " .
Paralysed rugby player Daniel James died in Switzerland in September .
Julie and Mark James travelled to the clinic with their son .

He was a great story writer , who could always make the most trivial things , hilarious .
As you can see here in Douglas Adams ' depiction of Australia
Australia is a very confusing place , taking up a large amount of the Bottom half of the planet .
It is recognisable from orbit because of many unusual features , including what at first looks like an enormous bite taken out of its southern edge ; a wall of sheer cliffs which plunge deep into the girting sea .
Geologists assure us that this is simply an accident of geomorphology and plate tectonics , but they still call it the " Great Australian Bight " proving that not only are they covering up a more frightening theory , but they can't spell either .
The first of the confusing things about Australia is the status of the place .
Where other land masses and sovereign lands are classified as either continent , island , or country , Australia is considered all three .
Typically , it is unique in this .
The second confusing thing about Australia are the animals .
They can be divided into three categories : Poisonous , Odd , and Sheep .
It is true that of the 10 most poisonous arachnids on the planet , Australia has 9 of them .
Actually , it would be more accurate to say that of the 9 most poisonous arachnids , Australia has all of them .
However , there are curiously few snakes , possibly because the spiders have killed them all .
But even the spiders wo n't go near the sea .
Any visitors should be careful to check inside boots ( before putting them on ) , under toilet seats ( before sitting down ) and generally everywhere else .
A stick is very useful for this task .
Strangely , it tends to be the second class of animals ( the Odd ) that are more dangerous .
The creature that kills the most people each year is the common Wombat .
It is nearly as ridiculous as its name , and spends its life digging holes in the ground , in which it hides .
During the night it comes out to eat worms and grubs .
The wombat kills people in two ways : First , the animal is indestructible .
Digging holes in the hard Australian clay builds muscles that outclass Olympic weight lifters .
At night , they often wander the roads .
Semi-trailers ( Road Trains ) have hit them at high speed , with all 9 wheels on one side , and this merely makes them very annoyed .
They express this by snorting , glaring , and walking away .
Alas , to smaller cars , the wombat becomes a symmetrical launching pad , with results that can be imagined , but not adequately described .
The second way the wombat kills people relates to its burrowing behaviour .
If a person happens to put their hand down a Wombat hole , the Wombat will feel the disturbance and think " Ho !
My hole is collapsing ! " at which it will brace its muscled legs and push up against the roof of its burrow with incredible force , to prevent its collapse .
Any unfortunate hand will be crushed , and attempts to withdraw will cause the Wombat to simply bear down harder .
The unfortunate will then bleed to death through their crushed hand as the wombat prevents him from seeking assistance .
This is considered the third most embarrassing known way to die , and Australians do n't talk about it much .
At this point , we would like to mention the Platypus , estranged relative of the mammal , which has a duck - bill , otter 's tail , webbed feet , lays eggs , detects its aquatic prey in the same way as the electric eel , and has venomous barbs attached to its hind legs , thus combining all ' typical ' Australian attributes into a single improbable creature .
The last confusing thing about Australia is the inhabitants .
First , a short history :
Some time around 40,000 years ago , some people arrived in boats from the north .
They ate all the available food , and lot of them died .
The ones that survived learned respect for the balance of nature , man 's proper place in the scheme of things , and spiders .
They settled in , and spent a lot of the intervening time making up strange stories .
Then , around 200 years ago , Europeans arrived in boats from the north .
More accurately , European convicts were sent , with a few deranged and stupid people in charge .
They tried to plant their crops in Autumn ( failing to take account of the reversal of the seasons when moving from the top half of the planet to the bottom ) , ate all their food , and a lot of them died .
About then the sheep arrived , and have been treasured ever since .
It is interesting to note here that the Europeans always consider themselves vastly superior to any other race they encounter , since they can lie , cheat , steal , and litigate ( marks of a civilised culture they say ) - whereas all the Aboriginals can do is happily survive being left in the middle of a vast red - hot desert , equipped with a stick .
Eventually , the new lot of people stopped being Europeans on Extended Holiday and became Australians .
The changes are subtle , but deep , caused by the mind - stretching expanses of nothingness and eerie quiet , where a person can sit perfectly still and look deep inside themselves to the core of their essence , their reasons for being , and the necessity of checking inside your boots every morning for fatal surprises .
They also picked up the most finely tuned sense of irony in the world , and the Aboriginal gift for making up stories .
Be warned .
There is also the matter of the beaches .
Australian beaches are simply the nicest and best in the entire world .
Although anyone actually venturing into the sea will have to contend with sharks , stinging jellyfish , stonefish ( a fish which sits on the bottom of the sea , pretends to be a rock , and has venomous barbs sticking out of its back that will kill just from the pain ) and surfboarders .
However , watching a beach sunset is worth the risk .
As a result of all this hardship , dirt , thirst , and wombats , you would expect Australians to be a dour lot .
Instead , they are genial , jolly , cheerful , and always willing to share a kind word with a stranger , unless they are an American .
Faced with insurmountable odds and impossible problems , they smile disarmingly and look for a stick .
Major engineering feats have been performed with sheets of corrugated iron , string , and mud .
Alone of all the races on earth , they seem to be free from the ' Grass is Greener on the other side of the fence ' syndrome , and roundly proclaim that Australia is , in fact , the other side of that fence .
They call the land " Oz " , " Godzone " ( a verbal contraction of " God 's Own Country " ) and " Best bloody place on earth , bar none , strewth . "
The irritating thing about this is they may be right .
There are some traps for the unsuspecting traveller , though .
Do not under any circumstances suggest that the beer is imperfect , unless you are comparing it to another kind of Australian beer .
Do not wear a Hawaiian shirt .
Religion and Politics are safe topics of conversation ( Australians do n't care too much about either ) but Sport is a minefield .
The only correct answer to " So , howdya ' like our country , eh ? " is " Best {insert your own regional swear word here} country in the world ! " .
It is very likely that , on arriving , some cheerful Australians will ' adopt ' you on your first night , and take you to a pub where Australian Beer is served .
Despite the obvious danger , do not refuse .
It is a form of initiation rite .
You will wake up late the next day with an astonishing hangover , a foul - taste in your mouth , and wearing strange clothes .
Your hosts will usually make sure you get home , and waive off any legal difficulties with " It 's his first time in Australia , so we took him to the pub . " , to which the policeman will sagely nod and close his notebook .
Be sure to tell the story of these events to every other Australia , you encounter , adding new embellishments at every stage , and noting how strong the beer was .
Thus you will be accepted into this unique culture .
Most Australians are now urban dwellers , having discovered the primary use of electricity , which is air - conditioning and refrigerators .
Typical Australian sayings :
* " G' Day ! "
* " It 's better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . "
* " She 'll be right . "
* " And down from Kosciusko , where the pine clad ridges raise their torn and rugged battlements on high , where the air is clear as crystal , and the white stars fairly blaze at midnight in the cold and frosty sky .
And where , around the overflow , the reed beds sweep and sway to the breezes , and the rolling plains are wide .
The Man from Snowy River is a household word today , and the stockmen tell the story of his ride . "
Tips to Surviving Australia :
* Do n't ever put your hand down a hole for any reason whatsoever .
We mean it .
* The beer is stronger than you think , regardless of how strong you think it is .
* Always carry a stick .
* Air-conditioning .
* Do not attempt to use Australian slang , unless you are a trained linguist and good in a fist fight .
* Thick socks .
* Take good maps .
Stopping to ask directions only works when there are people nearby .
* If you leave the urban areas , carry several litres of water with you at all times , or you will die .
* Even in the most embellished stories told by Australians , there is always a core of truth that it is unwise to ignore .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
GMs who prefer to create their own game worlds , rather than using published campaign settings , sometimes run up against some pretty significant challenges if they want to be prepared for what their PCs are going to do .
Some of us are better at creating details in advance , providing significant coverage of the aspects of the setting PCs will see and with which they ’ll interact so that we ’re ( almost ) never caught off - balance .
Others of us are better at making things up as we go along .
Most fall somewhere between the two .
I ’m one of those that falls somewhere between the two .
I like to come up with some general structure for features of the campaign world , and some specifics of how they affect character creation — then make up low - level details as the players encounter them .
I would n’t do it that way if it were easier to flesh out the details in advance , but after working at something for a while it starts feeling like tedious scut - work , and I want to just get on with the game and ( if necessary ) make up stuff on the fly .
I decided to take some implicit advice from my own writings , and work on things from a higher level of abstraction .
It would be nice to have more stuff figured out about ( for instance ) city design before I have to deal with PCs wandering through a city encountering features of it I have n’t yet figured out .
Toward that end , I started making notes about how to organize the process of city building .
Between examples of cities in several game setting books , a couple of books with information about city building , and my own experience and knowledge of what makes both game setting cities and real - world cities work , I worked up a list of details that should be addressed in the creation of a detailed game world city :
City Building Notes
That page will be edited as I come up with more information to include .
It is n’t intended as a static document , but rather as an up - to - date reference that incorporates my latest ideas about how things should be done .
It ’s more for my benefit than anyone else ’s , but I do n’t see any reason I should n’t share it with the rest of the world .
If you have any ideas for how I might improve on my notes or otherwise move forward to develop better city building ( or , more broadly , world building ) tools , please share them either in comments here or by way of my contact page ( see the link in the right - hand column here ) .
To wrap things up , I ’ll share an excerpt from an IM conversation I had with a friend about these notes , because I found this part of the conversation amusing ( when it went slightly off - topic ) .
The names have been changed to protect the guilty :
@ : I ’ll probably develop a workflow process for defining a city , and maybe eventually even write a program to automate it somewhat .
If I do write such a program , I ’ll probably include some randomization capability , too .
BMB : That would be kind of awesome actually to have a random city generator for a campaign . @:
It ’ll be kind of an interesting challenge to write the program , since I ’d want to make sure that the stuff it randomly selects actually fits together .
I ’d probably need some kind of hierarchical dependency system for probabilities .
. . .
BMB : Hmm yeah BMB : Eg have different weights or ‘ Tech levels ’ [ to borrow from gurps ] assigned to each level of complexity , eg stratified labor , standing army , &c , and then build up from the basics @ : Yeah — and more subtle stuff like tying different economic conditions and governmental monetary polices together ( such as the fact that exotic imports should n’t be really cheap and widely available if there are import tariffs , and industry should take a hit for high levels of commerce taxation , and so on ) .
@ : Standard of living would be affected by economic conditions , agriculture would be affected by the “ external holdings ” stuff . . . @ : . . . and agriculture would in turn affect the local foods stuff .
BMB : Definitely .
Sounds like it could be a pretty fascinating project . @:
The hard part is non-programming related — figuring out the relationships between the various factors .
BMB : True .
Though depending how fantasy you want , you can sort of invent variables that may not be quite realistic economically @ : Come to think of it , I guess the US government is playing the economy like a fantasy game .
@ : “ Hey — if we impose tariffs on imports , that wo n’t have any effect on exports at all ! ” @ : “ Maybe if we tax the crap out of people later to pay for economic stimulus packages , we can improve the economy now without suffering the side - effects later ! ”
BMB : Roll 3d10 against a dc of 44 to see if it works ..
I think I ’d rather just go with a standard d20 roll using a Profession ( Politician ) skill once per day to see how well it ’s working .
A DC of 44 appears to be about right , though .
No “ take 20 ” would be allowed , of course , though I guess you could “ take 10 ” all you like .
Each point by which you succeed or fail causes a 1 % change in economic circumstances — so if you take 10 with a 5 skill total , you end up with a - 29 % penalty to economic prosperity for that day .
It would n’t reset the next day , of course ; you ’d just apply that day ’s percentage variance to whatever resulting number you get from today ’s damage to prosperity .
What do you think the chances are that a mayor ( or whatever the chief executive office of the city is called ) would have a Profession ( Politician ) skill total greater than 24 ?
A Republican House leader said Wednesday that President Bush and his party ’s congressional leadership caved on principles to help the top of their presidential ticket during the Wall Street bailout and that there could be a leadership purge if enough Republican lawmakers lose their seats next month .
Rep .
Thaddeus McCotter , chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee , said Republicans need to immediately create better alternatives to Democrats ’ policies and cannot assume that their party will automatically recapture lost seats in 2010 if Sen.
Barack Obama is elected president this year .
“ That ’s the first thing we ’ve got to get out of their heads .
That ’s not how this works , ” Mr. McCotter told editors and reporters at The Washington Times .
“ You will lose all the votes .
What you will then do is craft an alternative that hits real people and frames the debate . ”
Mr. McCotter , Michigan Republican , said Republicans expect to lose 10 to 30 House seats in the elections Tuesday and that the final total likely will determine the fate of the party´s current leadership .
“ No one knows what number could be a trigger , ” he said .
“ Everybody ’s waiting for the number to know what is possible or not possible if they ’re shooting at [ House Minority Leader John A. ]
Boehner , if they ’re shooting at [ House Minority Whip Roy ]
Blunt , if they ’re shooting at anyone .
But they ’re not going to be out there making calls , they ’re going to wait until the number comes in . ”
The 43 - year - old congressman frequently referred to his roots , both as a Detroit native and an Irish Catholic , saying the latter explained why he’s not the sort to be optimistic about congressional Republicans ’ chances in the Tuesday elections .
He is in his first term as policy committee chairman , and said he has n’t been approached by other members seeking his support to oust the current leaders , though he said as a “ Boehner guy ” - a supporter of the Ohio Republican - he is n’t likely to be told .
If an effort is under way , he said , it will surface after the elections so they do n’t appear to be putting their own prospects ahead of the party’s .
Asked whether anyone else is ready to take the leader ’s role , Mr. McCotter was blunt : “ There is n’t . ”
He said Republicans under Mr. Boehner had a good year in 2007 , buying time for the Iraq troop surge strategy to work and stopping expansion of government health care through the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program .
He said 2008 was going well as Republicans demanded offshore drilling - until the financial mess hit .
He said the economic crisis exposed the split in the Republican Party .
“ We ran into the bailout .
The bailout touched upon the larger discussion in the Republican Party , ” he said .
“ It ’s not the conservatives versus the moderates , that ’s the rather cliched way of looking at it .
What you really have are globalists versus traditionalists .
Globalists tend to view America as an economy , not a country .
The traditionalists tend to view it as a country - a very delicate microcosm , a collection of individuals with different hopes , dreams , aspirations . ”
Republican leaders in the House led many , though not a majority , of House Republicans in backing the bailout .
Mr. McCotter said that was putting politics over principle .
“ Unfortunately , many of the people in the House seemed to think our overarching goal was , as it was with President Bush , to support the top of the ticket , the nominal leader of the party , as opposed to worry about what happened to our members , ” he said .
He said aside from policy mistakes , such as turning over so much power to the Treasury secretary , the bailout also served to derail what had looked like a promising message for Republican presidential nominee Sen .
John McCain because it shifted the election from a forward - looking question of options to a backward - looking referendum on Mr. Bush .
“ When the bailout was passed it became eight years of deregulation , or whatever the Democrats are saying , and McCain supported the administration in what was the most watched and salient economic issue to Americans heading into this election , ” Mr. McCotter said .
“ He could n’t have taken a branding iron and put it on his forehead any better .
That then , even if you voted against the bailout , that attached to you because your base Republicans and independents - independents actually hated it more than Republicans - started to deflate , and it became a referendum election . ”
Still , he said , the fact that most House Republicans opposed the bailout gives him hope .
Mr. McCotter voted against the bailout .
“ A majority of the House Republicans voted against that thing twice .
Twice .
So I think that gives us hope for the future , although not the immediate future , ” he said .
Mr. McCotter said rather than “ compassionate conservative , ” Mr. Bush ’s administration has been defined by a globalist view .
“ It tended to divorce itself from the average working people .
It did not challenge the American people sufficiently .
The Congress became , in many ways , the rubber stamp for this administration , ” he said .
“ It was not a separate equal branch of government that hurt us in 2006 and it continued to hurt us as the bailout progressed . ”
Another legacy is that Republicans have become politically “ atrophied . ”
“ Fundamentally bedrock politics , we are very bad at - just very bad .
It ’s atrophied .
It atrophied in what was called the permanent majority , ” he said .
He did defend the president , arguing that the world changed on him , diverting him from his goal of being a domestic reformer .
Just as former President Harry S. Truman ’s legacy has been rehabilitated by hindsight , he said , so might Mr. Bush’s .

In Darren Aronofsky ’s The Wrestler ( 2008 ) , Rourke plays a onetime titan of the tights who now lives in a trailer park and , with a weakened heart and a body ravaged by years of flying elbows and steroid use , is out for some redemption of his own .
Watching Rourke onscreen now — older , odder , beefier , his features more rugged from years of fighting and surgery - is actually strangely comforting , like some great wrong has been righted , even if the wrong in question was in part his own doing .
He looks more physically imposing , but gentler in a way .
He also seems somehow to have more power , some of it magic and some of it tragic , doing the kind of work he was meant to do , the kind of work people wanted him to do , the kind of work other people can’t do - at 56 years and numerous lives old , doing the best work of his career .
Christopher Walken , who has known Rourke since their days at the Actors Studio in the mid-’70s , recently caught up with him in New York .
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN : I wanted to ask you about growing up in Miami , because when I was a kid in the ’50s my father used to take us there .
South Beach was where the inexpensive hotels were .
Is that where you were ?
Collins Avenue near Wolfie ’s coffee shop and everything ?
MICKEY ROURKE : Yeah , yeah .
It ’s funny that you mention that , because when I was a kid and I was doing amateur boxing , Wolfie ’s was right on the corner .
So on nights that I ’d be up really late and go to Wolfie ’s , I ’d see all of Angelo Dundee ’s — fighters — like Muhammad Ali and Jimmy Ellis and Jerry Quarry , and all these guys would be there eating after they ran .
They used to run on the golf course down there , and then they ’d go to Wolfie ’s and have eggs and shit .
CW : South Beach was where the cheap hotels were , right ?
MR : Yeah , absolutely .
They used to call it the Elephant ’s Graveyard .
CW : In the ’50s , you could take your car on a boat and go to Havana . . .
Anyhow , I ’ve been reading some stuff about you that I did n’t know .
I did n’t know you were originally from Schenectady .
MR : Upstate New York , yeah .
CW : And then you moved to Florida .
And then you had your first career kind of in sports .
And then you got into acting .
Well , I never knew you were on the stage .
What was it , a Jean Genet play ?
MR : Yeah , I probably did a dozen plays , like Off - Off - Broadway stuff .
And the Genet play was the first one I did .
What the fuck was it ? [ pauses ]
Deathwatch .
CW : A lady got you into that ?
A teacher ?
MR : You know what it was ?
It was actually a kid from my football team in high school who was going to the University of Miami .
He was directing a play , and he did n’t like the leading man — or the leading man quit , or he fired him — and I was sitting on the beach one day , and he said , “ Hey , man , I ’m doing this play at the university . ”
I said , “ Well , I ’m not going to the university . ”
He said , “ Yeah , but nobody will know it . ”
So he put me in the fucking play .
And I liked it .
I really liked it a lot .
I had gotten injured during the boxing , and I was supposed to take several months off because I ’d had a couple of concussions , and so I sort of just left the boxing and got into the acting by accident after I did that play .
The NFU says dairy farms will see production fall " perilously " low UK farm production will plummet during the coming year unless the industry gets more support from regulators and retailers , farming leaders have warned .
The credit squeeze and high costs of feed , fertiliser and diesel mean farms could struggle to stay in business , the National Farmers ' Union says .
It has called for regulations to be eased and better deals from retailers .
But the British Retail Consortium says farmers benefited from 2008 's high prices and should not be under threat .
NFU president Peter Kendall said many UK farmers had already reported difficulties as a result of the squeeze on credit , which was making " a major dent in producers ' confidence in dealing with the high costs of farm inputs like animal feed , fertiliser and diesel " .
' Break - even position '
As a result , the union predicts dairy farmers will see milk production fall to " perilously low levels " and that wheat production could tumble as arable farmers also deal with the " legacy of poor autumn sowing and growing conditions " .
The warning comes after a record year for cereal crops .
In October , official figures showed British farmers had recorded a 28 % increase in the amount of cereals harvested in 2008 compared with 2007 .
The returns for producers have been increasing more rapidly than shop prices - so they are getting more than [ they did ] a year ago for their produce
Richard Dodd
British Retail Consortium
Wheat saw a massive increase , up 32 % on 2007 's harvest , to 17.5 m tonnes .
But Mr Kendall said the wet weather at the end of last year would impact on 2009 harvests .
" Up to between 10 and 15 % of land now lies unsown and many crops around the country have failed to grow because of the cool , wet autumn and winter .
" I anticipate that last year 's record harvest may be followed by an equally dramatic fall in production during 2009 , turning the UK from a net exporter into a break - even position . "
Sheep farmers will also be hit by what the NFU describes as the " pointless " prospect of electronically tagging all their animals , to meet an EU directive that this must be done by 2010 .
The horticultural sector will also be squeezed by retailers who are " continuing to use ruthless methods ... in order to keep their costs down " , the union says .
Mr Kendall added : " As the UK economy enters a full - blown recession , farming , as the UK 's largest primary onshore industry , could be one of the bright sparks , helping to deliver segments of the rural economy from the gloom .
" But that simply wo n't happen unless farmers get the recognition they deserve from regulators and retailers . "
Supermarkets ' not ruthless ' But Richard Dodd , of the British Retail Consortium , said there was " no reason " why farm production should go down in 2009 .
" Food prices are well up on a year ago and are still going up .
The returns for producers have been increasing more rapidly than shop prices - so they are getting more than [ they did ] a year ago for their produce .
" There is therefore a greater incentive than one or two years ago . "
He dismissed claims that retailers used " ruthless methods " to keep costs low , adding the dealings between supermarkets and farmers were already good for both sides .
" Supermarkets are the biggest , though not the only customer of UK agriculture .
More than three quarters of all the food sold in the UK 's supermarkets is sourced from the UK .
" The relationships that they have are straightforward and mutually beneficial .
The farmers benefit from the volume that supermarkets provide .
Supermarkets benefit from having a guaranteed supply . "
A spokeswoman for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , said ministers were committed to working with the agricultural industry in the current economic climate to ensure a " thriving and productive farming sector " .
" That 's why , for example , we have urged supermarkets and suppliers to pay farmers as quickly as possible , continued to fight for a level playing field for British farmers through reform of the CAP [ Common Agricultural Policy ] . "
The department had also worked with the industry to secure changes to the EU 's sheep - tagging regulations , including a delay to some of the more costly elements , she added .

Introducing SSLFail.com
Hey all , I 'd like to introduce all of you to a new site Tyler Reguly and I , along with Romain Gaucher and Jay Graver set up last week , SSLFail.com .
The site 's purpose is to point out the failures in various sites ' SSL implementations .
We 'll be publishing tutorials , and informative articles on SSL in addition to pasting screenshots of high profile sites ' failures .
We came up with the idea for the site when Romain came upon an SSL failure with Gmail .
Tyler then blogged about it , and then I was getting errors with Facebook .
The interesting things about Gmail , when you go to https://gmail.com,
Firefox was the only browser we tested to follow the 301 Redirect to another domain ( www.google.com) with a proper SSL certificate .
IE7 and Google Chrome on the other hand , asked the user for confirmation before the redirect .
Is this a Firefox SSL failure ?
I do n't know , and several others I 've spoken with are n't sure how a browser should handle it either .
Anyways , just wanted to point out this new site , which has already gotten some attention from lonervamp at terminal23 and hype - free .

The Cardinals fans who left diesel fuel messages in the lawn of Donovan McNabb 's Chandler home also left something else - a box with a postage sticker that listed the suspect 's name and address .
The two men , Rex Perkin , 37 , and Ryan Hanlon , 28 , were arrested Saturday around 6 p.m. , for using the fuel to kill the grass in the Philadelphia quarterback 's lawn and leave the messages . , " Go Cards , " " Go Kurt , " and " I ( heart ) AZ . "
Police said the pair admitted to dousing the grass midnight Saturday , the day before the Arizona Cardinals beat the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC championship .
But the story actually started two days before , when McNabb came home to his house in the Ocotillo neighborhood on the Thursday to find a Cardinals flag hanging from a tree in his yard .
The quarterback found the prank amusing and left the flag hanging in the tree , Favazzo said .
When McNabb came home late the next night , he saw the cardboard box that the vandals made into a makeshift sign - " Go Cards " was written on one side and " Beat Philly " on the other .
Again McNabb brushed it off , but when he woke up early the next morning on the day of the game , he smelled diesel fuel and called police .
" Police did a very , very quick investigation , " said Sgt. Joe Favazzo , a Chandler police spokesman .
Officers quickly spotted the postage sticker on the box with Perkin 's name and address .
They went Perkin 's home , where police arrested him at about 6 p.m. when he admitted to the prank and outted his co-worker , Hanlon .
Perkins wore a Cardinals cap in his booking photo .
Hanlon turned himself in at the police station after officers called him on the phone .
The two were booked and cited for criminal damage .
The diesel fuel caused an estimated $ 2,000 of damage to the lawn .

With victory almost in his grasp , the looming question for Barack Obama is whether he will squeak by or whether he can roll up the score .
It will matter enormously to his leadership as President .
For Obama supporters , just climbing to the top of the mountain with 270 electoral votes has always seemed daunting enough .
And they are right .
After all , Democrats have seen triumphs slip away from them so often - they have lost 7 of the past 10 presidential elections - that they are extremely uneasy that the Republicans can pull an upset this time , too .
It seems unlikely after a raft of national polls this weekend showed Obama with a national lead of around 7 points - and by some estimates in double digits .
Still , there were also unsettling state polls last night by the Mason Dixon firm showing McCain closing in fast in North Carolina , Virginia , Ohio and Missouri .
Who can say for sure that Pennsylvania will remain blue .
It ai n't over ' till it 's over .
But when the dust clears and if the Democrats have pulled it off , the Obama team will care a great deal about the size and breadth of victory .
Much of his early presidency will hang in the balance .
There are three keys to watch on Tuesday night :
1. Percentage of the national vote .
Right now , there is a solid prospect that Obama can rack up 51 percent or more of the total vote .
If so , he would be the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to win a majority of the national vote ( Carter had 50.1 percent ) and only the second Democrat since Franklin Roosevelt to claim a majority ( Lyndon Johnson was the other ) .
That historic standing would give Obama a fresh boost as the president - elect and would mean that he could run ahead of Members of Congress in their own states .
In Washington , that gives a president extra power .
2. Number of red states won .
In recent campaigns , Democratic presidential contenders have won mostly on the east and west coasts and the upper midwest .
John Kerry only won 19 states plus the District of Columbia , and one could get on a plane at Dulles and fly to Los Angeles without flying over a state that the Democrats won .
Obama has had a vision since his convention speech in 2004 of Democrats becoming a national party , getting beyond the traditional red / blue divides .
And he now has a good chance of doing it .
If he can win a couple of southern states , plus two or three states from the Rocky Mountains , not to mention more Midwestern areas , he can claim a true national victory - and he would have the makings of a new , majority coalition for the Democrats , something they have lacked for decades .
3 . The size of Democratic wins in the Senate and House .
The Democrats were heading toward significant pick - ups with or without a presidential win , but if Obama racks up a convincing victory and is accompanied by nine or more new Democratic Senators and a couple of dozen new House members , that will give him muscle on Capitol Hill that few Presidents have enjoyed .
I was working for Ronald Reagan in 1980 when he trounced Jimmy Carter and Republicans swept to 12 pick - ups in the Senate and 33 in the House .
Reagan was much more respected - and effective - in working with Congress because of that thumping victory .
So , the eyes of the Obama team will be focused on getting to 270 electoral votes tomorrow night , but those who care about governing - and Obama cares more than most appreciate - will be watching , too , to see how big and broad a victory he can achieve .
It could be an historic night in more ways than one .

Sir Nick already has an OBE A leading UK HIV campaigner who has strived to transform attitudes towards HIV / Aids and to the role of gay men and women in society has been knighted .
Nick Partridge , chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust , was recognised for his 20 - year service to healthcare .
Knighthoods also go to Royal College of Surgeons past president Bernard Ribeiro and president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh Neil Douglas .
Other new Sirs include Wellcome Trust 's director Dr Mark Walport .
Professor Sally Davies , director of research and development at the Department of Health becomes a Dame for her services to Medicine , as does Liz Fradd , a nursing academic and fellow of the Royal College of Nursing , for her services to nursing .
Dr Nigel Lightfoot , chief adviser at the Health Protection Agency , is honoured with a CBE for the crucial role he played in the polonium 210 poisoning incident in 2006 , where he oversaw the professional work .
HIV Sir Nick said his knighthood on the New Year list was " great recognition of the pioneering work of Terrence Higgins Trust . "
The Terrence Higgins Trust ( THT ) was the first charity to be set up in response to the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s .
It is remarkably significant that someone who has worked so hard in the HIV sector has finally been recognised
Edwin J Bernard , editor of HIV Treatment Update
It 's roots were in the gay community and , for many years , the HIV epidemic in the UK affected mainly gay men .
As the shape of the epidemic changed , so did the THT , under the guidance of Sir Nick .
He joined the Trust in 1985 as the office manager , one of only two full - time paid posts , and became its head in 1991 .
He was tasked with overcoming public anti-gay prejudice and convincing politicians about the urgency of the HIV situation .
He has campaigned hard for research funding and progress and now , thanks to pioneering medical work and the discovery of antiretroviral therapy in the 1990s , the diagnosis of HIV is no longer a death sentence .
Influential In 2004 , Nick was appointed a Commissioner of the Healthcare Commission , the independent inspectorate responsible for reviewing the quality of healthcare in England .
In 2006 , he was declared one of the 100 most influential gay and lesbian people in Britain by the Independent .
He is also chair of INVOLVE , an advisory group promoting public involvement in NHS , public health and social care research .
Sir Nick said : " I 'm absolutely delighted .
This is great recognition of the pioneering work of Terrence Higgins Trust , the importance of patient and public involvement in health research through INVOLVE and the impact of the health watchdog , the Healthcare Commission .
I 'm very privileged to work with three amazing organisations and to be honoured in this way . "
The THT provides a wide range of sexual health and HIV services to over 50,000 people a year .
Edwin J Bernard , editor of HIV Treatment Update , said : " It is remarkably significant that someone who has worked so hard in the HIV sector has finally been recognised .
" After 25 years of the Terrence Higgins Trust it is about time .
" Much of the media focus has been on the international Aids problem .
I hope this shines the spotlight on HIV / Aids in the UK . "
There are now three times as many people living with HIV as there were 10 years ago and the numbers will continue to climb .

Many women felt they did not get a fair hearing under Sharia law A Muslim think tank has found some UK Imams discriminate against women when enforcing Islamic Sharia law .
Scholars at the Centre for Islamic Pluralism ( CIP ) interviewed 90 Muslims in London , the West Midlands , Lancashire and West Yorkshire .
They found some women did not get fair hearings in forced marriage , arranged marriage and domestic violence matters .
It comes after an NHS doctor was freed in Bangladesh following claims she was being held there for a forced marriage .
Sharia is a set of principles which govern the way many Muslims believe they should live their life .
Some mosques hold Sharia courts .
The CIP 's international director and its report 's author Dr Irfan Al - Alawi said women seeking help in situations like forced marriages often turned to Imams for a ruling on what to do .
Some ladies have approached the Imams and the Imams ... have encouraged the ladies to stay with their husband or with their in - laws
Dr Irfan Al - Alawi
" Our research shows that domestic violence and forced marriages seem to be the dominant problems that women are facing and seeking Sharia rulings on .
" In every case it is a male who is the defendant coming from India , Pakistan or Bangladesh .
" Some ladies have approached the Imams and the Imams ... have encouraged the ladies to stay with their husband or with their in - laws , whereby they have a duty bound under the Sharia . "
He said he knew of a 15 - year - old girl in Pakistan who was tricked into marriage over the telephone with a 40 - year - old man from Sheffield , who had the mental age of a four - year - old child .
" The Home Office refused to recognise the validity of the marriage but the Islamic Sharia Council in Britain accepted it , " said Dr Al - Alawi .
He said Imams should be working at the heart of their communities showing leadership , but some were failing to do so .
He accused some Imams of " cashing in " on the Sharia system .
On average it may cost someone £ 250 to go and get an Islamic divorce , he said .
Dr Abedin 's return has been ordered by the High Court in Dhaka " There are Pirs [ Muslim holy men ] and Imams who come here from south Asia and charge people for charms , holy water ... how is this helping anyone ? " he asked .
" They should be putting back something useful into society . "
The spotlight has been on forced marriages in recent weeks , with the introduction of new laws designed to help victims , and a high - profile case in Bangladesh .
Lawyers for trainee NHS GP Humayra Abedin , 33 , from east London , said her family planned to force her into marriage after she travelled to Dhaka .
She had travelled there as she thought her mother was ill , and then was held against her will for months , they said .
Ms Abedin is due to arrive back in the UK later , after London 's High Court ordered her return under the new Forced Marriage Act and the High Court in Dhaka also ruled she must be freed .
Thirty - year - old Sophiya ( not her real name ) from West Yorkshire , was 13 when her father arranged her marriage to a distant cousin in Pakistan .
I saw three Imams but they all ruled that I was legally married according to the Sharia
Sophiya , 30 She said that after much resistance she was forced to marry a man she did not want to , but decided to go through with it so she could get back to the UK and put her case to a local Imam .
" I saw three Imams but they all ruled that I was legally married according to the Sharia .
I told them I had been forced but they said that did not change anything . "
Sophiya decided to try and please her parents and her new husband and carry on , but three years later she sought an Islamic divorce .
" I met some more Imams and said that we had been separated now for nearly two years but instead of giving me guidance with my divorce , they suggested I had to go for counselling or therapy .
" I told them I had been forced and this was not Islamic , but they disagreed . "
A few months later Sophyia 's husband wrote and gave her the Islamic divorce she longed for .
" I went through the proper Islamic way and these men told me to go away . "
Sophiya said she wants the government to send Imams back to their countries of origin if they cannot uphold the true values of the Sharia .
' Grey area ' Ishtiaq Ahmed , is a spokesperson the Council for Mosques , a Bradford - based group which represents over 90 mosques and religious schools .
" We have in Britain ...
Muslims from all over the world , people are practising their own cultural , their social , kind of way of life .
" We have looked into this issue on many occasions and have found that for some Imams a grey area can form where the rulings of the Sharia finish and long - held cultural practices start .
" Imams do need more training and help ; we also need lots more female scholars , ulemas , to work with our communities and try and help women . "
" I feel Imams are not trying to deliberately discriminate against anyone we just have to be more open in how we pass judgements so everyone is happy and understands the process . "
The report is due to be published next month and will be sent to the government and agencies .
It will recommend that Imams coming to the UK from south Asia and Africa need to be vetted to ensure they have a broad knowledge of Islam and a good command of English , so they can carry out their duties in a professional and competent way .

Blogs designed with a magazine layout are a pretty hot design trend .
This design approach also has long - term prospects as a viable layout and user interface strategy , particularly as mammoth , older blogs require new ways to better present and organize their arsenal of content , and as other blog owners incorporate new models of content into their sites .
But not all blogs are created equal , and not all blogs are great candidates for a magazine layout style .
In fact , a vast majority of blogs , particularly personal blogs , and those that are n’t updated frequently , are best served by the traditional , 2 or 3 - column scroll down approach .
When considering a new layout approach for your blog , your content should really drive the form ( layout methodology ) you choose .
Pros and Cons of Magazine Style Layouts
One of the driving forces behind the magazine layout approach on a blog is evolving technology .
This ranges from new ways of delivering content such as video , photo streams or widgets onto a site , to the injection of flexible , modular theme systems such as the Revolution magazine theme series and Gridline magazine theme series ( for WordPress as a platform ) .
Other content management systems , such as ExpressionEngine , make it increasingly easy for a blog to embrace a more modular , magazine style approach instead of the traditional , two - column - content - on - left - sidebar - on - right standby .
Pros of magazine layouts
You can provide a more comprehensive user experience if your blog has a lot of content , or if you update frequently , and you ’re providing great visuals , videos , or cross- promoting products on an ongoing basis .
A magazine layout can potentially avoid some of the old “ below the fold ” usability issues , but as monitors scale upward , this becomes less of an overriding factor .
If you ’re writing / selling to a more sophisticated , tech - oriented , or design - oriented audience , a properly executed , finely designed magazine style approach can improve the trustworthiness and reputation of your brand and position you to look more forward thinking and organized .
If you ’re leveraging alternative content like video , podcasts , Twitter feeds , photo streams from Flickr and providing a wholly interactive experience , a magazine theme is going to make your life infinitely easier from an organizational point of view , and your end user will likely be more engaged in your site , less likely to bounce away quickly , and return to your blog more frequently for a quick glance at your latest interactive updates .
A potential SEO boost with more links and varied content on your front page that get spidered quickly , versus miles worth of scrolling that gets lost in pagination .
Cons to consider
Magazine style is NOT for everyone .
If you post fewer than three times a week and are n’t supplementing those posts with any sort of microblogging updates ( Twitter , Tumblr , Flickr photos ) or video and photos , a magazine layout can cast more negative emphasis on the fact that your blog is n’t frequently updated .
Complexity of installation and design can be an issue .
While you can buy one of the pre-packaged magazine themes for WordPress , for example , any customization beyond that may take a higher technical knowledge of php .
If you ’re attempting a magazine style yourself from scratch and are lacking in the design skills department , you may find the complexity of balancing sizing , proportions , hierarchy , etc. too difficult to execute properly .
Cost .
If you want to go the magazine layout route , but need to outsource the design and programming work — even if it ’s a modification of an existing built magazine theme — you ’re looking at a potentially larger investment than most traditional blog layout approaches require .
Blogs and sites rocking the magazine layout trend
Some of the blogs listed below use a hybrid of magazine style and ‘ newspaper ’ ( similar to New York Times ) style approach , but for the sake of this article , we ’ll throw them in the mixer together and comment accordingly .
Anderson Cooper 360
A hybrid blog and news portal for CNN commentator Anderson Cooper , his 360 blog uses effective magazine / editorial style grouping for easy scanning and injection of lots of info onto the main page .
What ’s relevant about 360 , from both a design and SEO perspective , is the balance of blurbs of content along with lists of links .
The design could be kicked up a notch by offering a featured video near the top of the page that can play directly on the page without requiring the user to navigate elsewhere .
Cooper ’s reporting often features compelling visuals , and some of these could be turned into still shots in a gallery on the front page to help further add balance against the text and links .
TruthDig
Truthdig puts a huge chunk of change of content on its front page , but its visuals and color blocking help create a more structured approach .
The use of varying sizes of pictures helps move the eye down the page , and each section of the magazine is easily deciphered .
More padding and breathing room would help the design feel less chaotic , but Truthdig ’s designers may have purposely chosen a tight approach , with little white space , to convey a sense of urgency .
Macalicious
Macalicious positions itself as a news site , but any blog with a rich amount of content can take cues from its approach .
Macalicious is more a true magazine layout approach than Problogger and Truthdig , and it packs a lot of info on the front page without requiring us to move the mouse around much to see it .
If you have a blog with a small amount of very distinct categories , you might consider emulating Macalicious ’ top content , where they highlight recent news , then content from two other main sections .
The photos below the content point to a Flickr feed , and if you run , say , a travel blog , a similar solution could add great visuals to your page and enrich your entries with parallel visuals that make your readers experience more comprehensive .
Macalicious is a prime example of the content dictating the direction of the design .
Macs , as a topic , are fairly narrow , but within that are several primary areas of interest .
It ’s a big enough topic to require a strong organizational approach that the magazine layout provides , but it ’s narrow enough that it does n’t suffer some of the scrolling issues that TruthDig presented .
Follow the Winds
This topical blog and lifestyle magazine dedicated to windsurfing is interactive as all get out , and pushes visuals and graphics in a way that really leverages the strength of a magazine layout design .
Although a fair amount of scrolling downward is required on the front page , the content is blocked so effectively that it mimics the way a magazine ’s table of contents might feel .
This is magazine style taken to its true potential .
A cooking blog could take this site as inspiration for injecting lots of food visuals , some tutorial videos and organization by theme / category .
A fashion - oriented blog could also blow competitors out of the water visually by utilizing this kind of structure .
Just make sure you have enough interesting imagery and some micro content to support a framework this robust .
Hopefully these varied approaches to magazine style get your own creative juices flowing when it comes to potential for your own blog .
Although a magazine layout approach can be overwhelming , it also offers an opportunity to expand possibilities for your blog and inspire ways to use new social media and interactive technologies that will better engage your readers and help your site look more rich in content and style .
If you ’ve seen any great blogs designed in magazine style , we ’d love to hear about them , and your thoughts about the blog ’s design and organization .
Background : Poll – # 1 – # 2
This installment of Java concurrency bugs is a simple thing but one that still shows up too frequently , particularly in those new to concurrency .
It is tempting to believe that given a “ thread - safe ” class that you can use that correctly in all situations .
This is not true .
The problem is that composing two atomic thread - safe operations seems safe , but has several potential pitfalls .
The most obvious pitfall is assuming that performing two ( or more ) atomic operations yields a new atomic operation , which is definitely not the case .
For example , consider this operation on a Hashtable ( in which all methods are synchronized and thread - safe ) : [ source : java ]
/**
If the key already exists , get its value .
Otherwise add the key - value pair .
*/
public Object putIfAbsent ( Hashtable table , Object key , Object value ) {
if(table.containsKey(key ) ) {
// already present , return existing value
return table. get ( key ) ;
} else {
// does n’t exist , create and return new value
table .put ( key , value ) ;
return value ;
}
}
[ / source ]
Since the Hashtable is thread - safe , this method is thread - safe too right ?
Well , kind of .
It ’s not going to cause visibility problems in the table or deadlocks .
But there is a race condition here if multiple threads are executing putIfAbsent ( ) .
After the first if check , it ’s possible for anything to happen .
Another thread could remove the key from the table or add the key to the table , invalidating the result of the if check .
Similarly , after the put call , another thread could similarly add , remove , or modify the entry , thus causing this thread to return a wrong value .
To fix this code , you must either participate in the same lock that governs the existing atomic operations OR wrap those calls in a new layer of locking .
I picked Hashtable quite intentionally as it locks on its instance , allowing external users to participate in the same lock used internally : [ source : java ]
public Object putIfAbsent ( Hashtable table , Object key , Object value ) {
synchronized ( table ) {
if(table.containsKey(key ) ) {
// already present , return existing value
return table. get ( key ) ;
} else {
// does n’t exist , create and return new value
table .put ( key , value ) ;
return value ;
}
}
}
[ / source ]
Or you could encapsulate access to this Hashtable in a full wrapper object that completely hides the Hashtable and provides a single composite putIfAbsent .
In the case of a Map that did n’t use itself as the internal lock object , this would be your only choice .
In a wrapper object , it would not suffice to just lock this one method in a new lock ; you need to lock ALL operations in the new lock to properly synchronize individual get ( ) , put ( ) , remove ( ) , etc calls against the putIfAbsent ( ) call .
The ConcurrentMap interface added in JDK 1.5 defines composite operations so they can be implemented efficiently .
For example , the ConcurrentHashMap implementation can efficiently implement this internally as it would be a performance disaster to implement it in a wrapper .
Another perhaps simpler example of this can be seen with volatiles .
A simple volatile counter will appear to be safe to those first encountering concurrency : [ source : java ]
// This is broken !
public class VolatileCounter {
private volatile int count ;</ p>
public int next ( ) {
return count ++;
}
}
[ / source ]
The key here is that “ count + + ” is not one atomic operation ; it ’s three operations .
Read – Increment – Write .
And the Read and Write parts are atomic but composing these three operations together does not yield an atomic composite .
You really need to protect this counter with some form of synchronization or other mechanism of performing this increment atomically .
One good option in Java is the AtomicInteger ( and its cousins ) that let you perform this operation safely ( and likely more cheaply ) than with synchronization : [ source : java ]
public class AtomicCounter {
private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger ( ) ;
public int next ( ) {
return count.incrementAndGet ( ) ;
}
}
[ / source ]
Here we see how AtomicInteger defines a new method incrementAndGet ( ) that is a safe ( fast ) composite operation of two otherwise atomic operations .
But this happens only be merging them in an encapsulation , not by calling separate increment ( ) and get ( ) operations .
This seems like a simple thing but when it occurs in a bug it ’s usually far more subtle .
This problem with composing concurrent code based on locks is one of the biggest issues with producing reusable concurrent code and of composing large systems in Java .

Buried on page 11 of the Guardian on 1st November is an article , extremely enlightening in its simplicity , reporting the ‘ news ’ that during office Blair was only too happy to do Rupert Murdoch ’s bidding .
According to Lance Price , former Downing Street spin doctor , Murdoch was ‘ one of the four most influential people in the administration ’ .
Never mind that he was totally unelected , not actually a part of any ‘ administration ’ , or that he is a US citizen whose company ( News Corp . ) pays no net tax .
Buried on page 11 of the Guardian on 1st November is an article , extremely enlightening in its simplicity , reporting the ‘ news ’ that during office Blair was only too happy to do Rupert Murdoch ’s bidding .
According to Lance Price , former Downing Street spin doctor , Murdoch was ‘ one of the four most influential people in the administration ’ .
Never mind that he was totally unelected , not actually a part of any ‘ administration ’ , or that he is a US citizen whose company ( News Corp . ) pays no net tax .
The Guardian reports that , “ Tony Blair helped Murdoch overcome an official investigation which was jeopardising one of his big investments ... Blair , while prime minister , immediately ordered his top officials to help the tycoon . ”
One wonders why his big investment was being jeopardised by an ‘ official investigation ’ , and whether it crossed Blair ’s mind that perhaps it was being investigated for a reason .
But apparently he was blinded by sympathy .
“ Blair told the media magnet he was ‘ instinctively sympathetic to what Murdoch was aiming to achieve . ”
Clearly Blair ’s instincts have been finely honed to the interests of the highest bidder .
He felt that “ it was important that the UK remained at the cutting edge of developing this kind of media product . ”
Indeed .
The product , which enabled Sky Digital viewers to bank whilst watching TV , was so ‘ cutting edge ’ that it collapsed by 2001 , overtaken by internet banking !
Here we have a fine example of how politics is ‘ concentrated economics ’ .
Lenin explained how bourgeois democracy is a sham , since 9/10s of all forms of communication are owned and controlled by a small minority .
Murdoch , who makes Citizen Kane look like the local gazette ’s leading shareholder , uses his media might to influence elections , and then demands that his government carry out policies that allow him to expand his power , thus in turn influencing more elections .
No wonder he was ( and no doubt still is ) amongst the four most influential people over the government .
One has to ask the question , where do the millions of voters who elected the government come on the list of most influential ?

" At the risk of sounding like ' Dr. Evil ' , there is a very real possibility of seeing monthly payrolls falling by a million in the next few months , " Carnell wrote .
Payroll losses could reach seven figures as soon as January or February , he added .
The latest nonfarm payrolls report is due out on Friday and analysts surveyed by Briefing .com forecast that 475,000 jobs were shed in December , slightly fewer than November 's 533,000 .
But the volatile figure can be higher , with TrimTabs Investment Research analysts suggesting the economy lost close to 700,000 jobs in the last month of 2008 .
ING 's Carnell said that persistently over the past year the official payrolls number was more optimistic than the bank 's predictions , but now the two were closer and convergence was near .
For December , ING 's forecast is for payrolls to drop by 750,000 .
The market on Monday opened sharply lower only to quickly rebound on the early morning new home sales numbers .
This was short lived because after you dig through the journalistic rhetoric you will find that this was the lowest September since 1981 .
It was hard to spin the report .
This includes what should be the end of the strong summer selling season yet the data was simply not there .
This in light of major price declines which gave home sales a modest monthly boost .
At the end of the day , the market was down yet again sending the S & P 500 to 848 or a whopping 45 + % drop from its peak only 1 year ago .
These are epic numbers .
Wicked swings on the up and downside are not good .
This is massive volatility spurred by economic uncertainty .
If the technical definition of a recession is not met even in light of the entire economic calamity , then we clearly need to retool our measuring tape .
We are facing eerily similar circumstances from the Great Depression .
I will examine the four horsemen of the economic apocalypse in this article .
Many people assume that the Great Depression originated in the United States , which it did not .
Many also think the 1929 stock market crash was the source of the Great Depression when it was merely the most obvious symptom of a long - term and slowly growing global problem .
In fact , other global markets had already been declining even years before .
Charles Kindleberger in The World in Depression 1929 – 1939 ( a must read ) does an excellent surgical economic and historical dissection of the world economy at the time :
“ To the extent that the depression was ushered in by the stock market crash , it was the crash in New York that was of consequence .
Canadian prices went higher from 1926 and declined further from their peaks , compared to New York .
They were the tail of the dog .
European security markets had for the most part turned down earlier : Germany as far back as 1927 , the United Kingdom in mid-1928 , France in February 1929 .
The Vienna stock market , which had led the parade in the crisis of 1873 , was quiet , waiting for 1931 .
The action was in New York .
It had its effect worldwide , but not through tightly parallel movements in security prices . ”
No doubt the spectacular collapse of the stock market in October must have been a stunning blow to many but it was merely reflecting difficulties across the globe in many areas .
In the 1920s Florida saw a massive real estate speculative boom and bust .
It makes for a fascinating read since it chronicles a large part of the psychology we saw during this bubble .
Much of swagger is gone from real estate pitchmen .
The 4 major issues we are seeing that reflect much of what occurred during the 1920s are : ( 1 ) Major housing distress , ( 2 ) Global stock markets crashing , ( 3 ) Commodities collapsing , and ( 4 ) Unemployment surging .
This is part XX in our Great Depression series :
14 . Bank Failures .
15 . The King JPMorgan Speaks .
16 . Items That Sold in the Credit Bubble .
17 . The All Hat and No Cattle Nation
18 . Charity for Financial Deviants .
19 . The Silent Economic Depression
Issue Number # 1 – Housing Distress
The above chart should be a dramatic demonstration of what has happened to the United States housing market .
It has simply come to a screeching halt .
A large number of relatively well paying jobs in construction , machinery , and financing of this growth all depended on housing starts growing for the foreseeable future .
Even if we are to look at current housing sales trends the numbers still reflect a serious problem :
What you will notice is that lower priced resale homes had a slight jump while newly built homes which have more to do with construction growth and employment have fallen off a cliff .
But a more important point to note on both charts above is that you ’ll notice peaks in late 2005 and early 2006 .
This was nearly 2 years earlier than the August 2007 credit meltdown .
Keep in mind , the stock market did n’t reach peaks until October of 2007 .
Once these leading indicators started trending lower it was only a matter of time that the economy came with it .
Why would n’t it ?
So much of the newly created industries since 2000 completely depended on the finance , real estate , and the insurance economy ( FIRE ) .
The ultimate sign of pain is foreclosures .
These numbers are not encouraging :
September 2008 :
Properties with Foreclosure filings : 265,968
This was a 12 % drop from the previous month but keeps us at a record shattering pace that will see 3 million foreclosure filings in 2008 .
Some of this drop can also be attributed to new legislation issued in California forcing lenders to delay the foreclosure process .
This will only kick the can down the street a few more months .
Prices are still coming down hard .
The median California home is now down 41 + % from the peak reached last year .
Overall housing is not healthy and an economy so dependent on this one industry will have problems .
Issue Number # 2 – Stock Market Crashing
Global markets are suffering and this is hitting across every market .
What was propping up the emerging markets and many foreign markets was the notion of decoupling .
The idea with decoupling is somehow the world was large enough to withstand an economic recession in the United States without missing a beat in growing .
Not only is this notion wrong it is being proven utterly without merit .
Japan on Monday hit a 26 year low .
Iceland goes bankrupt .
Trillions of dollars , your dollars are injected into the system to nationalize banks .
We are a world couple whether we want to be or not .
The global financial system is too interdependent .
The issue at hand is going to test economic philosophies .
Many monetarists from the Freidman School believe problems like the one we are currently living through can be solved purely through monetary policy as discussed by Kindleberger :
“ Monetarists , such as Milton Friedman , think that the depression of 1929 was no accident .
They find the origin in the United States rather than in Europe or the periphery ; in monetary rather than real factors ; in policy rather than in the nature of institutions or in the tasks required of them ; in a national economy rather than in the operations of the international system .
Within the limits of U.S. monetary policy , moreover , which excludes the villain of many another analysis – structural dislocation in Europe after the First World War or the failure of the United States to act like a creditor nation , particularly the imposition of the Smoot - Hawley Tariff Act of June of 1930 – they rule out stock market speculation and the delay in passing the Glass - Steagall Act of 1932 , which overcame a domestic shortage of monetary gold by allowing the Federal Reserve System to substitute government securities instead of gold for the lacking eligible paper needed as backing for the central bank ’s liabilities …
… But Freidman ’s explanation of the 1929 worldwide Great Depression is national , monetary , and related to a policy decision .
It is unicausal .
In my judgment it is wrong .
Recently , starting with Allan Meltzer , monetarists have been admitting one international aspect to their analysis : the Smoot - Hawley Act .
The concession is slight , however , and the analysis remains almost wholly dependent on the quantity theory of money . ”
Current Fed Chairmen Ben Bernanke comes from the monetarist school of thought .
In fact , much of his often quoted “ helicopter ” analogy of dropping money from above comes from this idea .
He is a student of the Great Depression and I imagine if he is a true monetarist would adhere to this idea .
He is having a chance to put his theory to work and clearly , it is failing .
It fails to address the systemic problems infecting the global markets .
It also has little impact in commodities collapsing as they currently are .
In addition , flooding the system with money would require solvency on borrowers which does not exist .
That is why I lean a bit more to the neo -Keynesian model of economics in that at present , if we are to inject money into the economy it should be into to strategic job creation for a larger portion of the population .
Many will argue that this is interfering with the market but what the Fed and U.S. Treasury are doing is intervention .
We simply have differing philosophies of how to use the funding .
I think having one dogmatic philosophy is also dangerous since it misses the scope of the entire situation .
Even recently , Ben Bernanke mentioned it may be a good idea for more stimulus checks , a clearly Keynesian point .
Honestly , I am not for stimulus checks .
This amounts to a quick jolt into the economy which is quickly sucked dry .
I would rather see the funding go to strategic development of new industries and sustainable jobs .
Where will this money come from ?
The same place the $ 700 billion in easy money for corrupt crony capitalistic banks came from .
At least in this move , the larger public will benefit instead of a few corrupt Wall Street banks and lenders who led us into the abyss in the first place .
Issue Number # 3 – Commodities Collapsing
Commodities are collapsing across the board .
The above chart of oil should give you a major idea of what is happening in the market via demand destruction .
When you go from a peak of $ 147 to $ 62 within a few months , you can safely say that the market has collapsed .
You ’ll also notice that people are n’t too focused on oil anymore .
Remember a few months ago when most were clamoring about oil being the number one issue ?
Well this was simply a distraction from the number 1 issue which is the entire economy is being bombarded from multiple fronts and oil was simply part of the multi-faceted problem .
If oil was the main problem , then this current price should be sending stock markets soaring .
In fact , the opposite is happening .
Take a look at a couple of other charts :
This is demand destruction on multiple fronts .
What the Fed and the U.S. Treasury are trying to do is avoid deflation at all costs even if it means sacrificing the dollar .
Chances are the Fed will lower rates again which is not good for the dollar .
Incredibly , the only advancing item in the last few weeks is the U.S. Dollar :
I would imagine this quick run up is massive deleveraging of those who made large bets on the decoupling theory and need a safe place to stay for the moment .
In the end , when you have 60 + % of the world reserve currency you still carry a bit of weight around .
A couple of things .
Commodity prices sharply declined during the Great Depression as well .
They started their decline before the stock market crash .
Much of the decline was due to demand destruction .
This may pose even a bigger threat to exporting countries .
Look at what happened to Russia for example when oil collapsed this year .
They had to shut down their market a few times .
Issue Number # 4 – Unemployment Surging
Unemployment is growing at a feverish pace although the above chart will not show it .
The true current unemployment rate is more like 11 % which also includes part - time workers looking for full - time work and those who have given up looking for work altogether .
As a frame of reference , unemployment in early 1929 was 3.1 % with slightly below 2 million people unemployed from the work force .
In 1930 the number went to slightly above 4 million .
1931 saw the number increase to 8 million .
By 1932 the number was at 12 million .
In 3 years , the unemployment numbers went up by 10 million people .
This was a staggering number even by today ’s standards .
This year alone not one job has been added in the aggregate .
Last month we saw 159,000 jobs lost :
We are teetering here .
It would n’t take much to push this over the edge .
Already we are seeing massive layoffs across many industries .
Yahoo ! , Bear Stearns , WaMu , eBay , and other companies are cutting back .
The government which employs a large number of people is also cutting back .
The few industries that are hiring are simply not big enough to absorb the glut of workers .
This crisis has now spread into every area of our global system .
It is important at this point that policies that are taken do not usher in another Great Depression .
If we are to fling money at the problem , we should at least ensure that the money is spent on behalf of improving the overall status of the economy and not simply maintaining a failed banking system .
We clearly need to rethink things before we launch anymore money into these industries .
Calling for price supports is absurd .
This was tried in the past and failed .
It sounds good but is a gimmick .
What we need is a comprehensive new vision of what we expect out of our economy .
Blowing one bubble after another feeding on speculation and greed simply breeds a market psychology of greed and instability which in the end , the middle class ( should it continue existing ) usually has to bailout .
Is this really how we want our system functioning ?

An official investigation has been launched after two immigration service staff working with asylum - seekers were found to have links to the British National Party , The Independent has learnt .
One guard employed to look after asylum - seekers at a detention centre has been forced to resign after his name was found on a membership list of the BNP .
Another man has been suspended while his employer investigates alleged links to the same far - right organisation .
Both cases raise serious concerns about racism within the immigration system , where membership of extreme political groups has long been suspected .
Over the past two years
The Independent has helped reveal nearly 300 allegations of brutality , including 38 claims of racism , made by asylum - seekers about private security and immigration staff .
Some of the allegations included abusive and racist language , in which refugees fleeing persecution were referred to as " monkeys " or told to " go back to their own countries " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The only two services where membership of the BNP can be grounds for dismissal are the police force and the Prison Service .
In the case of the immigration service , everyone working in immigration removal centres or in the guarding or removal of asylum - seekers must sign a declaration making clear that they are not members of the BNP , Combat 18 or the National Front .
Those who are found to belong to any group that promotes racism will lose their accreditation to work in the immigration system .
Last night , the UK Border Agency said it " will not tolerate racist behaviour by individuals working in immigration removal centres .
All allegations are investigated and the UKBA can revoke an individual 's accreditation to work for the agency or have any contact with detainees . "
It is understood that a security guard resigned after a list of BNP members was leaked to the media last year .
In the case of the suspended guard , the investigation is being conducted by the private contractor .
During his suspension , the man will not be able to work with refugees or enter any immigration building .
BNP policy on immigration stipulates : " We will also clamp down on the flood of ' asylum - seekers ' , all of whom are either bogus or can find refuge much nearer their home countries . "
Last month the Home Office received another report , this time from its own complaints watchdog , that raised serious concerns about the treatment of complaints of racism made by asylum - seekers , many of which had been miscategorised as " poor service " complaints .
The report , written by the Home Office 's Complaints Audit Committee ( CAC ) , and seen by The Independent , said senior officials had " joined us in voicing concern that serious complaints such as allegations of assault aggravated by racism have been handled as service delivery complaints and as a consequence have not been properly managed " .
The Labour MP Diane Abbott said last night : " If it is true that staff employed to work with asylum - seekers and immigrants are members of the BNP then it is yet another sign that the Home Office are allowing for the mistreatment of immigrants in this country .
For years , campaign groups and my colleagues and I have been pointing out that hiring private contractors to work as immigration guards is a bad idea .
It seems we will now have more proof of this .
People who come to this country deserve to be treated with the same dignity and respect that is afforded to citizens . "
A spokesperson for Medical Justice , which helped compile a dossier of nearly 300 complaints of alleged abuse , said : " We hear detainees complain about racism on an almost daily basis and it's virtually unheard of for a complaint to be upheld .
The sheer volume of detainees complaining suggests among certain immigration guards there seems to be a canteen culture of racism which can flourish if left unchecked .
Detainees feel dehumanised . "
In its report , the CAC further warned : " Complaints of racism have caused us concern , as failures to report and investigate them fully may leave the UK Border Agency liable to prosecution under the Race Relations Act and to other anti-discrimination legislation ...
We have learnt of special problems in the detention estate , where complaints forms have a tick - box marked ' racism ' and where officials believe that racism has been widely used as an inappropriate add - on to service delivery complaints , such as a detainee claiming that he had been served cold food because of his ethnic origin .
" We have reservations about the accuracy of this view in light of Sir William MacPherson 's definition of a racist incident as ' any incident which is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person ' .
As we do not routinely audit service delivery complaints , we cannot calculate the extent of alleged misuse of the term ' racist ' . "
The CAC said the Home Office should have supplied all misconduct complaints alleging racism .
" We received only four complaints of racism from Colnbrook [ detention centre , near Heathrow Airport ] in 2007 .
This would appear to be a low number of potential complaints according to evidence collected by the HMIP [ prison inspectorate ] team , whose survey yielded the information that 18 per cent of detainees said they had been victimised by staff on the basis of their nationality and 15 per cent said they had been victimised on the basis of their ethnic or cultural origin .

A TOP private school is at the centre of a race row between its Jewish and Muslim pupils .
In the wake of fighting in Gaza which has left nearly 1000 Palestinians dead , Muslim children at Glasgow's Hutchesons ' Grammar School were asked if they hated Jews .
The school admitted many put up their hands - only to be told they should hate the Israeli army instead .
Muslim and Jewish pupils attend separate morning assemblies at the school , where fees are around £ 9000 a year .
News of last Thursday 's controversial meeting was released by two Jewish pupils who went along by mistake .
The assembly was led by Asgher Mohammed , a parent who is believed to be a chemist .
News of the hate vote spread quickly through the 368 - year - old school .
The parents of one of the Jewish children involved wrote to school rector Dr Kenneth Greig .
Dr Greig had letters sent out to other parents to explain the circumstances .
A school spokesman said yesterday : " The person in question has a long - standing history of taking the morning assembly .
" This is the first time anything like this has happened .
Perhaps it was not advisable to ask the question that he did .
" However , no one believes anything was intended to cause offence .
" His lesson was to preach religious tolerance and to show , despite what is going on in the Middle East , that Muslims and Jews in the UK can live in peace . "
Claire Singerman , who co-ordinates Jewish assemblies at the school , stressed the " excellent " relationship between pupils of different faiths .
Chemist Asgher Mohammed said last night : " I have seen the statement from the school and amvery happy with that .
I am not going to say anything else . "
Muslim pupils make up around seven per cent of the school roll .
Around six per cent are Jewish .
The school 's famous ex-pupils include former lord chancellor Derry Irvine and John Buchan , author of The Thirty - Nine Steps .
Three months ago , it was ordered to improve access for poorer students or risk losing its status as a charity .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
Hollywood 's disgraced private investigator to the stars shuffled in shackles into a federal courtroom Monday and was sentenced to 15 years in prison in a celebrity wiretapping scandal .
A threat to a reporter launched an investigation that brought down celebrity shamus Anthony Pellicano .
The sentence for Anthony Pellicano was close to the 16 years sought by federal prosecutors .
A probation report had recommended a sentence just under six years .
U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer also ordered Pellicano and two other defendants in the case to pay $ 2 million in restitution .
" You were unquestionably the organizer and leader , " the judge said , referring to Pellicano 's role in the vast wiretapping scheme .
The judge added that Pellicano inflicted " emotional , physical and psychological harm onto his victims " and counted the justice system among the victims .
After the sentencing , Prosecutor Dan Saunders applauded the 15 - year term , saying Pellicano never considered the law when trying to help his wealthy clients .
" If anything he was very jubilant , and proud and excited with his ability to break the law , " he said .
Dressed in a green jailhouse jumpsuit , Pellicano , 65 , blew a kiss to family members as he was led into court .
Later , he shifted in his chair as he told the judge , " I have already taken complete and full responsibility for all of my actions . "
Saunders called Pellicano's statement " false and hogwash . "
Pellicano was convicted in May of 76 counts of racketeering , wire fraud , identity theft and wiretapping after a two - month trial .
Pellicano and high - profile entertainment lawyer Terry Christiansen also were convicted in August of conspiring to wiretap the private conversations of billionaire Kirk Kerkorian 's former wife , Lisa Bonder Kerkorian .
The Kerkorians were locked in a child - support battle in early 2002 .
According to witness testimony , many of Pellicano 's wiretaps involved conversations between lawyers and their clients .
" The importance of the attorney - client privilege cannot be overstated , " the judge said
Pellicano represented himself in both trials , which included testimony from MGM mogul Kerkorian and comedian Garry Shandling , as well as 34 recordings Pellicano made with attorney Christensen .
The men could be heard joking about the phone conversations of Kerkorian 's ex-wife .
Pellicano's new lawyers said outside the courtroom that they would appeal .
" There are numerous appellate issues with both the conviction and this sentence , " said Michael Artan .
Pellicano faced up to 20 years to life in prison for the racketeering convictions alone .
Christensen , a partner in one of Hollywood 's top entertainment law firms , was sentenced to three years in federal prison .
The infamous Hollywood wiretaps case began when Los Angeles Times reporter Anita Busch was threatened in June 2002 .
A dead fish , a rose and a note demanding " Stop ! " were left on the windshield of her car .
In court , Busch propped a crutch against the back row of courtroom seats and limped forward to tell the judge how Pellicano 's actions had harmed her .
" I thought it was just a matter of time before I would be killed [ by Pellicano ] , " Busch said .
She added that she was so frightened by Pellicano that she feared turning on the ignition on her car because she thought it might blow up .
Busch turned to Pellicano and scolded , " You threw away your responsibility as a son to your mother and as a father to your own children -- for money . "
She then delivered a parting shot : " I fear for your soul when I think that God is just . "
Investigators raided Pellicano's offices on Sunset Boulevard as part of their investigation into the threats against Bush and exposed his wiretapping enterprise .
The case captured Hollywood 's attention as A - listers and insiders speculated on who would be caught up the scandal .
Sylvester Stallone and Keith Carradine were wiretapped ; Shandling was subjected to an illegal criminal background check .
The names of other stars , including Chris Rock and Courtney Love , came up in testimony during the trials .

Dir. of Malaysia ’s Human Rights Group Calls for Sodomy Law Repeal , PA : Shenandoah Police Face Racial Abuse Charges , Maddow : The Family Condemns Ugandan Anti-Gay Bill , PM Brown Pushes Civil Partnerships in Europe , and More …
by Victoria Lavin | December 17th , 2009 , 7:52 am
US influence helps draft Uganda anti-gay bill Rachel Maddow shows the connection between American right=wing evangelicals and an extreme anti-gay law newly passed in Uganda .
Transcript of Video >>> in the winter of 2009 , 5 years ago today , actually , a small blog in this country got a very big international scoop .
it was february 2009 , so that 's just one month into the barack obama presidency .
right ?
and while most people in this country were fixated on the freefalling global economy , and whether the new president and newly elected democrats would be able to arrest that freefall and bring us back from the brink of depression , three activists here in the united states were making preparations for big overseas trip .
the blog in question which is called the box turtle bulletin , they got advanced word about this trip .
five years ago today , they posted this blog item .
what they reported that day is three american evangelical activists had been invited to attend a three - day conference in uganda in march .
that march .
2009 . the conference was being organized by a ugandan anti-gay group and three american activists were scheduled to appear and speak at that conference .
it was unclear at the time what that conference was going to be all about exactly .
in march of that year as expected , these three american evangelical activists traveled to uganda and spoke at that conference and participated in a number of follow - up meetings which reportedly included members of the ugandan parliament .
eventually some undercover video recordings of the conference came out and it became clear what exactly these american activists were up to over there .
they were there it turns out to give this ugandan group an american anti-gay perspective on the evils of homosexuality .
proved , it 's ays are born that been proven they 're born that way .
that is a lie .
that 's what 's called a lie .
it is not true .
there is no definitive scientific study that has ever proved that homosexuality -- >>
these activists traveled to africa and urged the ugandans they met with including legislators to show , quote , zero tolerance for homosexuality .
presented this quack evidence of how dangerous gay people are , presented themselves as scientific experts on the subject .
they claimed people can be cured of being gay and then they came back home .
that trip to uganda , again , took place in march 2009 .
seven months later this bill appeared in the ugandan parliament .
anti-homosex wruality bill of 2009 , known as kill the gays bill .
called first for a sentence of life in prison just for being gay .
called for a sentence of death by hanging for the death of being gay and hiv positive .
could be sentenced for three years in prison for knowing somebody was gay and not reporting them to government .
the kill the gays bill landed with a thud on the world stage and almost as soon as it did , the american activists who had been in uganda earlier that year urging zero tolerance for homosexuality were claiming they were shocked by this legislation , had nothing to do with it and opposed at least the capital punishment part of what was called for in the bill .
we did lots of reporting on this at the time and learned that even though these american activists were trying desperately to distance themselves from the kill the gays bill when it came out , prominent ugandans aware of how the bill came to be were crediting the same americans for helping with and inspiring the legislation .
one priest we spoke with said members of the ugandan parliament present at the march conference left the meetings saying they needed to draft a new law to deal with the homosexual ity issue .
we learned it was not just the three american activists who had a front - row seat to what was happening in uganda .
remember " c " street ?
a swanky town house in washington , d.c. , run by a secretive religious group called the fellowship or the family .
lots of conservative members of congress from both parties are believed to be members of the family .
but they 're pretty secretive .
the family mostly operates off the radar .
the one thing they do that everybody knows about is they run the national prayer breakfast every year in washington .
other than that , they pretty much keep things as quiet as they can .
that group , that american religious group it turns out has ties to the specific ugandan legislator who introduced the anti-homosexuality bill .
the man who introduced the kill the gays bill in uganda is a member of the family , yes ? >> yes .
a young member of parliament , david bahadi , rising star who has been over to the united states for our national prayer breakfast and has taken something of an organizing role in the ugandan national prayer breakfast and has been involved in the family for some time .
>> so the legislator in uganda who introduced the kill the gays bill had ties to the group and american anti-gay evangelical activists actively lobbying legislators in the country they needed to get tough on homosexuality in their society .
both of them , " c " street and the activists swore they had nothing to do with the kill the gays bill .
the bill in uganda died after a wave of international outrage and condemnation .
that 2009 bill was put on the shelf .
it did not go away entirely .
at the end of last year in december the parliament in uganda quietly took up the bill again .
a revised version of the bill that does n't include the sentence of death for being gay this time but does include lots of the other prison sentences that attracted so much international outrage years earlier .
the ugandan parliament passed this bill in december and then earlier today , earlier this afternoon , you uganda 's president signed the bill into law , calls for lifetime imprisonment for the crime of -- for being in a same - sex marriage , zempb years in prison for attempting to commit homosexuality .
this bill at various times over the last few years has appeared to be dead but today it officially became the law of the land in uganda .
upon signing the bill , you gouganda 's president announced homosexual behavior was learned and could be unlearned which is after all something ugandan legislators have been told for years .
five years in fact .
exactly .
hold on .
there 's more .
MALAYSIA ’S SODOMY LAWS : PROGRESS WITH THE TIMES !
By Dr Kua Kia Soong , Director of SUARAM , 12 Dec 2009
Ever since the political trial against Anwar Ibrahim for sodomy in 1999 , I had been hoping that the gay community in Malaysia ( “ the pink brigade ” ) would have spoken out against our antiquated sodomy laws and fought for equality of treatment for all consensual sex between adults .
I have always believed that the rights of any section of our community must be fought for and led by that particular section , for only then can the exploited and those transgressed against be empowered in the process .
All over the world , not just in the West , the times are certainly changing .
On 2 July 2009 , the Delhi High Court delivered a historic judgement to amend a 149 - year - old colonial - era law and forthwith decriminalised private consensual sex between adults of the same sex .
India became the 127th country to take the guilt out of homosexuality .
Only rape and paedophilia remain offences under the law .
Inclusiveness
The Delhi bench invoked Jawaharlal Nehru 's politically resonant theme of inclusiveness : `` If there is one constitutional tenet that can be said to be ( the ) underlying theme of the Indian Constitution , it is that of inclusiveness …
`` Those perceived by the majority as `deviants ' or `different ' are not on that score excluded or ostracized . ''
( The Times of India , 3 July 2009 ) Equality The Delhi High Court further ruled : ``Indian constitutional law does not permit the statutory criminal law to be held captive by the popular misconceptions of who the LGBTs ( lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgenders ) are .
It can not be forgotten that discrimination is the antithesis of equality and that it is the recognition of equality which will foster the dignity of every inpidual …
`` There is almost unanimous medical and psychiatric opinion that homosexuality is not a disease or a disorder and is just another expression of human sexuality . ''
Article 8 of the Malaysian Federal Constitution guarantees the equality of all persons .
If this is not specific enough , the Malaysian Charter on Human Rights by Malaysian Civil Society in 1994 spells this out more specifically : “ There shall be no discrimination in the rights and privileges of persons based on their ethnic origin , class , social status , age , sex , mental and physical being , language , religious belief , sexual identity or political conviction … ” ( Article 8 : 2 ) Recently , Judge Jonathan Heher of the Johannesburg High Court struck down South Africa 's sodomy law on the grounds that it violated the nation 's new constitution which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation :
“ To penalize a gay or lesbian person for the expression of his or her sexuality can only be defended from a standpoint which depends on the baneful influences of religious intolerance , ignorance , superstition , bigotry , fear of what is different from or alien to everyday experience and the millstone of history . "
Just a few months earlier Ecuador 's Supreme Court ruled that nation 's sodomy law unconstitutional .
And Romania 's new prime minister recently promised to repeal his nation 's sodomy law to bring it in line with that of the European Union .
Pragmatism
Even closer to our shores , the attitude of our southern neighbour , Singapore , to homosexuality is also changing .
In April 2007 , Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said in a Reuter ’s report : " If in fact it is true , and I have asked doctors this , that you are genetically born a homosexual -- because that 's the nature of the genetic random transmission of genes -- you can't help it .
So why should we criminalize it ?
… Let 's not go around like moral police ... barging into people 's [ bed ] rooms .
That 's not our business …
So you have to take a practical , pragmatic approach to what I see is an inevitable force of time and circumstances . "
Lee said Singapore should no longer discriminate against homosexuals but must take a pragmatic approach .
Lee 's comments came at a time when many groups , such as The Singapore Law Society , are clamouring for a review of antiquated British colonial laws against homosexual sex , which they view as outdated and archaic .
Lee said Singapore should no longer discriminate against homosexuals but must take a pragmatic approach .

Humanity
The plight of Malaysian transsexuals such as Fathine , is but the latest in a litany of woes suffered by lesbians , gays , bisexuals and transgenders ( LGBT ) in this country .
For a society that claims that our Asian values are far superior to Western values , such demeaning treatment of our LGBT community is unacceptable .
What has happened to that slogan by the BN government to create a “ masyarakat penyayang ” ( a caring society ) ?
Stand Up
For the Rights of all LGBT
On the grounds of inclusiveness , equality , pragmatism and humanity , it is time for all progressive Malaysians , political parties and organisations to stand up for the rights of all LGBT and to call for the abolition of our outdated sodomy laws .

BBC Sharply Criticized after Asking Readers ‘ Should Homosexuals Face Execution ? ’
By Seth Adam , GLAAD 's Vice President of Communications | December 17 , 2009 The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) came under fire yesterday after a question was posted to the news giant ’s website asking readers to “ debate ” the topic , “ Should homosexuals face execution ? ”
The question references proposed anti-gay legislation in Uganda that calls for the execution of gay people who are so - called “ repeat offenders . ”
But British lawmakers are sternly speaking out against the “ debate topic , ” The Associated Press reported on Wednesday .
“ We should be looking at what is going on in Uganda with abhorrence , ” lawmaker Eric Joyce of the ruling Labour Party told The AP .
“ We should be condemning it , and the BBC should be condemning it .
...
Instead it seems to have thought it appropriate to come up with something that suggests it ’s a subject for discussion . ”
The BBC , however , defended its query on Wednesday : “ We agree that it is a stark and challenging question , but think that it accurately focuses on and illustrates the real issue at stake , ” said the BBC ’s World Service Africa program editor , David Stead .
The Associated Press also noted that the title of the online topic was changed to read , “ Should Uganda Debate Gay Execution ? ” but the article still goes on to ask readers the more offensive question , “ Should homosexuals face execution ? ” Early Thursday afternoon , the BBC published another statement further clarifying their line of reasoning :
The original headline on our website was , in hindsight , too stark .
We apologise for any offence it caused .
But it 's important that this does not detract from what is a crucial debate for Africans and the international community .
The programme was a legitimate and responsible attempt to support a challenging discussion about proposed legislation that advocates the death penalty for those who undertake certain homosexual activities in Uganda - an important issue where the BBC can provide a platform for debate that otherwise would not exist across the continent and beyond .
GLAAD was alerted to the BBC ’s so - called “ online debate ” late Wednesday and quickly contacted a BBC news editor and asked that the question be removed from the BBC website .
That editor has yet to respond to our request .
GLAAD urges you to contact the BBC and tell the broadcaster that defending the lives of gay people is not a matter of debate , but instead a matter of moral obligation .
Take action and sign a petition that will be sent to BBC executives here .
GLAAD will continue to insist that the BBC remove this deeply offensive question from its website .

Statutes of 2011 , chapter 721 ( SB 651 Leno )
The various California Codes ( reflecting laws currently in effect ) can be accessed through the California Law section of the California Legislative Counsel 's website .
This act eliminates the common residence requirement from the list of criteria to establish a domestic partnership .
This act provides that a person under the age of 18 who otherwise meets the requirements for a domestic partnership can establish a domestic partnership with a court order granting permission .
A certified copy of the court order will be filed with the Secretary of State .
This act also requires the Secretary of State to file and maintain a confidential domestic partnership , and authorizes the Secretary of State to charge a reasonable fee to offset costs connected to maintaining confidentiality .
Furthermore , this act authorizes a judgment for dissolution , nullity , or legal separation of a marriage between persons of the same sex to be entered if the marriage was entered in California and neither party to the marriage currently resides in a jurisdiction that will dissolve the marriage .

Protesters call for marriage equality Mon , Aug 15 , 2011 , 01:00
By Pamela Newenham | www.irishtimes.com/
SUPPORTERS OF civil partnership equality have accused the Government of contributing to bullying in schools by not giving the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community equal rights to everyone else .
Thousands of people took to the streets of Dublin yesterday to demand civil marriage equality .
Holding banners with slogans such as “ marriage is magic ” , “ I want for my sister what I have for myself – equality ” , and “ 73 % support gay marriage ” , an estimated 4,000 people marched to the Department of Justice on St Stephen ’s Green where a rally was held .
Organiser Max Krzyzanowski urged the Government to listen to the repeated calls highlighting the inequalities of civil partnership legislation and demonstrate its commitment to equality for all by lifting the ban on same - sex marriage .
He maintained the Civil Partnership Act , 2011 , had only served to cement inequality in Irish society by explicitly excluding LGBT people from the institution of marriage .
His fellow LGBT Noise organiser Anna MacCarthy said the Government was out of step with the public mood on the issue of marriage equality .
“ We need Fine Gael to catch up with public opinion , ” she said .
If someone enters a civil partnership with a child , their partner is not entitled to legally act as a step - parent , she said , adding “ the non-biological parent is a legal stranger to the child ” .
Addressing the crowd , Bobby Edgar , chairman of the anti-homophobic bullying group the Butterfly Project , said he hid himself away at school for fear of bullies .
“ I felt if I let bullies know I was different , I ’d be targeted , ” he said , adding : “ I may not have been bullied at school but I ’m being bullied now – by the Government – depriving me of marriage equality .
“ Our Government is adding to the bullying in schools by saying the LGBT community is n’t equal to everyone else , ” he said .
Among those calling on the Government to lift the ban on same - sex marriages were presidential candidate Mary Davis , Senator Katherine Zappone and singer Brian Kennedy .
“ This is a human rights issue , ” said Kennedy .
“ I thought the Civil Partnership Bill was the final destination .
I misunderstood it completely , ” he said .
“ There are 150 anomalies between civil partnership and civil marriage ; this is the first rung on the ladder , but there are many rungs still to climb until we reach equality . ”
Speaking after the rally , Kennedy said he was very disappointed Senator David Norris had withdrawn from the presidential race , and that he would not rule out running himself .
“ Someone asked me at a gig last night if I ’d consider running , and I would consider it .
“ I think President Kennedy has a nice ring to it , ” he added .
Megan Murphy and James Watson , who travelled from Portarlington , Co Laois , for the rally , said they believed it was important that equal rights be given not just in marriage but in general .
Their sentiment was echoed by Will St Leger , who said : “ Irrespective of gays , lesbians etc , I believe all humans should be treated equally . ”

11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month 1918 .
In remembrance of all those that died in the Great War .
Some thought provoking facts and towards the end , a role call for some of those nations that took part in what was the most brutal and unforgiving conflict ever .
The UK only has 3 surviving WW1 vets
Over the last three years I ’ve had the opportunity to work on several PHP projects , some of them having grown rapidly and required to scale quickly .
Three in particular have been a fantastic learning experience for me .
Now I do n’t consider myself a total expert , but I thought I would share my experiences .
Many PHP developers are self - taught , like I was , and are learning PHP to be able to create dynamic websites .
Many have n’t had studied or learned best practices for Object - Oriented Programming ( OOP ) .
They are web designers first , and programming in PHP is just a way to do things simple HTML ca n’t do .
Because most PHP applications rely heavily on the ability to read and store information in a database , many times designing how you interact with that database is critical .
The reason being is if you design something , but do n’t foresee a requirement or necessity , it can be extremely time consuming to go back and change .
These “ oversights ” can be costly in time , money , and resources .
I ’ve thought of some of the biggest oversights I ’ve had when working with PHP and MySQL and put them in a list .
This is my personal list , and I ’m sure some people can think of some other oversights that belong on the list as well .
This list is just for PHP & MySQL , not PHP and any database .
I know many people like using software like Doctrine to allow switching between different database types .
That is beyond the scope of this article .
Many of the examples in this article are very simple and are designed for showing techniques of better programming , not for actual use .
Straight copy and paste most likely will not create sound , robust solutions .
Search the web for a solid MySQL PHP Class to handle these issues for you , or you can make your own .
Now that I ’ve thrown out my disclaimers and thoughts , lets venture on to by list :
Oversight # 1 – No Data Access Layer
Oversight # 2 – Design for Only One Database Connection
Oversight # 3 – No Developer Logging
Oversight # 4 – Queries Written In Procedural Processes
Oversight # 5 – No Separation of Reads & Writes
Oversight # 1 – No Data Access Layer
I first heard the term Data Access Layer was when I was reading about ASP .
NET .
Basically a Data Access Layer ( DAL ) is a layer of code that you access data through .
Sounds simple right ?
Many new php developers do n’t have any type of DAL .
Here is an example of not having a Data Access Layer :
[ php ]
[ / php ]
Now , that was n’t so bad , was it ?
Lots of developers just use the mysql commands .
I have several projects I worked on my early days with PHP that fall victim to this oversight .
One in particular now has grown out of hand so bad that we ’ve decided to start from scratch for a whole new version .
Why ?
Lets say you have 3000 + php files , and your boss says “ Hrm , we ’re seeing some problems with performance .
Can you display at the bottom of each page the # of queries you use on that page ? ”
If you coded your entire project like the example above , you would be totally screwed .
You would have to find each and every mysql_query ( ) and add some counter at the end .
It would be a managing Nightmare .
So how cold you solve this problem ?
[ php ]
connection = mysql_connect ( $ host , $user , $ pass ) ;
return true ;
}
// Run a query against the database .
The key here is to make sure
// every query command goes through this function
public function Query ( $sql )
{
// Execute Query & Get Result Resource
$ result = mysql_query ( $sql ) ;
// Increment Query Counter
$ this ->query_count + + ;
// Return the result
return $ result ;
}
// Function to take an SQL query , execute it , and return all
// the rows in an assoc. array .
public function FetchArray ( $sql )
{
// Execute the Query and get the Result
$ result = $ this -> query ( $sql ) ;
// Create Empty Array to Store all the rows
$ array = array ( ) ;
// Loop through each row
while ( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result ) )
{
//
Add the row to the array
$ array [ ] = $row ;
}
// Return the array containing all the rows
return $ array ;
}
}
$ dal = new MySqlDAL ( ‘ localhost ’ , ’mysql_user ’ , ’mysql_pass ’ ) ;
$ user_list = $ dal -> FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM users ” ) ;
// Display Table of Users …
// ..
?>
[ / php ]
First of all , you ’ve satisfied the boss ’s wish of keeping a counter for the total # of queries .
The trick is to have all queries go through the function “ Query ( $sql ) . ”
This will ensure the counter stays current .
You can also add code to catch errors , display error messages , log queries , etc .
Having a class to wrap around your database connection , queries , etc. can make your life easier , and more simple .
Oversight # 2 – Design for Only One Database Connection
I have a project that I ’ve taken over right now that is suffering from being programmed into handling only one database connection .
“ But why would you ever need to connect to more than one database ? ”
Well , I like to have a database for important information : invoices , users , payments , etc .
Stuff that is updated every day & information that the end user manipulates .
Then I like to have another database for logging statistical information : user log-ins , page hits , visitor counts .
The problem I ’ve ran into lately is I want to have hourly backups for my important information , but only daily backups for simple statistical information .
It would be much easier if they were separated in different databases , but many times they are in the same .
I do n’t want to take the extra time and space to backup the statistical information .
Many people who run into this problem use a Singleton class to handle their Data Access Layer .
A singleton class is a class that can only have one instance at a time in execution .
This can be suer easy and quick to use in your code , but may lock you into a situation where your code only handles a single database connection :
[ php ]
[ / php ]
Now your boss comes in and asks you to connect to another database to get a list of customers .
You think “ uh oh , I ca n’t really do that with my design , now can I ? ”
The solution I like to use is having Database Connection classes , and then a Database Connection Manager .
Imagine I have the MySqlDAL class from the previous example in oversight # 1 .
I would create singleton class called MySqlManager .
It ’s job would be to handle the creation & management of all it ’s classes .
Here is an example :
[ php ]
connections = array ( ) ;
}
public static function GetInstance ( )
{
//
If the instance is null , make one
if (! self : :$ instance )
{
self : : $ instance = new MySqlManager ( ) ;
}
return self : :$ instance ;
}
// Connect to a new database ;
public static function CreateConnection ( $ host , $user , $ pass , $ name = ‘ default ’ )
{
$ manager = self : : GetInstance ( ) ;
$ manager -> connections [ $name ] = new MySqlDAL ( $ host , $user , $ pass ) ;
return $ manager ->connections [ $name ] ;
}
public static function GetConnection ( $ name = ‘ default ’ )
{
$ manager = self : : GetInstance ( ) ;
if ( isset ( $manager ->connections [ $name ] ) )
{
return $ manager ->connections [ $name ] ;
}
else
{
// handle connection not found error …
}
}
}
// Now you can create a connection , and if you do n’t give it a name , it will be defaulted for you
$ dal = MySqlManager : : CreateConnection (‘ localhost ’ , ’mysql_user ’ , ’mysql_pass ’ , ‘ customer ’ ) ;
$ customer_dal = MySqlManager :: CreateConnection(‘mysql.another-location.com ’ , ’ another_user ’ , ’another_pass ’ ) ;
// ..
// later in your code , maybe even in a class or function you could get the connection by name :
// get default connection
$ dal = MySqlManager : : GetConnection ( ) ;
// Get customer database connection
$ customer_dal = MySqlManager :: GetConnection (‘ customer ’ ) ;
$users = $ dal -> FetchArray ( ‘ SELECT * FROM users ’ ) ;
$ customers = $ customer_dal -> FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM customers ” ) ;
// ..
?>
[ / php ]
Now you have a MySQL Connection Manager class that can handle the creation , management , and disconnection of your SQL connections .
Your boss will be happy to hear you can connect to another database with easy !
Oversight # 3 – No Developer Logging
There are many times where I wish I could what was going on behind the scenes .
It is very easy to add Query Logging to your Data Access Layer if you choose .
I wo n’t give an example how to do so , but there are some several very important parts to it .
First , you need to be able to enable & disable query logging .
Second , you should log whether it was successful or not .
Also , if you play around with PHP ’s back tracing abilities you can trace where each query was made .
I ’ll make a blog post about this another day .
Oversight # 4 – Queries Written In Procedural Processes
I absolutely * loathe * when I get into a situation where queries are being written all over the place .
If there is one constant in any software development , it is that things will always change .
When queries are being placed in procedural code , it makes management of database changes a total hassle .
“ But what about find and replace ? ”
That can help you find places where you need to change , but you still can miss other places in your code , which can lead to bugs , headaches , and self - combustion .
Here is an example :
[ php ]
FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM user_links WHERE user_id = 1 ORDER BY number ” ) ;
// Display them on links page …
// .. another page
// Get user links
$ links = $ dal -> FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM user_links ORDER BY number ” ) ;
// Display them on profile page …
// .. another page
// Get user links
$ links = $ dal -> FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM user_links ORDER BY number ” ) ;
// Display them on about me page …
?>
[ / php ]
Not seeing the big issue here ?
Lets say you copy and paste that line of code ‘ $ links = $ dal - > FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM user_links ORDER BY id ” ) ; ’ on twenty different pages .
Then your boss comes and says “ Hey , you know how the user_links table has a title ?
Well every where we display the title , I ’d like to have it show which # of link it is , so example : Link # 1 – My Blog , Link # 2 – My Facebook . , Oh , and can we order them by date_added ?
Thanks ! ”
Have fun trying to find every place that query is executed .
Do n’t be surprised when only 80 % of the queries get changed , and the other 20 % become bug tickets with your boss wondering why you did n’t find them before .
This is an example of writing queries all over the place when you need them , instead of organizing them and abstracting them by Classes and Functions .
Here is an example of abstracting the query :
[ php ]
FetchArray ( “ SELECT * FROM user_videos WHERE user_id = ‘ $ this ->id’ ORDER BY date_added ” ) ;
$ new_video_list = array ( ) ;
foreach ( $ videos as $ video )
{
$ video [ ‘ caption ’ ] = “ Link # ” .$video[ ‘ number ’ ] .’ – ‘.$video[ ‘ caption ’ ] ;
$ new_video_list [ ] = $ video ;
}
return $ new_video_list ;
}
// ..
}
$ user = new User ( 1 ) ;
$ user_videos = $ user -> GetVideos ( ) ;
// ..
?>
[ / php ]
Now your boss will give you a raise when you can make changes this quickly .
While this example may seem simple , there are many times where I ’ve had projects that queries have required major changes and re-writes .
Bugs quickly service if queries that are the same , or similar , are copied and re-copied all over the place .
This leads to a giant mess very quickly .
So remove queries from the procedural flow of things by abstracting them in classes and functions .
Oversight # 5 – No Separation of Reads & Writes
This oversight has stung me for the first time just a few weeks ago .
A project of mine had reached critical mass with its size , and out grew its beefy MySQL dedicated server .
I started investigating doing a Master - Slave replication system , but every article said I needed to route SELECT statements to the slave servers , and just about every else to the Master ( like Insert , Update , Delete , etc ) .
This project did n’t have any Data Access Layer at all , and 2 + years of development on it .
There is no way I could go back and re-write all the queries on budget and timeline , especially without causing bugs .
especially if Insert / Update / Delete commands on accidently got routed to a slave server .
My suggestion is funneling all queries into two functions , Select ( ) and Execute ( ) .
Then , when you create a MySqlDAL instance , it would actually have a $ this -> master_connection ; and $ this->slave_connection ;
It would n’t connection on creation , but on the first instance a query was executed .
This is done to release stress on the Master server , the whole purpose of Master - Slave replication setups .
Here is a mock class that would handle this :
[ php ]
slave_connection )
{
$ this ->ConnectSlave ( ) ;
}
// .. Increment Slave Counter ..
return $ this -> Query ( $sql , $ this ->slave_connection ) ;
}
public function Execute ( $sql )
{
if (!$ this ->master_connection )
{
$ this ->ConnectMaster ( ) ;
}
// .. Increment Master Counter ..
return $ this -> Query ( $sql , $ this ->master_connection ) ;
}
// ..
}
?>

Conclusion
Hopefully these insights into oversights with PHP and MySQL can help someone out there tackle there next project , big or small .

One in seven Americans under age 65 went without prescribed medicines in 2007 as drug costs spiraled upward in the United States , a nonprofit research group said on Thursday .
That figure is up substantially since 2003 , when one in 10 people under 65 went without a prescription drug because they could n’t afford it , according to the Center for Studying Health System Change in Washington , D.C .
The current figure may be even higher because of the recent economic downturn , said Laurie E. Felland , a senior health researcher at the center and lead author of the study .
“ Our findings are particularly troublesome given the increased reliance on prescription drugs to treat chronic conditions , ” she added .
“ People who go without their prescriptions experience worsening health and complications . ”
A soldier fires a laser - based version of a light anti-armour weapon during an exercise in Canada ( Image : Ben Curtis / PA Archive / PA )
It ’s the stuff of science fiction : robots that can hunt down and kill humans , powerful lasers that can destroy targets without leaving a trace , and a weapon that can supposedly knock you down without even touching you – all of these , and more , came one step closer to reality in 2008 .
The developers of these technologies say that they will help to ensure that modern warfare is as efficient and humane as possible .
Their critics say the weapons are just the latest in a long line of lethal inventions that have increased man ’s brutality to man – successors to the Maxim automatic machine gun , the flame thrower , and mustard gas .
Whichever view you take , they introduce new ethical and practical questions .
In this review , we have gathered the 10 most important stories that New Scientist published on this subject this year , so you can make up your own mind .

Airborne Laser lets rip on first target
Laser dogfights in the sky may not be such a long way off , after a megawatt laser weapon was fired from an aircraft for the first time .
The plan is to target “ rogue ” missiles – but it could also be used against other planes or targets on the ground .
US boasts of laser weapon ’s ‘ plausible deniability ’
The US military is developing a “ long - range blowtorch ” that could allow it to incinerate targets silently , invisibly , and without leaving any trace – allowing its users to deny involvement .
Pentagon wants laser attack warnings for satellites
Are spy satellites being “ blinded ” by ground - based lasers ?
No -one knows for sure , but the Pentagon wants to develop sensors that could detect such attacks .
US considers nuclear - powered assault ships
The Bush administration is pressing ahead with a plan – first revealed here – to make assault ships nuclear so they will not have to pull into hostile ports for fuel .
But putting nuclear reactors into craft that will be in the line of fire is crazy , say critics .
Anti-landmine campaigners turn sights on war robots
Should robots be allowed to make their own decisions about killing people ?
No , says a major pressure group , which thinks that autonomous offensive weapons should be banned under treaties like those against landmines and cluster weapons .
Packs of robots will hunt down uncooperative humans
Another item on the Pentagon ’s wish list is a “ multi- robot pursuit system ” that will let packs of robots search for and detect a non-cooperative human – a vision that prompted one of the most spirited comment threads of the year .
‘ Pre-crime ’ detector shows promise
Technology developed to monitor soldiers ’ vital signs on the battlefield is being reworked to detect people who might be harbouring hostile thoughts .
But will it really help to prevent terrorist attacks , or is it just “ security theatre ” that invades travellers ’ privacy ?
Planned cluster bomb hunts targets down
A smart weapon being developed by the US would feature bomblets that could pursue targets for kilometres – but how good will they be at telling friend from foe ?
Flickering light could replace rubber bullets
US security forces are backing the development of a new breed of non-lethal weapon that will knock you flat with flickering light .
But will it work ?
And how should it be used if it does ?
Fifty years of DARPA : Hits , misses and ones to watch
And finally … it pioneered the internet and driverless cars , but DARPA ’s spectacular successes have been matched by some equally spectacular failures during the course of its 50 - year history .

NEW DELHI , India ( CNN ) --
The Indian navy captured 23 piracy suspects who tried to take over a merchant vessel in the Gulf of Aden , between the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula , Indian officials said .
Piracy suspects raise their hands in surrender as an Indian navy boat approaches .
In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects , the Indian navy seized two small boats and " a substantial cache of arms and equipment , " the military said in a statement .
Among the seized items were seven AK - 47 automatic rifles , three other automatic weapons and 13 loaded magazines ; a rocket - propelled grenade launcher along with rockets , cartridges and grenades ; up to three outboard motors and a global positioning system receiver .
Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have increased this year , with armed men staging increasingly bold attacks on ever - larger targets .
This year , pirates have attacked nearly 100 vessels off Somalia 's coast and hijacked nearly 40 , the International Maritime Bureau said .

The Indian warship Mysore , which carried out Saturday 's operation , is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden , the release said .
The Mysore received a distress call Saturday morning from the MV Gibe , a merchant vessel sailing under an Ethiopian flag .
The Gibe reported that two boats were firing small arms at it .
The merchant ship , which was 13 nautical miles from the Mysore , fired back with small arms onboard the vessel .
The Mysore changed course toward the Gibe and launched an armed helicopter , the Indian military said .
Upon seeing the helicopter and the Mysore closing in , the attackers broke off and tried to flee , the release said .
The warship caught up to the boats , the larger of which was described as a 24 - to 30 - foot dhow , a traditional Arab sailboat .
The dhow , identified as bearing the name Salahaddin , was towing a smaller skiff .
Indian sailors boarded the Salahaddin , the military said , and the 23 suspects surrendered peacefully .
The suspects , weapons , ammunition and equipment will be handed over to authorities , and the Mysore will return to patrol duties , India said .
Last month , the Indian navy said it had sunk a pirate " mother vessel " in the Gulf of Aden .
The ship 's owner said the sunken vessel was a Thai trawler that was being seized by pirates when an Indian warship fired on it .
Sixteen crew members were aboard the ship , said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat , owner of the Ekawat Nava 5 .
Two have been accounted for .
One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden , and one is confirmed dead , the ship 's owner said .
Indian authorities insisted that their ship , the frigate INS Tabar , had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack it .
" We fired in self - defense and in response to firing upon our vessel , " Commodore Nirad Sinha , a navy spokesman , told CNN .
" It was a pirate vessel in the international waters , and its stance was aggressive . "
He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition .
All sorts of vessels -- freight and cargo ships , cruise liners and private yachts -- have been attacked in the waters off Somalia .
In many hijackings , pirates take the crew and passengers hostage and demand a ransom .
Just this month , Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden , Yemen 's official news agency SABA reported .
A day earlier , the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack .
The United States is reportedly circulating a proposal in the U.N. Security Council that would allow military forces to enter Somali territory in " hot pursuit " of pirates .
The Pentagon said Friday , however , that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia .

India does not want its control of the Kashmir Valley questioned Kashmir , said Barack Obama just a few days before his presidential election victory , is " obviously a potential tar pit diplomatically " .
Few could argue with that .
Those outsiders who have sought to broker a deal in Kashmir , one of the world 's longest running conflicts , have got themselves into a fix .
They have not solved the dispute ; they have managed to embroil themselves in some very sour diplomatic rows .
For six decades , the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has defied attempts at resolution .
One of the United Nations ' oldest military contingents is stationed there - it has also been one of the most ineffective .
Just suggesting outside mediation is usually enough to provoke an angry response from the Indian government .
Bill Clinton role ?
Yet in that same interview with Time magazine , Mr Obama held open the prospect that his administration would get involved in sorting out Kashmir and might even send a high profile envoy .
I think there is a moment where potentially we could get [ Indian and Pakistani ] attention .
It wo n't be easy but it 's important
Barack Obama
One of the " critical tasks " for his administration , Barack Obama told Time 's experienced political commentator Joe Klein , was working with Pakistan and India " in a serious way " to try to resolve the Kashmir crisis .
He spoke of the need " to devote serious diplomatic resources to get a special envoy in there , to figure out a plausible approach , and essentially make the argument to the Indians : you guys are on the brink of being an economic superpower , why do you want to keep messing with this ?
" To make the argument to the Pakistanis : look at India and what they are doing , why do you want to keep on being bogged down with this particularly at a time where the biggest threat now is coming from the Afghan border ?
" I think there is a moment where potentially we could get their attention .
It wo n't be easy but it 's important . "
Joe Klein then put it to Barack Obama that it sounded like a job for former President Bill Clinton .
" Might not be bad , " responded Senator Obama .
" I actually talked to Bill ... about this when we had lunch in Harlem . "
It was hardly a roadmap for Kashmir , but nor was it just a stray remark .
Amid the clamour of the closing days of the presidential election campaign , the remarks did not get a lot of attention in the US media .
But they were noticed and analysed across South Asia .
Kashmiri separatists were pleased , the Pakistan establishment did not seem to know what to make of it and the Indian authorities were distinctly annoyed .
There is no linkage between Kashmir and the terror India has been facing emanating from Pakistan
Congress Party spokesman India controls the Kashmir Valley and believes it has largely vanquished the armed separatist groups , many of which have had links to Pakistan .
A US special envoy could be seen as throwing into question the Indian claim to Kashmir , and encouraging Kashmiris to campaign against Indian rule .
Ever since a peace accord with Pakistan back in 1972 , India has insisted that the future of Kashmir is a bilateral matter .
Its message to the rest of the world 's diplomats could be summarised as : " Keep away from Kashmir , it 's none of your business . "
Straws in the wind
The received wisdom in India was that either Barack Obama was naive in his remarks on Kashmir or he would be pulled back by the seasoned South Asia experts in Washington .
The Mumbai attacks in late November and then the broadly successful completion of state elections in Indian - administered Kashmir , were seen as strengthening India 's stand .
Indeed the veteran American journalist and foreign affairs expert Selig Harrison declared this month that President - elect Obama had " made his first big foreign - policy mistake " even before taking office .
The supposed mistake : pledging US intervention in the Kashmir dispute .
" By questioning Indian control of the Kashmir Valley , " wrote Harrison in the Washington Times , " the United States would strengthen jihadi forces in both Islamabad and Srinagar , the capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir .
More importantly , it would undermine improving US - India relations . "
But there have been some straws in the wind to suggest that the new administration will be more active over Kashmir .
Susan Rice , one of Mr Obama 's closest foreign policy advisers , made reference to Kashmir last week during Congressional hearings for her nomination as the new US ambassador to the United Nations .
She commended the role of the UN in responding to threats to international peace and security - " from the Balkans to East Timor , from Liberia to Kashmir , from Cyprus to the Golan Heights " .
That sent another shudder through the Indian external affairs ministry .
David Miliband 's words on Kashmir touched a nerve in India Also last week , an article by Britain 's Foreign Secretary David Miliband - published in the Guardian newspaper while he was on a visit to India - again turned the focus on the Kashmir conflict .
" Resolution of the dispute over Kashmir would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms and allow Pakistani authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders , " Mr Miliband wrote .
He did not suggest an international envoy .
Nevertheless , the Indian establishment fired a sustained volley of criticism at their ministerial visitor .
" There is no linkage between Kashmir and the terror India has been facing emanating from Pakistan , " said a spokesman for India 's governing Congress party .
" The bureaucracy in the British foreign office should have educated him a little bit on the facts . "
A leading figure in the main opposition BJP was even more forthright .
" In recent years , there has been no bigger disaster than the visit of David Miliband , " declared Arun Jaitley .
A British minister , of course , can hardly be said to reflect the views of the Obama administration .
But the remarks will be seen as indicating a new line of thinking in Western capitals .
As the world seeks to get the measure of the new man in the White House , South Asia 's politicians and diplomats are wondering whether there may now be a determined attempt by outside powers to promote a settlement of the Kashmir crisis .

President Obama spoke at the White House this hour on jobs , energy independence , and climate change .
More specifically , the news out of Obama 's appearance included an announcement that sets in motion a chain of events that would let California and some other states tighten their auto emissions standards .
We used this post to live - blog as it happens .
Click your " refresh " button to see our latest updates .
Update at 1:30 p.m. ET .
USA TODAY 's David Jackson leads his story about the president 's actions this way :
President Obama reversed more Bush administration policies Monday , endorsing state efforts to restrict tailpipe emissions and ordering higher fuel - efficiency standards .
These are " the first steps " toward " energy independence , " Obama said during a ceremony in the East Room at the White House .
Update at 10:44 a.m. ET :
The president is now signing a series of executive orders to implement the changes he wants made .
Update at 10:43 a.m. ET .
" Will not be held hostage " :
" We have made our choice , " Obama says .
" America will not be held hostage to dwindling resources , hostile regimes and a warming planet .
...
Now is the time to make tough choices . "
Update at 10:41 a.m. ET .
Emissions :
Obama confirms that he has ordered an immediate review of " the California request " to tighten auto emissions standards .
Update at 10:40 a.m. ET .
Fuel efficiency :
" We must ensure that the fuel efficient cars of tomorrow are built right here , " says the president .
" We will start by implementing new standards for model year 2011 .
...
This rule will be a down payment on a broader and sustained effort to reduce or dependence on foreign oil . "
Update at 10:37 a.m. ET .
Energy independence :
" Year after year , decade after decade , we 've chosen delay over decisive action , " Obama says .
" Now , America has arrived at a crossroads .
... Embedded in the American soil , wind and sun ... we have the capacity to change .
" It will be the policy of my administration to reverse our dependence on foreign oil . "
Update at 10:34 a.m. ET :
The president begins by noting the announcements in recent days of large job cuts at Microsoft , Intel , United Airlines , Home Depot and other major corporations .
He says " we owe it " to each of the laid - off workers , " and to every single American to act with urgency and with common purpose . "
Update at 10:32 a.m. ET : Reporters just got a " two - minute warning . "
A lost masterpiece hidden away in the attic of a French chateau for 200 years because its owners thought it was too racy , could fetch up to £ 900,000 when it is auctioned tomorrow .
The painting of a voluptuous and partly - clad young woman is by Giambattista Tiepolo , one of the most brilliant and sought - after Italian painters of his time .
Earlier this year , the grandchildren of the original owners brought it down from the dust and gloom to see the light of day for the first time since the 19th century .
The 35in by 27.5 in oil - entitled Portrait Of A Lady As Flora ( the classical Goddess of Spring ) - is estimated to make £ 700,000 to £ 900,000 at Christie 's Important Old Masters evening sale .
Richard Knight , international director of Christie 's Old Master Department , described it as ' one of the most exciting and extraordinary discoveries of recent years ' .
He confirmed it had been found in the the attic of a French chateau ' where it had been hidden by the grandparents of the present owners due to the semi- naked subject ' .
He added : ' The painting has lain untouched in the same private collection for over 200 years , and as a result it remains breathtakingly similar to the way it would have been immediately after it left the artist 's easel .
' Private collectors are attracted to rare , rediscovered paintings offered in untouched condition . '
The painting of the enigmatic , fleshy young woman , left breast provocatively exposed , is previously unpublished and is probably from a series of pictures commissioned some time just before 1760 by Empress Elizabeth of Russia ( 1709 - 1762 ) .
It has never before been seen in public and had remained in the family chateau of the present owners since ' at least ' the 19th century .
The painting is undated but thought to be undertaken in the 1750s and there is considerable debate about the identity of the model .
One theory is that she is a gondolier 's daughter called Christina .
According to art historians , Tiepolo valued her so highly as a model that when he and his family moved to Spain in 1762 , he brought Christina too so he could keep painting the woman who was ' beautiful with a haughty look ' .
Another theory is that the model is Tiepolo 's wife , Cecilia Guardi , sister of the painter Francesco Guardi .
Giambattista ( or Giovanni Battista ) Tiepolo was born in Venice in 1696 and was at his peak in the 1750s and 60s .
He was called to Madrid to paint for Charles III of Spain and spent the last eight years of his life there , dying in 1770 .
He is said to have inspired Goya .
ANN ARBOR , Mich .--- Aren't you ashamed of yourself ?
All these years , you 've been trying to build up your child 's self - esteem , and now a growing body of research suggests you may be making a big mistake .
A study published in the December issue of Child Development finds that early adolescents with high self - esteem are more likely to react aggressively when they feel ashamed than their peers with lower levels of self - esteem .
" Young teens with low self - esteem apparently do n't feel the need to protect their punctured egos , " said University of Michigan psychologist Brad J. Bushman , a co-author of the study with colleagues from VU University and Utrecht University in The Netherlands .
For the study , Bushman , Sander Thomaes , and colleagues conducted an experiment with 163 children ages 10 to 13 , from Michigan middle schools .
Almost all were white , and slightly more than half ( 54 percent ) were males .
A few weeks before participating in the on - line experiments , the young people filled out a questionnaire designed to assess their levels of self - esteem and narcissism .
The researchers measured self - esteem by assessing the degree to which participants were satisfied with themselves and the way they led their lives .
Sample statements included , " Some kids like the kind of person they are , " and " Some kids are not very happy with the way they do a lot of things . "
They were asked if they were like that .
Narcissism included grandiose views of themselves , inflated feelings of superiority and entitlement , and exploitative interpersonal attitudes , assessed by questions such as , " Without me , our class would be much less fun ; " " Kids like me deserve something extra ; " and " I often succeed in getting admiration . "
For the experiment , children were told they would be competing on an Internet reaction - time game called FastKid !
against an opponent of the same sex and age from a school in Columbus , Ohio ( where the Buckeyes live ! ) .
In reality , there was no opponent ; the computer controlled all events .
Those who were randomly selected for the " shame condition " were told that their opponent was one of the worst players in the supposed tournament , and they should easily win ; when they lost , their last - place ranking was displayed on a website they believed that everyone could see .
Children were told they could blast their opponent with a loud noise after winning a trial .
The narcissistic kids were more aggressive than others , but only after they had been shamed .
" Narcissists seem highly motivated to create and maintain a grandiose view of self , " the researchers wrote .
" They tend to interpret social situations in terms of how they reflect on the self , and they engage in self - regulatory strategies to protect self - esteem when they need to .
As shameful situations constitute a threat to grandiosity , narcissistic shame - induced aggression can likely be viewed as defensive effort to maintain self - worth . "
The researchers found no support for the traditional view that low self - esteem underlies aggression .
In fact , they found that high self - esteem increased narcissistic shame - induced aggression .
" It could be that narcissistic kids with high self - esteem are more vulnerable to shameful events than are kids with low self - esteem , " said Bushman .
" Or , they may differ in the way they deal with those events . "
The implications for parents and teachers :
Do n't shame a child who has a high opinion of himself .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
Three senior Islamist militants escaped from their cells in clashes overnight at a police station in Iraq ’s western city of Ramadi , which killed at least seven police and seven militants , officials said .

Prisoners being held at the al - Fursan facility overpowered a policeman who entered a cell early on Friday , stealing the man ’s weapon and killing him , said Major - General Tareq Yusuf , police commander for Anbar province .
Six other police officers , including a lieutenant colonel and a captain , were killed in subsequent clashes and six were wounded , Yusuf said .
Seven of the militants inside the police prison were killed in the fighting , he said .
Police imposed a curfew and searched homes the following morning in Ramadi , a largely peaceful city 100 km ( 60 miles ) west of Baghdad , Yusuf said .
An Interior Ministry official , who requested anonymity , put the death toll among police at 10 and said that Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Ghaini al - Dulaimi , who heads the station , died .
Both Yusuf , also known as Tareq al - Dulaimi , and the ministry official said three leaders of the al Qaeda - linked Sunni Islamist group Islamic State in Iraq escaped in the fighting .
The Interior Ministry official said that 23 out of a total of 40 detainees initially escaped but were later recaptured .
Anbar province , a vast desert area bordering Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia , was once the heart of Iraq ’s Sunni insurgency .
But it became far quieter after local Sunni Arabs began supporting U.S. efforts against al Qaeda and other militants in late 2006 .
The United States handed security control of Anbar to the Iraqi government in September , but U.S. Marines are still stationed in the province .
Yusuf said that police were going house to house with photos of the escaped inmates on Friday morning .
He pledged the militants would be captured .
“ The people of this city will help us bring them back to justice , ” he said .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Dow Chemical Co. DOW , - 1.91 % will not suspend or reduce its dividend despite the troubled economic environment , said Chairman and Chief Executive Andrew Liveris during a Monday conference call with analysts .
" Dow is the only company in the Fortune 200 to have paid its regular quarterly cash dividend without reduction or interruption since 1912 , " Liveris said .
" I have said it before , but I want to say it again :
We will not break that streak . "
Earlier , the Midland , Mich. , company said it would lay off 11 % of its global workforce , idle 180 plants and close 20 facilities in " high - cost locations . "
Further , the company intends to reduce its contractor workforce by about 6,000 .
Shares of Dow were up 3 % in premarket trading to $ 19.59 .

The U.S. government long ago announced its intention to “ fight the net ” .
As revealed by an official Pentagon report signed by Rumsfeld called “ Information Operations Roadmap ” :
The roadmap [ contains an ] acknowledgement that information put out as part of the military ’s psychological operations , or Psyops , is finding its way onto the computer and television screens of ordinary Americans .
“ Information intended for foreign audiences , including public diplomacy and Psyops , is increasingly consumed by our domestic audience , ” it reads .
“ Psyops messages will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences , including the American public , ” it goes on .***
“ Strategy should be based on the premise that the Department [ of Defense ] will ‘ fight the net ’ as it would an enemy weapons system ” .
Indeed , the Pentagon publicly announced years ago that it was considering using “ black propaganda ” – in other words , knowing lies .
( Article continues below )
CENTCOM announced in 2008 that a team of employees would be “ [ engaging ] bloggers who are posting inaccurate or untrue information , as well as bloggers who are posting incomplete information . ”
The Air Force is now also engaging bloggers .
Indeed , an Air Force spokesman said :
“ We obviously have many more concerns regarding cyberspace than a typical Social Media user , ” Capt .
Faggard says .
“ I am concerned with how insurgents or potential enemies can use Social Media to their advantage .
It ’s our role to provide a clear and accurate , completely truthful and transparent picture for any audience . ”
In other words , the government is targeting “ social media “ , including popular user - ranked news sites .
In addition , when you look at what the Israeli lobby has done with Megaphone software to automatically vote stories questioning Israel down and to send pro-Israel letters to politicians and media ( see this , this , this and this ) , you can start to see how the U.S. military – an even larger and better - funded organization – could substantially influence voting on social news sites with very little effort .
Moreover , the military has outsourced many projects to private contractors .
For example , in Iraq , much of the fighting has been outsourced to Blackwater .
And governmental intelligence functions have largely been outsourced to private companies .
It is therefore not impossible that the government is hiring cheap labor to downvote stories on the social media sites which question the government , and to postpro-government comments .
Finally , under the post - 9/11 “ homeland security ” laws , the government almost certainl routinely demands full access to ISPs and websites .
In other words , we ’ve all seen polls at Digg , Reddit , YouTube , and mainstream news sites suddenly disappear entirely if a sufficiently pro-government sentiment was not expressed .
Do you doubt that the military and homeland security apparatus would step in to take control of what it considered an “ enemy ” message ?
And remember , the government considers any message questioning anything the government does as an enemy message .
See this , this , this and this .

The recent turn of events in Japan has shown us the true , devastating and debilitating power of mother nature .
Nature has now bestowed on us a threat that is man made – nuclear fallout .
Maybe nature is teaching us to understand and value it more , while ensuring that we appreciate that man and his inventions can just as easily be turned against him .
If we look at the kanji as used by Soke , we can see a “ connection ” to the recent events here in Japan .
Soke truly has the “ mind and eyes of god . ”
Soke has always mentioned to us that we must prepare to battle the “ invisible ” .
We have come to now experience both the invisible force of nature and the potential spread of “ invisible ” nuclear fallout .
This is the last of the 5 weapons as told by Soke .
Soke also mentions that what are not considered weapons can be used against you at any time .
We all are concerned about Nuclear reactors , but I think most people concern themselves with nuclear missiles built for the purpose of war .
We now face a threat from something believed to be established for the betterment of human life .
There is always a reverse side .
I`d like to add a post by Doug Wilson
Recently , Soke has been talking about the evolution of war and how the proper study of Budo requires being in touch with the current times and how we must adapt this to our training .
Recently , there have been several discussions between myself and Soke individually , as well as in public translation to the class regarding this aspect .
Other martial arts schools often do not take this larger view and remain focused on teaching form , which does not allow for the freedom to observe and perceive the possible dangers allowing the human innate sixth sense to operate naturally .
Soke reminded us of Miyamoto Musashi ’s “ Book of Five Rings ” and how the 5 rings refer to the five elements of Chi , Sui , Ka , Fu and Ku .
Soke ’s inspirational message is that although this refers to an attitude or feeling that a true Budoka must look at the reality of this and how it applies to war or fighting .
We must look at the five elements as the evolution of war , and in that essentially the evolution of weaponry .
True Budoka must look at the ultimate potential and must incorporate the use of weapons into training on a regular basis .
This goes beyond what one might consider a typical weapon as well .
Often the greatest surprise can come from something not commonly considered a weapon to be used as such .
A mindset aware of this possibility is what Soke often is teaching .
A mindset that anything is possible and therefore one should not be caught up in preconceived ideas or assumptions .
( self )
In most cases , real fighting will evolve a weapon .
The intention can also be perceived as different as using a weapon most likely incorporates the intention of killing or at least causing direct physical harm .
This mindset is not an intention of submission or winning , it is an element of life or death and universally different .
The five stages ( elements ) of weapon evolution in Soke ’s example are : Ken
Tachi
Jyu ( Gun )
Katana
Nuclear Weapon Looking at each one of these we can see the evolution of attack as well as the associated defense and distances involved .
Although distance can be subjective , the basic idea is present .
In understanding the evolution of weapons we must also understand the evolution of the attack and focus our training according to the present possibility as well as maintain a connection to the past in order to have a complete and full understanding .
Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu training should always be looking at the incorporation and use of weapons in the training and the various distances , aspects and possibilities associated .
Particularly the training of a 15th Dan should clearly incorporate this idea and be understood , and if not a regular teaching this aspect , should be pursing this in one ’s personal training .
However , it should not be forgotten that it is the sign of lack of skill if one was to injure someone in training .
We must never become 無自 覚( lack of awareness ) but remain 無心 ( nothingness of mind ) .
Each inspiration will have a unique impact on each person in their own training , I ’m inspired to further seek to find applications in life outside of fighting .
We first should seek to live and then in the unfortunate event that one must fight to survive , we must fight .
I would like us to look at the Kihon Happou – the Bujinkan theme of the year .
In light of recent events and potential changes resulting from man made and natural forces , we can possibly read further and understand more deeply the meaning and importance of the Kihon Happou .
If Kihon Happou is the base of the martial arts , it can be described as the base of maintaining and destroying life .
We can see the truth of nature in the Kihon Happou .
We can see the power and it`s limitless variations .
” The body moves through space in a continuous series of living kamae .
Now like a stream , now a deep broad river , now a flood … ”
The more we train , the more we reveal the secrets to the truth and gain deeper and real understanding .
It is with nintai and bufu ikkan that we can eventually come to see and understand with the body , mind and spirit , the kihon of the martial arts .
Takamatsu sensei said that the kihon happou is the root to all budo .
Study and practise is one and the same .
I don`t differentiate the two .
Each movement , step , has the potential for the enlightenment we seek .
We therefore must be mindful to practise with the correct heart – Bushi no kokoro .
We can see that “ life ” is the greatest dojo .
The dojo helps us to become awakened to life and it`s dangers .
This is one aspect of the 5th dan test .
From there , we are told to grasp this feeling and live everyday with “ bufu Ikkan ” while developing Fudoushin .
Fudoushin is crucial for us as martial artists to develop .
If we cannot control ourselves , we can not help others in times of danger .
The day before the earthquake , my son wanted to ride the “ express train ” to Tokyo .
When we were walking down the steps of the station , I stopped .
I felt a need to reconsider .
My son was persistent , and so we continued .
Half way , I looked up from my newspaper and had the same feeling .
At the next stop we got off and returned home .
There was no earthquake that day , yet it was the same time I had the “ feeling ” on the train that the earthquake hit the day after .
As the heart of budo is found within the study of the kihon , we must try to develop ourselves .
Develop our base well to allow for buds to grow and sprout to reveal the miracles of following the laws of nature .
As we learn and experience one way , that way will eventually have to make way for a new way or wave of inspiration .
Just as the seasons change , so too does the training and evolution of ones study and practise .
Budo is coming to understand the very essence of living / life .
We are studying the laws of nature .
the study of the Kihon is to understand the way of nature and life and death .
The kihon is the beginning of understanding martial arts practise .
It is also the end point of the training .
It is the discovery of the point between life and death .
Just like the natural cycle of life and death .
The numeral 8 is often turned to signify the idiom “ infinite ” .
Not only does the kihon signify the study of unlimited and never ending possibilities , it teaches us that the life is but a cycle of constant change and eventual reincarnation .
We can see the idiom as representing the whirlpool spiraling to signify the source of the earthquake epicentre .
Kihon is the very source of life and death .
We are learning to accept the universal scheme and how to live within it`s realm ( kukan ) harmoniously ( bushi no wa ) .
We try to harness natures gifts , but sometimes nature uses them against us .
We must search for that space to live , the space beyond life and death .
This is Bushido : knowing the fragility of everything and living in the truth of the moment .
I have decided to have my family come with me to France and Ireland next week .
It is my feeling that we should move from the recent area and observe from a safe distance .
Soke has often said that budo is about “ distance ” .
In light of the possible threat that lingers over Japan , I wish my family to have a distance giving us the ability to make descisions from a safe angle and with enough time .
The theme of my Bushinden Kai will be the Kihon Happou .
We will train in light of recent events and a manner to encourage maturity through our taijutsu training .
I look forward to seeing everyone soon .
Stay well .
Bufu Ikkan
I`m sure the next piece by Soke on the Kihon Happou will be absorbed in a different light if considering the recent events here in Japan .
“ Kihon Happou ”
by Soke Masaaki Hatsumi ”
I have trained myself and instructed others in Kihon Happo and felt that those who have had previous training in Karate , Judo , Aikido , Kung Fu , and other fighting techniques tend to stay with those forms and have trouble learning Budo Taijutsu from a “ blank slate . ”
The fighting forms stay with the student even though he starts the training of Budo Taijutsu .
When do the previous learned techniques disappear ?
I think it is up to a person ’s individual talent .
The phenomenon is just like a dialect disappearing after one lives in a different part of the country .
No matter how hard one tries , he will never be a professional announcer if he speaks in dialect .
The same can be said for Budo .
I also studied various martial arts such as Judo , Karate , Aikido , old - style Budo , and Chinese Budo .
In other words , until I encountered Takamatsu Sensei , I was a Budoka ( martial artist ) with many dialects .
One day I began to wonder why and when did I lose those ” dialects ? ”
I realized that it was after I lost all my muscle tone after five years of illness .
Discovery of your own dialect is one way of improving Budo .
When one reaches a certain degree of skill , he comes up against the “ wall , ” something he has trouble overcoming .
This is the so - called dialect of Taijutsu .
I want to write about how to train yourself when you reach a higher rank during Budo training .
I would like to use a Cat Competition as an example .
I have had lots of experience in the competition because my wife served as judge of the World Cat Club and I was also vice chairman of the club .
Suppose five top cats are chosen out of hundreds of cats .
All of them are wonderful and beautiful , but that alone can not be judged .
With no other way to judge which cat is more beautiful then another , the judges start to look for faults .
The one with the most faults drops to fifth , the next , fourth , then third , and so on .
The one with the least faults becomes Grand Champion .
Bugei is the same way .
If one reaches to a higher rank , he need only eliminate his faults .
It may sound easy , but eliminating faults is very difficult to accomplish , because we tend to think we are faultless .
Faults can be translated into something different in Budo .
They can be suki ( unguarded points ) , or carelessness , presumption , arrogance , etc. they all become our fault .
No fault , zero condition is the best .
I am zero .
I joke that the Soke has no Dan .
Zero , no fault that is the target of Bufu Ikkan ( living through the martial winds ) . ”
Meeting the new couple next door can be an anxious business for even the most relaxed home owner .
Will they be international drug traffickers ?
Have they got noisy kids with a penchant for electronic music ?
As worries go , however , having the US president move in next door must come fairly low on the list .
Unless of course you are a resident of northern Paraguay and believe reports in the South American press that he has bought up a 100,000 acre ( 40,500 hectare ) ranch in your neck of the woods .
The rumours , as yet unconfirmed but which began with the state - run Cuban news agency Prensa Latina , have triggered an outpouring of conspiracy theories , with speculation rife about what President Bush 's supposed interest in the " chaco " , a semi-arid lowland in the Paraguay 's north , might be .
Some have speculated that he might be trying to wrestle control of the Guarani Aquifer , one of the largest underground water reserves , from the Paraguayans .
Rumours of Mr Bush 's supposed forays into South American real estate surfaced during a recent 10 - day visit to the country by his daughter Jenna Bush .
Little is known about her trip to Paraguay , although officially she travelled with the UN children 's agency Unicef to visit social projects .
Photographers from the Paraguayan newspaper ABC Color tracked her down to one restaurant in Paraguay 's capital Asunción , where she was seen flanked by 10 security guards , and was also reported to have met Paraguay 's president , Nicanor Duarte , and the US ambassador to Paraguay , James Cason .
Reports in sections of the Paraguayan media suggested she was sent on a family " mission " to tie up the land purchase in the " chaco " .
Erasmo Rodríguez Acosta , the governor of the Alto Paraguay region where Mr Bush 's new acquisition supposedly lies , told one Paraguayan news agency there were indications that Mr Bush had bought land in Paso de Patria , near the border with Brazil and Bolivia .
He was , however , unable to prove this , he added .
Last week the Paraguayan news group Neike suggested that Ms Bush was in Paraguay to " visit the land acquired by her father - relatively close to the Brazilian Pantanal [ wetlands ] and the Bolivian gas reserves " .
The US presence in Paraguay has been under scrutiny since May 2005 when the country 's Congress agreed to allow 400 American marines to operate there for 18 months in exchange for financial aid .
At the time many viewed the arrival of troops as a sign that Washington was trying to monitor US business interests in neighbouring Bolivia , after the election of Evo Morales , a leftwing leader who promised to nationalise his country 's natural gas industry .
After his wife became ill , Steve Whyte took a sample of the ice cream to be independently tested .
A report from the National Measurement Institute found the sample " has an offensive odour and physical properties similar to human excreta ... and to contain fragments of a variety of plant matter typical of excreta " .
The tracts will be sold at auction on Dec. 19 , the last lease sale before President Bush leaves office a month later .
The new leases were added after a map of the proposed tracts was given to the National Park Service for comment this fall .
The proximity of industrial activity concerns park managers , who worry about the impact on the air , water and wildlife within the park , as well as the potential for noise , said Michael D. Snyder , a regional director of the Park Service who is based in Denver .
The Park Service is usually given one to three months to comment on leases , Mr. Snyder added .
“ This is the first time , ” he said , “ where we have not had sufficient opportunity to comment . ”
He said he had asked the Bureau of Land Management ’s state director , Selma Sierra , to pull the new tracts from the December auction for more study .
She refused .
Kent Hoffman , a deputy director of the land management bureau ’s Utah office , said the Park Service had ample opportunity to review the broad management plan under which the leases were developed , even if it was not given the usual notice of which leases were being offered for sale .
Mr. Hoffman added that 37 days remained to air any protests and review the decision about which tracts to lease .
If any leases are sold Dec. 19 and subsequently delivered to the buyers before Inauguration Day , however , it will be difficult for the new administration to reverse those decisions .

- U.S. President - elect Barack Obama , with his silence on 's attacks in , has confirmed Arab expectations that foreign policy changes will come small and slow when he moves into the White House next month .
On the fourth day of Israeli air strikes which have killed more than 380 people in , the U.S. President - elect has yet to take a position , though he spoke out after militants ' attacks in Mumbai and has made detailed statements on theeconomy .
" He wants to be cautious and I think he will remain cautious because the Arab - Israeli conflict is not one of his priorities , " said Hassan Nafaa , an Egyptian political scientist and secretary - general of the Arab Thought Forum in " Obama 's position is very precarious .
The Jewish lobby warned against his election , so he has chosen to remain silent ( on ) , " added Hilal Khashan , a professor of political science at theof " If Obama continues to remain silent . . .his silence will be seen and will have the operational effect of providing an endorsement for 's war on , " said Paul Woodward of Conflicts Forum , an organization aimed at changing Western policy toward Islamist movements such as Hamas .

Bush , who invadedand gave strong support toBut his choice of a foreign policy team , especially Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State and Rahm Emanuel as chief of staff , have raised doubts that much will change .
Mustapha el - Sayed of University said : " I am really pessimistic ... because when I see the kind of people who surround President - elect Obama I find they are the best friends ofwho do not dare to distance themselves from the positions of the Israeli government . "
" Silence sounds like complicity , " Mark Perry , the Washington Director of the Conflicts Forum group , told Al Jazeera .
" Obama has said thathas the right to defend itself from rocket attacks but my question to him is ' does he believe that Palestinians also have the right of self - defense ?'. . .
And Obama repeatedly spoke out in support forduring his election campaign , describing the country as one of the ' greatest allies and has vowed to ensure its security . -

Meanwhile they have been organizing support for Israeli high school students who have been imprisoned for refusing to serve in an army that occupies the
I ’ll start with the bottom line :
The moderate and sane Arab world is expecting an Israeli blow against Hamas ’ leadership , including its organizational infrastructure and resources .
In the face of what ’s been happening recently , there is quiet and anxious expectation for “ Israel to respond already , ” because the Arabs are uneasy about seeing Hamas creating a balance of terror vis -à - vis Israel .
One of the main arguments of Hamas heads vis-à - vis Yasser Arafat was that as Palestinian Authority president he failed in creating such balance of terror .
The angry Arafat prided himself in the 1990s on “ Barghouti ’s Tanzim , ” a militant group comprising thousands of gunmen who “ objected ” to peace with Israel ; thereby , Arafat could claim that simultaneously to the peace process , the PA is also leading some resistance .
Yet the truth is that Arafat was appreciated and admired because he did not threaten Israel with a deterring balance of terror .
Hamas , just like Hizbullah – another ostracized and criticized Islamic group – was talking about a whole different kind of balance of terror .
Back in those days already , it was preparing a network of bombers and recruited legions of suicide terrorists with the aim of hurting Israel as much as is possible .
“ Once we take power , ” Hamas leaders said at the time , ” we shall teach the Zionist enemy all about a balance of terror . ”
They said they would do it , and they did .
There are those who mistakenly interpreted Hamas ’ willingness to agree to the latest lull as the interest of a boxer seeking to avoid a knockout blow by taking a break .
“ People in the know ” claimed that Hamas was on the brink of collapse and that the lull saved it from disaster , no less .
Yet now it turns out that the aspiration for a lull was a well planed tactical phase in creating a system of deterrence vis -à - vis our leaders in Jerusalem .
Overall , every move undertaken by Hamas , ranging from fundraising abroad to deploying its forces on the frontlines vis-à - vis Israel , must not be received with simplistic and disparaging interpretations .
When one hears the declarations made by Hamas spokespersons , and when one sees the order among its ranks , as opposed to the chaos that prevailed among Arafat ’s people , it would be good to address what goes on in Gaza with a little more seriousness .
The penny dropped for decision - makers in Jerusalem recently , yet it appears it has not dropped completely yet .
Suddenly , our leaders are concerned about the price paid by Israel in the wake of the lull with Hamas ; a price that manifests itself through huge quantities of smuggled weapons meant to be used against Israel ’s southern cities at the moment of truth .
So why has n’t the penny dropped completely yet ?
Because Hamas expected Israel to punish the group for its actions militarily , rather than by using civilian means – a type of response that lacks real meaning in the Strip .
Our reluctance to violate the lull despite the Qassam rocket attacks is being perceived by Hamas as an inability to target its leaders as we did in the past .
Image of weakness
Hamas interprets Israel ’s conduct as grave weakness by those who sacrifice strategic principles in exchange for short - term relative quiet – therefore , Hamas is celebrating its victory .
Sources in the Strip dismiss the frequent border crossing closures in response to lull violations by opposition elements .
They do n’t get overly excited by it , and look who they sent to respond to it in the media … the official in charge of electricity supply .
The equation is clear : Israel is battling “ peaceful ” residents and fighting generators and supermarkets .
In Hamas ’ view , Israel is scared to confront the group ’s leaders .
Hamas is rubbing its hands with glee :
In the dilemma between enabling the group ’s threatening military buildup in exchange for short - term relative quiet and the daily Qassam attacks and disruption of life in Sderot and the Gaza region , Israel chose the first option , just like Hamas hoped it would .
Hamas conducts itself like a government that does not fear an IDF invasion .
If in the past this was only done for domestic purposes , recently the movement has been conveying outwardly as well the achievement of creating a balance of terror vis -à - vis Israel .
Some will say this is n’t true , and that Israel still deters Hamas .
However , the bombing of the Syrian reactor and the assassination of Imad Mugniyah and other terror figures , which have been attributed to Israel by the international media , have not prompted Hamas to engage in any second thoughts .
On the contrary , Hamas believes that it , along with Hizbullah , serves as the only Arab bridgehead threatening Israel ’s existence .
The common perception among Arab commentators is that Israel has ceased to be the “ threatening Israel . ”
Observers are trying to figure out who advises Israel ’s leaders to adopt the kind of moves we see in Gaza .
Arab observers are likening Israel to a giant whose arms are tied behind its back , while it idly watches the “ tunnel youth ” flooding the Strip with bombs that can target Israeli communities far away from Gaza .
Venomous contempt is directed at Israeli and Egyptian negotiators , who instead of creating deterrence vis-à - vis Hamas capitulate in the face of its demands time and again , in order to secure yet another day of quiet .
Israel ’s leaders are portrayed as men in dresses ( a hint to the costume used by Defense Minister Barak during an Israeli operation in Beirut in the 1970s , ) a harsh image of weakness accompanied by idle threats .
Between the lines , we can understand that the sane Arab world objects to Hamas ’ conduct , even if quietly .
If there is a sort of consensus in the Arab world regarding who should not be “ ruling the territories , ” the answer is Hamas .
Therefore , the repeated question is : How long will Israel show restraint ?
How far would Israel let Hamas go ?
That is , when will Israel announce its intention to deliver a powerful blow against Hamas leaders and its organizational infrastructure ?
Observers in Amman , Cairo , Rabat , and Riyadh will not be sorry to see it happening .
President Obama has left no doubt that he will make a sharp break with the policies of his predecessor , President George W. Bush .
But after just one day in office , it is clear that Mr. Obama ’s break will be one of style , as well as substance .
An air of informality surrounds the Obama White House that might leave Bush advisers aghast .
On Wednesday morning , Mr. Obama was seen in the Oval Office without a suit jacket – a definite no -no in the Bush administration .
Even more striking was the new president ’s demeanor as he signed executive orders Thursday to shut down the prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba and to reverse other Bush anti-terror policies .
In the Bush White House , presidential appearances were short and to the point .
When the president was done speaking , junior aides would call out “ Thank you ! ” – a signal to reporters and photographers that it was time to leave the room .
On Thursday , Obama aides did the same .
“ Thank you ! ” one called , after the president signed the first executive order .
But a reporter shouted , “ No , there ’s another one ! ” Mr. Obama chimed in .
“ There are three of these , ’’ he said .
Then , instead of reading from a script , as Mr. Bush might have done , the new president winged it , offering off - the - top - of - his head explanations for each of his actions before putting down his signature .
Several times , he double - checked his facts with his White House counsel , Gregory B. Craig .
“ Is that correct , Greg ? ’’ Mr. Obama asked .
All the while , the television cameras rolled .

A California architect has constructed a home that heats itself from the warmth of its appliances .
Homes like this have been popular in Germany , where a local architect built the first of its kind in 1991 , but they are only just starting to catch on here in the States .
[ Creative Commons photo by KeWynn Lee ]
Nabih Tahan ’s “ Passive House ” on Grant Street in Berkeley is the first one in California .
It uses a ventilator to recycle the heat that radiates from the appliances , reducing the use of heat from fossil fuels by 80%-90 % .
Passive House Design
In order to utilize ambient heat from appliances , the house needs to be incredibly well insulated .
It ’s essentially air tight , allowing the ventilation system to trap the heat and distribute it throughout the home .
Passive homes have specific design requirements , such as “ superinsulation ” and superwindows .
It would be extremely expensive to retrofit a house as a passive house , making it more suited to new construction or a home that is undergoing a massive renovation .
Even with the energy savings , it would take a long time to break even on the investment with a retrofit .
The architect behind the passive house in Berkeley said :
By doing smaller insulating renovations , you can improve energy consumption and you ’ll definitely make a difference .
But to get to Passive House standards , you really have to either rip out the outside or the inside of the house .
Improving Your Own Home ’s Energy Usage
Homeowners can still take some lessons from passive house construction , even if they ca n’t afford a huge renovation .
According to the US Department of Energy , over 1/3 of Americans ’ energy bills goes towards heating their homes .
Something as simple as sealing cracks around doors and windows can make a big difference in the amount of electricity or gas you ’re using to keep your home warm .
Many power companies provide cheap or even free home energy audits to help determine where you need additional sealing and insulation .
There are a number of inexpensive things you can do to improve your home ’s efficiency .
Sustainablog has some great tips on making your home more energy efficient , or you can read a bit more on energy audits over at Green Building Elements .

日本の Erlang な人たちで，ヨーロッパで行われた Erlang Conference の発表をいくつか紹介したら面白いかなと思ったので，やってみます．手始めということで，
Erlang eXchange で行われた JoeArmstrong さんのキーノートスピーチを紹介します ．Joe Armstrong , " Erlang Keynote : Armstrong on Software : Erlang & SMP , " Erlang eXchange 2008 , June , 2008.このスピーチでは ，Erlang が注目されている理由を簡潔に紹介しています．ややひいき目な感じもしますが，現在のコンピュータ環境で
Erlang が選ばれる理由は十分に説明されていると思います．では，内容をかいつまんで紹介します．発表者の
Joe さんは ，Erlang の生みの親であり，『プログラミン グ Erlang』の著者でもあります．この本には，" Softwre for ConcurrentWorld " というサブタイトルが付けられています．このことからもわかるように，Joe さんは並行性 ( concurrency ) を重要な特徴と考えているようです
．Erlang とマルチコアプロセッサが同じ時期に注目され始めたのは，偶然ではありません．Joe さんの言葉を借りると， 「 プロセッサのコアが増えるにつれ，並行プログラムは速くなるが，逐次的なプログラムは
( 相対的に ) 遅くなる」ためです．理想的には，Erlang を使うと，コアが N あれば N倍速くなります．障害耐性 ( fault tolerance ) においても，並行性など の
Erlang の特徴が有利に働きます．障害耐性を確保するためには，複数のコンピュータからなる分散システムであることが必要です．これらを，message passing による並行プログラムで動作させます．信頼性を高めるには，コンピュータは多いほどよいです．ということは，スケーラブルでなければなりません．結局のところ，障害耐性，分散，並行性，スケーラビリティは切り離せない問題です．Erlang にはこれらが備わっています．並行プログラムには，大きく二つのアプローチがあります．ひとつは，プロセス間に共有メモリを用意する方法です．しかし，あるプロセスが誤ったデータを書き込むと，他のプロセスがクラッシュするかもしれません．また，共有メモリの配置や伝送遅延，lock の問題もあります．データの共有をやめて message passing を採用することで，これらの問題を解決できます ．MapReduce もそうですし，なにより人間は messagepassing でコミュニケーションしています．副作用のない関数型言語こそ，このパラダイムの実現に適しています．もちろん，Erlang は関数型言語です．最後に，コード例や，マルチコアプロセッサでの性能グラフが紹介されています．また，テレコムを中心とした利用例も示されています．
DESPITE the serious nature of their offences , psychopathic criminals get let out of prison sooner than others – in Canada , at least .
Psychopaths tend to be unusually adept at manipulating others , and even the legal system , to their advantage .
“ In prison , they push administrators to gain better food , resources , or to work outside on road crews , ” says Kent Kiehl of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque .
To find out how effective psychopaths are at duping parole boards , Steve Porter of Dalhousie University in Halifax , Nova Scotia , studied records of 310 male inmates from a Canadian prison .
He found that those …

Salesmen and parents know the technique well .
It 's called the takeaway , and as far as Keith Mularski is concerned , it 's the reason he kept his job as administrator of online fraud site DarkMarket .
DarkMarket was what 's known as a " carder " site .
Like an eBay for criminals , it was where identity thieves could buy and sell stolen credit card numbers , online identities and the tools to make fake credit cards .
In late 2006 , Mularski , who had risen through the ranks using the name Master Splynter , had just been made administrator of the site .
Mularski not only had control over the technical data available there , but he had the power to make or break up - and - coming identity thieves by granting them access to the site .
And not everybody was happy with the arrangement .
A hacker named Iceman -- authorities say he was actually San Francisco resident Max Butler -- who ran a competing Web site , was saying that Mularski was n't the Polish spammer he claimed to be .
According to Iceman , Master Splynter was really an agent for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Iceman had some evidence to back up his claim but could n't prove anything conclusively .
At the time , every other administrator on the site was being accused of being a federal agent , and Iceman had credibility problems of his own .
He had just hacked DarkMarket and three other carder forums in an aggressive play at seizing control of the entire black market for stolen credit card information .
That 's when Mularski went for the takeaway .
Salesmen have long used this tactic to seal difficult deals :
You simply take the deal off the table in the hope it will spur the customer to come to you .
Badgered by questions about his credibility , he threatened to quit altogether .
" I decided to risk it all and just said , ' Hey , if you think you can do a better job running the site and if you think I 'm a fed , then by all means take the stuff .
I do n't want anything to do with it , " he recalled recently in an interview .
" What law enforcement agency would , after they were monitoring the site , want to give it back to the bad guys ? "
Mularski's gambit paid off , and the other DarkMarket administrators let him stay on for another two years .
In the end they would regret that decision .
Iceman was right : Supervisory Special Agent J. Keith Mularski had gone deeper into the world of online computer fraud than any FBI agent before .
Working with police agencies in Germany , the U.K. , Turkey and other countries , he spearheaded a remarkable investigation that netted 59 arrests and prevented an estimated US $ 70 million in bank fraud before the FBI pulled the plug on Operation DarkMarket on Oct. 4 , 2008 .
Mularski works for a little - known FBI division called the Cyber Initiative and Resource Fusion Unit , run out of the National Cyber - Forensics & Training Alliance in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
The unit is different from a typical FBI field office .
It works hand in hand with industry and takes the time to do the deep research required to penetrate the world of online criminals .
" They have a direct personal relationship with industry people in all areas , but specifically a great relationship with the financial institutions , " said Gary Warner , director of research in computer forensics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
The group also works closely with international law enforcement , laying the groundwork to prosecute Internet criminals who launch attacks across national borders .
" Those relationships allow them to take on cases that nobody else would take on , " Warner said .
Mularski's life as an undercover spammer began around July of 2005 , when he created his handle Master Splynter in a tribute to the cartoon rat who plays sensei to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .
His unit ran a project called Slam - Spam , and Mularski , a self - confessed computer nerd , said he had picked up a lot of spamming tricks before he started the operation .
" I could talk shop , " he said .
He did n't send out spam himself , but he knew what questions to ask and -- more importantly -- what not to ask .
He kept to his character as a spammer .
If someone approached him with a new " zero day " attack , he would n't ask for details .
And he avoided going after personal information , not asking forum members obvious cop -giveaways such as where did they live .
" The thing is with these guys , you can't necessarily target them and just approach them out of the blue , " he said .
" So by being out there and not really caring about things -- I played a lot of things off nonchalant -- I was able to gain their trust . "
The hours were long ; scammers do n't work 9 to 5 .
" Sometimes I spent as much as 18 hours in a day online , " Mularski said .
" I was online every day from August 2006 until the operation came down . "
His most active discussion time was between 10 o'clock at night and one or two in the morning .
" Every night I 'd be watching TV with my wife next to me and I 'd have the computer on , just in case somebody needed to get a hold of me , " he recalled .
After 10 years of marriage to an FBI agent , Mularski's wife knew that operations could cut into personal time .
It could n't have been easy , though .
" She was the real saint in this whole thing , " he said .
Master Splynter did n't take vacations either , even if Mularski did .
" Usually , if you 're not going to be online , you 've got to give notice because they wonder what you 're doing , whether you got busted or not .
So if I was travelling somewhere and I could n't be online , I 'd always give these guys advance notice . "
By September 2006 , Mularski had become a moderator on DarkMarket .
Not as powerful as an administrator , he was still a trusted manager , one step above the reviewers who assessed the quality of products being sold on the site .
That 's when he got his big break .
And it came from an unlikely source : Iceman himself .
According to authorities , Iceman was making a play to control the market for fake credit cards by hacking into four carder sites , including DarkMarket , knocking them offline and moving their membership to his own site , CardersMarket .
Even when the site was back up and running , Iceman continued to hit DarkMarket with distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attacks , which would overwhelm it with wave after wave of useless Internet traffic .
Mularski was n't sure how things would play out , but in September 2006 he saw his chance .
He started talking with Iceman about joining CardersMarket as a moderator , but soon realized that he the had a better shot with another administrator at DarkMarket , Renu Subramaniam , aka JiLsi .
" I basically told him , ' Hey , I can secure your servers for you , ' " Mularski said .
JiLsi made him a moderator , but held off granting him administrative access .
Then one Saturday night a month later , DarkMarket started getting hammered with another DDoS attack .
" I was talking with JiLsi and I said , ' Hey I can secure the site ?
The servers are all set . ' "
JiLsi's reply : " Let 's move it . "
Mularski was now a made man .
As administrator to the site he could track people who logged in and , most importantly , read everything the cyberthieves were saying to each other .
Working with his international law enforcement contacts , Mularski compiled evidence and , one by one , his team tracked down the crooks who ran DarkMarket .
The first big one to go was Markus Kellerer , a.k.a. Matrix001 .
German authorities picked him up with five other scammers in May 2007 .
A few months later Mularski's patron , JiLsi , was arrested in the U.K. , one of the first targets of a newly created U.K. organization called the Serious Organized Crime Agency .
By September last year the operation had pretty much run its course .
FBI approval for Operation DarkMarket was set to expire on Oct. 5 , and Turkish authorities had finally rounded up Cha0 , ( real name Cagatay Evyapan ) , considered one of the FBI 's top targets .
An electrical engineer who manufactured ATM and point - of - sale skimming devices that could be hooked up to legitimate machines to steal information , Evyapan considered himself a " very traditional , organized criminal , " not just a computer hacker , Mularski said .
He showed his nasty side when an associate named Kier ( news reports have named him as Mert Ortac ) spoke with Turkish media in early 2008 , angering Evyapan .
" He kidnapped him and tortured him and posted a picture of Kier in his underwear that 's now famous , " Mularski said .
The sign read , among other things , " I am rat .
I am pig .
I am reporter .
I am **** ed by Cha0 . "
With Evyapan gone , " We had taken out all the administrators of DarkMarket , and that pretty much left me at the top , " Mularski said .
Still , he remained in character for a few weeks longer .
In September he posted a note saying he was closing the site , in part because of police infiltration .
" It obvious [ sic ] that the Special Services and Security f***s are still here lurking in our ranks .
They continue to gather evidence on us .
They read our posts , they talk with our vendors , they look to see who are the active members of the forum , " he wrote , according to a posting published on Wired.com .
But Mularski always knew that with all the international arrests being made there was a chance , through error or differences in judicial processes , that his name would be made public .
And that 's ultimately what happened .
A German reporter , Kai Laufen , working on a story about cybercrime , discovered Mularski's name in court documents relating to the Kellerer case .
On Oct. 13 Wired reported the story and everybody knew .
Still , some of Mularski's carder buddies refused to believe the reports .
" These guys trusted me so much that even after the Wired article came out exposing me , for two days afterwards people were reaching out to me on ICQ thinking that it was a hoax and making sure I was alright . "
Most were silent , however , after Mularski wrote them back saying that he was indeed an FBI agent .
One hacker who called himself Theunknown swore at Mularski , " You piece of crap fed ... you 're never going to catch me . "
" Why do n't you turn yourself in .
It beats living the rest of your life on the run , " Mularski wrote back .
A week later , Theunknown followed his advice .
I ca n’t remember anyone shouting out dedications before a song on late night TV–nevermind dedications to the host and people in the Gaza Strip–but leave it to Q - Tip to break the mold .
Tip was on Conan O’Brien last night and did a pretty enthusiastic take of " We Fight / We Love " from The Renaissance , and Tip even sang Raphael Saddiq ’s part .
I guess when the song mentions WMDs do n’t have souls , it makes sense to get political in the intro .
Portland was recently chosen as one of five cities where the U.S. Small Business Administration will bring a program this year intended to boost urban businesses that have “ high growth potential . ” 
The program will select certain business owners for 26 weeks of free training on such topics as marketing and financial management .
The goal will be to “ generate new jobs , attract investment , and provide a sustainable economic base ”  for Portland .
This is the classic political approach to economic development : pick a few favored businesses , spend tax dollars on hand - outs , and hope that it creates wealth .
But it never really works .
The people doing the targeting are picking winners ( and therefore losers ) on the basis of political considerations and personal preferences , not estimated returns on investment .
Therefore , the tax dollars they spend for the training will yield few positive results , while making the rest of us worse off .
This is not wealth creation ; it ’s actually wealth destruction .
A much more effective strategy would be just to lower business taxes across the board and repeal regulations that are unrelated to public health or safety .
This would encourage private sector investment and help create a rising tide of opportunity that would lift all boats , not just those chosen by some federal bureaucrats .

Here 's a look at the filming of the classic Doctor Who story " Caves Of Androzani , " where co-star Nicola Bryant is faced with a major acting challenge .
She has to ad - lib saying " Doctor , what 's happening ? " and " Doctor , I 'm frightened ! " and making scared faces for , like , two minutes .
Just in case they need a little extra reaction from Peri , the Doctor 's traveling companion .
This clip ( which is n't on any DVD ) shows just how tough it is to be a classic
Who companion : you do n't just need to be able to freak out , you need freaking endurance .
Click through for another classic scared - companion ad - lib .
This one comes from the filming of " Planet Of Evil , " and is on that story 's DVD .
They 're filming the cliffhanger at the end of episode one , when the anti-matter monster is advancing on the Doctor and Sarah Jane .
Actor Elisabeth Sladen is screaming and hyperventilating her little heart out , and then she thinks the scene is over .
But no .
The director wants her to scream and hyperventilate a bit longer , just in case they need some extra material .
Bear in mind both these scenes were probably recorded at 10 PM with the studio running overtime and everybody having been up since 5 AM and desperate to get to the pub .
The other great bit from the " Caves " behind - the - scenes footage is director Graeme Harper telling Colin Baker that he has to sit up erect when he becomes the new Doctor , and then giggling for aqes about how funny it is that the Doctor is getting erect .

Well , its more like a beta copy of the game in its incomplete stage and has different things in it .
I 'm a crazy collector and also the back of the cd looks pretty cool looking , I should have taken a pic of the back of it .
Supposedly you could only get this if you lived in Japan though , because this is the beta copies they gave out at there convention and they claim they were limited .
But who the hell knows what limited means , for all I could have know they could have given out over 20,000 copies and called it limited .

NEW YORK , Dec 10 ( Reuters ) - Sony Music Entertainment was sued on Wednesday by the U.S. government , which claimed the music company violated federal rules aimed at protecting the online privacy of children .
Sony Music improperly accepted registrations on its music websites from users who were under 13 , without obtaining consent from their parents , according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan .
The civil suit , which seeks unspecified monetary penalties , said Sony Music was in violation of the Children ’s Online Privacy Protection Rule , which is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission .
The case was brought by the U.S. Attorney ’s Office in Manhattan .
The lawsuit said Sony Music ’s notice of its information practices on its website did not clearly or accurately disclose how it collected and used the information .
A Sony Music representative was not immediately available for comment .
Sony Corp 6758 .

The White House fired back at allegations that Bush 's policies led to the mortgage meltdown .
WH on Times : ' Gross negligence '
The White House on Sunday issued a blistering 500 - word response to a scathing 5,000 - word article on the front page of Sunday 's New York Times that says President Bush and his style and philosophy of governing played a direct role in the mortgage meltdown that 's crippling the nation 's economy .
The response accused the nation 's largest Sunday paper of " gross negligence . "

" The Times ' ' reporting ' in this story amounted to finding selected quotes to support a story the reporters fully intended to write from the onset , while disregarding anything that did n't fit their point of view , " White House Press Secretary Dana Perino said in an e-mailed statement .
In an unusual double - header , The White House later issued a document headlined , " Setting the Record Straight : The Three Most Egregious Claims In The New York Times Article On The Housing Crisis . "
The article was part of the newspaper 's " The Reckoning Series " about the nation 's market implosion , and was headlined , " ‘ Ownership society ’ : White House Philosophy Stoked Mortgage Bonfire . "
" Eight years after arriving in Washington vowing to spread the dream of homeownership , Mr. Bush is leaving office , as he himself said recently , ' faced with the prospect of a global meltdown ' with roots in the housing sector he so ardently championed , " says the article by Jo Becker , Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Stephen Labaton .
" There are plenty of culprits , like lenders who peddled easy credit , consumers who took on mortgages they could not afford and Wall Street chieftains who loaded up on mortgage - backed securities without regard to the risk .
But the story of how we got here is partly one of Mr. Bush ’s own making , according to a review of his tenure that included interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials .
From his earliest days in office , Mr. Bush paired his belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone .
...
" Mr. Bush did foresee the danger posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government - sponsored mortgage finance giants .
...
As early as 2006 , top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming .
And when the economy deteriorated , Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn ; as recently as February , for example , Mr. Bush was still calling it a ' rough patch . '
The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis . "
In response , the White House today released the following " Statement by Press Secretary Dana Perino " :
" Most people can accept that a news story recounting recent events will be reliant on ' 20 - 20 hindsight ' .
Today 's front - page New York Times story relies on hindsight with blinders on and one eye closed .
" The Times ' ' reporting ' in this story amounted to finding selected quotes to support a story the reporters fully intended to write from the onset , while disregarding anything that did n't fit their point of view .
To prove the point , when they filed their story , NYT reporters were completely unfamiliar with the president 's prime time address to the nation where he laid out in detail all of the causes of the housing and financial crises .
For example , the president highlighted a factor that economists agree on : that the most significant factor leading to the housing crisis was cheap money flowing into the U.S. from rest of the world , so that there was no natural restraint on flush lenders to push loans on Americans in risky ways .
This flow of funds into the U.S. was unprecedented .
And because it was unprecedented , the conditions it created presented unprecedented questions for policymakers .
" In his address the president also explained in detail the failure of financial institutions to perform normal and necessary due diligence in creating , buying and selling new financial products -- a problem that almost no one saw as it was happening .
" That the NYT ignored such an important economic speech to the American people and the complex causes of the crises is gross negligence .
" The Times story frequently repeats a charge by the Administration 's critics : a ' laissez faire ' attitude toward regulation .
We make no apology for understanding the concept of regulatory balance .
That is , regulation should be stringent enough to protect the greater public good and safety but not overly strong so that it unnecessarily inhibits innovation , creativity and productivity gains that are the sole source of increasing Americans ' standards of living .
But while repeating this charge , the reporters gave glancing attention to the fact that it was this Administration that pushed for strengthened regulation and oversight , greater transparency , and housing reform .
" The story also gives kid glove treatment to Congress .
While the administration was pushing for more transparent lending rules and strengthening oversight and supervision of Fannie and Freddie , Congress for years blocked attempts at stronger regulation and blocked reform of the Federal Housing Administration .
Democratic leaders brazenly encouraged Fannie and Freddie to loosen lending standards and instead encouraged the housing GSEs to play a larger and larger role in the housing market -- even while explicitly acknowledging the rising risks .
And while the story notes the political contributions of some banks to Republicans , it neglects that political contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac overwhelmingly supported Democratic officials — in particular the chairmen of the Banking committees .
In fact , even in the midst of what by then was a housing crisis , it took Congress nearly a full year to pass specific legislation called for by the president in the summer of 2007 , especially legislation to reform oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
" There are many more reporting failures in this story — failure to consider the impact of monetary policy ; ignoring the regional nature of housing markets ; and ignoring the Bush administration 's historic proposal to overhaul the nation 's regulatory system , for example .
But then a review of these issues would wave complicated the reporters ' myopic point of view that only Bush administration policies could possibly be responsible for the housing and finance crises . "
UPDATE -- New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller said through a spokesperson Monday : " The piece that has driven the White House spokesmen to such a show of apoplexy was based on on - the - record interviews with dozens of current and former officials of the current administration .
It is part of an ongoing series that examines in depth the accountability of numerous players in the economic meltdown , including Congress , rating agencies , brokerage houses and the Fed .

Nearly $ 300,000 Wall Street Paycheck Not What It Seems
Oct. 20 , 2006  --
An average compensation of $ 289,644 sounds pretty good for the population not working within a mile of the New York Stock Exchange .
But according to New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi in a new study , that is what the average salary is on Wall Street .
To be clear , that does n't mean that all bankers make this much .
It means that there is a large army of men and a few women who make much less -- and a few very , very wealthy individuals who make an astronomical sum of more .
First , this not the average salary -- it 's the average compensation , which includes a bonus .
Most of the investment banks , asset managers and hedge funds structure their overall compensation on relatively low salaries and bonuses proportioned to the revenue generated by the employee .
For example , if you work on a team that helps one Fortune 500 company merge with another and that acquisition brings in $ 25 million in business for your firm , you can expect your bonus in January to include a small slice of that .
If you manage a portfolio of a billion dollars of someone else 's money , you will likely share a percentage of the profit that you bring to that billion .
" It has been a good year for investment bankers .
There have been a lot of mergers and acquisitions fueled by a rise in equity , " said Andrew Barber , associate editor at Trader magazine .
Trader is a lifestyle magazine geared toward professional traders who Barber says likely bring home much more than the average from the recent study .
When Business Is Good , So Is Competition
According to the report , compensation on Wall Street increased almost 22 percent in 2004 and an additional 11.8 percent in 2005 .
Barber says part of the reason for the increase is that when business is good , competition for top talent gets ferocious .
" Large Wall Street banks have been a magnet for top traders and top investment bankers , " Barber said .
" Places like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have had to work hard to keep their best employees , " he said .
Whether it is marquee investment banks competing against one another for the talent , or hedge funds and asset management firms recruiting the same leaders , executive recruiting firms like the Gerson Group are at times almost tracking indexes of market confidence .
Maureen Brille , managing director of the Gerson Group , helps place some high - priced and high - value talent throughout the investment banking world .
" It 's not about the money most of the time , it is about succeeding and excelling for most [ of ] our clients , " she said .
When the overall compensation can include guaranteed bonuses or equity in a firm that could be in the seven - or eight - figure range for managing director level executives , not too many people are thinking about the $ 300,000 base salary .
While difficult to comprehend for those outside the business , people working in the profession justify their earnings in several ways .
" I 've worked 80 - hour weeks every year since I 've come out of college , and when you think about the fact that I personally generated $ 185 million in revenue last year for my firm , my bonus seems appropriate , " said a vice president level investment banker at a top tier Wall Street firm who asked to remain anonymous .
A Manhattan hedge - fund manager who took home more than $ 2 million last year said that he had generated wealth for his clients , and that none of them had complained about what they had paid him .
" It is n't like I 'm making the money when they 're not .
When we have good years , everyone gets paid , " he said .
Good Times in Cycles
Times are not always this good .
Barber remembers that there have been lean times even in recent memory .
" Being an investment banker in 2001 and 2002 was about as easy a path to riches as being a stock trader in 1931 , " he said , referencing The Great Depression .
Brille also emphasizes that this is as pure a performance industry as there ever has been created .
" You have to produce every year .
You have to be originating , bringing in business .
Maintain long - term knowledge of the transactions , and you have to keep closing deals , " she said .
While Trader magazine may be filled with advertisements for $ 300,000 cars and $ 10 million yachts , the irony is that some of the people who can afford these toys rarely have the time to enjoy them .
" Most of the people have to work tremendously long hours and spend a tremendous portion of their adult lives to reach that level .
Having the time to enjoy them is another matter , " Barber said .
UPDATE : Video clips of the debate on whether Google violates its “ Do n’t be evil ” motto are here .
The transcript and other information is here .
The question of Google ’s evil was in the air around The Times on Thursday .
Just after I pushed the save button on the post that posed the question whether Google violates its “ Do n’t be evil ” motto , I sat in with the Times editorial board ( that is , those who write the unsigned comments on the editorial page ) for a meeting with Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive and also a member of President - elect Barack Obama ’s transition economic advisory board .
Mr. Schmidt talked mainly about policy issues , like Google ’s plan for alternative energy , and his thoughts about privacy .
Unprompted , he brought up Google ’s motto , explaining how the company thinks about the sort of tough questions that come up in its business , like whether to identify people who search for child pornography to law enforcement agencies .
( It does not because it does n’t want to be making judgments about its users . )
“ ‘ Do n’t be evil ’ is an invitation to debate , ” he said .
“ It means we will fight over what it means . ”
Beyond Google ’s endless meetings , the company ’s motto certainly has prompted debate this week .
I wrote my original post based on a formal , Oxford - style debate held in New York on Tuesday .
That debate left the audience tied with 47 percent believing Google violates the dictum and an equal number believing it does not .
And more than 100 Bits readers have added their arguments to the question of whether Google actually meets the evil - free standard it set for itself .
Our readers were also quite divided , both on the morality of Google ’s actions and the reason for their judgment .
Some of those that see evil lurking in the heart of Mountain View object to Google ’s actions to limit search results in China .
Others accused it of sins including bullying , hypocrisy and invasion of privacy .
“ EVIL ! ” declared George Burdell .
“ They are advertising company mining your data and flooding your eyeballs .
Everything else is a trail of candy to get you into the store . ”
Some readers , taking the view that Google should not be condemned , challenged criticism of the company as “ full of holes , ” as Steve put it .
And many praised the virtues of the company ’s services .
“ Try living in a foreign country … .
( Thailand ) …… no libraries , minimum access to publications / books / news .
Google is a savior ! ” wrote John Oles .
Many readers declared Google no different from any corporation in a capitalist economy .
But some found that to be inherently evil ; others did not .
A smaller group saw merit in both arguments .
“ They ’re not evil , but we need to keep an eye on them , ” commented B. Mull .
Dominik Pucek wrote , “ Yes , Google is evil .
But dammit , I like it ! ”
Ultimately , this sort of ambivalence was the combined mood of Bits readers .
Of the first 104 commenters who explicitly answered the question , 27 said Google violates its “ do n’t be evil ” motto and 31 said it does not .
Ideally , a campaign 's website should have a really small footprint to reach the largest number of people by not alienating slow connections with a long load time .
The Obama campaign 's homepage relied heavily on imagery so their website really struggled with having a quick loadtime .
The Obama homepage weighs in at 752 K ( 2 minutes on 56k ) and receives a YSlow grade of F .
However , with the Obama web team being really smart , they were ready to deal with this dilemma .
They made the conscious choice that it was more important for the website to match the campaign image and theme than for it be optimized for slow connections .
However , rather than leave those on slow connections completely in the lurch , the team spent a few more bits and cleverly gave their site background a cool look .
When the site is fully loaded , this image is completely covered .
There is no reason for it to exist , other than to show up while the site is loading .
This strategy allowed the campaign to build their image heavy site while not alienating or discouraging slow connections with a boring , uninspiring blank load screen .
The Obama team also made sure that this image loaded first by placing it at the top of their stylesheet which in turn was loaded early in their html header .
If you know any other simple yet often - overlooked techniques like this , leave them in the comments .
It is always nice to see some Creative Advertisement , such as these for Samsung MP3 Players , that are necessarily presenting the product , but an idea .
These Samsung ads seen at AdsoftheWorld are very creative and fun as well .
What Elvis Presely fan would n’t appreciate an Elvis created earphone to listen to their favorite music .
At the same time , there are also those that would rather listen to Hip Hop , hence , that individual is also hanging from someone ’s ear .
Lastly is the Executive , or the one interested in an Opera …and the little earphone is dressed to impress .
The thing is , I think this would be a great accessory for the earphones we already own .
Just like people hang jewelry from their cellphones , they would also be able to pronounce their individuality with a little creature hanging from their ear when listening to music .
Think about it , kids can have Disney characters , Gamers could have Mortal Kombat Players , and some can have comic book superheros .
Why ca n’t this be ?
Bottom line , ads can also be a cool thing .
Two great example are the Celebrity Font Art we have seen before or even the Cool Post It Notes .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Former U.S. - installed Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has denounced the policies of President George W. Bush as an “ utter failure ” that gave rise to the sectarian venom that ravaged his country .
In an interview published on Saturday in the pan -Arab newspaper Asharq al - Awsat , Allawi found fault with American management of Iraq since the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 as well as the government of present Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
Allawi ruled Iraq for almost a year after U.S. occupation officials handed power to him in 2004 as prime minister of an interim government .
He was selected by a council hand - picked by Washington after the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein .
“ Yes , Bush ’s policies failed utterly , ” said Allawi , describing the U.S. administration that once backed him .
“ Utter failure .
Failure of U.S. domestic and foreign policy , including fighting terrorism and economic policy . ”
“ His insistence on names like ‘ democracy ’ and ‘ open elections ’ , without giving attention to political stability , was a big mistake .
It cast shadows on Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan and Egypt , and I believe this will be remembered in history as President Bush ’s policy , ” he said .
A former member of Saddam ’s Baath Party who fled into exile and agitated against the dictator , Allawi now heads a secular political movement which did poorly in elections in 2005 .
His bloc was part of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki ’s government but walked out last year .
Maliki ’s government was characterized by “ weak performance , erected upon political quotas , major government corruption and infiltrated state agencies , ” he said .
“ Four years passed ... and they ca n’t build the police , army , national institutions . ”
“ Ending Saddam ’s regime was essential , but replacing the Saddam regime with extreme chaos was not right , ” he said .
“ I did not imagine the political process would eat itself from inside or that it would abandon the rule of law and establish political sectarianism . ”
Sectarian violence has dropped sharply in Iraq , but reconciliation and political harmony remain elusive even as the United States prepares to withdraw its 140,000 troops by 2012 .
ST . PAUL , Minn . – A new study shows that people who are smokers and have a family history of brain aneurysm appear to be significantly more likely to suffer a stroke from a brain aneurysm themselves .
The research is published in the December 31 , 2008 , online issue of Neurology® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology and will appear in the January 6 , 2009 , print issue of Neurology ® .
The type of stroke , called subarachnoid hemorrhage , is one of the bleeding types of stroke and is deadly in about 35 to 40 percent of people .
In the study , scientists looked at 339 people who suffered a stroke from a brain aneurysm and 1,016 people who had not had a stroke due to an aneurysm .
Current smokers made up half of the group that had a stroke .
The other half had never smoked or had smoked in the past .
The research found people who smoked and had a family history of stroke were more than six times more likely to suffer a stroke than those who did not smoke and did not have a family history of stroke or brain aneurysm .
The study also found that people with a family history of stroke could cut their risk by more than half by quitting smoking .
The results were the same regardless of high blood pressure , diabetes , alcohol use , body mass index and education level .
" While all people should be advised to quit smoking , our findings suggest that there is an interaction so that if you smoke and you have a family history of aneurysms , you are at an extremely high risk of suffering a stroke from a ruptured brain aneurysm , " says study author Daniel Woo , MD , with the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and member of the American Academy of Neurology .

For those wanting more background on how we came to write this extremely long essay together , please read Nick ’s more extensive introduction here .
GIRL TALK , THE MASHUP DETONATOR
Gregg Gillis , a 26 - year - old college graduate who likes pop music and owns a laptop , became Girl Talk in the first year of the 21st century .
Taking cues from Britney Spears ’ self - positioning circa 2001 — when she was famously “ Not a Girl , Not Yet A Woman ” — Gillis is not a DJ , but not a traditional musician either .
With the aid of computer editing software , he creates danceable sound collages that often incorporate over 15 - 20 audio sources : namely , popular and less popular rock , rap , dance , and electronic songs , no era or genre excluded .
The sources are mostly recognizable , and his songs — Gillis calls them “ songs ” — carry the force of nostalgia but are reconfigured and “ mashed up ” enough so as to sound fresh and new and free of the groan that collects when somebody insists on playing all four minutes and seventeen seconds of MC Hammer ’s “ U Ca n’t Touch This ” at the holiday party .
With Girl
Talk , we get that blissful moment of recognition without having to suffer through the next three minutes and thirty seconds remembering exactly why it has n’t been Hammertime for more than a decade now .
Like many others before and after him , Gillis found his success after the indie music website Pitchfork Media bestowed positive reviews upon his third album , 2006 ’s Night Ripper .
“ Pittsburgh native Greg Gillis ( Girl Talk ) absolutely detonates the notions of mash - up , ” wrote reviewer Sean Fennessey .
“ As an illegal art form , it ’s surprising no one came along with an idea like this sooner . ”
The review came out on July 17 — so maybe the summer heat kept the typically spot - on Fennessey from remembering John Oswald ’s Plunderphonics , the all - stolen - sample recording from 1985 .
Either way , for Pitchfork and many others , Girl Talk raised the bastard - pop bar .
He was not just playing two songs on top of each other like 2 ManyDJs or Freelance Hellraiser , nor was he playing two songs next to each other in an anything - goes free - for - all DJ set a la Optimo or Erol Alkan .
Instead Gillis is something of a surgeon , scalpeling out drum breaks from one song , vocal melodies from another , a guitar riff from another , and stitching them into some danceable semblance of a new song .
These Frankensteins were emblematic of the indie- rockcentric Pitchfork ’s growing appreciation for Southern rap , modern pop , and dance music too , so it was no surprise when the site took the opportunity to award Gillis ’s album Best New Music , its highest honor — to celebrate Girl Talk was , in a way , to celebrate the site itself .
Around that time , Gillis hooked up with the Chicago - based Windish Agency .
He quickly began touring the world with his sweaty dance parties .
He had a well - blogged reputation for inviting people on stage to dance with him as he huddled over his computer , triggering his samples live , and soon he became a festival headliner .
A career in music firmly established , soon Gillis quit his Pittsburgh day - job as a biomedical engineer .
And now Gillis is at the point fame - wise where MTV News is more than happy to run a story about his last show , to take place on December 21 , 2012 .
That date counts for the end of the Mayan calendar — believed by some to be the day the world will end .
For a guy who plays others people ’s music , more or less , Gillis is not doing so bad for himself .
I’LL BE YOUR WHATEVER YOU WANT
Girl Talk , to his immense credit , is an avatar of the most important musical - technological developments and music - industrial complications from the last decade : ( illegal ) music hyper - consumption in the face of record industry meltdown ; the blurring of distinctions in major and indie labels ; the plumbing of indie cool ; an indie - rock about - face towards “ selling out ” ; an unprecedented participatory music culture , a next - next - level fan club .
( i.e. : It ’s not enough just to go to the shows , or buy the t- shirts , or track down the seven - inches . )
The mega - fans are remixing their favorite songs , lacing them with dance beats and synthesizer presets , posting their remixes on their blogs , commenting on those of others .
Even if there were precedents for these complications , the 21st century form of mashups is a very palpable convergence : an internet - mediated , meta - pop moment .
There was a time of openly loathing but secretly loving 2 Many DJ ’s blend of Skee - Lo ’s “ I Wish ” over “ Cannonball ” by the Breeders .
But it was n’t clear at the time ( late 2002 ) that this would be a New Musical Movement with artist heroes and collectives .
The mashup was at best the democratization of once elite techie show - off skills .
Pro Tools Free or Fruity Loops or Live ( cracked or otherwise ) were now widely available , and so anybody with an ounce of computer know - how was able to twist and contort their favorite songs into a seamless mixtape .
Soon , an army of sixteen year - olds would surely adopt the mashup as a standard protocol in their early musical careers .
They ’d figure out a way to impress girls by putting Indigo Girls tracks over “ Tootsie Roll . ”
HE WISHES HE WAS A BALLER
A month after Night Ripper received Best New Music , Gillis told critic Ryan Dombal , “ I ’m trying to separate myself from other people by having songs that would be considered — technically — original things .
I do n’t seek out mashups .
I ’m associated with the whole mashup movement , and it ’s too bad because I ’m not a huge fan of them . ”
Two years later , Gillis told Robert Levine of the New York Times , straight up , “ I want to be a musician and not just a party D.J. …. and like any musician I want to put out a classic album . ”
Then again , Gillis does n’t need to say anything of this sort , with the militia of sycophants he has lined up to defend his work .
Our favorite is Chris Bodenner , a guest blogger at Andrew Sullivan ’s Daily Dish blog .
Bodenner not only insists Girl Talk is an artist , but believes him to be “ the artist for the Age of Obama ” :
[ Obama ] ’s campaign — buoyed by young fans and volunteers — embodies that generation in so many ways , as does Girl Talk .
Obama is a young , diverse , and unique politician running an innovative , grassroots campaign that thrives offs the Internet .
Similarly , Girl Talk is a young , innovative , Internet - based artist whose level of sampling is unique and incredibly diverse — racially and stylistically .
And both Obama and Gillis draw from the same demographics : African - Americans and young liberal whites .
Plus , they both put on killer live shows .
Suffice it to say , we did not expect the glorification of mashers - up to the point of being artists — as if “ talented DJ ” just could n’t suffice .
Even Belgian duo 2 Many
DJs kept their dark arts in the realm of the “ DJ mix . ”
The Skee - Lo / Breeders track , for example , boasted no pretensions of song title other than a listing of its ingredients .
But for some reason this Night Ripper set was an “ album ” rather than a “ mix , ” made of “ songs ” and not of “ mashups . ”
Perhaps this posing is required , however , because Night Ripper does n’t particularly work as a straight DJ mix .
There is no build ; it does n’t breathe .
The genius of 2 Many DJs and some of the other first wave mashup artists was the naturalness of their blends .
Without tinkering too much , the harmonic and melodic elements would align to make a sonically pleasing moment .
Christina Aguilera sounded plausible singing over The Strokes in “ A Stroke of Genius . ”
No DJ superhero could be heard pulling the strings .
In the pre-Girl Talk days , the standard of judgment was the seamlessness , the beauty of a ridiculously paired , yet ironically similar set of songs .
But this is Girl Talk .
Night Ripper is a “ postmodern musical creation . ”
This posits itself as Art — challenging all prior definitions of what it means to make music .
A NITPICKY DIGRESSION B/W BEFORE THEY WERE GIRL TALKS
Technology obscures the fact , a simple one to me , that “ mashing up ” is the fundamental process for music making : i.e. combining and recombining different sounds into pleasing and / or at the very least hopefully - not - boring configurations .
Lynyrd Skynyrd were known to mash up guitar and bass and drums into the configuration of “ Sweet Home Alabama . ”
Weezer had a pretty good mashup called “ Say It Ain’t So . ”
Some people / bands make terrible mashups .
Other people / bands make pretty good mashups !
All ’s to say , there is a context for Girl Talk ’s cut - and - paste aesthetic .
Technically he is working in the tradition of musique concrete , which when Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry and Stockhausen and friends did it , comprised cutting up physical vinyl records and tape reels and re-pasting them together — using prerecorded sounds and reconfiguring them and then playing them as pastiche .
These were compositions but not traditional songs .
And most of these compositions , to be frank , are more fun to think about than listen to .
But since then , the concrete nature of recording has been exploited tremendously as part of the modern recording studio setup .
Most radio pop songs are cut-and - pastes of previous takes actually , looped and warped and seamlessly woven together .
And so musique concrete , one could reasonably argue , has significantly altered the path of recorded music , not necessarily with its content but as a process .
ROMAN CANDLE IN THE WIND
What ’s tricky is that Gillis wants the Art-ness of musique concrete and the Popularity of Pop Music .
Unlike musique concrete artists , even more popular ones like Matmos , Gillis wants , needs even , his samples to be fully recognizable .
He is using well - known songs too , not field recordings of , say , a squeaky door hinge — so there is an element of junior - high level trainspotting to the album ’s appeal , right down to the title : Night Ripper clearly plays on the Beatles song title “ Day Tripper . ”
The tracklisting of the Night Ripper song “ Smash Your Head ” counts ( at least ) 17 samples , from Fall Out Boy to X - Ray - Spex to the Pharcyde , whose “ Passing Me By ” itself samples at least two songs .
The effect is an advanced version of that game on the iPod , which challenges you to figure out what the song is from a four second random clip .
It ’s a game , and because Gillis keeps a steady beat , it ’s technically danceable too .
It ’s rarely listenable though — at least in any traditional , “ I am taking pleasure in the configuration of these simultaneously occurring sounds and words ” sense of pop music listening .
Although Girl Talk has a few choice moments like the “ Where Is My Mind ” vs. “ Hate Me Now ” blend , he relies on pitch - shifting and time - distorting everything to fit within the same BPM — cramming all his various found elements into the same one - size - fits - all bed a la Greek villain Procrustes .
He is obedient more to his process than the finished product .
His most beloved blend of Biggie Smalls and Elton John pitches up “ Tiny Dancer ” to a ludicrous degree , and to add insult to injury , Gillis lets John ’s artificially - chipmunked lyrics step all over Biggie ’s rhymes .
( This would surely prompt a severe drubbing if done in real life . )
Gillis ’ labored matching of “ Ain’t to Proud to Beg ” over “ Friends of P ” just sounds like “ I Love the ‘ 90s ” projectile vomiting .
There are also sloppy segments on Night Ripper where the songs ’ keys do n’t match up — like Ciara ’s “ Oh ” over Elastica ’s “ Connection ” — which I doubt was an intentional experiment in audience - polarizing post - modernism .
Maybe we should n’t say that the errors are “ unmusical ” but they have the groove of a elementary school violin recital .
The ultimate glory of Girl Talk is supposed to reside in a brand new expression of “ pop obsession ” for a radically - different generation .
But as it stands , Girl Talk just seems to love pop music as a sadistic steward , morphing all the hooks and cherished moments of the last forty years into devalued fodder for a long stream of time - stretched mid-range EQ mush with no peaks or dynamics .
Notice we do n’t find Girl Talk offensive to copyright , “ the ontology of art , ” or pop music in general .
We just think the relatively innovative gimmick of his style has exempted him from critical thought put towards the actual result .
Are we a pop culture generation easily placated to hear our “ references ” bounced back to us , no matter the context or skill ?
Recall the Weezer video for “ Pork and Beans . ”
Is the whole game now : “ Hey , I know what that is !! ” ?
I ’M GONNA ADD SOME BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT
Late this summer , Girl Talk released his Night Ripper follow - up called Feed the Animals .
( This is possibly a subtle reference to Belly ’s “ Feed the Trees , ” but I doubt it . )
Since Night Ripper , Gillis ’s technical abilities improved , and there are fewer “ unmusical ” moments when keys do n’t line up or samples seem sloppy .
With fewer mistakes to distract us , the Girl Talk Thesis Statement seems more apparent , i.e. there is a Girl Talk Thesis Statement after all .
Like a good crate - digging producer , Gillis aims to salvage what the past has discarded and wishes to figure out how to make worn - out songs sound good again .
A pretty clean example of that :
He updates the build of “ Dance To the Music ” by Sly and the Family Stone , the part when Sly sings “ I ’m gonna add a little organ ” and then the organ comes in , repeat with guitar , repeat with bass — except Girl Talk makes very simple substitutions for the original responses to Sly ’s calls .
If anything , it ’s clever , a good party trick .
Later Girl
Talk rescues the one great chorus from an otherwise terrible Southern rap track ( cf. Shawty Lo ’s “ They Know ” or Cassidy ’s “ Drink N My 2 Step ” ) and finds it a better backbeat .
Gillis sometimes just goes for broke and it works , combining awesome with awesome and giving us awesomer :
For an all - too - brief time , Blackstreet ’s “ No Diggity ” chorus glides over Kanye ’s “ Flashing Lights ” instrumental .
Getting paid is a forte ; this is something else entirely .
Girl Talk is definitely Gillis ’s Ongoing Project — and these records , as long as he keeps making them ( four more years , dude ! ) , could very well approach an Aesthetic if not a Point .
From a technical standpoint , this is also a project that requires a certain degree of time and effort and patience ( and an endless supply of a cappellas ) .
He could just be combining any old songs , but he is n’t .
Obviously sometimes his combinations and sequences do n’t taste good .
But with music at least , the best moments are more value - indicative to me than the plethora of shitty ones .
Shittiness is an inevitability .
As pointed out , digital music manipulation tools have become cheaper and more available and the d-word , shudder , democratized .
The ignobile vulgus does n’t have the best track record when it comes to artmaking .
Remember what happened when synthesizers became readily available in late disco , giving birth to house music :
We first got Frankie Knuckles ’ “ Your Love , ” but then we got , you know , everything else after that .
Some of it was awesome .
Most was terrible .
We ’re not saying Girl Talk is the Frankie Knuckles of mash - ups .
But compare him with the rest of what the internet has put out there for us — all the ridiculous song title puns — and you realize the extent to which he does care how he puts things together .
His records have rough patches sonically , and he does n’t have a handle on pacing , knowing only one speed ( fast ) and one density ( brick ) and one EQ setting ( lots of mids ) .
But he ’s not exactly taking the piss , or the same kind of piss , as the rest of these people .
DJ HERO
That being said , Girl Talk ’s insistence on not being a pure DJ is a key to why the music sounds like it does , why it has only one speed , one timbre , and one density : if he lets a sample or phrase or loop breath on its own without some kind of additional percussion or secondary element , he is violating his own semantic scruples .
Rule Number One of Girl Talk Club : Everything must be mashed at all times or otherwise the whole musique concrete / “ art compounded from other art ” rationale falls away , and Gillis is “ just a DJ . ”
This is a bar of poetic , Babel - like heights — an exciting concept , one to which Girl Talk ’s execution rarely lives up .
But in doing so , Girl Talk has deftly avoided the mashup label , and the musique concrete label , in favor of a brand - new artform whose result , critics be damned , has no point of comparison .
If not an outright lie , most times uniqueness is a bad excuse for Not Art .
Many artists recoil at the mere suggestion that someone is doing something else just like them .
To that end , these artists create new rules so that no one is on the same court .
They get away with it , in no small part because most snobby music fans hate the idea of music having a “ playing field ” anyway , where music becomes like sports — scratch DJs or guitar soloists who have to practice , practice , practice , who try to outdo their rivals through sheer technical skill , who play at Madison Square Garden for screaming fans , who wipe the sweat with actual towels .
( Except when it ’s a video game , then we suddenly love it . )
Girl
Talk does n’t want to go to the Wimbledon of mash - ups , so he created his own sport .
Let ’s call it Speed Mashball .
I do n’t think he ’s the best Speed Mashball player he could be ( he ’s definitely gotten better since the Night Ripper Tournament ) , but with no competition stepping to the plate to kick a “ goober - ball ” ( we will discuss the rules and jargon of this complicated athletic metaphor later ) , Girl Talk is the undisputed gold medalist .
And by using every sample known to man ( and every a cappella downloaded from Jam Glue ) , he basically outmoded the entire circa 2003 mash - up sport .
We can put Girl Talk under the umbrellas of musique concrete or loop - based pop music itself , but these titles further confuse Gillis , making him out to be some kind of outsider or misunderstood auteur .
Truth is , however , Girl Talk is first and foremost a campus favorite , a party rocker , that serious DJ flown in for the Kappa Alpha party who you go and ask if he has any De La Soul ; he screams at you indignantly “ I just played some ! ” and then you go back to looking for where Carrie Ann went off to .
Unlike Matmos or Pierre Schaeffer or anything musique concrete , Girl Talk needs “ the critics ” as much as Tay “ Chocolate Rain ” Zonday does — which is to say , not at all .
Dude ’s likely got every weekend for the next year booked without all the ink spilled from the pens of eggheads .
As a second cousin , Girl Talk has that guy who sped - up all the Beatles albums to fit in a single ten minute file .
But that particular music auteur gets no love from Pitchfork , no respect as “ an artist . ”
Must be his subpar Street Team .
THE LEGOMANIAC
Can a process truly be called “ repurposing ” or “ recontextualizing ” when Repurpose and Recontext is built into the content ’s genetic code ?
When it ’s all part of the master plan ?
Disco and funk producers did n’t intend for their drum breaks to become the stuff of rap samples — yet with Girl Talk compositions , one wonders how much of Gillis ’s ease is a testament to his technical prowess , and how much is just an articulation of the fact that pop music has become increasingly standardized , its parts more or less interchangeable .
All major rap singles , for instance , come with an instrumental and a vocal a cappella ; the verses are mostly all the same length , about 16 bars ; the choruses are all more of less the same length of time too .
It is understood within the architecture of pop and hip - hop music these days that the song is waiting , begging even , to be mashed up .
A modern audience likely wo n’t find anything remotely violent or controversial or confrontational to Girl Talk presenting this information either .
Rock has coexisted with hip - hop has coexisted with noise .
Our ears are better - than - ever equipped to handle these kinds of recombinations .
Girl Talk has a moment on Feed The Animals when he puts a rap over the French disco-house track “ Music Sounds Better With You , ” and another one when we hear Lil Mama over Metallica ’s “ One . ”
It ’s telling how little these tracks sound out of the ordinary , because ten years ago I suspect they would have .
Just last year , Kanye took Daft Punk ’s electro track “ Harder Better Faster Stronger ” and put rapping over it , called it “ Stronger , ” and it went to # 1 on the Billboard Pop 100 .
Discounting the precedent of the Beastie Boys , Jay - Z ’s best - selling Black Album in 2003 was filled with Lil Mama / Metallica - type moments .
In the public imagination , these artistic decisions are no longer scandalous .
We ’re seeing this in other situations , as the idea of user - generated content delights our commerce so — that the line between Ultimate Fan and Actual Artist is rendered the same in terms of exchange value .
In 2008 , Girl Talk is pop music ’s Ultimate Fan .
But the extent to which the music he ’s working with is so portable , so building - block ready , makes it seem like he ’s not making art so much as merely following industry directions :
Step by step , like he ’s putting together a Lego spaceship .
There is no violence in this process , in other words ; he ’s hardly repurposing much of anything .
Instead it ’s like a video game in which Gillis has found the warp level — yet keep in mind , somebody somewhere had to program that warp level precisely so that it would be discovered .
THE 21ST NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER
And as the Ultimate Fan , Girl Talk exists as a mover not of music but nostalgia .
He is the guy at the party who says , “ Remember slap bracelets ? ”
Dude :
How about devil sticks ?
Although there are things to hate about the whole “ mass nostalgia ” angle , who can gainsay the fact that the first major role of our new internet - based culture is to dig back in the near past and scream , “ Yo , you remember this shit ? ” — whether it ’s 1970s toy commercials on YouTube or Super Mario Bros.
mycology sets on BoingBoing or funny Russian Speed Racer overdubs on Some Awful Thing .
There is no way VH1 could have a “ nostalgia for this week ” show unless they felt the pressure to one - up the Internet where it ’s all nostalgia all the time .
Girl
Talk fits into our national cultural mood extremely well .
Gillis is the musical equivalent of “ Best Week Ever . ”
And I am sure that even that show could be legitimized as “ a perfect manifestation of what McLuhan and Warhol augured ” rather than Lowest Common Denominator TV .
( A personal note from David :
As someone living in the far Orient and generally ignoring recent American “ popular ” music to listen to David Brooks and Mark Shields battle it out on podcasts , I am either the least or most qualified person to make a judgment on Girl Talk .
I had no idea Kayne West made music ; I just thought he was that whiny Fauntleroy in shutter sunglasses always hanging out at colette in Paris .
Forget art .
The question is , without a public hungry for the references , is Feed the Animals anything at all ?
Does Girl
Talk hold up as “ music ” without all the extratextual information ?
If you had no idea about mash - ups or hip - hop or “ No Diggity ” or “ Epic ” by Faith No More would you really be all that impressed ?
It would just be a long stream of unstructured pop drone .
Imaginary straw - men that have lived in a underground bunker for fifty years would totally hate Girl Talk ! )
To extend the earlier Lego metaphor : Just as bloggers have two basic options — write original content or become a central link warehouse — musicians now can either mold the musical blocks for other “ secondary ” artists or build the “ spaceship ” from the publicly available kit .
But these are not equal options .
I doubt that anyone will ever sample Kayne ’s “ Stronger . ”
It ’s a dead - end , a cultural vasectomy .
A REALLY EASY WAY TO CONNECT TO PEOPLE
“ The whole basis of the music is that people have these emotional attachments to these songs , ” Gillis told Pitchfork .
“ Being able to manipulate that is a really easy way to connect with people . ”
If Girl Talk has done anything , his dead - end project is a reminder of how fiercely dominant Western pop music has become .
This is a capitulation , an audio essay even , of the last 25 years of American pop music : loop - based , interchangeable parts that , turns out , are more similar than maybe we ’d like to admit .
The “ is n’t it funny how ‘ Smells Like Teen Spirit ’ sounds like that Boston song ” moment is taken to its darkest , veil - lifted extreme .
That we ’re back in the Tin Pan Alley , and all pop music might actually be the same after all .
That the difference is truly manufactured , that the concerns of each song are not interesting .
Taking cues from the Grand Wizard Theodor : pop music is not art , but sound design .
Therein lies the insidiousness .
Adorno pulled no punches .
But Girl
Talk poses as a pop optimist .
He loves pop music — all pop music .
It ’s all so unique .
It ’s all just so great to him .
Implicit in his project is that :
It ’s all so similar to him too .
That it all sounds the same in the end .
That listening to a bunch of songs we used to care about in his refracted , rejiggered form is , at its heart , the same exact thing , compositionally and otherwise , as listening to a brand new song by a brand new musician .
Why bother , right ?
This project , worse than any covert corporate sponsorship , he calls a celebration of pop music .
What he himself does n’t know is we already had a name for it : la danse macabre .
I 'm sorry , Dave , I 'm afraid I can't do that .
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it .
Look Dave , I can see you 're really upset about this .
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly , take a stress carrot , and think things over .
My mind is going , Van M .
Consider this simple C++ program :
#include < string > std:: string str = " hello world " ; int main ( ) { return 0 ; }
Compile it and start it under gdb .
Look what happens when you print the string :
( gdb ) print str $ 1 = {static npos = 4294967295 , _ M_dataplus = { < std::allocator< char >> = {< __gnu_cxx::new_allocator<char >> = {< No data fields >} , < No data fields >} , _M_p = 0x804a014 " hello world "}}
Crazy !
And worse , if you ’ve done any debugging of a program using libstdc ++ , you ’ll know this is one of the better cases — various clever implementation techniques in the library will send you scrambling to the gcc source tree , just to figure out how to print the contents of some container .
At least with string , you eventually got to see the contents .
Here ’s how that looks in python - gdb :
( gdb ) print str $ 1 = hello world
Aside from the missing quotes ( oops on me ) , you can see this is much nicer .
And , if you really want to see the raw bits , you can use “ print /r “ .
So , how do we do this ?
Python , of course !
More concretely , you can register a pretty - printer class by matching the name of a type ; any time gdb tries to print a value whose type matches that regular expression , your printer will be used instead .
Here ’s a quick implementation of the std :: string printer ( the real implementation is more complicated because it handles wide strings , and encodings — but those details would obscure more than they reveal ) :
class StdStringPrinter : def __init__ ( self , val ) : self.val = val def to_string ( self ) : return self.val ['_ M_dataplus ' ] ['_ M_p ' ] .string ( )
gdb.pretty_printers ['^std::basic_string<char , .*>$ ' ] = StdStringPrinter
The printer itself is easy to follow — an initializer that takes a value as an argument , and stores it for later ; and a to_string method that returns the appropriate bit of the object .
This example also shows registration .
We associate a regular expression , matching the full type name , with the constructor .
One thing to note here is that the pretty - printer knows the details of the implementation of the class .
This means that , in the long term , printers must be maintained alongside the applications and libraries they work with .
( Right now , the libstdc + + printers are in archer .
But , that will change . )
Also , you can see how useful this will be with the auto - loading feature .
If your program uses libstdc+ + — or uses a library that uses libstdc++ — the helpful pretty - printers will automatically be loaded , and by default you will see the contents of containers , not their implementation details .
See how we registered the printer in gdb.pretty_printers ?
It turns out that this is second - best — it is nice for a demo or a quick hack , but in production code we want something more robust .
Why ?
In the near future , gdb will be able to debug multiple processes at once .
In that case , you might have different processes using different versions of the same library .
But , since printers are registered by type name , and since different versions of the same library probably use the same type names , you need another way to differentiate printers .
Naturally , we ’ve implemented this .
Each gdb .
Objfile — the Python wrapper class for gdb ’s internal objfile structure ( which we briefly discussed in an earlier post ) — has its own pretty_printers dictionary .
When the “ - gdb.py ” file is auto - loaded , gdb makes sure to set the “ current objfile ” , which you can retrieve with “ gdb.get_current_objfile “ .
Pulling it all together , your auto - loaded code could look something like :
import gdb.libstdcxx.v6.printers gdb.libstdcxx.v6.printers.register_libstdcxx_printers(gdb.get_current_objfile( ) )
Where the latter is defined as :
def register_libstdcxx_printers(objfile ) : objfile.pretty_printers [ ' ^std::basic_string <char , .*>$ ' ] = StdStringPrinter
When printing a value , gdb first searches the pretty_printers dictionaries associated with the program ’s objfiles — and when gdb has multiple inferiors , it will restrict its search to the current one , which is exactly what you want .
A program using libstdc ++. so. 6 will print using the v6 printers , and ( presumably ) a program using libstdc ++. so. 7 will use the v7 printers .
As I mentioned in the previous post , we do n’t currently have a good solution for statically - linked executables .
That is , we do n’t have an automatic way to pick up the correct printers .
You can always write a custom auto - load file that imports the right library printers .
I think at the very least we ’ll publish some guidelines for naming printer packages and registration functions , so that this could be automated by an IDE .
The above is just the simplest form of a pretty - printer .
We also have special support for pretty - printing containers .
We ’ll learn about that , and about using pretty - printers with the MI interface , next time .
Carbon nanotubes , or hollow microscopic wires made of carbon ( pictured ) , may one day replace some of the neurons in your brain .
They could repair brain damage , or give a turbo boost to healthy brains .

A group of researchers in France and Italy have published a paper today in Nature Nanotechnology that carbon nanotubes can act as neural workarounds in the brain , forming tight contacts with the already - existing nerve cells and conducting electricity between them exactly the way neurons do with each other .
According to Henry Markram , a lead scientist on the project at Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry in Switzerland :
The new carbon nanotube - based interface technology discovered together with state of the art simulations of brain - machine interfaces is the key to developing all types of neuroprosthetics — sight , sound , smell , motion , vetoing epileptic attacks , spinal bypasses , as well as repairing and even enhancing cognitive functions .

If we use technologies like this to cure Alzheimer 's patients , we may wind up with a generation of hyper - intelligent seniors ready to invent the next brain - boosting technology .

It 's too bad we 'll never see this level of engineering in the US .
Construction companies would just over - charge for the work , do sub -par work and take 10 times as long to get it done .
And a bunch of people would just piss and moan about the environment or the disruption to their community and block any attempt to get anything done .
It reminds me of the improvements to infrastructure I hear recommended for my area that would be a great help but some organization puts a stop to because they 're intent on forcing their own agenda on everyone .
NASA 's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has found 12 previously unknown pulsars ( orange ) .
Fermi also detected gamma-ray emissions from known radio pulsars ( magenta , cyan ) and from known or suspected gamma-ray pulsars identified by NASA 's now - defunct Compton Gamma - Ray Observatory ( green ) .

Four months into its mission , the Fermi Gamma -ray Space Telescope has discovered 12 never - before - seen pulsars and observed gamma-ray pulses from 18 others .
" I am very happy to welcome you all to a new era in pulsar physics , " Roger Romani said at a press conference held today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California .
Romani is a researcher in the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and Stanford University .
" We know of 1800 pulsars , but until Fermi we saw only little wisps of energy from all but a handful of them .
Now , for dozens of pulsars , we 're seeing the actual power of these machines . "
In the past , most pulsars - rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit energy in narrow beams - were observed only in radio waves .
Yet , as the FGST data reveals , this radio - wave emission is extremely weak compared with the pulsars ' flashes of gamma-rays .
The 12 newly discovered pulsars offer insight into the mechanism behind the gamma-ray emissions .
The data show that the classic understanding of emission , whereby gamma rays are created in the same location as radio waves , is mistaken .
Researchers now theorize that the radio beams form near the neutron star 's surface , while the gamma rays form far above .
FGST is also shedding light on pulsars as they near the end of their lifecycles .
Over the past few months , the telescope found seven very old and relatively rare pulsars that are thought to have gravitationally attracted additional stellar matter from companion stars , causing them to increase in mass and spin much faster .
These " millisecond " pulsars spin hundreds of times faster than their younger siblings , with their surfaces moving at up to a tenth of the speed of light .
They also have magnetic fields 10,000 times lower and are thought to be 10,000 times older than previously discovered pulsars .
With the observation of these millisecond pulsars , Romani said , " we 're really seeing the history of pulsars . "
Alice Harding of the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center added : " This is the tip - of - the - iceberg .
We 'll probably be discovering a lot more . "
Researchers announced these findings at the American Astronomical Society meeting this week in Long Beach , California , and at the Texas Symposium on Relativistic Astrophysics last December in Vancouver , Canada .

We were going to sell our jewelry on craigslist.com but thought this sounded like a more effective way to maximize our profits .
WHAT A JOKE !
I finally received my check after weeks and weeks of waiting with no word and no confirmation that they even received my jewelry -- I feared it was gone for good .
It might as well be lost !
For a 14 K gold bracelet that I was offered $ 75 , $ 85 , and $ 90 for on craigslist I received a whopping $ 4.73 !
I felt instantly sick and feared the worst .
For some small diamonds that they took our of a ring they paid me $ 0.21 .
Yes , that is twenty - one cents .
Add in a 14 k ring and pair of earrings and my total windfall was $ 7.51 .
I feel like I 've been sucker punched and just hope someone reads this and saves themself the time , energy and agony of going through this process .
This is a scam people .

Eye contact is commonly considered a sign of self - confidence and a means for emotional connection .
In contrast , a person who averts their gaze is often considered shy , fearful , embarrassed or lying .
Many a self - help manual has touted the power of eye contact , with direct eye contact suggested to help one quickly gain an individual ’s attention , create an emotional connection and make a lasting impression .
While these are quite common assumptions , scientists are only beginning to unravel the cognitive and brain processes that may underlie and corroborate the significance of eye contact .
Recent studies using brain imaging show that the normal brain may essentially “ prefer ” to direct attention to the faces of individuals who are engaging in direct eye contact .
A direct eye gaze has been shown to rapidly activate a “ social brain network ” , that involves a greater engagement of brain areas that are important for emotion and attention ( fusiform and amygdala ) .
This means that the brain is very rapidly engaged by someone ’s direct gaze ( even at the very earliest stages of perceiving that person ’s face ) , and that this eye contact directs the brain to put more of its emotional resources into processing that face .
The evidence supports the idea that engaging in direct eye contact with someone may indeed have a very significant impact on the way in which that person notices , has an emotional reaction towards , and remembers a face .
Interestingly , eye contact may be so important to our social and emotional functioning that it may even explain the social and emotional disturbances in certain clinical disorders .
Autistic children , for example , show very little eye contact , and this may be due to eye contact involving an over-activation of emotional brain centers ( amygdala ) in these children .
This means that autistic children may be perceiving eye contact as a threat , which may in turn lead to problems socializing and connecting with others .
Similarly , a recent study suggests that adolescents with psychopathic traits essentially may have a “ fear blindness ” that is due to a deficient ability to fixate on people ’s eyes .
The study at the University of New South Wales assessed adolescent males who scored high on having psychopathic traits .
They found that these adolescents had a reduced ability to recognize fear , and that this deficiency was explained by a reduced ability to fixate on another ’s eyes .
This deficiency in eye fixation was suggested to possibly be linked to a disturbance in key emotional brain centers ( amygdala ) in these adolescents .
They say that the eyes may be the “ windows to the soul ” and the “ lamp of the body . ”
These adages may be of significant relevance to the clinical and cognitive neurosciences .

Hegel on Daoism ( Taoism )
Dao generally means " the way , " the right way of spirit , i.e. , it means " reason . "
The sect of the Dao occurs already ( as we see ) in the twelfth century B.C.
It was a noteworthy event that the emperor passed over esteemed officers with his rewards ; his intention was in a subtle way to put them to one side , to separate them from his other retainers .
These gallant officers included masters of the teaching as well as some who were only initiates at a lower level .
Seven noble officers had distinguished themselves by particular deeds of valor ; in the eyes of the mass of soldiers they were regarded as Shen who had only assumed human bodies , and they presented themselves in that light as well .
On a ceremonial day the emperor addressed them , saying he had not forgotten them , that he recognized very well the value of their merits .
" Even though you have bodies , " he continued , " you are Shen , of that there is no doubt .
The outstanding actions that you have performed under my eyes are sufficient proof of that to me .
The intention , for the sake of which you returned to the earth , can only be to acquire for yourselves new merits , to disclose new virtues .
I can do no better than to put you in a position to practice these virtues , by safeguarding you against the corruption of the times . "
He therefore determined the mountains to be their residence , where they could spend their remaining time in intimate association with the Shen who no longer have human shape .
They were supposed to take with them all who belonged to their sect , all who strove solely to attain immortal life .
He made these seven into chiefs over all the mountains of the realm and gave them all rights of dominion over the initiates .
Thus they were to apply themselves to the study of the Dao and to the effort to make themselves immortal ; together with the other Shen , they were also supposed to acquire information about the secrets of nature that are impenetrable to other human beings .
Thus they were separated from actual society .
From this account we see that at that time there was already a class of people who occupied themselves with the inner life , who did not belong to this universal state religion but built up a sect that devoted itself to thinking , withdrew within itself and in its thinking sought to bring to consciousness what the true might be .
Therefore , the next stage of this initial configuration of nature religion which was this very knowing by immediate self - consciousness of itself as the highest , as the ruling element , i.e. , this immediacy of taking immediate willing to be what is highest is the return of consciousness into itself , the demand that consciousness should be inwardly meditative and that is the sect of the Dao .
Linked with this , in any case , is the fact that human beings who recede into thought or into the inner domain , who applied themselves to the abstraction of thought , have at the same time the intention of being immortal , of being pure sages , of whom some are newly initiated while others have attained the mastery or the goal and already regard themselves as higher essences also with respect to their existence and actuality .
Therefore we already find among the Chinese in antiquity this orientation toward the inner , to the Dao , an orientation to abstractly pure thinking , which orientation constitutes the transition to the second form of nature religion .
There occurred in later times a renewal or improvement of the Dao teaching , attributed especially to Lao‑zi , a sage who was somewhat older than Confucius but who lived contemporaneously with Confucius and Pythagoras .
Confucius is thoroughly moralistic and no speculative philosopher .
Tian , this universal power of nature , which by the emperor 's authority is an actuality , is linked to the moral nexus , and Confucius chiefly developed this moral aspect .
His teaching coalesced with the state religion .
All the mandarins had to have studied Confucius .
But the sect of the Dao based itself solely on abstract thinking .
Dao is the universal .
It is quite noteworthy that the determination " three " immediately comes into play to the extent that Dao is something rational and concrete .
Reason has produced one , one has produced two , two produced three , and three the universe the same doctrine that we see in Pythagoras .
The universe rests upon the dark principle and is at the same time embraced by the bright principle , by light .
A spirit or breath unites them , and brings about their harmony and maintains it .
The initial determination of the triad is the One , and is called J ; the second determination is the Chi or light breathing ; the third is Wei , what is sent , the messenger .
These three symbols are perhaps not Chinese ; one sees in them the three letters J , H , W , and correlates this with the Hebraic tetragram Jehovah , and with the trigram Yao of the Gnostics .
The One is the indeterminate , that without characteristics , the impoverished initial abstraction , what is wholly empty .
If it is to be internally concrete , to be living , then it must be determinate , and thus it is the Two , and the Third is the totality , the consummation of determinateness .
Thus , even in the first efforts of humanity to think in the form of triunity or trinity , we can observe this necessity . ­
Unless three determinations are recognized in God , " God " is an empty word .
Right at the beginning of thinking we find the very simplest and most abstract determinations of thought .
If , from this assertion that the absolute power is , there occurs the progression to the universal , then thinking begins , though the thinking itself is originally quite empty and abstract .
Further developments of this relationship are found in Chinese literature .
The symbol of the Dao , is on the one hand a triangle , and on the other hand three horizontal lines one above the other , the middle one of which is shortest , with a vertical stroke through all three as a sign that these three are to be grasped essentially as one .
In China these symbols are called Gua .
The [ eight ]
Gua embody the elements of the higher Chinese reflection .
Thus in the sect of the Dao the beginning consists in passing over into thought , the pure element ; but one should not believe that a higher , spiritual religion has established itself in this case .
The determinations of the Dao remain complete abstractions , and vitality , consciousness , what is spiritual , do not , so to speak , fall within the Dao itself , but are still completely within the immediate human being .
Thus Lao‑zi is also a Shen , or he has appeared as Buddha .
The actuality and vitality of the Dao is still the actual , immediate consciousness ; in fact , it is even a deceased individual such as Lao‑zi , although it transforms itself into other shapes , into another human being , and it is vitally and actually present in its priests .
Just as Tian , this One , is the ruling element , though as this abstract foundation , whereas the emperor is the actuality of this foundation , the one who in fact rules ; so the same is the case with the Dao , with the representation of reason .
Reason is likewise the abstract foundation that has its actuality for the first time in existing human beings .
Since the universal , the higher , is only the abstract foundation , the human being thus abides in it without any properly immanent , fulfilled inner element ; one has no inner hold on oneself .
One has for the first time a footing within oneself when freedom and rationality emerge , when one has the consciousness of being free and when this freedom elaborates itself as reason .
This developed reason provides absolute principles and duties ; and people who are themselves conscious of these principles in their freedom and within their conscience people in whom they are immanent characteristics have for the first time a footing within themselves , in their conscience .
But insofar as human beings find themselves in that preceding relationship , where the absolute is only an abstract foundation , they have no footing within themselves , no immanent , determinate inwardness .
For that reason everything external is for them something inward ; everything external has significance for them , it has a relation to them , and indeed a practical relation .
This relationship is in general the constitution of the state , the circumstances of being ruled from without .

Abstract : When Western science was introduced to modern China , more translated words were used to express fundamental concepts and terms than borrowed words .
The process of academic translation , commensuration , and communication between Western and Chinese philosophy is a process of comparative philosophical research .
Nowadays , however , it seems that Chinese philosophy is evaluated by a Western Hegelian criterion .
This leads to the debate over whether or not China has philosophy .
But it is meaningless to argue about whether or not China has the name of philosophy .
The key issue is whether or not China has the actuality of philosophy .
Looking at the history of Western philosophy , it seems that the Hegelian definition of philosophy was the only one that existed in Europe .
However , during the last 200 years after Hegel that the two main philosophical trends of positivism ( scientism ) and irrationalism developed from anti-Hegelianism or " Spurning Metaphysics . "
As metaphysics is being reconstructed , the ghost of Hegel has reappeared .
It is clear that in the future , philosophy will evolve from the development of human metaphysics or cultural philosophy .
It is a process of the " negation of negation " : from traditional metaphysics to the spurning of metaphysics , and then to human metaphysics .

Abstract :
The author deals with two basic problems in this paper .
Hegel 's interpretation of Chinese philosophy is discussed first , and Hegel 's relation towards the oriental religion in general is explored in greater detail .
Hegel 's understanding of the relation is then connected with the Daodejing 's philosophy .

Moai Figures
Easter Island , situated in the southeast Pacific over 1,000 miles from the other islands of Eastern Polynesia and some 1,400 miles west of South America , is one of the most remote inhabited places in the world .
Between 600 and 800 A.D. , a group of colonists from an unidentified location in Eastern Polynesia settled on Easter Island after sailing in a southeasterly direction for many weeks .
The name Easter Island originated with the European explorer Jacob Roggeveen , who first saw the island on Easter Sunday , 1722 .
Today , the Easter Islanders call themselves and their homeland Rapa Nui .
Rapa Nui society was organized following the classic Polynesian pattern : an aristocracy composed of ranked hereditary chiefs ( ariki ) with political authority over the commoners , who constituted the majority of the population .
The art of Easter Island is distinctively Polynesian , much of it centering on the creation of religious images .
The most recognizable art form from Easter Island are its colossal stone figures , or moai , images of ancestral chiefs whose supernatural power protected the community .
Between roughly 1100 and 1650 , Rapa Nui carvers created some 900 of these sculptures , nearly all of which are still in situ .
The moai represent ancestral chiefs who were believed to be descended directly from the gods and whose supernatural powers could be harnessed for the benefit of humanity .
The massive stone figures were generally erected on temple platforms ( ahu ) along the coast , where they faced inland to keep watch over the local community .
Most were carved from soft volcanic tuff at Rano Raraku , an extinct volcanic crater that served as the primary statue quarry .
The giant stone sculptures commonly weigh between 10 and 12 metric tons .
Their average height is roughly 13 feet , but they range anywhere from 8 feet to an unfinished example over 70 feet high .
Moai are characterized by long sloping noses , strong brows , deeply inset eyes , and prominent chins .
Some examples also wear a hatlike cylinder made of red stone on their heads , which may represent a headdress or elaborate hairstyle .
Each moai was commissioned by a specific individual or group and created by a team of expert stoneworkers under the direction of a master carver .
As many as fifteen people began by quarrying a large rectangular block using basalt picks ( toki ) .
Once the figure was roughed out , the master carver and his assistants added the fine details , usually beginning with the head and face .
Afterwards , a team of workers used ropes and levers to move the sculpture down the quarry slope .
It was then set upright and the remainder of the carving was completed .
The finished sculpture was then moved to its final destination using a wooden sled or rollers .
Experimental re-creation of this feat by modern archaeologists suggests that it required approximately 40 individuals to move an average - sized moai , By the time Europeans first reached Easter Island in 1722 , the moai tradition was already in decline .
Early explorers reported many moai still standing , but by the mid-nineteenth century , all had fallen due to neglect or warfare .
Many have since been restored by archaeologists .
Other art forms on the island include petroglyphs , many depicting birdmen and other fantastic creatures , as well as a variety of wooden sculptures .
One type of wooden image , the naturalistic male figures known as moai tangata , may depict family ancestors .
Although their imagery is conventionalized , they may be individual portraits .
What appears to be hair on the top of their heads is actually a low - relief carving depicting fishlike creatures with human heads and long flowing beards , possibly representing shark - human spirits ( nuihi ) .
In a number of respects , the moai tangata bear a close formal resemblance to the larger stone moai .
With their enlarged heads , frontal orientation , prominent stomachs , and arms that extend down the sides of their bodies , both types of image embody a classically Polynesian conception of the human form .
Easter Island art also includes barkcloth images , wooden ornaments , and featherwork .
Apart from the stone figures and petroglyphs , virtually all surviving works from the island date to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries .
We all know people , be they friends , family or colleagues , who seem to have a permanently downbeat view of life .
Worryingly for them , research over the last few years has indicated that a negative outlook for the future has been associated with both faster progression of age - related disease , and earlier mortality .
Furthermore , telomere attrition occurs with age , and being at the wrong end of the telomere length distribution at any given age is associated with increased risk of a number of diseases , including cardiovascular disease .
So it should come as no surprise to learn that chronic psychological stress has been associated with accelerated telomere shortening in circulating white blood cells .
The problem arises in trying to provide a biological mechanism that links this form of stress to increased telomere loss .
To address this , a group including the telomere / stress heavyweights Epel and Blackburn noted that both acute and chronic stress have been associated with increased interleukin - 6 ( an inflammatory cytokine ) , and repeated bouts of inflammation are associated with telomere shortening .
Thus the authors set out to link stress ( in this study the measure was optimism vs. pessimism ) to telomere shortening via IL - 6 in a cohort of post - menopausal women :
Pessimism correlates with leukocyte telomere shortness and elevated interleukin - 6 in post - menopausal women .
The combination of less positive and more negative expectations for the future ( i.e. , lower optimism and higher pessimism ) increases risk for disease and early mortality .
We tested the possibility that expectancies might influence health outcomes by altering the rate of biological aging , specifically of the immune system ( immunosenescence ) .
However , no studies to date have examined associations between optimism or pessimism and indicators of immunosenescence such as leukocyte telomere length ( TL ) and interleukin - 6 ( IL - 6 ) levels .
We investigated whether dispositional tendencies towards optimism and pessimism were associated with TL and IL - 6 in a sample of 36 healthy post - menopausal women .
Multiple regression analyses where optimism and pessimism were entered simultaneously , and chronological age and caregiver status was controlled , indicated that pessimism was independently associated with shorter TL ( beta=-.68 , p=.001 ) and higher IL - 6 concentrations ( beta=.50 , p=.02 ) .
In contrast , optimism was not independently associated with either measure of immunosenescence .
These findings suggest that dispositional pessimism may increase IL - 6 and accelerate rate of telomere shortening .
Mechanistic causal relationships between these parameters need to be investigated .
As with the previous Epel / Blackburn paper ( showing that “ intrusive thoughts ” impact on telomere length ) , the psychological measures ( optimism , pessimism and perceived stress ) were all based on questionnaires .
As a molecular biologist who is accustomed to running standardized assays I will always have a little trouble when the data comes from a subject assigning a score to a comment such as , “ If something can go wrong for me , it will ” .
I worry that there is such a subjective element to this type of study , but appreciate that in psychology there is little alternative .
This relatively small study of 36 post - menopausal women comprised 81 % white subjects .
Given the recent observations that ethnicity impacts on telomere length , it would have been sensible to include subjects from a single ethnic group to reduce the number of confounding variables .
( There is no mention of any impact of ethnicity on telomere length , or if it was even considered as a confounder . )
There is also evidence that telomere attrition rates may differ in pre- vs. post - menopausal woman , a phenomenon that may be related to telomerase stimulation by estrogen .
Therefore , it is pleasing to see that all subjects were post - menopausal ( the authors have previously correlated perceived stress in post - menopausal women with shorter telomeres , but stress that this study is a different cohort ) .
The study reported a significant , negative association between IL - 6 and telomere length , although the authors clearly state that this is not proof of causality : it may be that it is the critical shortening of telomeres that triggers inflammation rather that the other way around .
Of the psychological measures optimism was not associated with either telomere length or IL - 6 , while pessimism is associated with both .
This observation feels slightly counter - intuitive ; is reduced pessimism not the same as increased optimism ?
If so , one would expect that if pessimism associates with shorter telomeres then surely optimism would associate with longer telomeres ?
Clearly this is not the case .
As in the previous Epel / Blackburn study , higher levels of perceived stress were also associated with shorter telomeres , leading to the conclusion that “ exposure to psychological stressors in pessimists could contribute to to chronic low - level increases in circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines … contributing to telomere shortening ” .
While this was a small study , it does add weight to the hypothesis that an individual ’s psychological disposition is a contributing factor to poor health outcomes .
Cause for further concern for our downbeat friends is that an individual ’s score on optimism and pessimism measures generally remain stable across time ( important to note that this was not assessed in the present study , but has been replicated in earlier studies ) .
Unfortunately for the happy folk out there , optimism again fails to associate with “ better ” health outcomes — so we may as well all take the middle - ground on this one .

But Clive Black , head of research at Shore Capital , said : “ While muted for Tesco , we should not forget that it still has the highest sales , cash and profit densities in the industry . ”
Meanwhile , DSGI , the group behind Currys and PC World , is expected to report that like - for - like sales plunged 10 % - 12 % during the period .
Analysts said that although sales of electrical goods had leapt in January , the rise would not make up for a difficult Christmas in which customers shunned big - ticket items .

Times – Performing two Google searches from a desktop computer can generate about the same amount of carbon dioxide as boiling a kettle for a cup of tea , according to new research .
While millions of people tap into Google without considering the environment , a typical search generates about 7g of CO2 Boiling a kettle generates about 15g .
“ Google operates huge data centres around the world that consume a great deal of power , ” said Alex Wissner - Gross , a Harvard University physicist whose research on the environmental impact of computing is due out soon .
“ A Google search has a definite environmental impact . ”
Google is secretive about its energy consumption and carbon footprint .
It also refuses to divulge the locations of its data centres .
However , with more than 200 m internet searches estimated globally daily , the electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions caused by computers and the internet is provoking concern .
A recent report by Gartner , the industry analysts , said the global IT industry generated as much greenhouse gas as the world ’s airlines – about 2 % of global CO2 emissions .

Independent – Energy - guzzling flatscreen plasma televisions will soon be banned as part of the battle against climate change , ministers have said .
“ Minimum energy performance standards ” for televisions are expected to be agreed across Europe this spring , they say , and this should lead to “ phasing out the most inefficient TVs ” .
At the same time , a compulsory labelling system will be drawn up to identify the best and worst devices .
The moves , which follow last week ’s withdrawal of the 100W incandescent lightbulb , are part of a drive to slow the rapid growth of electricity consumption in homes by phasing out wasteful devices and introducing more efficient ones .
Giant plasma televisions – dubbed “ the 4x4s of the living room ” – can consume four times as much energy as traditional TVs that used cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) .
Over the past 30 years , the number of electric appliances and gadgets in a typical home has almost trebled – from 17 to 47 – as a host of devices from scanners to security systems , cappuccino makers to computer game consoles have joined the more traditional kettles , irons , vacuum cleaners and cookers .
And the number of televisions in homes has also grown rapidly ; there are now 60 million of them , one for every person in the country .

In artistic composition how many times do you repeat a phrase or pattern before it becomes boring ?
The newest show at the Haskins Laboratories Gallery , Intricacies : Extreme Detail in Current Art , seems to suggest the eye may be far more giving than the ear .
The exhibition of works by Rachel Hellerich ( pictured ) and six other area artists who luxuriate in repetition of patterns is on view until Jan. 23 .
Even if you are not one to count and step over cracks on the sidewalk on your way to 300 George St. , it ’s well worth a visit .
Hellerich ’s lushly painted acrylics on paper suggest influences such as Hindu or Islamic art , or even the Rococo , where all empty space is deemed the enemy to be conquered with pattern .
In these two compositions , called “ Orange Crush ” and “ Fade to Jade ” as well as in two larger canvasses called “ Phantastic Edifices , ” she has an eighth of the composition , at the top , uncovered .
It appears , in the latter works , to be a sky but one that is quite literally green , as if with envy for the temple and built environment below .
Taking the edge off Hellerich ’s repeating patterns is the inclusion of a figure , the only human figure in the entire exhibition .
I ’m not sure what this connotes : perhaps that human variousness , palpable to the eye , is the net result of all the invisible patterning that creates the cells , and from there the creatures and forms of nature , including ours truly .
Hellerich ’s figure is , by turns mysterious and humorous , is part Vashti , part ET , part Casper the Friendly Ghost .
It ’s by no means accidental that art using extreme detail and patterning is featured at Haskins Laboratories , a scientific venue .
Most of the works in the show suggest views cosmic or microscopic .
West Haven artist John Arabolis , for example , displays a series called “ Fabric of Life , ”
It just might connote that essential fabric of life , the brain ’s interior , with its elegant ganglia reaching out across a cerulean blue background .
Charles Prinz Kopelson ’s oil and ink on linen compositions , such as his “ The Americas II ” , are like an aerial view of some ancient city , all neatly laid out and viewed from a helicopter height .
If you step back , however , you might be faced with no aerial view at all but a close - up of glyphs and pictographs .
Which is it ?
What comes to mind , the more one moves up and down the line - up of works , which pleasantly fills several corridors on the ninth floor of 300 George , is that nature ’s two halves , the vast world of the cosmos and the immensities within each tiny biological unit , might not be so different after all .
At least not to artists .
Edith Borax - Morrison ’s pen and ink drawings are nearly all circles that contain a pandemonium of white canals that become tendrils reaching out from a central octopus - like knot or ball of organic stuff in the middle .
The circle containing all this action gives the works , which have charming names such as Minerva ’s Revenge , Split Decision , and Gossamer Drift , a pleasant tension .
The only artist who actually lets nature be on hand to be her actual helper is Alyse Rosner .
She lays down acrylic patterns of dots or swirls over small squares of raw pine .
Then she lets the wood ’s natural striations be visible both through the color she adds as well as , untouched , on the sides of the blocks .
One artist is somehow not fully at ease with the notion that nature rules with her patterning and our artists ’ role is merely perhaps to capture or approximate .
That artist is Hamden ’s Cham Hendon .
His three compositions are done in acrylic so thick it seems like enamel : one sea battle , one mountain scene , and this one called “ Woodland Friends ” suggests that nature has ordered her creations less according to patterns of shape than of color .
Or the painting is an homage to the fast receding vistas of LSD , Jefferson Airplane , Grace Slick , and their ten - foot - tall white rabbit .
Either way , the work is eerie and oddly humbling .

Gitit
Gitit is a wiki program written in Haskell .
It uses HAppS for the web server and session state , git for storage , history , search , diffs , and merging , and pandoc for markup processing .
Pages can be added , changed , and removed either on the web or using git 's command - line tools .
Gitit uses pandoc 's extended version of markdown as its markup language .
Getting started
Compiling and installing gitit
You 'll need the GHC compiler and the cabal - install tool .
GHC can be downloaded here .
For cabal - install on * nix , follow the [ quick install ] [ ] instructions .
If you want the syntax highlighting feature , you need to make sure that pandoc is compiled with support for it .
First , make sure your system has the pcre library installed .
Then :
cabal install pandoc - fhighlighting
You can skip this step if you do n't care about highlighting support .
You can now install the latest release of gitit :
cabal update cabal install gitit
To install a version of gitit checked out from the repository , change to the gitit directory and type :
cabal install
The cabal tool will automatically install all of the required haskell libraries .
If all goes well , by the end of this process , the latest release of gitit will be installed in your local .cabal directory .
You can check this by trying :
gitit -- version
If that does n't work , check to see that gitit is in your local cabal - install executable directory ( usually ~/.cabal / bin ) .
And make sure ~/. cabal / bin is in your system path .
Running gitit
To run gitit , you 'll need git in your system path .
Check this by doing
git -- version
Switch to the directory where you want to run gitit .
This should be a directory where you have write access , since two directories , static and wikidata , will be created here .
To start gitit , just type :
gitit
If all goes well , gitit will do the following :
Create a git repository , wikidata , and add a default front page .
Create a static directory containing the scripts and CSS used by gitit .
Start a web server on port 5001 .
Check that it worked : open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5001 .
Configuration options
You can set some configuration options when starting gitit , using the option -f [ filename ] .
A configuration file takes the following form :
Config { repository Path = " wikidata " , staticDir = " static " , wikiBanner = " < img src=\ " /images/bann.png\ " alt= \" banner\ " " , wikiTitle = " Wiki " , wikiFooter = " Powered by Gitit " , tableOfContents = False , maxUploadSize = 100000 , portNumber = 5001 , passwordSalt = " l91snthoae8eou2340987 " , debugMode =
True , locked Pages = [ " Help " ] , accessQuestion = Just ( " Enter the access code ( to request a code , contact me@foo.bar.com ) : " , [ " abcd " ] ) }
For the most part , these options should be self - explanatory .
The wikiBanner will be inserted before the top navigation bar on pages , and can be used to include a banner or wiki title .
It is raw HTML .
Similarly , the wikiFooter is raw HTML that will be inserted at the bottom of the page .
will be inserted before the top navigation bar on pages , and can be used to include a banner or wiki title .
It is raw HTML .
Similarly , the is raw HTML that will be inserted at the bottom of the page .
The tableOfContents boolean determines whether a table of contents , derived from the page 's headers , will be included for every page .
boolean determines whether a table of contents , derived from the page 's headers , will be included for every page .
maxUploadSize ( in bytes ) limits the size of pages and uploads .

The passwordSalt is used to encrypt passwords and should be changed for every new site .

debugMode causes diagnostic information to be printed to the console .

locked Pages is a list of pages that cannot be edited from the web interface .
( They may still be edited via git , by those with access to the repository . )
is a list of pages that cannot be edited from the web interface .
( They may still be edited via git , by those with access to the repository . )
The accessQuestion is either Nothing ( in which case anyone will be allowed to register for an account ) or Just ( question , [ ans1 , ans2 , ... ] ) ( in which case anyone who registers must first answer the question with one of the provided answers ) .
One can deter automated spammers by using an accessQuestion with an easy and obvious answer .
Or one can use an accessQuestion to limit those who can edit a wiki to a trusted group .
Configuring gitit
The static directory
If there is no wiki page or uploaded file corresponding to a request , gitit always looks last in the static directory .
So , for example , a file foo.jpg in the images subdirectory of the static directory will be accessible at the url / images / foo.jpg .
Pandoc creates two subdirectories of static , stylesheets and javascripts , which include the CSS and scripts it uses .
Changing the theme
To change the look of the wiki , modify gitit.css in static / stylesheets .
Adding support for math
Gitit is designed to work with jsMath to display LaTeX math in HTML .
Download jsMath and jsMath Image Fonts from the jsMath download page .
You 'll have two .zip archives .
Unzip them both in the static / javascripts directory ( a new subdirectory , jsMath , will be created ) .
You can test to see if math is working properly by clicking " help " on the top navigation bar and looking for the math example ( the quadratic formula ) .

The CEO of one of the province ’s largest private - power companies is “ absolutely ” confident it can finance its run-of - river hydroelectric projects in spite of the economic slowdown .
Donald McInnes , CEO of Plutonic Power Corporation , told the Georgia Straight that General Electric has invested $ 100 million in equity in his company ’s 196 - megawatt East Toba and Montrose project .
That has allowed Plutonic to borrow $ 470 million to build the two - facility development north of Powell River .
“ Manulife and this group of life - insurance companies lent us $ 470 million 18 months ago , ” McInnes said by phone from the Okanagan .
“ Because of our sales contract with B.C. Hydro and because of our partner in GE , they felt we would be a really good credit risk .
Therefore , if we were able to get a contract again in this next call for tender , they have said , ” ˜Yes , the world is falling apart , but every month we still get all these cheques from people that have life - insurance policies ; we would love to lend you some more money in the same manner that we did last time . ’ ”
Although Plutonic ’s finances may be in order , opponents could be lining up to speak out against the company ’s much larger planned project at Bute Inlet , also located north of Powell River .
At open houses on Tuesday ( January 27 ) in Powell River and Wednesday ( January 28 ) in Sechelt , the public will be able to provide input on the project ’s draft environmental - impact statement and the terms of reference for a potential federal review panel .
According to the company ’s December 2008 description of the Bute Inlet project , it is expected to produce 1,027 megawatts of electricity from 17 generating facilities and require the construction of 443 kilometres of transmission lines and about 100 bridges along the Southgate , Orford , and Homathko rivers .
Plutonic hopes to begin building the facilities in 2011 and producing power in 2014 .
“ I got it confirmed from the environmental - assessment office that it ’s even bigger than the supposed Site C [ dam ] , ” Nicholas Simons , NDP MLA for Powell River–Sunshine Coast , told the Straight .
“ So it will probably be something that will become a debate for the entire province , as opposed to simply the residents of the Sunshine Coast . ”
Marvin Rosenau , a fisheries instructor at BCIT , said he did n’t have enough information to assess whether or not fish will die as a result of the planned development .
However , Rosenau told the Straight that he is concerned about the cumulative impact of the numerous independent power projects under way across the province .
“ What you ’re looking at here is not one project but an amalgam of projects , ” he said .
“ These become more viable through economies of scale .
So it ’s kind of like divide and conquer — picking off the enemy one by one with snipers sitting there in the bushes .
Then at the end of the day , you sit back and you realize that the central coast has been industrialized . ”
Plutonic ’s McInnes bristled at being labelled a sniper .
“ The big opposition is by the vocal few , ” he said .
“ The B.C. Hydro employees ’ union is fervently against development by the private sector .
It is reported that they have funded the Western Canada Wilderness Committee to the tune of half a million dollars to fight the existence of private - sector power ” ¦.
They are scaremongering and using environmental impacts in a very negative way , as opposed to being honest about what the debates are about . ”
Gwen Barlee , policy director at the Wilderness Committee , called McInnes ’s allegations “ laughable ” .
The nonprofit organization ’s revenues in 2008 totalled $ 2.26 million , with 66 percent of that coming through donations , Barlee told the Straight .
She claimed that McInnes was trying to minimize the size of the opposition to independent power producers .
“ You are going to see a dramatically broad cross section of people , ” Barlee said of the open houses .
“ I think what you will see is that 90 percent of the room will be made up from local people who are tremendously concerned about this rush to stake and privatize streams and rivers across the province . ”
I ’ve been trying to avoid writing a piece like this simply because if I wrote one , there would be a lot of bitterness involved , and I do n’t like to put a blame on anybody .
But when I saw a lot of confusion over the state of my Calc Solver in Barcelona ( not the least of which is Louis ’ announcement on Calc Solver for 3.0 during his keynote speech , which was truly a bad surprise for me ) , as well as this statement by Stefan Taxhet ( st ) in the issue page outlining Sun ’s intention to duplicate the entire work I did ( for free ) , I felt like it was time for me to explain what actually happened surrounding my effort to write an Optimization Solver for Calc .
Background ( Why I started this )
Back when the OO.o project just started , the Calc team was requesting for two features from the community .
One was advanced statistical analysis add - on , and the other was linear and non-linear optimization solver .
Back then , I had already submitted more than a few bug - fix patches most of which were accepted and integrated ( aside from this 2 and half year old patch which would probably never be integrated and I had already lost my hopes for ) and started feeling comfortable with Calc ’s code base .
As the next step , I wanted to do something bigger , like a full - fledged feature , to try to prove to those Sun guys that they can count on hobbyist hackers writing a significant piece of code .
There was already some effort on writing a Solver for Calc well before I started working on my own ( back in 2004 ) .
One was written in OO.o Basic ( initiated by Jim Thompson ) , and the other was written in Java as a UNO component ( Arun Gaikwad ) .
Unfortunately Jim could not continue his work due to unavailability of spare time because of his other responsibilities ( here is his last email post to sc - dev mailing list ) .
Arun ’s work was promising , but he insisted on integrating his work under GPL , which was not possible at the time because OO.o was licensed under SISSL / LGPL .
The consensus back then was to convince Arun to submit his work under LGPL as an external component , which would legally permit OO.o to include it without compromising the license under which OO.o was distributed .
But the effort to convince Arun failed , and we were back to square one .
During that time , I had already started my own effort on writing a Solver .
My intention was to write a Solver component that would allow a clean integration into OO .o by writing one from scratch .
But since I did n’t have any idea on how to write a solver , my effort started from buying books ( I bought three ) and studying on the subject of operations research .
I did n’t want to announce it at that time simply because I did n’t even know whether I could go anywhere with this , so I worked on this in my spare time , studying the books , writing and testing the algorithms in Python ( with the intention of re-writing them in C++ later ) , and investigating UNO ’s AWT dialog framework because I did n’t want the kludge of adding a Basic layer to my component just for the dialogs .
After months of hacking , finally , the breakthrough happened .
Since I felt comfortable that I could go somewhere with this effort of mine , I made an announcement on the sc - dev mailing list .
Here is my first announcement on the sc - dev mailing list , and the later update .
After that , I was making constant status updates in the Solver issue page as well as the sc - dev mailing list so that the world ( and more importantly the Hamburg team ) knows that I was working on this , to avoid duplication of effort .
Everything was going reasonably well .
Google Summer of Code ( GSOC ) 2005
That year was the first year of Google Summer of Code .
I did n’t think much about that event because I was not a student , and I did n’t think I would be involved in any way .
But to my surprise , Sun decided to post the Solver task as one of the student projects , without even contacting me , despite the fact that they must have known my effort since I diligently made my update known to the public , both on the mailing list as well as the issue page .
And the description of the task sounded as if the task was never touched by anyone .
I was confused .
I thought to myself , they could have at least contacted me how much work was already done before submitting that task to Google as if it was never touched .
Because of that , I was forced to upload my interim code to the issue page to make it clear that part of the work that was planned for GSOC was already finished .
The very next day I uploaded my code , I received privately an angry email from someone who wanted to work on this task , but felt unfair because I uploaded my code to the issue page the very next day of the GSOC announcement .
He was telling me how he did n’t appreciate what I did because he had just wasted 2 hours of his time writing a proposal .
I felt humiliated .
It was not I who decided to register that task as GSOC task , and I was not even contacted !
And I am the one getting this angry email even after I put so much effort writing that code I wrote all in my spare time ?
Who is being unfair now !?
So , I forwarded that email to Erwin Tenhumburg , Louis Suarez Potts and Niklas Nebel , expressing my dissatisfaction on how they decided to register this task with GSOC even though the work was already on - going and they should have at least contacted me on the status of the effort .
Only Erwin replied to my email .
After exchanging several emails between Erwin and myself , they decided to put me as co-mentor of this GSOC task , and put Niklas as the Sun contact in case I need help from Sun .
This is how I ended up mentoring the project for GSOC 2005 .
My memory is vague , but I believe I was the only mentor who was not a Sun employee but a free - lance hobbyist contributor that year .
But mentoring a student , totally on my own time was not very easy .
I did my best , but unfortunately the project was not successful .
In the end , there was no single line of code contributed from the student .
Again , I do n’t mean to put a blame on anyone , and if I had to pick one , I would certainly pick myself to take the blame .
But it simply did n’t work out .
Post GSOC and Joining ooo - build
After the GSOC , I went back to what I was doing before the GSOC , which was to continue to improve the simplex algorithm for linear programming .
At that time , there was one avid user of my Solver from Belgium ( Ludvic Ansiaux ) , who was testing it for every version I released .
He helped me sort out lots of bugs in my optimizer algorithm and some UI issues , so I have to give him a huge thank you for what he did .
To this day , I have never received any help on testing as big as his .
But my progress was slowing down , and I was starting to realize the difficulty of writing a good Solver component , especially the backend optimizer code .
I was simply losing my motivation because of lack of progress .
But I forced myself to go on , simply because I did n’t want all of what had done to be wasted .
Then around January of 2006 , Michael Meeks contacted me , telling me that he was interested in integrating my Solver code into ooo - build – the build used by Linux distributors ( such as Debian , Ubuntu , SuSE ) to ease the pain of integrating new code and distro- specific code into OO.o because of the upstream ’s lack of interest in integrating patches .
I was simply delighted , and did n’t think twice about joining them and making my Solver officially a part of ooo - build .
It was also when the Solver code was morphed into a full fledged module named ‘ scsolver ’ , after Michael reorganized my source tree to fit the OO.o build system .
My excitement was back once again , and I was very delighted to see my Solver distributed in the default OO.o build that comes with openSuSE 10.1 .
That ’s also when I got my first software engineer position at SlickEdit after years of non-IT work in environmental science field .
Unfortunately , however , this also meant that more time was spent on my new job , not because the new job required more hours but because my previous job did n’t constrain me as much in terms of work hours ( in other words , I had more free time then ) .
But I managed to go on improving the linear optimizer .
In the end , however , with Michael ’s suggestion , I decided to ditch my own linear optimizer in favor of using lp_solve maintained by Kjell Eikland and Peter Notebaert , and focus my effort on writing non-linear optimizer instead .
That was actually the right decision because lp_solve is simply a much better optimizer than the one I wrote myself .
At that time , other Linux distributors such as Debian and Ubuntu started including my Solver , suffice it to say that brought more excitement to me .
GSOC 2006
Jody Goldberg decided to register this Solver project as a GSOC task for the year 2006 , and he and I signed up as the co-mentors of this task .
But unfortunately it did n’t attract any students that year , and as a consequence , there was no single line of code contributed .
There was someone else from the Novell side assigned to work on this , and he did work on the code awhile as far as I can tell .
But in the end there was no code either .
Then CWS was created
In September of 2006 , Michael told me that it was now time to upstream the Solver code .
He created a CWS for this ( called scsolver02 ) , and I began working toward putting my code into CWS .
This was not an easy task , however .
For one thing , I had to make the Solver related code a configure - time option ( with -- enable - scsolver option ) , which meant that I needed to find a way to make building of lpsolve and scsolver modules optional .
Now , for someone who was not very familiar with OO.o ’s quite convoluted , unorthodox build system , this seemed like a huge mountain of task ( and it was ) .
But I managed to find a way by looking at other optional modules and trying to make sense of it and do something similar for the lpsolve and scsolver modules .
Besides the above configure issue , I also needed to find a way to make the Solver menu item in the Tools menu optional , which as we discovered was not as easy as it seemed .
But I had to solve these two issues because , obviously , without them being solved , there would be no chance of integration .
So I investigated further .
I believe there was a little confusion even among Sun engineers with regard to how to implement a conditional menu item .
I initially asked Eike on the sc - dev mailing list , and he referred me to the framework - dev mailing list instead .
So I asked the question there , which resulted in this thread .
In short , the discussion started from how to conditionally add a menu item , to how to make my Solver component a pure UNO component to make it truly an optional feature .
But there was one problem : I was using the internal string resource manager API to localize the strings , but there was no UNO equivalent of string resource manager ( an effort only recently included ) .
I was n’t really sure in which direction the discussion was going , and I do n’t really remember if there was any consensus as to what the next step would be ( as far as scsolver 02 cws integration is concerned ) .
But the discussion ended , and I was somewhat left confused , unsure of what to do next .
The specification woes
In addition to the above task , Michael Meeks told me ( perhaps against his belief ) to write a specification which he said was sadly something I needed to write in order to get my code accepted upstream .
I knew how much he was against this whole specification process .
Although I was not in favor of the specification process myself , I was not that much against it at the time .
That said , I had no doubt in my mind that writing a specification for this Solver feature would require a fair amount of time .
In the end , I accepted the task , somewhat unfavorably , in order to get things moving .
Please note that I was doing all of this completely on my own time , and no one was paying me to do any of this .
I had to make a lot of sacrifice with my precious family time to allocate some time to work on this , but I was still left with only 30 minutes up to an hour of time available each day .
Suffice it to say that my progress was very very slow , and since there was no coding involved , my motivation was all time low .
But I kept going , believing that someday all of this would end .
Then the specification template really brought me tons of agony .
Apparently there was some sort of Basic macro embedded in the template itself , to control some list boxes present in the template .
It was designed to run a custom Basic macro every time the value of a list box changes .
However , there was some hard - coded file path in the Basic code that prevented any of this from running properly ( someone told me later that the code would only run properly inside Hamburg ) , so every time I changed the value of a list box , I ’d get a run -time error message .
Not to mention I could n’t author the dialog description part of my specification because of that .
I found myself debugging the basic code , wondering why on earth I had to debug a code when I was supposed to write up a documentation for the feature !
My level of frustration was rising rapidly .
After three days of struggling with the misbehaving basic code , I asked for help , on the spec - dev mailing list .
Then I soon found out that this was not a new problem and others were experiencing it as well .
Two days had passed since I posted my request for help and I was still not getting any reply , so I asked again if anybody was there to comment .
Still no reply from Sun .
My frustration was at its peak because I was really trying to get the spec completed so that I could integrate the CWS and go back to the fun of coding again .
This spec writing ( debugging ? ) non-sense dragged me on for weeks .
Then my patience had run out , and I finally exploded .
At that time , Michael was also running a piece on how the spec process was broken , in a very humorous way .
So I emailed him and dumped my frustration with this whole specification process .
I feel sorry that he had to listen to all my rant , but he was kind enough to listen to all of what I had to say , then after some private email talk between him and someone over at Sun , he eventually initiated this infamous specification thread .
I do n’t want to go into the details of the discussion we had on that thread ( it ’s all public for those who care ) , but it ’s probably sufficient to say that nothing really has changed , except for the fact that now we are allowed to write a specification on the wiki , instead of using the Writer template .
What I was quietly hoping to see out of this discussion was that we could finally abolish this painful specification process , but that unfortunately did n’t happen .
( In retrospect , I was probably a bit too naive to have expected that from Sun . I should have known better . )
So , I was back to having to write a specification .
This time on the wiki , but the same process nonetheless .
After that thread had settled , I already told Michael that , after finishing the integration of the CWS , I did not want to go through the pain of upstreaming again , and that I would like to continue my work in ooo - build only .
But deep down , I even had little motivation left to continue at that point , and I was more or less thinking about what I was going to say as my last word to the project , though part of myself was still wanting to stay with the project ( after all , I loved hacking the OO.o code ) .
I was torn .
For the record , I tried to write a specification even under that kind of mental state , but my fingers would refuse to move , and I found myself sitting in front of my computer not doing a thing .
After joining Novell and licensing change
Long story short , I joined Novell in March 2007 .
I had already decided to leave the project before that , but Novell decided to pick me up .
When Novell asked me whether I would be willing to change the license of the Solver code to LGPL only , I simply agreed .
The change in licensing made perfect sense since the entire code was owned by myself ( ~99 % ) , with a small fraction contributed from Novell and Debian , under LGPL .
But that did not mean that I lost interest in contributing the code upstream .
Quite the opposite .
Since it was made clear back when we were having a licensing discussion with Arun that LGPL code would be perfectly acceptable for upstream integration , I did n’t even expect that changing the license to pure LGPL would make much difference .
As I said in my last comment in the issue page , my hope was to bring this functionality to all users of OO.o , but under a slightly different , more liberal license to make it fair to all the work and support those Novell guys have given me to make all of this possible .
I truly believed what we were asking was a small , small favor , and I believed that we deserve at least that much after all we had done to the project .
Then Louis Suarez Potts announced Sun ’s intension to develop a Solver for 3.0 .
I was there , witnessing his announcement on Calc Solver for 3.0 first - hand .
Again , since it was never communicated with me , I was not quite sure what that announcement meant , until I saw this comment from Stefan Taxhet in the issue page .
So what happens next ?
I simply do n’t know , but one thing is clear .
If Sun insists on rewriting all the work I ’ve already done just to ensure that they own all the code in OO.o , even though it is legally permissible to integrate my code under a pure LGPL license as an external component , then perhaps I need to re-think my relationship with the project .
Because that would be a clear sign that the goal of this project is no longer to work with community developers ( i.e. those who contribute code , not talk ) and create a vibrant open - source project where contributors feel they are making a difference , but to take advantage of free labor to further the corporate goal of Sun Microsystems , by protecting vigorously Sun ’s total ownership of the code base as well as the development process in their entirety .
But I ’d love to be proven wrong .
I ’d love to be proven that Sun still are willing to work with us , to make OO. o truly a wonderful product as well as a project attractive to prospective code contributors .
But there is nothing I , as a single insignificant mere mortal can do to influence the behemoth that is Sun .
It ’s impossible to make an even slightest change in how the project is run , even after countless hours of coding and more than 10,000 lines of code generation ( which I received no compensation for and involved quite a lot of personal sacrifice ) .
In the end , I made no difference at all .
Sad , truly sad .

LOS ANGELES --
At nearly 3 a.m. , William L. McComb stands coatless on a chilly airport sidewalk , waiting to collect a rented Volvo .
The chief executive of Liz Claiborne Inc. left his midtown Manhattan office about 13 ½ hours ago , and must lead an important conference call in three hours .
With a corporate jet , " I would have long ago landed and been at my hotel , " Mr. McComb says wearily .
The boyish - looking executive , who turned 46 Monday , flies nearly 200,000 miles a year , all of them on commercial flights , almost always in coach .
That makes Mr. McComb unusual , given that many CEOs of major companies travel on corporate jets .
Proponents say corporate planes offer executives safety , convenience and rapid access to remote locales .
Company aircraft are a flying office and " a day extender for me , " says James E. Rogers , CEO of Duke Energy Corp. , a Charlotte , N.C. , utility that owns two jets and a helicopter .
After flying to White Plains , N.Y. , for a business dinner this month , " I got back on the [ Duke ] plane and I was home by 10:30 p.m. , " Mr. Rogers recalls .
But public anger and tough times mean more CEOs may soon be joining Mr. McComb on commercial flights .
The heads of the Big Three car makers provoked a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers by traveling to Washington on private jets in November to plead for federal help .
Pound sinks to new record as sterling nears parity with the euro
The run on the pound continued today as sterling headed towards parity with the euro .
Sterling slumped nearly a cent against the single currency to a new all - time low of € 1.1126 before recovering slightly to € 1.1156 .
The pound was buying even less at the tourist rate with holidaymakers able to buy little more than € 1 with £ 1 at bureaux de change .
Sterling has crashed by more than 25 per cent over the last 18 months and more than 12 per cent since September on fears over the state of the UK economy .
The number of families choosing to holiday in Britain - such as Scarborough - could soar by at least one million as a result of the weak pound
It is bad news for those heading to the continent this winter with everything from hotel rooms in Paris to ski passes in the Alps far more expensive than a year ago .
Investors are dumping the pound in favour of the euro on signs the UK recession will be longer and deeper than on the continent .
The euro was trading at 89.01p .
With sterling slumping to another new low against the euro , the number of families choosing to holiday in Britain next year could soar by at least a million .
Holiday operators said self - catering breaks , holiday parks , boat holidays and country lodges on home soil were all proving popular as families already hit by the credit crunch call time on breaks abroad .
Bookings for cheaper local trips such as holiday parks are on the increase
A spokesman for Hoseasons , the UK ’s biggest self - catering holiday operator , said it was seeing a rise in the number of families choosing to stay close to home .
‘ Next year ’s bookings are up 15 per cent on this time last year , ’ he said .
We do n’t think people will stop going on holiday , but they are being more careful about the kind of holiday they choose .
‘ They might have one holiday break in the UK where they can manage their budget more easily than they can abroad .
‘ It also means people are spending their money in the UK , which is helping our economy . ’
Naomi Woodstock , of holiday park company Haven , said destinations such as Great Yarmouth and Scarborough were proving popular .
‘ We are 10 per cent up on advance bookings for next year , ’ she said .
One - for - one :
There are fears the pound could soon hit parity with the euro
‘ The fact that people now get fewer euros for their money is definitely a consideration . ’
Sian Brenchley , a spokesman for VisitBritain , said : ‘ We have found that the economic situation is making people take another look at holidays at home .
‘ We have still got the bucket - and - spade aspect but we have expanded to be so much more , with the regeneration of seaside areas and cities that can rival overseas destinations . ’
Quenton Fyfe , of website AboutBritain.com , said that while overall booking levels were down year - on - year because of the credit crunch , there had also been signs of an increase in European visitors to the UK .
‘ It is better value for people from the eurozone than it has been so it is bound to make us a more attractive holiday destination , ’ he said .
Although the pound gained one cent against the U.S. dollar yesterday , reaching $ 1.49 , the fall against the euro means sterling is now the weakest it has ever been against that currency since it was launched in 1999 .
Yesterday , customers changing £ 200 at Birmingham Airport got only 199 euros after charges – less than one euro to the pound .
Stephen Heath , from the internet - based foreign exchange business FairFX.com , said : ‘ It ’s probably only a matter of time before the pound weakens to a point of currency exchange rate parity with the euro . ’
In recent years , Britons have headed to the US to snap up cheap gifts thanks to the good exchange rate but the tables have now turned .
Store bosses say Americans are coming to London in numbers not seen since before 9/11 .
Up to 10 million overseas visitors are expected to shop in London in the run-up to Christmas , helping to offset the downturn in spending by hard - pressed Britons .
Beverley Aspinall , managing director fo Fortnum & Mason in London , said : ' The strength of the euro has made a huge difference .
Last weekend was really phenomenal .
' More than 70 per cent of the customers in our restaurants were Europeans .
And when they come they do n't just sit down with a salad .
They have a starter , a main , a pudding and a bottle of wine .
It 's great . '
Draw : Tourists are flocking to London 's famous stores such as Harrods , above , to take advantage of the plunging value of the pound
Spending by Americans is up more than 20 per cent on last year but the biggest increase was among visitors from the UAE with a 100 per cent rise , she said .
At Selfridges in Oxford Street spending by Americans is running at 50 to 60 per cent above last year 's levels , while French customers are 30 per cent more lavish .
Its own research found that almost 90 per cent of fashion items are now cheaper in the West End than in equivalent stores in Paris , Milan and New York .
The only major nationality to be less in evidence this Christmas is the Russians , whose money helped fuel a boom in 2006 and last year .
Jace Tyrell , spokesman for the New West End Company , which represents traders in Oxford Street , Bond Street and Regent Street , said : ' It seems a lot of them have gone home . '
Estate agents say wealthy foreign investors are also taking advantage of the weaker pound to pick up bargains .
Trevor Abrahamson , of Glentree International , said he had had three enquiries from purchasers with budgets of up to £ 40 million in the past two weeks .
British government mounts new bank bailout amid warnings of economic collapse
By Jean Shaoul
21 January 2009
Britain's Labour government announced another massive bank bailout on Monday .
It comes just months after the same banks received a £ 500 billion " aid " package from the government that included buying up shares in Britain 's leading high street banks and providing loan guarantees and credit facilities .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown had claimed of his October bailout that it had " saved the banks " .
In reality , the global economic crisis has intensified , plunging the UK into the worst recession since World War II .
The latest measures came as the Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS ) , one of Britain 's largest banks , posted a loss of £ 28 billion for 2008 — the largest corporate loss in UK history .
This includes a £ 20 billion write - down of its purchase of Dutch bank ABN Amro and US bank Capital One .
Banking shares collapsed due to fears about further losses and the expiry of the short - selling ban at the weekend , threatening to pull down the entire banking sector , Britain 's largest and most important industry .
RBS ' shares are worth just 10 percent of their value two years ago .
On Friday , Barclays Bank , which has so far avoided part - nationalisation by the government by seeking funds from Middle East investors , saw its share price collapse by 25 percent .
Overall , British banks are set to lose £ 85 billion over the next three years , far in excess of the £ 50 billion of fresh capital under the October bailout .
According to the Financial Times , the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling admitted that he had not known about the banks ' huge losses when he authorised the purchase of bank shares at prices above the market price .
Despite handing over hundreds of billions of taxpayers ' money , Darling claimed that there had been no time in October to fully scrutinise RBS ' books , as the government 's priority had been to prevent the collapse of the banking system .
Such was the government 's anxiety to announce its latest rescue plan that it has yet to be finalised .
Darling claimed the new package was needed because a collapse of the banking system would bring the entire economy " down with it " .
The chancellor and the prime minister have refused to specify how much the measures will cost or where the money will come from .
Financial commentators believe it could be more than £ 350 billion .
Everything points to another series of hasty improvisations whose bottom line is to provide the means for the financial elite to continue " business as usual " at the expense of millions of working people .
The first measure , aimed at ring - fencing the banks ' toxic assets , will provide insurance for the banks against borrowers defaulting on their existing loans .
Under this Asset Protection Scheme , the banks will pay the government a flat fee , and then the state will cover approximately 90 percent of the losses should the borrower default .
In return , the banks will have to commit to lending more .
The details of the scheme are subject to negotiations that will not be completed until the end of February .
The government has said that it will send in accountants , lawyers , bankers and financial consultants to establish the value of the assets and level of insurance required .
The Financial Times cited an unnamed government official as describing it as " a job - creation exercise for the City " .
While the remark may have been intended as a joke , it is in essence the content of the entire rescue package .
While the government claims that it will not have to negotiate with the banks over the value of the loans , as it would if it were setting up a stand - alone " bad bank " , a solution that had been touted by some , that is exactly what it will be doing , with even less transparency .
Those banks that have not yet written down their bad debts will be required to do so or absorb greater losses than those that have .
But since there is no market for such loans , it is unclear what their value is or whether they have any value at all .
The Asset Protection Scheme paves the way for the taxpayers to assume the burden of all the banks ' toxic assets .
Under the second measure , the government will extend its £ 250 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme , which enables banks to raise funds by issuing new wholesale debt with a five - year maturity date until the end of the year .
Third , the state will guarantee £ 100 billion of asset - backed securities such as mortgages , corporate and consumer debt in an attempt to boost the wholesale markets .
Fourth , while the government 's £ 200 billion Special Liquidity Scheme will close at the end of this month , it has put in place other mechanisms to achieve the same effect .
The Discount Window allows banks to swap " assets " such as sub - prime mortgages for more liquid assets such as government bonds .
For an extra fee , they can be swapped for one year instead of one month .
The government will also ease the terms of the October bailout by offering to convert its preference shares in RBS , Lloyds TSB and HBOS into ordinary shares .
In the case of RBS , this increases the government 's stake from 58 percent to nearly 70 percent and saves RBS £ 1 billion a year by not having to pay a 12 percent interest charge on the shares to the government .
In return RBS will be required to increase its lending to £ 6 billion next year .
Northern Rock , which was nationalised last February to stave off bankruptcy , will be allowed to hold onto its mortgage loans rather than selling them off .
This will mean repaying its debt to the government more slowly .
In another policy reversal , the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) has reduced its requirement for banks ' first tier capital from 8 percent to 4 percent for those banks that took part in the first bailout in an effort to get them to restart lending .
Last and by no means least , the Treasury has followed the US Federal Reserve and put in place the mechanisms , euphemistically called " quantitative easing " , that will allow the Bank of England to inject money into the financial system .
This will enable the Bank to lend to the non-financial sector by buying up assets such as corporate bonds , commercial paper and syndicated loans under the Asset Purchase Facility , up to £ 50 billion in the first instance .
The claim is that this will ensure funds are available to corporations requiring credit where they are unable to raise loans from the banks .
According to the Financial Times , the top 350 listed companies are due to refinance £ 210 billion of loans over the next five years .
Without such a mechanism in place , auditors may refuse to sign off annual accounts as going concerns , effectively bankrupting numerous corporations .
The Asset Purchase Facility also means that the Bank will take on the risk of corporate default on the loans .
But since the Bank does not have the funds , the Treasury will provide the Bank of England with the necessary cash by issuing government debt and indemnify the Bank against default risk .
Thus while the Bank is the conduit for lending to the corporate sector , it is the taxpayers who are , in reality , the bankers .
The big four high street banks have a combined loan book of more than £ 6 trillion , more than four times Britain 's annual GDP of £ 1.3 trillion or 15 times the government 's officially recognised debt .
To put this in some kind of perspective , even a 10 percent increase in RBS ' bad debts , soon to be 70 percent owned by the government , would equal £ 200 billion .
This is equivalent to one - third of annual government spending or double the annual spend on the National Health Service .
Not only does the government 's blank cheque for the banks stand little chance of rescuing either Britain 's banks or the economy , financial commentators are now talking openly about the insolvency of Britain itself .
On Tuesday the pound fell to a seven year low against the dollar , hitting $ 1.3966 from $ 2 less than a year ago .
Jim Rodgers , who founded the Quantum hedge fund with billionaire speculator George Soros , warned that sterling was " finished " and that investors should dump the pound .
Soros and Quantum are credited with forcing sterling 's collapse out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on September 16 , 1992 , by selling short more than $ 10 billion worth of pounds .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Employees of U.S. security firm Blackwater who shot and killed Iraqi civilians should face the death sentence , relatives of some victims said on Sunday .
U.S. law enforcement sources said on Friday that U.S. officials expected to announce charges soon against the security guards over the shooting that killed 17 civilians in 2007 and strained U.S. - Iraqi ties .
“ A death sentence is the least thing ...
In addition the director of Blackwater should be taken to trial .
He gave them the weapons , this authority to block roads and kill civilians , ” said Mohammed al - Kinani , whose son was killed that day .
The news of the case stirred painful memories for Kinani , who was in his car with several family members when it came under fire from Blackwater guards on September 16 last year .
North Carolina - based Blackwater , the largest security contractor in Iraq , has said its guards acted lawfully , and in self - defense after their motorcade came under fire .
No further comment was immediately available over the weekend .
Blackwater is employed in Iraq by the U.S. State Department , and its employees were protecting a diplomatic convoy on the day of the incident .
Blackwater vehicles had closed the road ahead and traffic had come to a stop , Kinani said .
He had heard three or four gun shots .
The situation was calm , he said .
Then one Iraqi vehicle edged forward as its driver spoke to a policeman .
“ When they saw that , they opened fire , with full force , they completely destroyed the car , ” Kinani said .
Gunfire rained down on the area in front of the Blackwater vehicles , Kinani said , hitting vehicles , the pavement , the traffic light and electricity poles .
Car tires exploded and windows shattered as his family cowered in the car .
Kinani said he saw a young man in the car in front of him try to leave his vehicle .
“ They riddled his body with bullets .
He lay on the side of the road and there was blood all around him .
And every minute they ’d return and fire at his body , ” Kinani said .
He tried to dial for help , but a bullet ricocheted off the rear view mirror and smashed the phone from his hand before hitting him in the face , Kinani said .
After about eight to 12 minutes the shooting stopped , said Kinani , who got out of the car .
His young nephew , who was in the vehicle , told him his nine year - old son Ali had been killed .
Ali was slumped against the passenger door , its window shattered .
“ When I opened the door he tumbled out .
His brain fell between my feet , ” Kinani said , breaking down in tears .
LOOKING FOR ANSWERS
The expected charges against the Blackwater security guards come after more than a year of FBI investigations in one of the most high - profile legal cases remaining before President George W. Bush leaves office next month .
The shooting enraged the Iraqi government .
Many Iraqis were also upset in April when the State Department renewed Blackwater ’s contract to protect U.S. personnel in Baghdad .
“ They killed innocent people and there ’s no excuse .
The most severe penalty U.S. law allows would be just , ” said Haythem al - Rubaie , whose wife and son were killed in the incident .
Security firms working for the United States after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion enjoyed immunity from prosecution in Iraq , but that ends on December 31 under a security pact between Baghdad and Washington signed last month .
Both Rubaie and Kinani went to Blackwater ’s offices in Baghdad looking for an apology and an explanation .
“ They said this is $ 20,000 , a gift , not compensation , from the company .
I told them , ‘ You kill my son and give me $ 20,000 ? ’
I do n’t want your $ 20,000 .
You until now have not admitted there was a crime , or apologized , ” Kinani said .
He said he offered to relinquish all legal and monetary claims on Blackwater if they apologized , but the firm declined .
Rubaie said he left a meeting with Blackwater with no answers .
“ I asked Blackwater why they killed my son .
They said they did n’t know .
I asked them why they killed my wife , who was screaming for help after my son was killed ...
He said : ‘ I do n’t know ’ , ” Rubaie said .
“ I told him that if every time I ask you something you tell me ‘ I do n’t know ’ then there ’s no point in us meeting . ”
The BBC came under renewed pressure yesterday to broadcast an emergency appeal for Gaza on behalf of the Disasters Emergency Committee ( DEC ) after it received more than 10,000 complaints about its refusal to show the film .
More than 50 MPs will back an early day motion in the Commons today urging the BBC to reverse its decision .
Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , Ben Bradshaw , the health minister , and Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , all criticised the BBC .
Shahid Malik , the justice minister , said he had not met anyone who supported the BBC 's stance .
Dr Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury , said the BBC should broadcast the appeal by DEC , an umbrella group of humanitarian charities including Oxfam , Save the Children and the Red Cross .
The appeal will be shown tonight on ITV , Channel 4 and Five .
But the BBC is arguing that by screening the humanitarian appeal the corporation " could be interpreted as taking a political stance " .
The Guardian understands that Brendan Gormley , DEC 's chief executive , assured senior BBC executives that the money raised was " for all those affected by the recent conflict " , including people in southern Israel .
But the BBC said last night : " Whilst our records show that DEC stated in principle the aid could be applied to a wider area , they clearly indicated that the situation with Israel was unlikely to need the help of the appeal and in practice the request was solely for Gaza . "
Mark Thompson , the BBC 's director general , said in a blog over the weekend that the " fundamental reason " the BBC refused to broadcast the appeal was to preserve its perceived impartiality .
In discussions after the DEC's Gaza appeal proposal was lodged , Gormley is understood to have told BBC executives the appeal would not just be for Palestinian victims of the conflict .
" The DEC appeal is for those suffering as a result of the Gaza conflict .
The greatest unmet need is in Gaza itself , " a DEC spokesman said yesterday .
" But DEC members are working in Gaza and Israel , and the Red Cross movement have helped to evacuate people living in southern Israel .
We believe that the availability of aid to both Gaza and Israel was understood by the BBC . "
ITV was producing the two - minute appeal last night , which will be shown on the channel before the main news at about 6.25 pm tonight .
The film will be disseminated to other broadcasters and websites , including Channel 4 and Five .
John Ryley , head of news at Sky , was consulting senior colleagues last night about whether it should broadcast the appeal .
About 50 protesters last night staged a noisy but peaceful demonstration in the reception area of BBC Scotland 's headquarters in Glasgow .
" This is not about taking sides in the conflict , " said the Labour MP Richard Burden , who has tabled today 's parliamentary motion .
At a central London fundraiser for the British aid agency Medical Aid for Palestinians several attendees were critical of the corporation last night .
Actor Samantha Morton said she would never work for the BBC again if the corporation failed to show the emergency appeal .
The 31 - year - old Oscar nominee said she was embarrassed to earn money from a corporation that would take such a " horrific " and " disgusting " decision .
Former BBC journalist Rageh Omaar said he thought Thompson had " panicked politically " .
" If he changes his mind now it will be even more disastrous , " Omaar said .
Comedian Bill Bailey said the BBC was showing " moral cowardice " .
Separately , Andrew Hind , the chief executive of the Charity Commission , said the BBC 's refusal would have a direct impact on the money raised .
" I can't see how members of the public will confuse a humanitarian appeal for people in desperate need in Gaza with unbalanced reporting , " he said .
• This article was amended on Tuesday 27 January 2009 .
The chief executive of the Charity Commission is Andrew , not David , Hind .
This has been corrected .
Mankind has been trying to hurt his fellow man since the dawn of time , and technology makes the job much easier .
Modern technology means ' increased lethality ' and scarier weapons - but it can also keep soldiers out of harm 's way , patch them up when they 're hurt and one day , even erase traumatic memories .
These fourteen technologies may sound like the stuff of sci- fi , but they 're rapidly becoming reality .
1. Exoskeletons
Would n't it be great if you could give ordinary soldiers robot strength and stamina ?
Exoskeletons do just that , and as this video shows , they 're not very far away .
They 're also capable of working without a person inside them .
Everybody panic !
2. Smart uniforms
We can't make soldiers invisible just yet , but smart fabrics can make them much harder to see - and almost invisible to night vision goggles , heat sensors and radar kit .
3. Liquid armour
Armour is handy , but it's heavy and inflexible - so scientists have developed liquid armour , which is designed to offer the best of both worlds .
There are two kinds of liquid armour : Shear Thickening Fluid ( STF ) , which hardens on impact , and Magnetorheological ( MR ) fluid , which is essentially iron particles suspended in liquid .
Add a magnetic field and MR fluid becomes solid in fractions of a second .
Of the two , STF liquid armour is the current favourite : MR fluid armour is still a good few years away .
4. Bendy guns
One potentially fatal problem with the good old - fashioned gun is that you need to see what you 're shooting at - so when you pop your head round a corner , the enemy might just pop it off your shoulders .
Enter Cornershot , an Israeli system designed for SWAT teams and special forces .
It 's a simple enough idea : a gun that can be bent at right angles , with a sight that follows the barrel so the operator can see what he or she is shooting at .
5. Sonic bandages
One of the biggest preventable causes of battlefield deaths is from blood loss , so the Deep Bleeder Acoustic Coagulation ( DBAC ) programme is working on ' sonic bandages ' that cauterise wounds with a focused blast of ultrasonic energy .
6. Electronic guns
Metal Storm combines electronic ignition and stacked projectiles to devastating effect - or " increased lethality " , as the brochure puts it .
Its light weight means that Metal Storm guns tend to have lots and lots of barrels firing simultaneously .
It makes a machine gun look like a pea shooter .
7. Rail guns
Rail guns use magnetic fields to blast projectiles at incredible speeds : the US Navy has tested one that fires its load at seven times the speed of sound .
8. Robot bombers
Earlier this week , unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) fired three Hellfire missiles at a house on the Afghan border , killing fugitive Rashid Rauf .
That 's just a taste of what 's on the horizon , because today 's UAVs are titchy compared to projects such as Taranis , which includes building full - size , unmanned fighter jets .
9. Brain erasers
For many soldiers , the trauma of war does n't end when the fighting does - and post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) can make their civilian lives a misery .
A Men In Black - style brain eraser would be a big help , so it 's no surprise that the military is funding research into whether such devices are possible .
Scientist have already found a way to erase mice 's memories , so such tech could well be possible .
10 .
See - through planes
Clearly inspired by Wonder Woman , the MoD wants pilots to be able to see right through their aircraft .
Sadly that does n't mean making planes out of glass with scantily clad lovelies flying them ; it means a heads - up display inside the pilot 's helmet that projects images from outside , enabling the pilot to ' see ' through the metal .
The helmets are currently in development for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter .
11 . Invisible tanks
As the old joke almost put it :
What 's green and invisible ?
That tank .
Last year , the MoD revealed that it was testing invisibility systems for tanks and even troops .
It 's a simple enough idea - cameras film the tank 's surroundings and then project it onto the tank - but it 'll be a few years before it 's battlefield ready .
A proper invisibility cloak is probably decades away .
12 . Pain beams
Want a non-lethal but exceptionally painful energy weapon ?
Then get thee to Raytheon , whose Silent Guardian uses a focused beam of microwave energy to heat up the skin and force enemies to take cover .
As Ars Technica notes , rather brilliantly , this is one area where a tinfoil hat really could defend you .
13 . HAARP
Depending on whom you believe , the High - frequency Active Auroral Research Programme is either a system for better global communications , a space weapon for battling UFOs , an earthquake creator or a mind control ray .
The first explanation comes from military men who can't see a piece of cheese without wondering how to kill people with it ; the others from the tinfoil hat brigade and Muse 's Matt Bellamy .
Who to trust ?
14 . Terminators
We 've got exoskeletons .
We 've got guns .
So why not go the next step into Terminator territory and develop robot brains that would enable the exoskeletons to chase us around with their guns ?
That 's exactly what DARPA 's SyNAPSE ( Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics ) electronic brain programme seems designed to do .
SyNAPSE ? SKYNET , more like .
Everybody panic !
Again !

What do you do when you go to Starbucks and the barista is rude , or your experience downright sucked ?
You could fill out a comment card , but if you 're like me you 're more likely to walk away angry , soured on the brand behind your daily fix .

Watergate and the Future : News for 2009 Russ Baker
Published : Monday December 22 , 2008
Print This Email This
In this guest column , award - winning investigative reporter Russ Baker gives some background on his new book which , in part , explores former President George H.W. Bush 's CIA ties and his little known connections to the Watergate scandal .
One of the fastest ways to raise eyebrows in politically savvy company is to suggest that Richard Nixon was not the villain of Watergate .
Everyone knows that Nixon himself set loose the Watergate burglars and then oversaw the attempted cover - up that followed .
We know this because the most famous journalists of the last fifty years  Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein  made their careers on that story .
I thought I knew it too .
Then I began the research that led to my new book , Family of Secrets : The Bush Dynasty , The Powerful Forces That Put it in the White House , and What Their Influence Means for America .
I had no intention , when I started , of re-opening the Watergate inquiries .
But the trail led there , as I sought to answer a question that somehow has escaped careful attention .
Why did Richard Nixon repeatedly promote George H.W. Bush ( Bush Sr. , or Poppy , as he is known ) for important political posts despite both his apparent lack of qualifications and Nixon 's own privately - expressed doubts about Bush 's mettle ?
Why , even when Nixon became so wary of so many of his appointees that he fired cabinet members en masse , did he continue to be solicitous of Bush Sr . ?
Nixon named the obscure Poppy to be UN ambassador in 1970 and then chairman of the national Republican Party in 1972 .
Even earlier , in 1968 , Nixon actually put Bush Sr. on his list of vice presidential running mate prospects  this not long after Poppy was first elected to the House of Representatives .
Similarly , Nixon 's replacement , Gerald Ford , sent Poppy off as envoy to China and later made him CIA director , though by most accounts he was an odd choice for both of these sensitive jobs .
In short , in the Nixon era , Poppy Bush was the man who always seemed to be around , yet also managed to stay out of the main story .
Digging way back , I came upon evidence that Nixon felt beholden to the Bush family and to the interests it represented .
The reason : Bush Sr.'s father , Senator Prescott Bush , grandfather of George W. Bush , apparently helped launch Nixon 's political career in 1946 as a way of destroying his first opponent , liberal congressman Jerry Voorhis , an outspoken critic of the excesses of bankers and financiers .
Given the current Wall Street disasters , and the role of Prescott 's grandson in enabling them , this revelation has obvious contemporary relevance .
Once I understood this special Nixon - Bush relationship , which is basically missing from all major Nixon biographies , I began to ask what exactly Poppy had been doing during the Watergate years .
This led to the discovery that the Watergate break - in was almost certainly just one of a series of illegal acts that were engineered by people around Nixon , but not by Nixon himself .
Far from defending Nixon 's interests , these people had been privately frustrated with him on a variety of fronts and were now looking to take him down .
Simply put , once Nixon attained the presidency , he struggled for his independence , and began doing things that displeased his former sponsors .
I explored in particular a little - known matter called the Townhouse Affair .
It turns out to be an important precursor to Watergate .
Townhouse and Watergate both had earmarks of involvement by CIA figures .
And I looked at something that has barely emerged in public , but which was discussed by Nixon and his advisers : his ongoing struggle with the CIA .
Combined with other evidence I developed of Poppy Bush 's longstanding involvement with the CIA ( back to the 1950s ) , it becomes apparent that there was more to Watergate than Richard Nixon 's paranoia .
There is not space here for all the particulars I lay out in Family of Secrets .
But a few highlights :
Townhouse appears in retrospect to be an elaborate effort to frame Nixon for financial wrongdoing , by orchestrating a ridiculously shady - looking fundraising operation ( and purported political blackmail scheme ) headquartered in a basement office in a D.C. townhouse .
The people who conjured up and ran Townhouse were tied to Poppy Bush .
Wealthy independent oilmen who backed Bush felt anger and distrust toward Nixon , who proved to be less than entirely reliable on their key issues , such as a tax giveaway called the Oil Depletion Allowance .
Many figures in Nixon 's White House had CIA ties , and appear to have been keeping an eye on him , even as they worked for him .
( The role of the security services raises suggestive questions as a new president prepares to take office  namely , how free is any president to pursue the agenda he promised the voters ?
The ghosts of the Bushes and what they represent will hang over a new President Obama in ways we have never imagined . )
Poppy Bush had extensive secret ties to the intelligence apparatus before he became CIA director in 1976 .
This connection has not previously been reported , and it provides an answer to a question that puzzled observers at the time  namely , what had Poppy Bush ever done to prepare him to lead the nation 's premier spy agency ?
After being named Republican national chairman , Poppy Bush used that position to monitor and help shape the unfolding Watergate affair .
John Dean was much more than a whistleblower .
It appears that he was aware of or even a key figure in the White House covert activities that brought Nixon down , yet encouraged Nixon to take the blame for them .
There is evidence suggesting a connection between Poppy Bush and Dean .
Records show that Bush actually called the then - obscure Dean from his UN office in New York during the earliest days of these events .
Why would the UN ambassador be speaking to a White House counsel ?
The rookie reporter Bob Woodward began working at the Washington Post , and on Watergate in particular , with job recommendations from high officials in the White House who knew him from his days in Naval intelligence work .
and on Watergate in particular , with job recommendations from high officials in the White House who knew him from his days in Naval intelligence work .
A handful of famous Watergate tape excerpts were misconstrued  or in some cases , misleadingly edited  by some in academic , media , legislative and judicial arenas to convey a false impression of what Richard Nixon actually knew  and of how culpable he was .
Watergate special prosecutor Leon Jaworski , a key figure in the ousting of Nixon , was a close Texas friend of Poppy Bush  and steered clear of evidence that pointed to Poppy 's involvement .
Even the notion of " Deep Throat , " purportedly Woodward 's main source ( identified as the recently - deceased FBI man W. Mark Felt ) , may have been part of a CIA - style " psyops " scheme to create the impression of Nixon 's culpability .
Some key figures claim that there was in fact no " Deep Throat " at all .
Nixon suspected the CIA of surrounding him and then setting him up .
From his own days supervising covert operations as vice president , he recognized that the Watergate burglars and their bosses were seasoned CIA hardliners with ties to the Bay of Pigs invasion and events linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
Nixon battled the CIA for files on what he called the " Bay of Pigs thing , " but never could get access to them .
In sum , I found that the very people who created Nixon and used him to advance their own political interests ended up destroying him .
Nixon 's famous paranoia , in other words , had a basis in reality .
All of this , and much more , arose directly from my research , which is carefully documented in Family of Secrets and in more than 1000 source notes .

PHOENIX ( Reuters ) -
In the final stretch to the U.S. presidential election , more than three quarters of likely Hispanic voters say they support Democrat Barack Obama over Republican John McCain , a study found .
The Univision / Reuters / Zogby poll released on Tuesday said that 78 percent of a sample of 1,016 Latino likely voters favored Sen. Obama , with 13 percent supporting McCain , an Arizona senator .
The poll , which was conducted between October 30 and November 2 , found that 54 percent of respondents said the economy and jobs were the most important issue in deciding who to vote for , followed by health care and immigration , with 12 percent and 11 percent respectively .
Hispanics make up 15 percent of the U.S. population and 9 percent of the electorate , and could be a critical swing voting bloc in battleground states in the U.S. Southwest as well as Florida on Tuesday .
In 2004 , President George W. Bush won about 40 percent of the Latino vote -- a Republican record -- when he beat Democrat John Kerry .
But opinion polls show Republican standing among Hispanics has since been hurt by a shrill national debate over immigration reform and a worsening economy .
A survey by Zogby International last month found that 70 percent of Hispanic likely voters favored Obama , with 21 percent favoring McCain .

DNA research and Mormon scholars changing basic beliefs By Patty Henetz , Associated Press SALT LAKE CITY 
Plant geneticist Simon Southerton was a Mormon bishop in Brisbane , Australia when he woke up the morning of Aug.
3 , 1998 to the shattering conclusion that his knowledge of science made it impossible for him to believe any longer in the Book of Mormon .
Two years later he started writing Losing a Lost Tribe : Native Americans , DNA and the Mormon Church , published by Signature Books and due in ctores next month .
Along the way , he found a world of scholarship that has led him to conclude The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints belief is changing , but not through prophesy and revelation .
Rather , Southerton sees a behind - the - scenes revolution led by a small group of Brigham Young University scholars and their critics who are reinterpreting fundamental teachings of the Book of Mormon in light of DNA research findings .
Along the way , he says , these apologist scholars , with the apparent blessing of church leadership , are contradicting church teachings about the origins of American Indians and Polynesians .
" You 've got Mormon apologists in their own publications rejecting what prophets have been saying for decades .
This becomes very troubling for ordinary members of the church , " Southerton said .
And while the work of the BYU apologists — the term means those who speak or write in defense of something — remains confined largely to intellectual circles , some church members who have always understood themselves in light of Mormon teachings about the people known as Lamanites are suffering identity crises .
" It 's very difficult .
It is almost traumatizing , " said Jose Aloayza , a Midvale attorney who likened facing this new reality to staring into a spiritual abyss .
" It 's that serious , that real , " said Aloayza , a Peruvian native born into the church and still a member .
" I 'm almost here feeling I need an apology .
Our prophets should have known better .
That 's the feeling I get . "
Southerton , now a senior researcher with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Canberra , Australia , has concluded along with many other scientists studying mitochondrial DNA lines that American Indians and Polynesians are of Asian extraction .
For a century or so , scientists have theorized Asians migrated to the Americas across a land bridge at least 14,000 years ago .
But Mormons have been taught to believe the Book of Mormon — the faith 's keystone text — is a literal record of God 's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas who descended from the Israelite patriarch Lehi , who sailed to the New World around 600 B.C.
The book 's narrative continues through about 400 A.D.
The church teaches that Joseph Smith translated this record from gold plates found on a hillside in upstate New York in 1820 , when he was 14 .
The Book of Mormon was first published in 1830 .
In Mormon theology , Lamanites are understood as both chosen and cursed : Christ visited them , yet their unrighteousness left them cursed with dark skin .
The Book of Mormon says Lamanites will one day be restored to greatness through the fullness of the gospel .
( The original 1830 version of the Book of Mormon said they would become " white and delightsome ; " in 1981 , the passage was changed to " pure and delightsome . " )
Though not mentioned specifically in the Book of Mormon , Polynesians have been taught they are a branch of the House of Israel descended from Lehi .
Traditionally , Mormons have understood the Book of Mormon to cover all of the Americas in what is known as the hemispheric model .
At a Bolivian temple dedication in 2000 , church prophet and President Gordon B. Hinckley prayed , " We remember before Thee the sons and daughters of Father Lehi . "
And in 1982 , the church 's then - President Spencer Kimball told Samoans , Maori , Tahitians and Hawaiians that the " Lord calls you Lamanites . "
Southerton 's book details how these teachings have helped LDS efforts to convert new members , especially among Indians in Latin America and Maoris in New Zealand .
He also offers primers on Mormon history and American race relations , quick tutorials on DNA research and syntheses of Mormon - related genetic research and DNA scholarship .
But in light of BYU scholars ' recent opinion that the Book of Mormon 's events could only have occurred in parts of Mexico and Guatemala — that is , Mesoamerica — the final third of the book is dedicated to examining the work of LDS scholars at the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies , or FARMS , established 25 years ago and housed at BYU .
FARMS findings on Mesoamerica are based on the Book of Mormon 's " internal geography , " that is , descriptions of how long it took the ancient peoples to get from one place to another .
The apologists now believe the events occurred only hundreds of miles from each other , not thousands — provoking new questions including how the Americas could have been so rapidly populated with people speaking so many languages without the presence of vast numbers of people who never appear in the narrative .
In a telephone interview from his Canberra office , Southerton said that keeping up with the rapidly growing body of work in genetic research made it difficult for him to finish the book while also keeping it up - to - date with critics and apologists and those in between all seeking to reframe the Book of Mormon in light of DNA research .
In particular , he 's tried to keep up with FARMS qrticles , which he said are " completely at loggerheads with what the church leaders are teaching . "
Church spokesman Dale Bills on Thursday said the church teaches only that the events recorded in the Book of Mormon took place somewhere in the Americas .
The doctrine of the church is established by scripture and by the senior leadership of the Church , the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve .
" Faithful Latter - day Saint scholars may provide insight , understanding and perspective but they do not speak for the church , " he said .
On its Web site , under the " Mistakes in the News " heading , the church declares , " Recent attacks on the veracity of the Book of Mormon based on DNA evidence are ill considered .
Nothing in the Book of Mormon precludes migration into the Americas by peoples of Asiatic origin .
The scientific issues relating to DNA , however , are numerous and complex . "
The site then offers Web links to five articles , four of which were published last year in the Journal of Book of Mormon Studies , a FARMS publication .
Aloayza believes that is tacit approval of what FARMS is saying .
" There is such a huge divide between what the scholarly elite with the LDS church knows and will discuss and what the ordinary member knows , " Aloayza said .
" The burden of proof is on the people who are advancing the Book of Mormon as the word of God . "
BYU political science professor and FARMS director Noel Reynolds said FARMS reseabch and writings are not aimed at proving or disproving the Book of Mormon .
" We understand the difficulties of that .
We get dragged into these discussions repeatedly because of books like Southerton 's or ordinary anti-Mormon questions , " he said .
The work of FARMS should n't be considered counter to church doctrine because the geography of the Book of Mormon has " never been a matter of official church pronouncement , " Reynolds said .
While believing in a hemispheric model might be considered " naive , " he said , " it 's also fair to say that the majority of LDS over a period of time have accepted a hemispheric view , including church leaders . "
Added FARMS founder and BYU law professor John Welch , " We do n't speak officially for the church in any way .
These are our opinions , and we hope they 're helpful . "
Southerton , who no longer is a member of the church , said given the state of DNA research and increasing lay awareness of it , church leaders ought just to own up to the problems that continued literal teachings about the Book of Mormon present for American Indians and Polynesians .
" They should come out and say , ' There 's no evidence to support your Israelite ancestry , ' " Southerton said .
" I do n't have any problem with anyone believing what 's in the Book of Mormon .
Just do n't make it look like science is backing it all up . "

In their attempts to halt credit deflation , the government and the Fed are unleashing a torrent of corruption , inefficiency , misuse of funds , and fraud .
If a bank is too big to fail and the government and / or the Fed make sure that it survives , despite the past mis-behaviors of its officers , then they invite those officers to misuse the funds that they infuse .
Any transfer of money ( or funds ) from stockholders and lenders to corporate officials is accompanied by methods of controlling the behavior of those officials .
Transfers of money from taxpayers to governments also necessitate methods of control .
Without such methods , officials , bureaucrats , and politicians have an incentive to engage in a range of behaviors that harm the interests of those who are supplying the funds .
The control methods include audits , reporting requirements , boards of directors , independent committees , governance methods , arms - length dealings , ethical training , laws concerning fiduciaries , laws against fraud and malfeasance , freedom of obtaining information , and so on .
All of these methods also require effective enforcement if they are to do their job .
Much of this control goes on without much publicity , until a highly - publicized breakdown occurs such as in the case of the Madoff fraud .
But there cannot be well - functioning markets or well - functioning governance , corporate or non-corporate , private or public , business or non-business , without an extensive set of methods to control the behavior of agents who are entrusted with the money of principals .
Even before the recent bailouts , the federal government and the Fed were supplying enormous amounts of money to a variety of persons .
It is common knowledge that their controls over the use of these funds are not anywhere near what they should be .
The main reason for this is that these institutions are themselves poorly controlled by their constituencies who are forced to accommodate them .
Taxpayers are forced to pay taxes , no matter how badly the funds are used .
All of us are forced to accept dollars as legal tender .
The instances of government waste are well - known .
The frauds committed against the Medicare program are large and numerous , but these are facilitated by the poor controls that we have over government and its poor controls over the funds that it extracts from us .
The gross over - charging by defense contractors is constantly documented .
In a war like that in Iraq , the entire war with its insanely high costs is an example of non-existent control of funds by those paying the bills .
The entire war is a fraud in that public officials misrepresent its costs and benefits in order to gain public approval for their misuse of the public ’s money .
These and more like them are examples of what happens when there are poor controls over the use of money that has been transferred from agents to principals .
Bernard Madoff is now famous for having catapulted himself into the ranks of a large - scale fraud that rivals what occurs constantly between government and taxpayers and then , again , between government and its contractors .
The last year has seen government and the Fed ramp up their relatively uncontrolled dispersion of money to new heights .
In an extraordinarily brief period of time and acting in great haste , we have seen a $ 700 billion bailout program passed by Congress along with the nationalization of such huge failures as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
We have seen the Fed expand its loans in all sorts of directions , including a private insurance company , foreign central banks , commercial paper , and any number of insolvent U.S. banks .
We have seen the U.S. government make any number of new and expanded financial commitments and guarantees that can explode its solvency at any time and lead to very high costs to society .
Once again , the government and the Fed are committing massive frauds .
They are intentionally deceiving the public about the necessity and benefits of these expenditures .
A great deal of money is being transferred to persons who should be absorbing losses that they are responsible for .
At the same time , we have not seen anywhere near sufficient controls instituted over the uses of these funds .
If we did have such controls , the federal government would be electing directors to bank boards across the country .
The socialization of finance would come out into the open .
Over time , as these funds begin to be misused by those who are receiving them , because the control mechanisms put in by the government are so weak , we can expect to see a gradual tightening of control which will bring the government control more and more into the open .
We can also expect a greater politicization of the process .
If proper controls were in place , the Fed would not be releasing funds wholesale and at preferential rates to entire classes of borrowers .
It would be carefully negotiating loans with controls over their use with individual borrowers .
We have not seen even an accounting for the Fed ’s loans .
The Fed refuses to reveal information about the nature of its loans .
The government never controls the uses of its money in a way that is acceptable to taxpayers .
Its controls are always weaker than even private sector controls , and private sector controls have many problems as it is .
But now that the government is bailing out banks and businesses , the problems get even worse .
To the extent that the government attempts to control those who receive its funds , it socializes the economy more than ever .
The bigger the bailouts are , either the waste due to lack of control rises steeply , or else , if controls are put in place , the socialization of business with all its inefficiencies rises steeply .
The public loses in either case .
We have always had these same issues of control of money and socialization before us .
The Medicare program wastes huge amounts of money by its poor insurance structure .
This represents a failure in control of how taxpayers ’ funds are spent .
On the other hand , to the extent that Medicare attempts to control how the funds are spent , it tells hospitals , doctors , and patients what they must do .
We encounter the same dilemma as in the bailouts and the Fed loans .
We are damned if they do not control , for that creates incentives for fraud , waste , misuse of money , and inefficiencies .
But we are damned if they do control , for that brings even greater socialization with all of its attendant evils .
The more money that the government spends on bailouts , the more that it maintains already corrupt and inefficient institutions in place .
It provides them with greater incentives to laxity , misuse of funds , and even frauds .
Public works spending will be no different .
The housing and construction lobbies are powerful .
They find many allies in city , education , and state lobbies .
The National Association of Realtors , the National Association of Homebuilders , and the Mortgage Bankers Association are powerful .
They are sometimes joined by the National Education Association that fears losses of local property tax revenues .
They are joined at times by the National League of Cities , the National Conference of State Legislatures , the Council of State Governments , and the National Association of Counties .
Does the unorganized public stand a chance against these organized groups ?
Public works spending is public fraud .
One only need note that there is just as little accountability of the funds spent as with the Fed ’s loans .
The politicians intend to deceive the public and misrepresent the benefits and costs of public works projects .
Graft and kickbacks are present through campaign contributions and gifts .
These are the kinds of factors that signal that public works spending is actually a fraud .
The politicians wave job creation numbers before the press , knowing full well that the process is a fraud .
Biden is now claiming how carefully projects will be selected .
This is totally unbelievable .
It is rhetoric to gain support .
The money will be dissipated on bike paths , costly earthquake resistant building improvements , devices to save energy that cost more than they return , increases in Medicaid , modernization of classrooms that do not improve education in the slightest , and all manner of environmental fads .
Much of the public knows this , but the government uses its media platform to defuse any dissent while it extols the virtues of its actions .
This deception is at the heart of the fraud .
When it comes to government and money , we are between two rocks and a hard place .
The government ’s uses of forced exactions ( taxes ) are not controlled by the principals ( the taxpayers . )
In the next stage , which is when government spends the money , it fails to control the uses .
Waste , improvidence , and inefficiency are government hallmarks .
Earmarking funds for favored interest groups is standard operating procedure , and that induces these groups to laxity , corruption , misuse of funds , and fraud .
But when the government attempts to control its use of funds by controlling the behavior of its recipients , then heavy - handed and inefficient socialism and fascism rear their ugly heads .
The largest frauds in our society are the frauds of government .
The largest frauds in our society are the frauds of elected leaders .
They constantly betray the public trust , a term that has largely disappeared from their lips .
Bailouts ,
Fed loans , and public works projects spread the poison more widely , inducing even more private sector laxity , inefficiency , kickbacks , payoffs , and corporate and business malfeasance .
This will not diminish until those who supply the money control the uses of that money .

Carbon Nanotubes Might Be Used in Future Water Filters
September 15th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Nanotechnology seems to be invading all facets of modern life , from the pills you take to the batteries that power your iPod .
Pretty soon , carbon nanotubes may even filter your water .
Researchers at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in India are investigating the hollow carbon fibers as a potential water filter .
They believe the unique chemical properties of nanotubes mean that only water molecules can pass through their interiors , while toxic metal ions , viruses , and bacteria cannot .
Additionally , the smooth , water - repellent interior of the nanotubes means that a filter made from the technology would have a high flow rate of water without fouling — so it would be very efficient .
But there ’s still plenty of work to be done before carbon nanotubes are a viable option for filtering .
The Indian research team is currently trying to engineer nanoscale structures to form arrangements that can efficiently decontaminate water .
With the rapid rise of contaminated drinking water around the world , solutions are desperately needed .
Since poor countries are more likely to lack access to drinking water , a carbon nanotube filter will be most useful if it is both simple and cheap to operate and maintain .
And if that massive hurdle is surpassed , developing nations may suddenly be a lot better off .

( CNN ) --
A severe ice storm prompted President Bush to declare Saturday that a state of emergency exists in northern Massachusetts , a move that authorizes the use of federal aid to help the recovery effort .
This week 's ice storm felled many trees in Boston and elsewhere across Massachusetts .
The Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are to coordinate relief efforts in the counties of Berkshire , Bristol , Essex , Franklin , Hampden , Hampshire , Middlesex , Suffolk and Worcester .
By Saturday night , there were 180,000 customers without power , said James Mannion , deputy public information officer for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency .
The declaration " frees up resources from other states around us , " he said , adding that state officials have asked FEMA for cots to be used in 70 shelters , where 1,300 people were expected to spend Saturday night .
In addition , 750 National Guard troops were deployed in the affected area , he said .
Though much of the ice melted Saturday , it refroze Saturday night .
Do n't Miss Storm leaves 1 million without power in Northeast
" The big problems here are , obviously , the power outages , " he said .
Some towns , like Westford , a town of 16,000 residents in northeastern Massachusetts , had no power , he said .
Officials were working to clear roads so that power crews could get in .
Gov. Deval Patrick declared a statewide state of emergency on Friday in response to the storm , which struck Thursday and continued into Saturday .
Milder weather was forecast for Sunday .
All About Massachusetts • FEMA
Bernanke and the Fed have to be miffed over their lack of traction in addressing the credit bubble .
Of course if Bernanke understood simple economics as explained in Impossible To Get Something For Nothing , he would not be doing the silly things he is doing such as running out of letters in his alphabet soup of lending facilities .
Today we see yet another lending facility and fittingly enough it is called the MMIFF .
Inquiring minds are reading the Fed 's Press Release On the MMIFF .
The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday announced the creation of the Money Market Investor Funding Facility ( MMIFF ) , which will support a private - sector initiative designed to provide liquidity to U.S. money market investors .
Under the MMIFF , authorized by the Board under Section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRBNY ) will provide senior secured funding to a series of special purpose vehicles to facilitate an industry - supported private - sector initiative to finance the purchase of eligible assets from eligible investors .
Eligible assets will include U.S. dollar - denominated certificates of deposit and commercial paper issued by highly rated financial institutions and having remaining maturities of 90 days or less .
Eligible investors will include U.S. money market mutual funds and over time may include other U.S. money market investors .
The MMIFF complements the previously announced Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) , which on October 27 , 2008 will begin funding purchases of highly rated , U.S. - dollar denominated , three - month , unsecured and asset - backed commercial paper issued by U.S. issuers , as well as the Asset Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ( AMLF ) , announced on September 19 , 2008 , which extends loans to banking organizations to purchase asset backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds .
The AMLF , CPFF , and MMIFF are all intended to improve liquidity in short - term debt markets and thereby increase the availability of credit .
Got That ?
The MMIFF is intended to help restore liquidity to the money markets .
The MMIFF will be a credit facility provided by the Federal Reserve to a series of special purpose vehicles established by the private sector ( PSPVs ) in accordance with the terms described below .
Each PSPV will purchase eligible money market instruments from eligible investors using financing from the MMIFF and from the issuance of asset - backed commercial paper ( ABCP ) .
The MMIFF is authorized under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
Eligible Assets of a PSPV
A PSPV will purchase from eligible investors at amortized cost U.S. dollar - denominated certificates of deposit , bank notes , and commercial paper with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less .
Each PSPV will only purchase debt instruments issued by ten financial institutions designated in its operational documents .
Each of these financial institutions will have a short - term debt rating of at least A - 1 / P -1/F1 from two or more major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ( NRSROs ) .
PSPV Concentration Limit
At the time of a PSPV ’s purchase of a debt instrument issued by a financial institution , the debt instruments of that financial institution may not constitute more than 15 percent of the assets of the PSPV .
Liabilities of a PSPV
Each PSPV will finance its purchase of an eligible asset by selling ABCP and by borrowing under the MMIFF .
The PSPV will issue to the seller of the eligible asset ABCP equal to 10 percent of the asset ’s purchase price .
The ABCP will have a maturity equal to the maturity of the asset and will be rated at least A - 1 / P - 1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs .
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRBNY ) will commit to lend to each PSPV 90 percent of the purchase price of each eligible asset until the maturity of the asset .
The FRBNY loans will be on an overnight basis and at the primary credit rate .
The loans will be senior to the ABCP , with recourse to the PSPV , and secured by all the assets of the PSPV .
Downgrade or Default of an Eligible Asset
If the debt instruments of a financial institution held by a PSPV are no longer eligible assets due to a short - term debt rating downgrade , the PSPV must cease all asset purchases until all of the PSPV ’s assets issued by that financial institution have matured .
Upon a default of any asset held by a PSPV , the PSPV must cease all asset purchases and repayments on outstanding ABCP .
Proceeds from maturation of the PSPV ’s assets will be used to repay the FRBNY and , upon maturation of all assets in the PSPV , any remaining available cash will then be used to repay principal and interest on the ABCP .
Any excess spread will be allocated as described below .

Fed to Provide Up to $ 540 Billion to Aid Money Funds
The Federal Reserve will provide up to $ 540 billion in loans to help relieve pressure on money - market mutual funds beset by redemptions .
" Short - term debt markets have been under considerable strain in recent weeks " as it got tougher for funds to meet withdrawal requests , the Fed said today in a statement in Washington .
A Fed official said that about $ 500 billion has flowed since August out of prime money - market funds , which with other money - market mutual funds control $ 3.45 trillion .
The initiative is the third government effort to aid the funds , which usually provide a key source of financing for banks and companies .
" The problem was much worse than we thought , " Jim Bianco , president of Chicago - based Bianco Research LLC , said in a Bloomberg Television interview .
Policy makers are trying to prevent " Great Depression II " by stemming the financial industry 's contraction , he said .
JPMorgan Chase & Co. will run five special units that will buy up to $ 600 billion of certificates of deposit , bank notes and commercial paper with a remaining maturity of 90 days or less .
The Fed will provide up to $ 540 billion , with the remaining $ 60 billion coming from commercial paper issued by the five units to the money - market funds selling their assets , central bank officials told reporters on a conference call .
The new program is called the Money Market Investor Funding Facility , and officials said it 's intended as a backstop for money - market mutual funds to use as needed to meet redemptions .
BBC personality made 40 false rape allegations against her ex-boyfriend whose life remains blighted by her lies
' Robert ' says his life has been shattered despite being cleared of any allegations
A BBC personality has shattered her ex-boyfriend 's life by falsely accusing him of rape .
The woman , who has broadcast to television audiences of millions , accused him of raping her 40 times throughout their two - and - a - half - year relationship .
He was arrested , held in a police cell and handcuffed as police searched his flat for evidence of his crime .
But she retracted her allegation weeks later , and the officer investigating the claims described them as ' inconsistent ' and ' not credible ' .
Despite the lack of evidence , the incident remains on the Police National Computer thanks to a legal loophole , which campaigners say is blighting the lives of falsely accused men .
Even if the ' victim ' withdraws their allegation , it will show up under enhanced Criminal Records Bureau checks that are undertaken regularly on people who apply for jobs with employers such as the NHS or schools .
It will also prevent them from travelling to the United States .
The boyfriend cannot be identified to protect his accuser 's anonymity , but wants to make his case public .
He said : ' The lies she told have ruined my life .
Yet , while I have lost out on jobs and been left paranoid and scared of women , she has got away without punishment .
We 're not even allowed to reveal her identity .
Rape is a horrific crime , and there is no way I am capable of committing it .
' I do n't care how successful she is , she should be sent to prison .
Of course , the BBC does n't know what she has done .
But if they were to find out I would like to think they 'd sack her . '
Fewer than six per cent of reported rapes result in a conviction , but according to Tim Murray of the False Rape Society , this case is typical .
' Thousands of innocent men are tainted for ever by an unfair system , ' he said .
' The accused should have the right to remain anonymous until a conviction .
If they are cleared , the incident should be erased from their records . '
Robert - not his real name - is an articulate man in his 50s who met the BBC star in London in 2003 .
A keen amateur photographer , he was there to take promotional shots .
The woman , who we will call Charlotte , was working for a commercial television station and asked Robert if he would take some publicity pictures to help further her career .
Within weeks they had embarked on a physical relationship .
' In addition to being very beautiful she was intelligent and funny .
She was , still is , ambitious .
Her career and becoming famous meant more to her than anything , ' he said .
The pair filmed many of their encounters at his Central London flat , something he said was Charlotte 's idea .
' It turned her on and I enjoyed it too , ' he said .
' We agreed from the start that we'd have an open relationship .
But we did n't just have sex .
We cooked together , went to restaurants .
I supported her whenever she was down . '
Robert , who separated amicably from his wife , with whom he has two teenage children , ten years ago , was introduced to her friends , but not her family .
' They have strict views on sex before marriage and Charlotte wanted them to believe she was a virgin . '
Still in her 20s , there was a considerable age gap between the two .
' It was flattering at first , ' he admits .
' But as the months went by I became more self - conscious about it .
Plus , I started to mistrust Charlotte .
She lied to me about her whereabouts .
And I knew she wanted to marry another boyfriend . '
By March 2006 he decided to end the relationship .
He arranged to visit Charlotte 's London home to pick up the keys to his flat from her .
Yet as he was waiting outside in his car , he was arrested .
He was taken first to Hendon Police Station in North London , then to Marylebone police station , where he was accused of raping her , spiking her drinks , blackmailing and threatening to kill her .
' I was confused and powerless .
I imagined myself in prison for life .
I respect women and would not dream of touching one against her will .'
While in custody , Robert , a former employee of an international trading company , suggested the police visit his flat to pick up the DVDs he and Charlotte had made .
' I knew they should prove my innocence , ' he said .
Men who are falsely accused of rape can have their lives ruined as the allegations remain on the police 's computer ( pictured posed by model )
He also thinks the footage was the reason for his arrest in the first place .
' Once I ended the relationship she became paranoid I would blackmail her with the DVDs , ' he said .
' But she was judging me by her standards . '
After seven hours , he was released on bail .
' I dreaded telling my children and ex-wife what had happened , ' he recalled .
' Charlotte had befriended them , even picking my children up from school .
Luckily they supported me from the start . '
In police records , obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request and seen by The Mail on Sunday ,
Charlotte claimed that Robert had been blackmailing her by threatening to sell the DVDs to the Press .
She said he spiked her drink before they had sex and threatened to kill her if she left him .
' It was all nonsense , fabricated to substantiate her claim , ' he said .
' She once told me she had been raped twice before .
Now I think she uses both the allegation , and sex in general , as some kind of tool to get what she wants . '
As the days passed , the police began to find Charlotte 's evidence increasingly ' tenuous ' .
The DVDs showed that Charlotte ' would appear to be fully participating in sexual acts ' .
On May 18 , perhaps knowing her account contained , as police put it , a ' number of inconsistencies ' , she withdrew the allegation .
The police officer recorded the incident as ' no crime ' .
Robert then received a letter saying he was released from bail and that no further action would be taken .
' But there was no apology from Charlotte or the police , ' he says .
His anger was exacerbated when police told him in a letter that ' the matter remains recorded as rape ' .
It was eventually downgraded to ' an allegation of rape ' after he protested .
Although the allegation had been withdrawn , one police officer had written in his records that : ' There is insufficient additional verifiable information to determine that no notifiable offence has been committed . '
Surprisingly , the law permits officers to register their disagreement with the outcome of a case in police records , with potentially devastating repercussions .
While Charlotte 's anonymity is guaranteed by the Sexual Offences ( Amendment ) Act of 1976 , Robert 's ordeal will remain on his file indefinitely .
He believes he has been rejected from a job as a Home Office interpreter because he failed to clear criminal checks .
An application for a US visa requires him to state whether he has ever been arrested for a crime , and he says he did not apply for a job as a photographer in London schools because his records would stop him being offered it .
A police spokesman would not discuss individual cases but said : ' The current Association of Chief Police Officers guidelines state that police forces retain allegations of serious crime for ten years .
We are liaising with ACPO and the Information Commissioner about a review of this policy . '
It was announced recently on the Clojure Google Group that a hospital services system has been developed , in part using Clojure , and has been put into live production use in a major veterinary hospital .
The product appears to use several languages and technologies , but Clojure appears to play an important role .
This announcement carries some signficance , as it is one of the first published reports of Clojure being used in a large - scale production deployment , particularly one as sensitive as a hospital environment .
As a language , Clojure is relatively young , having only been under development for a few years .
The core of the product is an HL7 - compliant message bus .
The routing and archiving of messages , as well as the fault tolerance and error handling of the bus are all controlled by Clojure :
We designed an HL7 message bus to link several services within the hospital .
Presently we link the medical record system with the radiology department .
The main benefit is to avoid re-keying information about patient and requests in every system .
We also provide some key applications on the bus to allow people to share information in a consistent way along the system they use on a daily basis .
It 's like a Babel tower , radiologists want to work with their radiology system while the administration wants to work with the medical record system to bill , ... each of these systems meet specific needs of a user base .
However there is a need for a common ground to share information .
That 's what our product offers .
There are a number of other technologies and specifications listed as used in the application , including :

Malaysian Fisherman Reels in Shark with ' Webbed Feet '
PENANG , Malaysia --
Has anyone ever seen a baby shark with webbed feet ?
A worker of the Malaysian Fisheries Development Board ( LKIM ) in Batu Maung , Penang , made this unusual find when she was given the 1.7kg fish by a fisherman at the jetty recently .
Mary Looi , 48 , said she only realised the shark was different when she wanted to cook tomyam fish for lunch for her family .
“ It was only when I was about to cut the shark the day after I received it that I found two webbed feet sticking out from the lower part of the body .
“ The shark is one - metre long , ” she said .
Looi said she dared not cook the fish after consulting her husband Gooi Man Kaw , 57 , who told her that according to Chinese belief , eating fish with unusual features could bring disaster or ill luck .
“ Immediately , I returned the fish to the fisherman that night at about 10 pm .
“ He threw it back into the sea , ” said Looi .
Looi , who has been working at LKIM for 10 years , said this was the first time she had stumbled upon such an unusual find .
When contacted , Universiti Sains Malaysia ( USM ) Muka Head marine research station head Prof Dr Zulfigar Yasin said this is the first time he had heard of fish with legs found in the Malaysian waters .
“ There is a possibility that the fish could have swum from other waters into Malaysian waters .
“ As far as I am concerned , fish species with legs or bony fins can only be discovered in the waters of North Sulawesi in Indonesia or South Africa , ” he said .

Apparently … these things are hi-tech ( a.k.a. “ ugly ” ) From Men ’s Fitness :
Together , the jersey and shorts are 31 % lighter than the typical NBA uniform .
Before , layers of twill were sewn together , bogging down the garment .
Now added elements , like conference names and player numbers , are bonded on with a heated glue .
From a comfort standpoint , the jerseys are tighter fitting and the seams are heat welded , not sewn .
That means better mobility and less abrasion for players inside the uniforms .
Yeah … when I think of NBA uniforms …
I ’m always thinking “ why do they make those guys wear those heavy things ?
Although , this innovation is cool :
League rules state that jerseys must stay tucked in at all times .
The gripper elastic waistband keeps the jersey in place , giving players one less thing to worry about “ in the heat of battle . ”
The McCain - Palin ticket has developed an interesting campaign strategy .
They do n't want the public to see their plans to dismantle social security , Medicare and the system of employer - provided healthcare .
To distract people from these policies that will directly affect their lives they are taking politics to new lows .
Among the highlights for the cesspool two is the nonsense that Barack Obama was calling Sarah Palin a barnyard animal when he used the old expression " putting lipstick on a pig " .
Then John McCain told us that he approved of an ad calling Obama a sexual pervert .
These two are happy to throw out any sort of vile lie because the more time the media and the public spend focusing on this garbage , the less time they will have to notice that McCain wants to privatise and cut their social security .
McCain thinks that America 's workers have it too easy when they retire .
He wants them to retire later and have less money when they do .
In addition to cutting social security , he is also likely to cut Medicare benefits .
He has railed about " entitlements " in the past , and because of our broken healthcare system , Medicare is the most rapidly growing entitlement .
McCain has also supported measures that increase the cost of Medicare by subsidising private insurers that take part in the programme .
In other words , McCain is likely to reduce Medicare benefits in order to increase the profits of private insurers .
McCain has also explicitly targeted the system of employer - based health insurance through which most non-elderly people get their coverage .
McCain proposes to take away the tax deduction for employer - provided insurance , a seeming violation of his no - tax - increase pledge .
( McCain would provide a $ 2,500 tax credit for buying insurance . )
Under McCain 's plan , the money that employers pay for health insurance would be taxed in the same way as money paid in wages .
That means that workers would pay taxes on money that they never see in their paycheques .
When insurers increase their premiums , employers would have to pull more money out of workers paycheques for taxes , even if they covered the full cost of the premium hike .
This means that workers see their take - home pay cut every time insurers raise premiums .
As an employer , I can guarantee that this will create a big headache and no doubt lead many employers to just drop health insurance coverage .
Dealing with insurance companies is bad enough .
Having to constantly explain to your workers why their pay is falling is too much .
McCain 's plan will soon destroy the system of employer - based insurance , which is undoubtedly its intention .
Before long , the vast majority of people will have to shop individually for their healthcare .
This will lead to enormous waste of time as tens of millions of families will have to ask questions like : " Do you want the plan that 's good on cancer but bad on heart disease , or the plan that 's bad on cancer but good on heart disease ? "
Even worse , the people who have serious health problems and most need insurance will find it extremely expensive , if not impossible , to get insurance coverage .
See , insurance companies do n't like to insure sick people .
They lose money on them .
They have no choice if they get an employer - based pool that includes mostly healthy people , but also some with health problems .
If insurers get to choose their customers individually , as they would under McCain 's plan , then they can either refuse coverage or set exorbitant premiums for anyone with a serious health condition .
In other words , McCain 's system of individual insurance is just great for anyone who does n't really need insurance .
Anyhow , if the McCain - Palin ticket had n't dragged this campaign into the gutter , then we would be having a serious debate right now over their plans to eliminate employer - provided healthcare .
We would also have a debate over their plans for Medicare and social security .
We might hear more about their budget plans , including their intention to extend President Bush 's tax cuts to the richest people in the country .
But the McCain - Palin positions on these issues are not popular .
If the public clearly understood what they are proposing , they would lose in a landslide .
Therefore , they are running a cesspool campaign to distract the public .
Last Saturday , the first day of massive air strikes on Gaza , I finally get through to my old friend Mohammed .
We speak for a few moments , he reassures me he is OK , he asks about my now - delayed trip to Gaza , and suddenly I ask : " What is that noise ? "
It is a sort of distant keening , like the roar of approaching traffic , or a series of waves hitting a rocky shore .
" I am at the cemetery , Karma " , he says , " I am burying my family . "
He now sounds exhausted .
He repeats , over and over again in his steady , tired voice as if it were a prayer : " This is our life .
This is our life .
This is our life . "
I had just come off the phone with Jamal , who at that moment was in another cemetery in Jabaliya camp , burying three members of his own family .
They included two of his nieces , one married to a police cadet .
All were at the graduating ceremony in the crowded police station when F16s targeted them that Saturday morning , massacring more than 45 citizens in an instant , mortally wounding dozens more .
Police stations across Gaza were similarly struck .
Under the laws of war ( or international humanitarian law as it is more commonly known ) , policemen , traffic cops , security guards : all are non-combatants , and classified as civilians under the Geneva conventions .
But more to the point , Palestinian non-combatants are not mere civilians , but possess something more real , more alive , more sovereign than a distancing legal classification : the people in Gaza are citizens .
Some work in the various civic institutions across the Strip , but most simply use them on a daily basis : their schools , police stations , hospitals , their ministries .
Later on that first day I finally reach Khalil , who runs a prisoners ' human rights association in Gaza .
He was trying to organise a press conference .
It was chaotic : he was shouting , he could n't finish his sentences or form words .
When I told him what I had just heard , he told me that he too had just come from the cemetery .
His cousin , Sharif Abu Shammala , 26 years old , had recently got a job as a guard at the university .
He had been asked to go in that morning to sign his worksheet at the local police station ; he had felt lucky to find the work .
For the one and a half million Palestinian citizens living in Gaza , ways to absorb and describe their daily predicament - these collective and individual experiences of extreme violence - had already been used up by the two years of siege that preceded this week 's carnage .
Hanging out with Mohammed at his office in Gaza City six months ago , mostly just watching him smoke one cigarette after another , he abruptly leant over his desk and said to me : " Everyone is dead .
There is no life in Gaza .
Capital has left .
Ask someone passing by : where are you going ?
They will answer : I do n't know .
What are you doing ?
I do n't know .
Gaza today is a place of aimless roaming . "
On this New Year 's Day at his home in Sheikh Radwan , his walls tremble from the F16 aerial bombardment under way in his neighbourhood .
The intensity of it courses down the line into my ear , his voice a cloud of smoke .
His house is just next to the mosque .
Earlier this week , his wife 's cousin in Jabaliya refugee camp lost five of her children : they lived next to a mosque the Israeli air force had bombed .
" So where can I sleep , my children sleep ? " he asks down the phone .
" I do n't know how to tell you what this is like , as I have stopped sleeping , myself .
We cannot go out , we cannot stay in : nowhere is safe .
But I think I would rather die at home . "
I first met international law professor Richard Falk when he was a member of the Seán MacBride commission of inquiry into the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 .
The UN rapporteur of human rights to the Palestinian territories , he has studied massive bombardment of this type many times before .
Yet he too struggled to put words on to the singular horror unfolding : " It is macabre ... I do n't know of anything that exactly fits this situation .
People have been referring to the Warsaw ghetto as the nearest analog in modern times . "
He says he cannot think of another occupation that endured for decades and involved this kind of oppressive circumstances :
" The magnitude , the deliberateness , the violations of international humanitarian law ... warrant the characterisation of a crime against humanity . "
A friend of mine , a brilliant and experienced journalist from Gaza , has been covering these indescribable things in her job for an American newspaper .
She tells me : " I do n't know what to do .
I feel overwhelmed by what I am seeing , and what they are doing : I simply can't understand the enormity of what I witness in the hospitals , where they keep bringing in children , or out in the streets - they are killing all of us .
I do n't know how to write about it . "
She feels utterly weighed down by the fact that the Israeli government have refused to allow international journalists into Gaza to see what she is seeing .
Despite her bewilderment she , like all the other citizens of Gaza I speak with this week , seem to know exactly what to do : although filled with fear , they run to volunteer , help pull neighbours from under the rubble , offer to assist at the hospital ( where more than half of the staff is now voluntary ) , write it all down , as best they can , for a newspaper .
Only a gifted few have found for us the words we keep seeking , and indeed Palestinian poetry of siege has a tradition going back generations .
Mahmoud Darwish wrote some for an earlier Israeli siege , 26 years ago in Beirut :
The Earth is closing on us
pushing us through the last passage
and we tear off our limbs to pass through
The Earth is squeezing us
I wish we were its wheat
so we could die and live again
I wish the Earth was our mother
so she'd be kind to us
During that siege , in the daily bombardment from F16 fighter planes , entire buildings would come down around you - six , seven stories high , hundreds of neighbours , colleagues , and friends disappearing forever under a tonne of rubble and plumes of smoke .
We stopped racing down to the cellar : better to sleep up on the roof .
This week the citizens of Gaza find themselves seized with the same dread choices .
On Wednesday night one colleague , Fawwaz , a professor of economics , was trapped under the rubble of his house near the ministry of foreign affairs .
He managed to text a friend to send emergency workers to rescue him .
Haider , another university colleague , tells me about it in wonder .
He has n't known where to place himself inside his flat : all parts of it have been struck with building debris and huge flying shards of glass .
He is sitting outside in his car while we speak , although I can't see that this is the right move .
Many now sleep on the roofs , he says , as if their visible presence may deter the Apache helicopters , earsplitting drones , and fighter planes that are demolishing everything in their path - more than 400 buildings in six days .
The recently completed building of the ministry of education ( paid for by European donors ) is damaged ; the ministry of justice , the foreign ministry utterly destroyed : all national institutions of the Palestinian Authority , none military .
On New Year 's Day , Khalil tells me in a voice gone hard with a combination of anger and despair : " When we heard the news last night that the British government are giving something like € 9 m [ £ 8.65 m ] for humanitarian assistance , all of us understood immediately that this Israeli war against our citizens will not stop but will continue , and that the donation is the invoice .
We understood the Europeans will pay the price - with us " .
He is roaming around his office as we are chatting , assessing the damage to it : he works just across from the Palestinian Legislative Council , where the democratically elected parliament sat ; now flattened by Israeli aircraft .
Every neighbourhood in Gaza is a mixture of homes , shops , police stations , mosques , ministries , local associations , hospitals , and clinics .
Everyone is connected and fastened down right where they are , and no citizen is safe in today 's occupied Gaza from the Israeli military , whose reach is everywhere .
As a way to share time on the phone , while my friend Houda 's neighbourhood was under aerial assault for more than 40 minutes , she and I discussed at length comparisons between previous Israeli military sieges we had been under .
The carefully planned and premeditated strategy of terrorising an entire population by intensive and heavy bombardment of both military and civic institutions - destroying the entire civic infrastructure of a people - was identical .
What is unprecedented here is that in Gaza there is nowhere to evacuate people to safety : they are imprisoned on all sides , with an acute awareness of the impossibility of escape .
Land , sea , sky : all will kill you .
My friend As'ad is a professor of phonetics at one of the universities in Gaza .
He had been giving the students poetry to read these last months , and this summer told me about a class where they had worked on a piece by the late Palestinian poet Abu Salma .
" It spoke to our situation so powerfully that all at once they began to sing it : ' Everyone has a home , dreams , and an appearance .
And I , carrying the history of my homeland , trip ... wretched and dusty in every path . ' "
He told me yesterday on the phone , when I finally reached him after days of trying : " They bombed the chemistry lab at the university .
I have a phonetics lab .
Will they bomb that too ? "
Before this week 's war on the citizens of Gaza , the government of Israel and its war machine had been attempting to fragment the soul and break the spirit of one and a half million Palestinians through an all - encompassing military siege of epic proportions .
The theory behind besieging a population is to annihilate temporal and spatial domains , and by so doing slowly strangulate a people 's will .
Siege puts extreme pressure on time , both external and internal , and on space : everything halts .
Nothing comes in , nothing comes out .
No batteries , no writing paper , no gauze for the hospitals , no medicines , no surgical gloves even - for these things , say the Israeli military , cannot be classified as humanitarian .
Under siege no one can find space to think lucidly , for the aim is to take away the very horizon where thoughts form their reasoning , a plan , a direction to move in .
Things become misshapen , ill - formed , turn in on themselves .
Freedom , as we know , is the space inside the person that the siege wishes to obliterate , so that it becomes hard to breathe , to organise , above all to hope .
Not achieving its aim , and even now with no international action to put a stop to it , the siege this week reached its natural zenith .
Western governments , having overtly supported the blockade for two years , now fasten their shocked gaze upon the tormented and devastated Gaza they have created , as if they were mere spectators .
I wish we were pictures on the rocks
for our dreams to carry as mirrors .
We saw the faces of those who will throw
our children out of the window of this last space .
Our star will hang up mirrors .
Where should we go after the last frontiers ?
Where should the birds fly after the last sky ?
Where should the plants sleep after the last breath of air ?
We will write our names with scarlet steam .
We will cut off the hand of the song to be finished by our flesh .
We will die here , here in the last passage .
Here and here our blood will plant its olive tree .
( Mahmoud Darwish )
This week Palestinians have created an astonishing history with their stamina , their resilience , their unwillingness to surrender , their luminous humanity .
Gaza was always a place representing cosmopolitan hybridity at its best .
And the weight of its dense and beautiful history over thousands of years has , by its nature , revealed to those watching the uncivilised and cruel character of this high - tech bombardment against them .
I tell each of my friends , in the hours of conversation , how the quality of their capacity as citizens inspires a response that honours this common humanity .
From the start of the attack , Palestinians living in the cities and refugee camps across the West Bank and the Arab world took to the streets in their tens of thousands in a fierce demand for national unity .
More than 100,000 people erupted on to the streets of Cairo ; the same in Amman .
Earlier this week I regaled my friend Ziad , who lives in Rafah refugee camp , with an account of how , at the demonstration in London on Sunday , a young man threw his shoe over the gates of the Israeli embassy .
Rushed by police ( who perhaps thought it was a bomb ) , the mass of British protesters poured off the pavement to envelop him .
Ziad laughed for ages and then said quietly , " God only knows , he must be from Gaza . "
Exit Interview , Stage Right
By Nick Corcodilos
Exit interviews fascinate me like cockroaches do .
An exit interview is the meeting a company 's human resources department has with an employee who has been terminated or who has resigned .
Like the Top Ten Stupid Interview Questions , exit interviews are the cockroaches of the human resources world : no one knows why they exist , no one can justify or eliminate them , and they will likely survive into the third millennium .
While most companies still conduct exit interviews , many human resources managers tell me they do n't bother with them any more .
For reasons I 'll outline in this article , I think employers should be embarrassed to conduct exit interviews and employees should be smart enough to decline them .
The ostensible objective of the exit interview is to help the company " improve the way it does things " so fifty more employees wo n't quit in the coming weeks .
In other words ,
If you 'll just tell us why you are resigning , we 'll see to it that no one else ever has to resign for those same reasons .
Why , we 'll change our company for the better , and thank you for your candor .
The credibility gap
According to a white paper titled " Exit Interviews " by Nina Drake and Ian Robb from the Society for Human Resource Management ( SHRM ) , " exit interviews represent a prime opportunity to gain candid information on employment conditions " within a company .
This is purely wishful thinking , and very naïve at best .
Exit interviews invade an employee 's privacy and insult his intelligence .
Employers can't possibly believe they 're going to get credible information in such a meeting .
Invading privacy
The decision to quit a job ( or the reaction to being fired ) is personal and often complex .
I believe it is utterly presumptuous of a company to require an employee to explain it .
Unless the employee wants to talk about it , it 's not the company 's business .
If the company had any right to this information , it was only while the employee was a committed member of the team , not after he has decided to leave ...

I mentioned earlier that IO scheduler CFQ coming by default in RedHat / CentOS 5.x may be not so good for MySQL .
And yesterday one customer reported that just changing cfq to noop solved their InnoDB IO problems .
I ran tpcc scripts against XtraDB on our Dell PowerEdge R900 server ( 16 cores , 8 disks in RAID10 , controller Perc / 6 i with BBU ) to compare cfq , deadline , noop and anticipatory ( last one just to get number , I did not expect a lot from anticipatory ) .
Here is result ( in transactions per minute , more is better ) :
cfq 2793.5 noop 6586.4 deadline 6513.7 anticipatory 1465
Here is graph of disk writes ( column bo in vmstat ) during benchmark
As you see noop / deadline can utilize disks much better .
For reference I used tpcc scripts from https://launchpad.net/perconatools, generated 100W ( about 9.5 GB of data on disk ) , and used next XtraDB params :

The bombing went on for about 10 minutes .
It was like an earthquake on top of your head .
The windows were shaking and squeaking .
My 10 - year - old was terrified , he was jumping from one place to another trying to hide .
I held him tight to my chest and tried to give him some security and reassure him .
My 12 - year - old was panicking and began laughing hysterically , it 's not normal .
I held her hand and calmed her and told her she would be safe .
My wife was panicking .
She was running around the apartment looking for somewhere to hide .
We live on the ground floor so we headed to the basement .
Not very far from our home is the headquarters of the police and there was a massive bomb .
The chief of police was killed .
Two streets away there was another bomb and more people were killed .
The office of the president is about one kilometre from our house and it was also bombed .
We went downstairs to the basement and tried to hide ourselves from the shelling .
The child of one of our relatives , who lives in our building , finally came home from school .
We had n't been able to find her .
All the phone connections were jammed .
She came home and she was in a very serious state of shock .
She was pale and trembling and she was describing dead bodies in the streets .
On her way home she passed Hamas people in uniform and they were dead .
I had been very apprehensive when I woke up this morning .
I had some bread , some cheese and a glass of tea .
Like all the people in Gaza I felt that something was going on and something very serious .
When Israel allowed the delivery of food and fuel [ when it ended the blockade of Gaza yesterday ] I said to myself and my friends that Israel is really planning a massive strike .
They do n't want to be blamed for starving the people .
I was sitting in the living room with my family trying to figure out what to do today for lunch , it 's our main meal .
What to cook and how to cook , whether we have enough to eat .
There was no rice so I wanted to have lentil soup and my wife said " No , there 's no lentils in the market . "
I said " What else can we do ? "
She said " I bought some cans of food . "
We were discussing this when suddenly the whole thing erupted .
Suddenly there was a big explosion .
Right now I feel very anxious about what 's going to happen .
I 'm worried about how many more people are going to die .
This essay was published in January 2009 , four days after President Obama ’s inauguration . ”
" They said this day would never come , " he began as he faced the ecstatic throng in the downtown Convention Center in Des Moines on 3 January 2008 .
This was the night Barack Obama became a force to be reckoned with .
It was a party without food or drink , but no one needed either .
They were juiced with jubilation , the din of it bouncing off the precast concrete .
The packed crowd , hooting and hollering , was mostly ( this was Iowa ) white : all shapes , ages and classes .
But amid them were plenty of African - Americans , schoolkids in buttercup yellow T - shirts , silver - haired matrons , tall college boys , who , before the appearance of the candidate , had been rocking and rapping and singing and swaying .
They were the gospel choir of The One and the crowd rode the elation as if this was a revival meeting , which in its way it was , the body revived being that of the United States of America .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Obama can play heart and he can play head .
He 's the classical orator as well as the preacher of call - and - response .
That evening he was pitch - perfect ; letting the emotional electricity surge before cooling the voltage .
He spoke in calculated measures , light on his feet , the basketballing candidate with the nifty jump shot , head turned slightly aside as if tuning in to history 's promptings : " I hear you Abe , I hear you Martin ; message coming in loud and clear " .
Then square on again to the crowd , the gaunt gravity broken by a flashing collusive grin ; everybody a brother and sister .
Right now he owns American rhetoric .
And until he came along the standard response of the hacks was to say he 's welcome to it , who cares ?
In the age of the television spot and the web , formal speeches seemed a redundant luxury ; so much embellishment ; nothing to do with the engineering of power .
But lo and behold it turned out that words were the fuel that turned the pistons after all .
George W Bush 's inadequacies with language had stopped being a sign of stirling inner strength , or even an endearing comedy .
In the age of Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq , words failed him and so he failed America .
The country , it turned out , hungered for logos , but not the pabulum of standard operating procedure for election campaigns , much less talk radio rant .
What it wanted were words to bind up America 's wounds ; words such as Lincoln and Franklin D Roosevelt managed ; words which , in the midst of calamity , could remind the nation of the resilience of its history ; the possibilities of a decent future .
So Obama is both blog and blarney ; the melder of old and new in American democracy .
His footsoldiers leave no e-mail address undisturbed but they also knock on doors to get voters registered ; veterans to the polls .
They can spin a sharp slogan with the best , but their man knows how to be Cicero when the occasion begs for it .
That evening in Des Moines , the rhythm of the sentences was scrupulously scored .
The last word of that opening sentence , counter - intuitively falling in a downbeat , the irony allowed to register , throwing the crowd its hit of underdog glee .
" They " who thought the " day would never come " were the thunderstruck operatives of what , until this very evening , had been assumed to be the unstoppable Hillary machine .
But it was also the media hacks who had long awarded her the nomination and had written off Obama as too professorial , too liberal , too black and yet not black enough .
( The Clintons still had the allegiance of most of the black democratic leadership . )
Obama 's campaign , the conventional wisdom had it , would be the candidacy of doomed wholesomeness : losers ' granola ; the Bill Bradley of 2008 .
Obama was Campus Man , catnip for the sophomores , all finesse and no killer instinct , who would fold as soon as he realised politics was a contact sport .
" They " were even some of the Obama campaign people themselves , who , not quite predicting the magnitude of the result in Iowa , had failed to organise any security for the celebration .
No metal detectors , no watchful men in metallically bulked suits .
He was , after all , still a " Hopeful " .
Best not to get deluded .
Give it a shot , end up with the second spot on the ticket ?
Not so bad .
" They " were the Republican opinion - makers who had been salivating at the opportunity of a Clinton nomination .
Dirt - diggers primed and raring to go , who resented this inexplicable , irritating disruption to their plans .
But this was the greatest wrong - footing in post - war electoral history .
Beneath all the prime time bloviation that night , the dismissals of the Iowa result as nothing more than a web - geek wonder , you could pick up a faint but unmistakable tremor of unease .
Could it be that something stupendously unsettling in the political order was actually taking place ?
What was that sudden subsidence beneath the feet ?
Just an untoward event or a political sinkhole about to swallow the entire Roveian Republican ascendancy , along with the doomed Bush presidency ?
Were things really that weird ?
Was it all up with the Age of Reagan ?
As the campaign rolled on through Hillary 's fighting comeback , Obama 's capacity to brush off everything thrown at him and his unmistakable growth into presidential suit - size drew reluctant admiration from his foes .
This was serious .
This was real .
There is no point asking whether Obama would have made it were the times not so out of whack .
History made him and he made history .
It 's the test of a formidable politician that he or she can smell opportunity in unfolding disaster and has the resolution to brush aside those who live by more conventional timetables .
It has already been said that it 's Obama 's misfortune to be the first African - American president at a time of acute national crisis .
But you can bet he does n't see it that way ; rather as the gift of challenge .
Sometimes – as in 1860 with Abraham Lincoln and 1932 with Franklin D Roosevelt – the man and the moment do meet .
This is one of those occasions , all the more miraculous for occurring at a juncture when the United States must urgently accomplish two goals usually supposed to be in mutual contradiction .
On the one hand , America has to rediscover common national purpose ; on the other , it must re-engage with the world .
Matters have moved so far and so fast from the sovereign assumption of George W Bush 's presidency – that America needed to shrug off the diplomatic niceties of the rest of the world if it was to assert its national interest and protect its security – that the active reintegration of the United States into the global community is now held to be a condition of American recovery .
The woeful side of interdependence has been exposed by financial débacle ; but it 's now Obama 's task to turn it into a strength .
Obama 's mantra has been that , historically , mutual regard has been as much the American way as rugged individualism .
Acknowledgement that we are our brothers ' and sisters ' keepers , he often says , is what we owe to those who want to stand on their own two feet , but who have been disabled by circumstances not of their doing , whether that is a missing father , a neglected school , or a catastrophic spike in unemployment .
That same truism could be applied from the developed to the developing world ; and to the need for concerted international action to arrest climate change .
After a long period when attending to others ' concerns has been stigmatised as a soft aversion to the exercise of power , Obama wants to reassert mutuality not just as a bona fide American ideal in the tradition of Wilson , Franklin D Roosevelt and George Marshall , but one that serves American interests more reliably and more morally than military heft .
It is burden enough that he has to carry the desperate expectations of a damaged United States on his shoulders , but Obama can scarcely avoid a sense around the world that he is the answer to its prayers as well .
That somehow he can manage to be a miracle worker in the Middle East , in Afghanistan and in Latin America .
The impossible assignment comes along with what he has wryly called his " funny name " .
For better or worse he is supposed to be president of the planet .
Through Barack Hussein Obama runs culture lines that connect Kenya with Kansas ; ethnically complicated Polynesian - Asian Hawaii with black south Chicago ; Scots - Irish bloodlines with a touch of Cherokee on his maternal grandmother 's side .
His and Michelle 's daughters , Malia and Sasha , bring together west and east Africa ; the atrocity of the slave ships with his Luo father 's voluntary immigration .
It 's safe to say that he was not elected president because of this cosmopolitan richness .
But it 's equally true – and remarkable evidence of the American capacity for national redefinition – that it did Obama no harm either .
Once they had recovered from their shock at not getting Hillary Clinton as their long - desired Democratic nominee , the movers and shakers of the Republican party must have gleefully assumed that Obama 's name – along with the rich possibilities for its branding him as un-American , not to mention his skin colour , his association with radical preachers and an unrepentant anti-Vietnam war underground militant – precluded any possibilties of his actually winning the presidential election .
Americans , ran the received wisdom , might flirt with his exoticism ( the usual code word for race ) and his intellectual elitism , but they would never actually put him in the White House .
Whatever they now said about George W Bush , they had wanted to have a beer with him , had valued and voted the affability factor , the reassuring sense that somehow he was " one of them " .
Would regular white folks in the heartlands of Indiana , Colorado and North Carolina , really think Obama was one of them ?
Perhaps the most astonishing fact about the election of 2008 was that by an emphatic majority , if not a landslide , American voters judged someone called Barrack Hussein Obama , whose complexion in no way resembled the preceding 43 presidents of the United States , to be the patriot to whom they wished to entrust the fate of the country at a time of grave peril .
Instead of the decorated Vietnam prisoner of war with the hero 's story , the public voted into power a lanky African - American intellectual .
On the eve of his inauguration , close to three quarters of the population – a number far greater than those who voted for him – expressed confidence in the prospects of his leadership and administration .
Obama 's goal of transcending bitter partisanship , of leaving behind the triviality of mutual abuse for a politics of substance – the stance that in every campaign has been discounted as naïve – turned out to voice a national craving that , with the avalanche of disasters falling on America , became simply irresistible .
The idealistic visionary turned out to be the smart politician .

Whether this delicate flower of national solidarity will survive the deepening recession or a war gone bad in Afghanistan remains to be seen .
But even before a word of what must be the most anticipated inaugural speech since John F Kennedy in 1961 has been uttered , Obama has accomplished something indispensable for the immediate condition of the country : he has restored public trust in the integrity and competence of American government .
Against the self - accelerating disintegration of confidence in institutions assumed , as a matter of course , to be more or less dependable – banks , insurance , the stock market , the property market – the mere fact of the Obama administration offers a fixed point around which belief in American reinvention can make a credible stand .
Given the ignominy into which the Bush - Cheney administration has fallen , its almost complete loss of legitimacy and credibility , would this have been the case with any incoming administration ?
Almost certainly not , for the manifold crises that have befallen the United States have had at their core a resistance to the notion that there could be any virtue in acts of the federal government other than those undertaken to secure American power .
George W Bush 's fatal alternation between contempt for government and panic - stricken plunges into its arms are the logical consummation of the philosophy of Jeffersonian individualism paramount since Reagan .
The undisguised masterplan was to use deficits to starve reprehensible ( and , as the conservatives saw them , self - perpetuating ) public institutions – such as Public Broadcasting , the Department of Education , the Environmental Protection Agency – of funds and so doom them to such impotence that they could be liquidated to nary a bleat of protest .
Thus the bureaucratic behemoth would be shrunk to its irreducible minimum – and lo , in the burial ground of the New Deal , a thousand flowers of enterprise would bloom unimpeded by the thorns and tares of regulation .
So ran the true religion of the right .
So it was hardly a surprise that the Iraq invasion followed the same game plan .
As this view insists that the default mode for every culture worldwide is democracy and capitalism , once the Baath party and Saddam Hussein were removed , the allegedly Western - leaning , enterprise - oriented Iraqi culture would vault to dynamic liberation and its stability and prosperity would become self - sustaining .
The feedback loop was unarguable .
Freedom would ensure integrity ; infrastructure – and temporary security needs – would be funded by oil revenues ; and a nucleus of Western entrepreneurial culture would take hold in the benighted autocratic , theocratic Middle East .
The stagnant pond in which the insects of al - Qa'ida bred would be drained and life would be grand in Mesopotamia .
It 's hard to think of a moment in American history when ideological blinkers got more fatally in the way of an administration 's capacity to see the true direction of national history .
Iraq desperately needed more and better government , not less .
What it got , for many years following the invasion , was an exploded infrastructure in which masters of outsourcing roamed at will .
As the United States has learnt to its bitter cost , financial institutions needed more careful regulation , not less .
A cyclone of economic imperatives has swept away the bad odour hanging over government since Ronald Reagan declared it to be the problem , not the solution .
Ask Detroit 's automobile makers and you will find that Bill Clinton 's declaration that " the era of big government is over " turns out to be premature .
Government has been recalled , presided over by a chief executive who is unapologetic about its obligations to the socially vulnerable while being under no illusion that its long - term job is to manufacture automobiles or run the banks .
Republican attempts to demonise Obama as a stealth socialist about to impose a radically alien welfare state on the land of the free failed to strike a chord with a majority of American voters .
The reason was that , unlike John Kerry , Obama avoided being boxed into the stereotype of the remote patrician intellectual aloof from the mundane hurts of the average Joe and Jane .
Paradoxically , Obama escaped this snare ( also eluded by the authentically down - home , chicken - fried Bill Clinton ) by not pretending he was something he was n't .
No one was going to buy a version of Obama that was NASCAR and Bud six - pack .
But the tried and true conservative tactic of unleashing the mistrust of cleverness , of tarring it as suspiciously metropolitan , failed them .
Not only because the results of its most glaring counter - example in the 43rd President were all too fresh , but also because Obama embodied a politics that reflected " the way people actually live their lives " , as he put it in The Audacity of Hope .
Palin kept yelling that Obama had n't actually done anything , other than strutting his Harvard Law School stuff into the Senate , and in the debate with Joe Biden she turned his record of " community service " into a joke , as if it were no more than a liberal cookie - bake sale .
Obama ( though not the street - tough Biden from Scranton , Pennsylvania ) was oddly passive in response , but nonetheless the message got across that in south Chicago he had organised tenants to demand basic decencies of life from the Housing Authority .
Those were not trivial matters : removal of asbestos ; provision of dependable sewage ; minimal security against the predation of drug gangs ; public schools that were invested in learning rather than being teenage holding pens .
This was why in Iowa a television crew driver , raised as a farm boy on a small spread in the south of the state , described Obama 's appeal to me as " down - to - earth " .
A way with words , the sharp mind , did n't undercut that impression .
They are of a piece with his conviction that intelligence is not necessarily unpatriotic , that education is an American liberation , and that no government need apologise for securing for its least fortunate citizens the education and health care that make the realisation of the American dream something more than an empty piety .
Two places provided Barack Obama with his unfashionable belief in the possibility of a doctrine of public justice and social benevolence that would accord with , rather than betray ( as the right had it ) American idealism .
Those places are Hawaii and the urban black church .
They were the making of Barack Obama , though neither of them has been of much interest to commentators on this side of the ocean who , when they pay any attention , dismiss them as two symptoms of American fantasy : the loud shirt and the credulous hallelujah .
But fail to understand them and you will never get the 44th President .
Hawaii was as formative for Obama as rural Illinois was for Lincoln .
It 's the state that regularly appears in the top deck of administrations spending most per capita on education , health care , public transport ; a state unembarrassed about government activism .
None of which makes Hawaii any sort of social paradise .
It 's precisely because the ethnic wound opened when the kingdom was annexed in 1898 , ( largely at the behest of the pineapple mogul Sanford Dole ) refuses to heal , because the relationship between natives and haole whites remains that of colonised victims and imperialists – that the challenge for government to close the gap between extremes of wealth and poverty has remained perenially urgent .
The brutality of modern Hawaiian history makes for a state with a restless conscience .
All the historical ingredients that made mainland Americans allergic to civic government – above all , the frontier that allowed pioneers to indulge their fantasies of Jeffersonian self - sufficiency – were glaringly absent from modern Hawaiian history .
If the islands were n't quite Sweden in mid-Pacific , nor were they the wilder West .
They were , in fact , as much eastern as western .
Native codes of kapu – what was forbidden and the power of traditional law to enforce punishment and maintain asylum , followed by the Asian devotion to family paternalism and governing omniscience , generated a different kind of attitude to public ethics than in the rest of the United States .
And although the colonising presence of industrial farming and ranching companies followed the classic pattern of unregulated capitalism , even Sanford Dole and his heirs affected the Hawaiian manner of paternalist obligation .
Two other institutions – the strong presence of both Protestant and Catholic church missions and their schools ; and the American Armed Forces – only reinforced this unembarrassed sense of an ethical order containing the excesses of an entrepreneurial culture .
If anything , Hawaii 's reputation as a pleasure dome only made the public determination to contain its hedonism within the bounds of social regulation stronger .
Hawaii 's story runs counter to American mythologies in so many ways .
Instead of unlimited space and a fiction of permanent abundance it has always been aware of the pressure of population on limited space and finite natural resources .
Though there has been ecological havoc wrought by both dense settlement and the destruction of native species by animal colonisation , the Hawaiian way has been to be aware of the costs of the damage and to take steps to arrest it .
Tourists get confined to their beach pens on Waikiki , so the last Nene geese can make it on the rainforest hills of western Kauai .
Anyone familiar with the wasted terrain of Lana 'I and western Moloka ' I with its black plastic sheets , torn and blowing in the wind ; relics of pineapple plantations long since abandoned , will understand Obama 's passion about the stewardship of the global environment .
You could scarcely imagine anyone with a background less like the oil drillers of Midland Texas .
Then , too , Hawaii scrambles the ethnic game in ways that would always make Barry Obama as he was then , ultimately impervious to the obligations of race - identity politics .
Oahu , the island of Obama 's upbringing means " The Gathering Place " but those who were gathered were exceptionally complicated in their cultural identity .
Portuguese and Basque whalers fetched up in Hawaii , as did the Russians and British .
The islands are imprinted with Asian strains but none of them match , much less meld ; even though Filipinos and the first wave of Japanese migrants came in virtual bondage as sugar cane workers .
Some of those who toiled under indentures were Chinese , but they gravitated quickly ( as they did on the Pacific coast of the mainland ) to dry goods stores , launderers , road builders and cooks .
Different generations of Japanese wear the distinctions of their history carefully and precisely ; the earliest immigrants a cut above now ( rather like convict chic in Australia ) later cohorts , including those patriotic Americans who suffered the humiliation and privation of internment after Pearl Harbor , often condescending to the hordes of tourists from Tokyo and Osaka who flood the islands at vacation time .
One thing , however , the many Asian - Pacific cultures did share and that was the twinned belief in unremitting bootstrap hard work and the pricelessness of learning .
Growing up black in Hawaii was a whole lot more auspicious than in , say Alabama or south - central Los Angeles , but it was certainly no picnic .
Nearly all of those Asian cultures rubbing up against each other shared a disdain for Africans , distinct from white American racism , but an affliction all the more rankling in what , day by day , must have seemed the easy - going pace of Oahu society .
What came as a particular blessing to Obama then was the simple fact of cherishing parentage , meaning his mother and grandparents .
Barack Obama Sr and Ann ( real name Stanley )
Dunham could fall in love at university in Honolulu and their union be relatively uncontroversial compared with states where black - white marriages were still a criminal offence , because Hawaii 's attitude was relaxed in such matters .
In his gripping autobiography , Dreams From My Father ( a book so beautifully written that it seems inconceivable it came from the hand of a politician , which , at the time he wrote it , he was not ) Obama is unsentimentally clear - eyed about all this .
His father and mother , in their respective ways , embodied authentic , if ultimately contradictory , beliefs about American redemption .
Barack
Sr , the son of a goatherding Luo chief , came to the United States as the epitome of upward mobility through the American opportunity .
But it was the pursuit of that same goal that took him away from the conjugal nest when he was offered another scholarship , this time to Harvard .
What he left was not so much an African - American as American - African son , just four years old .
Ann , on the other hand , represented something like the opposite instinct : that of America as a liberal commonwealth of social conscience .
( Her mother , Obama 's " Toot " , characterised Ann as an Adlai Stevenson liberal Democrat , secular and utopian . )
In her own passion for America as school project , Ann reached back to the ideals of Emerson , Bronson Alcott and New England instruction , even though she and her parents were from the world of the Great Plains .
During her second marriage in Indonesia , she would rouse the small Barack – seven or eight years old – at four in the morning for crash lessons that would supplement the shortcomings of local schooling .
Obama 's education was formative in more than a purely pedagogical sense .
It made him wonder : was he to be Barry or Barack ?
What was the relationship of a child of Kansas and Kenya to the history of African - Americans ; their slavery , persecution , segregation and liberation ?
Should he escape that history or embrace it ?
Could America escape or embrace it ?
Oahu 's elite schools owed something to the British model as much as the American : uniforms ; loyalty codes ; heavy duty homework and when his mother sent him back to the island to live with Gramps , the moody , unfulfilled furniture salesman and the indomitable , dynamic Toot , Obama went to one of Hawaii 's most serious hothouses of talent , Punahou School .
Amid the white shirts and dark ties , teenage self - romance was bound to go black and so he did , complete with Afro , basketball , hard music and a smattering of dope .
Dreams From My Father is pre-emptively candid about all this .
Scoring off the 42nd President 's procrastinations on the same subject , Obama writes : " I did inhale .
That was the point . "
The abrupt and very brief reappearance in Hawaii of Barack
Sr who threw his weight around in Gramps and Toot 's Honolulu apartment like some visiting district collector from the British Empire , must have only made the boy 's role confusion worse .
Was he supposed to admire the missing patriarch or drive a stake through his heart ?
At Occidental College in California ( chosen because a girlfriend had gone there ) , Barack got the uppermost of Barry .
Black politics and Malcolm the charismatic martyr were irresistible .
But what Obama took from Malcolm X ( he must have read the autobiography rather than just invoking it ) was the slain leader 's resistance to role - assignments for Black Men : by black Islam , by militant radicalism or by Martin Luther King 's Christian exhortation .
Obama began to see the addiction to victim - rage as a liability .
It was unclear , though , what might replace it .
Columbia University , where he transferred for his junior and senior year , does n't seem to have given him the answer he was looking for .
There were more great books ; a headlong dive into political theory .
But although Harlem was on his doorstep and part of him wanted to lose his doubts east of Morningside Park , his black and white angels continued to wrestle in his head .
For some months after graduation , Obama worked as an apprentice consultant to a business corporation in Manhattan .
He suited up and bought the briefcase .
Hair neatly cropped , he was the African - American In the Office .
When he shared his yearning to do something that brought him closer to the tough realities of black life in the cities , the African - Americans who worked at the low - paid cleaning jobs told him they did n't need any more social workers – what they needed were brothers who " made it " , who brought the bacon home to the hood .
Barack came of age with the news of his father 's death .
Obama was 21 , living a mournful , solitary life on a block of East Harlem " treeless and barren , lined with soot - coloured walk - ups " .
Later , he would learn from his half - sister that there had been a sorry decline .
Barack
Sr , the gifted goatherd 's son who had made it to Harvard , had been an oil company executive , then a government economic advisor in independent Kenya .
But he had paid a heavy price for standing up to Jomo Kenyatta over the Kikuyu monopolisation of offices at the expense of the Luo .
His own job had gone ; penury and depression followed and in their train , inevitably , multiple women and heavy drinking .
By the time he managed a sad , slow climb back , he had been consumed by humiliation and resentment .
The tragic picture liberated Obama from that indeterminate vision of the missing but charismatic father on whom he could project some sort of heroic wishful thinking .
Now he knew he needed solid connection ; the " hunger for community " that later he would accurately believe America itself craved .
He would find it in south Chicago , though the road to solidarity and success was hardly paved with yellow bricks .
Working for the Developing Communities Project , run by a Jewish convert to Catholicism , Jerry Kellman , in the tough projects of Roseland and Altgeld Gardens was an apprenticeship in heartbreak .
Trying to mobilise tenants to claim rights to basic services , Obama endured empty meeting halls ; hardened cynicism from the city ; disbelief among the black churchmen who wrote him off as another naïve , over - educated kid who would high - tail it back to a fancy job when he realised he could n't build Jerusalem overnight on the south side of Chicago .
But just the fact that the first black mayor , Harold Washington , was in office , along with deep reserves of tenacity and the famous Obama unflappability , along with the refusal to back off from the improbable , got him through many of these trials .
He earned respect the hard way .
And through working with the churches – the vital link to the neighbourhoods – Obama found religion the social way , with Jesus the ethical teacher .
Once inside , he made the instinctive , historical connection with the entire history of black self - determination , from the secret slave churches in the south through to the great temple establishments that ran schools and cared for the sick and pretty much everything during the century of Jim Crow segregation .
He began to tune in to its melodies and cadences ; the music itself , but also the mighty instrument of its preaching , without which the civil rights leaders would have been muffled or distant apostles .
From being a listener , he became a speaker , so that when the accusations against Jeremiah Wright 's unhinged anger threatened to derail his campaign in March 2008 , it was the most natural thing in the world for Obama to deliver the finest of all his speeches , in Philadelphia , in which he undertook to help white America face and understand the long history through which race , religion and the politics of salvation were all braided up together .
So Barack Obama became an interlocutor , discovering that without compromising his own history he could disarm paranoia and make people of opposite minds and backgrounds listen to each other .
At Harvard Law School , where he had gone to acquire the sharp knowledge he would need , whether he stayed in community work or , as his inner voices ( and friends ) were telling him , tested the waters of politics , he became the first elected black president of the Harvard Law Review because he was already seen as someone who transcended partisan alignments .
In a bitterly divided institution , Obama was elected with the help of conservatives who saw him as a maker of consensus rather than someone who endorsed radical positions as a duty to his race .
This is how it has gone on ever since .
Stereotyped over and again as a presumptuous outsider whose unapologetic reverence for knowledge somehow was supposed to make him tone - deaf to the needs of regular people , Obama has mobilised those who were tired of hearing that the way things had to be was the way they had always been .
That went as much for black city and state politics as for the kind of presidential campaign his own was organised to confound .
When he went back to Chicago , taking a job in a law firm specialising in civil rights cases , rather than the high - paying corporate position that would have been offered on a plate , there was no question about either his understanding of , or his credibility with , the districts of south Chicago .
Marriage to Michelle Robinson , who had gone from a working class background to Princeton , did no harm to perceptions of Obama as someone whose understanding of , and credibility with neighbourhood politics was unimpeachable .
It 's true that astonishing breaks have come his way .
During the campaign for the United States Senate in 2004 , first his Democratic opponent , the billionaire Blair Hull became terminally mired in a bad divorce ; then his Republican opponent , Jack Ryan , was exposed as forcing his wife to have sex in public in heavily equipped swinger clubs .
This did not go down well with the party faithful .
More often , though , Obama has made his own luck .
Taking on a veteran black politician , Alice Palmer for a seat in the Illinois Senate seemed a wild gamble designed to separate him for good from exactly the constituency he would have to count on for any kind of political career beyond the city .
But time and again , he has caught the change in wind - direction , projected himself as new life for an enervated body politic , whether city , state or country , and time and again he has managed to put together a coalition of support across race , class and the cultures that are presumed to divide the United States into two permanently alienated warring camps .
Last year , Indiana was in his column .
He is not all mouth and mind .
Though his opponents liked to caricature him as someone who talked the talk while ducking votes , his time in the Illinois Assembly and his shorter tenure in the Senate were certainly not short of evidence that he knows how to deliver legislation that makes a concrete difference to people 's lives .
In Illinois , hundreds of bills bore his sponsorship and many of them , though unglamorous , were of the utmost importance : securing state funding for free mammograms and prostate screening , for example .
In the Senate , he teamed up with the pillar of orthodox Republican foreign policy , Richard Lugar , to sponsor legislation dealing with the security of nuclear waste and to tighten oversight of nuclear materials that might have gone stray inside or outside the United States .
What could be more important than that ?
Well , saving the nation , I suppose .
( Let 's leave the world out of it for the moment , shall we ? )
No election campaign or no curriculum vitae could guarantee he is up to the task .
But last October , when everything fell apart and the dread phrase " uncharted waters " kept on issuing from the lips of stricken veterans of US political and financial life , Americans recognised a stark difference in the capacity of the two men they were being offered as potential presidents .
John McCain imploded in meaningless histrionics , suspended his campaign and marched to Washington to do , as it turned out , nothing in particular .
Obama kept his cool .
When he opened his mouth it was to say things that , on the whole , made sense to the confused and the panicky .
It was a good enough omen to win him the White House .
Calm intelligence will be the necessary but insufficient condition of bringing the United States out of its economic trough .
At a time when public faith in those who were entrusted with money , power , credit and weapons has utterly collapsed , it falls to Barack Obama to restore belief in the history and destiny of the American experiment .
Who could conceivably be in a stronger position to do that ?
So as he took the oath of office on the bible that Abraham Lincoln used in 1861 , Obama at last began wiping clean American history of its ancient taint : the promise of equality and liberty , made by the Founding Fathers at the same time that it was denied to its slaves and their shamefully oppressed descendants .
A day later , on 21 January , his government was installed on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King 's great Washington speech , and Obama can now say to whoever will listen that it is truly a dream no longer postponed .
All of America can be embraced in that recognition , just as all of America , those who voted for him and those who did not , was uplifted by his election .
None of which guarantees he will be the President his country and the world is hoping for .
But I 'm prepared to take a bet he will .
In his own words
" Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time .
We are the ones we 've been waiting for .
We are the change that we seek . "
" Americans ... still believe in an America where anything 's possible – they just do n't think their leaders do . "
" Hope – Hope in the face of difficulty .
Hope in the face of uncertainty .
The audacity of hope !
In the end , that is God 's greatest gift to us , the bedrock of this nation .
A belief in things not seen .
A belief that there are better days ahead . "
" Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition .
It asks too little of yourself .
And it will leave you unfulfilled . "
" If you 're walking down the right path and you 're willing to keep walking , eventually you 'll make progress . "
" I am not opposed to all wars .
I 'm opposed to dumb wars . "
" We have a stake in one another ... what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart . "
In others ' words
" Your victory has demonstrated that no person anywhere in the world should not dare to dream of wanting to change the world for a better place . "
Nelson Mandela
" Your extraordinary journey to the White House will inspire people not only in your country but also around the world . "

" By choosing you , the American people have chosen change , openness and optimism . "

Ya I know it ’s only a concept from Honda but still does n’t it just make you drool .
The FC Sport was unveiled last week at the L.A. Auto Show by Honda as part of their on - going research into hydrogen power for vehicles .
The car was designed to show that the new green technologies can compete against any gas guzzler thrown at it .
The ultimate goal for Honda with the FC Sport was to develop a lightweight vehicle with a low center of gravity and a high performance electric powertrain .

Conclusion
PHILIP , King of Macedon , ambitious to obtain the teacher who would be most capable of imparting the higher branches of learning to his fourteen - year - old son , Alexander , and wishing the prince to have for his mentor the most famous and learned of the great philosophers , decided to communicate with Aristotle .
He dispatched the following letter to the Greek sage : " PHILIP TO ARISTOTLE , HEALTH : Know that I have a son .
I render the gods many thanks ; not so much for his birth , as that he was born in your time , for I hope that being educated and instructed by you , he will become worthy of us both and the kingdom which he shall inherit . "
Accepting Philip 's invitation , Aristotle journeyed to Macedon in the fourth year of the 108th Olympiad , and remained for eight years as the tutor of Alexander .
The young prince 's affection for his instructor became as great as that which he felt for his father .
He said that his father had given him being , but that Aristotle had given him well - being .
The basic principles of the Ancient Wisdom were imparted to Alexander the Great by Aristotle , and at the philosopher 's feet the Macedonian youth came to realize the transcendency of Greek learning as it was personified in Plato 's immortal disciple .
Elevated by his illumined teacher to the threshold of the philosophic sphere , he beheld the world of the sages -- the world that fate and the limitations of his own soul decreed he should not conquer .
Aristotle in his leisure hours edited and annotated the Iliad of Horner and presented the finished volume to Alexander .
This book the young conqueror so highly prized that he carried it with him on all his campaigns .
At the time of his triumph over Darius , discovering among the spoils a magnificent , gem - studded casket of unguents , he dumped its contents upon the ground , declaring that at last he had found a case worthy of Aristotle 's edition of the Iliad !
While on his Asiatic campaign , Alexander learned that Aristotle had published one of his most prized discourses , an occurrence which deeply grieved the young king .
So to Aristotle , Conqueror of the Unknown , Alexander , Conqueror of the Known , sent this reproachful and pathetic and admission of the insufficiency of worldly pomp and power : " ALEXANDER TO ARISTOTLE , HEALTH :
You were wrong in publishing those branches of science hitherto not to be acquired except from oral instruction .
In what shall I excel others if the more profound knowledge I gained from you be communicated to all ?
For my part I had rather surpass the majority of mankind in the sublimer branches of learning , than in extent of power and dominion .
Farewell . "
The receipt of this amazing letter caused no ripple in the placid life of Aristotle , who replied that although the discourse had been communicated to the multitudes , none who had not heard him deliver the lecture ( who lacked spiritual comprehension ) could understand its true import .
A few short years and Alexander the Great went the way of all flesh , and with his body crumbled the structure of empire erected upon his personality .
One year later Aristotle also passed into that greater world concerning whose mysteries he had so often discoursed with his disciples in the Lyceum .
But , as Aristotle excelled Alexander in life , so he excelled him in death ; for though his body moldered in an obscure tomb , the great philosopher continued to live in his intellectual achievements .
Age after age paid him grateful tribute , generation after generation pondered over his theorems until by the sheer transcendency of his rational faculties Aristotle - -" the master of those who know , " as Dante has called him -- became the actual conqueror of the very world which Alexander had sought to subdue with the sword .
Thus it is demonstrated that to capture a man it is not sufficient to enslave his body -- it is necessary to enlist his reason ; that to free a man it is not enough to strike the shackles from his limbs -- his mind must be liberated from bondage to his own ignorance .
Physical conquest must ever fail , for , generating hatred and dissension , it spurs the mind to the avenging of an outraged body ; but all men are bound whether willingly or unwillingly to obey that intellect in which they recognize qualities and virtues superior to their own .
That the philosophic culture of ancient Greece , Egypt , and India excelled that of the modern , world must be admitted by all , even by the most confirmed of modernists .
The golden era of Greek æsthetics , intellectualism , and ethics has never since been equaled .
The true philosopher belongs to the most noble order of men : the nation or race which is blessed by possession of illumined thinkers is fortunate indeed , and its name shall be remembered for their sake .
In the famous Pythagorean school at Crotona , philosophy was regarded as indispensable to the life of man .
He who did not comprehend the dignity of the reasoning power could not properly be said to live .
Therefore , when through innate perverseness a member either voluntarily withdrew or was forcibly ejected from the philosophic fraternity , a headstone was set up for him in the community graveyard ; for he who had forsaken intellectual and ethical pursuits to reenter the material sphere with its illusions of sense and false ambition was regarded as one dead to the sphere of Reality .
The life represented by the thraldom of the senses the Pythagoreans conceived to be spiritual death , while they regarded death to the sense - world as spiritual life .
Philosophy bestows life in that it reveals the dignity and purpose of living .
Materiality bestows death in that it benumbs or clouds those faculties of the human soul which should be responsive to the enlivening impulses of creative thought and ennobling virtue .
How inferior to these standards of remote days are the laws by which men live in the twentieth century !
Today man , a sublime creature with infinite capacity for self - improvement , in an effort to be true to false standards , turns from his birthright of understanding -- without realizing the consequences -- and plunges into the maelstrom of material illusion .
The precious span of his earthly years he devotes to the pathetically futile effort to establish himself as an enduring power in a realm of unenduring things .
Gradually the memory of his life as a spiritual being vanishes from his objective mind and he focuses all his partly awakened faculties upon

JOHN AND THE VISION OF THE APOCALYPSE .
From an engraving by Jean Duvet .
Jean Duvet of Langres ( who was born in 1485 and presumably died sometime after 1561 , the year in which his illustrations to the Apocalypse were printed in book form ) was the oldest and greatest of French Renaissance engravers .
Little is known concerning Duvet beyond the fact that he was the goldsmith to the King of France .
His engravings for the Book of Revelation , executed after he had passed his seventieth year , were his masterpiece .
( For further information regarding this obscure master , consult article by William M. Ivins , Jr. , in The Arts , May , 1926 . )
The face of John is an actual portrait of Duvet .
This plate , like many others cut by Duvet , is rich in philosophical symbolism .
p. 202
the seething beehive of industry which he has come to consider the sole actuality .
From the lofty heights of his Selfhood he slowly sinks into the gloomy depths of ephemerality .
He falls to the level of the beast , and in brutish fashion mumbles the problems arising from his all too insufficient knowledge of the Divine Plan .
Here in the lurid turmoil of a great industrial , political , commercial inferno , men writhe in self - inflicted agony and , reaching out into the swirling mists , strive to clutch and hold the grotesque phantoms of success and power .
Ignorant of the cause of life , ignorant of the purpose of life , ignorant of what lies beyond the mystery of death , yet possessing within himself the answer to it all , man is willing to sacrifice the beautiful , the true , and the good within and without upon the blood - stained altar of worldly ambition .
The world of philosophy -- that beautiful garden of thought wherein the sages dwell in the bond of fraternity -- fades from view .
In its place rises an empire of stone , steel , smoke , and hate - a world in which millions of creatures potentially human scurry to and fro in the desperate effort to exist and at the same time maintain the vast institution which they have erected and which , like some mighty , juggernaut , is rumbling inevitably towards an unknown end .
In this physical empire , which man erects in the vain belief that he can outshine the kingdom of the celestials , everything is changed to stone , Fascinated by the glitter of gain , man gazes at the Medusa - like face of greed and stands petrified .
In this commercial age science is concerned solely with the classification of physical knowledge and investigation of the temporal and illusionary parts of Nature .
Its so - called practical discoveries bind man but more tightly with the bonds of physical limitation , Religion , too , has become materialistic : the beauty and dignity of faith is measured by huge piles of masonry , by tracts of real estate , or by the balance sheet .
Philosophy which connects heaven and earth like a mighty ladder , up the rungs of which the illumined of all ages have climbed into the living presence of Reality -- even philosophy has become a prosaic and heterogeneous mass of conflicting notions .
Its beauty , its dignity , its transcendency are no more .
Like other branches of human thought , it has been made materialistic - -" practical " -- and its activities so directionalized that they may also contribute their part to the erection of this modern world of stone and steel .
In the ranks of the so - called learned there is rising up a new order of thinkers , which may best be termed the School of the Worldly Wise Men .
After arriving at the astounding conclusion that they are the intellectual salt of the earth , these gentlemen of letters have appointed themselves the final judges of all knowledge , both human and divine .
This group affirms that all mystics must have been epileptic and most of the saints neurotic !
It declares God to be a fabrication of primitive superstition ; the universe to be intended for no particular purpose ; immortality to be a figment of the imagination ; and an outstanding individuality to be but a fortuitous combination of cells !
Pythagoras is asserted to have suffered from a " bean complex " ; Socrates was a notorious inebriate ; St. Paul was subject to fits ; Paracelsus was an infamous quack , the Comte di Cagliostro a mountebank , and the Comte de St. - Germain the outstanding crook of history !
What do the lofty concepts of the world 's illumined saviors and sages have in common with these stunted , distorted products of the " realism " of this century ?
All over the world men and women ground down by the soulless cultural systems of today are crying out for the return of the banished age of beauty and enlightenment -- for something practical in the highest sense of the word .
A few are beginning to realize that so - called civilization in its present form is at the vanishing point ; that coldness , heartlessness , commercialism , and material efficiency are impractical , and only that which offers opportunity for the expression of love and ideality is truly worth while .
All the world is seeking happiness , but knows not in what direction to search .
Men must learn that happiness crowns the soul 's quest for understanding .
Only through the realization of infinite goodness and infinite accomplishment can the peace of the inner Self be assured .
In spite of man 's geocentricism , there is something in the human mind that is reaching out to philosophy -- not to this or that philosophic code , but simply to philosophy in the broadest and fullest sense .
The great philosophic institutions of the past must rise again , for these alone can tend the veil which divides the world of causes from that of effects .
Only the Mysteries -- those sacred Colleges of Wisdom - - can reveal to struggling humanity that greater and more glorious universe which is the true home of the spiritual being called man .
Modern philosophy has failed in that it has come to regard thinking as simply an intellectual process .
Materialistic thought is as hopeless a code of life as commercialism itself .
The power to think true is the savior of humanity .
The mythological and historical Redeemers of every age were all personifications of that power .
He who has a little more rationality than his neighbor is a little better than his neighbor .
He who functions on a higher plane of rationality than the rest of the world is termed the greatest thinker .
He who functions on a lower plane is regarded as a barbarian .
Thus comparative rational development is the true gauge of the individual 's evolutionary status .
Briefly stated , the true purpose of ancient philosophy was to discover a method whereby development of the rational nature could be accelerated instead of awaiting the slower processes of Nature , This supreme source of power , this attainment of knowledge , this unfolding of the god within , is concealed under the epigrammatic statement of the philosophic life .
This was the key to the Great Work , the mystery of the Philosopher 's Stone , for it meant that alchemical transmutation had been accomplished .
Thus ancient philosophy was primarily the living of a life ; secondarily , an intellectual method .
He alone can become a philosopher in the highest sense who lives the philosophic life .
What man lives he comes to know .
Consequently , a great philosopher is one whose threefold life -- physical , mental , and spiritual -- is wholly devoted to and completely permeated by his rationality .
Man 's physical , emotional , and mental natures provide environments of reciprocal benefit or detriment to each other .
Since the physical nature is the immediate environment of the mental , only that mind is capable of rational thinking which is enthroned in a harmonious and highly refined material constitution .
Hence right action , right feeling , and right thinking are prerequisites of right knowing , and the attainment of philosophic power is possible only to such as have harmonized their thinking with their living .
The wise have therefore declared that none can attain to the highest in the science of knowing until first he has attained to the highest in the science of living .
Philosophic power is the natural outgrowth of the philosophic life .
Just as an intense physical existence emphasizes the importance of physical things , or just as the monastic metaphysical asceticism establishes the desirability of the ecstatic state , so complete philosophic absorption ushers the consciousness of the thinker into the most elevated and noble of all spheres -- the pure philosophic , or rational , world .
In a civilization primarily concerned with the accomplishment of the extremes of temporal activity , the philosopher represents an equilibrating intellect capable of estimating and guiding the cultural growth .
The establishment of the philosophic rhythm in the nature of an individual ordinarily requires from fifteen to twenty years .
During that entire period the disciples of old were constantly subjected to the most severe discipline .
Every activity of life was gradually disengaged from other interests and focalized upon the reasoning part .
In the ancient world there was another and most vital factor which entered into the production of rational intellects and which is entirely beyond the comprehension of modern thinkers : namely , initiation into the philosophic Mysteries .
A man who had demonstrated his peculiar mental and spiritual fitness was accepted into the body of the learned and to him was revealed that priceless heritage of arcane lore preserved from generation to generation .
This heritage of philosophic truth is the matchless treasure of all ages , and each disciple admitted into these brotherhoods of the wise made , in turn , his individual contribution to this store of classified knowledge .
The one hope of the world is philosophy , for all the sorrows of modern life result from the lack of a proper philosophic code .
Those who sense even in part the dignity of life cannot but realize the shallowness apparent in the activities of this age .
Well has it been said that no individual can succeed until he has developed his philosophy of life .
Neither can a race or nation attain true greatness until it has formulated an adequate philosophy and has dedicated its existence to a policy consistent with that philosophy .
During the World War , when so - called civilization hurled one half of itself against the other in a frenzy of hate , men ruthlessly destroyed something more precious even than human life : they obliterated those records of human thought by which life can be intelligently directionalized .
Truly did Mohammed declare the ink of philosophers to be more precious than the blood of martyrs .
Priceless documents , invaluable records of achievement , knowledge founded on ages of patient observation and experimentation by the elect of the earth -- all were destroyed with scarcely a qualm of regret .
What was knowledge , what was truth , beauty , love , idealism , philosophy , or religion when compared to man 's desire to control an infinitesimal spot in the fields of Cosmos for an inestimably minute fragment of time ?
Merely to satisfy some whim or urge of ambition man would uproot the universe , though well he knows that in a few short years he must depart , leaving all that he has seized to posterity as an old cause for fresh contention .
War -- the irrefutable evidence of irrationality -- still smolders in the hearts of men ; it cannot die until human selfishness is overcome .
Armed with multifarious inventions and destructive agencies , civilization will continue its fratricidal strife through future ages , But upon the mind of man there is dawning a great fear -- the fear that

THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE OF THE MYSTERIES .
From Khunrath 's Amphitheatrum Sapientiæ , etc .
This symbolic figure , representing the way to everlasting life , is described by Khunrath in substance as follows : " This is the Portal of the amphitheatre of the only true and eternal Wisdom - - a narrow one , indeed , but sufficiently august , and consecrated to Jehovah .
To this portal ascent is made by a mystic , indisputably prologetic , flight of steps , set before it as shown in the picture .
It consists of seven theosophic , or , rather , philosophic steps of the Doctrine of the Faithful Sons .
After ascending the steps , the path is along the way of God the Father , either directly by inspiration or by various mediate means .
According to the seven oracular laws shining at the portal , those who are inspired divinely have the power to enter and with the eyes of the body and of the mind , of seeing , contemplating and investigating in a Christiano - Kabalistic , divino - magical , physico - chemical manner , the nature of the Wisdom : Goodness , and Power of the Creator ; to the end that they die not sophistically but live theosophically , and that the orthodox philosophers so created may with sincere philosophy expound the works of the Lord , and worthily praise God who has thus blessed these friend , of God . "
The above figure and description constitute one of the most remarkable expositions ever made of the appearance of the Wise Man's House and the way by which it must be entered .
____________________________
eventually civilization will destroy itself in one great cataclysmic struggle .
Then must be reenacted the eternal drama of reconstruction .
Out of the ruins of the civilization which died when its idealism died , some primitive people yet in the womb of destiny must build a new world .
Foreseeing the needs of that day , the philosophers of the ages have desired that into the structure of this new world shall be incorporated the truest and finest of all that has gone before .
It is a divine law that the sum of previous accomplishment shall be the foundation of each new order of things .
The great philosophic treasures of humanity must be preserved .
That which is superficial may he allowed to perish ; that which is fundamental and essential must remain , regardless of cost .
Two fundamental forms of ignorance were recognized by the Platonists : simple ignorance and complex ignorance .
Simple ignorance is merely lack of knowledge and is common to all creatures existing posterior to the First Cause , which alone has perfection of knowledge .
Simple ignorance is an ever - active agent , urging the soul onward to the acquisition of knowledge .
From this virginal state of unawareness grows the desire to become aware with its resultant improvement in the mental condition .
The human intellect is ever surrounded by forms of existence beyond the estimation of its partly developed faculties .
In this realm of objects not understood is a never - failing source of mental stimuli .
Thus wisdom eventually results from the effort to cope rationally with the problem of the unknown .
In the last analysis , the Ultimate Cause alone can be denominated wise ; in simpler words , only God is good .
Socrates declared knowledge , virtue , and utility to be one with the innate nature of good .
Knowledge is a condition of knowing ; virtue a condition of being ; utility a condition of doing .
Considering wisdom as synonymous with mental completeness , it is evident that such a state can exist only in the Whole , for that which is less than the Whole cannot possess the fullness of the All .
No part of creation is complete ; hence each part is imperfect to the extent that it falls short of entirety .
Where incompleteness is , it also follows that ignorance must be coexistent ; for every part , while capable of knowing its own Self , cannot become aware of the Self in the other parts .
Philosophically considered , growth from the standpoint of human evolution is a process proceeding from heterogeneity to homogeneity .
In time , therefore , the isolated consciousness of the individual fragments is reunited to become the complete consciousness of the Whole .
Then , and then only , is the condition of all - knowing an absolute reality .
Thus all creatures are relatively ignorant yet relatively wise ; comparatively nothing yet comparatively all .
The microscope reveals to man his significance ; the telescope , his insignificance .
Through the eternities of existence man is gradually increasing in both wisdom and understanding ; his ever - expanding consciousness is including more of the external within the area of itself .
Even in man 's present state of imperfection it is dawning upon his realization that he can never be truly happy until he is perfect , and that of all the faculties contributing to his self - perfection none is equal in importance to the rational intellect .
Through the labyrinth of diversity only the illumined mind can , and must , lead the soul into the perfect light of unity .
In addition to the simple ignorance which is the most potent factor in mental growth there exists another , which is of a far more dangerous and subtle type .
This second form , called twofold or complex ignorance , may be briefly defined as ignorance of ignorance .
Worshiping the sun , moon , and stars , and offering sacrifices to the winds , the primitive savage sought with crude fetishes to propitiate his unknown gods .
He dwelt in a world filled with wonders which he did not understand .
Now great cities stand where once roamed the Crookboned men .
Humanity no longer regards itself as primitive or aboriginal .
The spirit of wonder and awe has been succeeded by one of sophistication .
Today man worships his own accomplishments , and either relegates the immensities of time and space to the background of his consciousness or disregards them entirely .
The twentieth century makes a fetish of civilization and is overwhelmed by its own fabrications ; its gods are of its own fashioning .
Humanity has forgotten how infinitesimal , how impermanent and how ignorant it actually is .
Ptolemy has been ridiculed for conceiving the earth to be the center of the universe , yet modern civilization is seemingly founded upon the hypothesis that the planet earth is the most permanent and important of all the heavenly spheres ,
p. 204
and that the gods from their starry thrones are fascinated by the monumental and epochal events taking place upon this spherical ant - hill in Chaos .
From age to age men ceaselessly toil to build cities that they may rule over them with pomp and power -- as though a fillet of gold or ten million vassals could elevate man above the dignity of his own thoughts and make the glitter of his scepter visible to the distant stars .
As this tiny planet rolls along its orbit in space , it carries with it some two billion human beings who live and die oblivious to that immeasurable existence lying beyond the lump on which they dwell .
Measured by the infinities of time and space , what are the captains of industry or the lords of finance ?
If one of these plutocrats should rise until he ruled the earth itself , what would he be but a petty despot seated on a grain of Cosmic dust ?
Philosophy reveals to man his kinship with the All .
It shows him that he is a brother to the suns which dot the firmament ; it lifts him from a taxpayer on a whirling atom to a citizen of Cosmos .
It teaches him that while physically bound to earth ( of which his blood and bones are part ) , there is nevertheless within him a spiritual power , a diviner Self , through which he is one with the symphony of the Whole .
Ignorance of ignorance , then , is that self - satisfied state of unawareness in which man , knowing nothing outside the limited area of his physical senses , bumptiously declares there is nothing more to know !
He who knows no life save the physical is merely ignorant ; but he who declares physical life to be all - important and elevates it to the position of supreme reality -- such a one is ignorant of his own ignorance .
If the Infinite had not desired man to become wise , He would not have bestowed upon him the faculty of knowing .
If He had not intended man to become virtuous , He would not have sown within the human heart the seeds of virtue .
If He had predestined man to be limited to his narrow physical life , He would not have equipped him with perceptions and sensibilities capable of grasping , in part at least , the immensity of the outer universe .
The criers of philosophy call all men to a comradeship of the spirit : to a fraternity of thought : to a convocation of Selves .
Philosophy invites man out of the vainness of selfishness ; out of the sorrow of ignorance and the despair of worldliness ; out of the travesty of ambition and the cruel clutches of greed ; out of the red hell of hate and the cold tomb of dead idealism .
Philosophy would lead all men into the broad , calm vistas of truth , for the world of philosophy is a land of peace where those finer qualities pent up within each human soul are given opportunity for expression .
Here men are taught the wonders of the blades of grass ; each stick and stone is endowed with speech and tells the secret of its being .
All life , bathed in the radiance of understanding , becomes a wonderful and beautiful reality .
From the four corners of creation swells a mighty anthem of rejoicing , for here in the light of philosophy is revealed the purpose of existence ; the wisdom and goodness permeating the Whole become evident to even man 's imperfect intellect .
Here the yearning heart of humanity finds that companionship which draws forth from the innermost recesses of the soul that great store of good which lies there like precious metal in some deep hidden vein .
Following the path pointed out by the wise , the seeker after truth ultimately attains to the summit of wisdom 's mount , and gazing down , beholds the panorama of life spread out before him .
The cities of the plains are but tiny specks and the horizon on every hand is obscured by the gray haze of the Unknown .
Then the soul realizes that wisdom lies in breadth of vision ; that it increases in comparison to the vista .
Then as man 's thoughts lift him heavenward , streets are lost in cities , cities in nations , nations in continents , continents in the earth , the earth in space , and space in an infinite eternity , until at last but two things remain : the Self and the goodness of God .
While man 's physical body resides with him and mingles with the heedless throng , it is difficult to conceive of man as actually inhabiting a world of his own - a world which he has discovered by lifting himself into communion with the profundities of his own internal nature .
Man may live two lives .
One is a struggle from the womb to the tomb .
Its span is measured by man 's own creation - - time .
Well may it be called the unheeding life .
The other life is from realization to infinity .
It begins with understanding , its duration is forever , and upon the plane of eternity it is consummated .
This is called the philosophic life .
Philosophers are nor born nor do they die ; for once having achieved the realization of immortality , they are immortal .
Having once communed with Self , they realize that within there is an immortal foundation that will not pass away .
Upon this living , vibrant base -- Self - - they erect a civilization which will endure after the sun , the moon , and the stars have ceased to be .
The fool lives but for today ; the philosopher lives forever .
When once the rational consciousness of man rolls away the stone and comes forth from its sepulcher , it dies no more ; for to this second or philosophic birth there is no dissolution .
By this should not be inferred physical immortality , but rather that the philosopher has learned that his physical body is no more his true Self than the physical earth is his true world .
In the realization that he and his body are dissimilar -- that though the form must perish the life will not fail -- he achieves conscious immortality .
This was the immortality to which Socrates referred when he said : " Anytus and Melitus may indeed put me to death , but they can not injure me . "
To the wise , physical existence is but the outer room of the hall of life .
Swinging open the doors of this antechamber , the illumined pass into the greater and more perfect existence .
The ignorant dwell in a world bounded by time and space .
To those , however , who grasp the import and dignity of Being , these are but phantom shapes , illusions of the senses - arbitrary limits imposed by man 's ignorance upon the duration of Deity .
The philosopher lives and thrills with the realization of this duration , for to him this infinite period has been designed by the All - Wise Cause as the time of all accomplishment .
Man is not the insignificant creature that he appears to be ; his physical body is not the true measure of his real self .
The invisible nature of man is as vast as his comprehension and as measureless as his thoughts .
The fingers of his mind reach out and grasp the stars ; his spirit mingles with the throbbing life of Cosmos itself .
He who has attained to the state of understanding thereby has so increased his capacity to know that he gradually incorporates within himself the various elements of the universe .
The unknown is merely that which is yet to be included within the consciousness of the seeker .
Philosophy assists man to develop the sense of appreciation ; for as it reveals the glory and the sufficiency of knowledge , it also unfolds those latent powers and faculties whereby man is enabled to master the secrets of the seven spheres .
From the world of physical pursuits the initiates of old called their disciples into the life of the mind and the spirit .
Throughout the ages , the Mysteries have stood at the threshold of Reality -- that hypothetical spot between noumenon and phenomenon , the Substance and the shadow .
The gates of the Mysteries stand ever ajar and those who will may pass through into the spacious domicile of spirit .
The world of philosophy lies neither to the right nor to the left , neither above nor below .
Like a subtle essence permeating all space and all substance , it is everywhere ; it penetrates the innermost and the outermost parts of all being .
In every man and woman these two spheres are connected by a gate which leads from the not - self and its concerns to the Self and its realizations .
In the mystic this gate is the heart , and through spiritualization of his emotions he contacts that more elevated plane which , once felt and known , becomes the sum of the worth - while .
In the philosopher , reason is the gate between the outer and the inner worlds , the illumined mind bridging the chasm between the corporeal and the incorporeal .
Thus godhood is born within the one who sees , and from the concerns of men he rises to the concerns of gods .
In this era of " practical " things men ridicule even the existence of God .
They scoff at goodness while they ponder with befuddled minds the phantasmagoria of materiality .
They have forgotten the path which leads beyond the stars .
The great mystical institutions of antiquity which invited man to enter into his divine inheritance have crumbled , and institutions of human scheming now stand where once the ancient houses of learning rose a mystery of fluted columns and polished marble .
The white - robed sages who gave to the world its ideals of culture and beauty have gathered their robes about them and departed from the sight of men .
Nevertheless , this little earth is bathed as of old in the sunlight of its Providential Generator .
Wide - eyed babes still face the mysteries of physical existence .
Men continue to laugh and cry , to love and hate ;
Some still dream of a nobler world , a fuller life , a more perfect realization .
In both the heart and mind of man the gates which lead from mortality to immortality are still ajar .
Virtue , love , and idealism are yet the regenerators of humanity .
God continues to love and guide the destinies of His creation .
The path still winds upward to accomplishment .
The soul of man has not been deprived of its wings ; they are merely folded under its garment of flesh .
Philosophy is ever that magic power which , sundering the vessel of clay , releases the soul from its bondage to habit and perversion .
Still as of old , the soul released can spread its wings and soar to the very source of itself .
The criers of the Mysteries speak again , bidding all men welcome to the House of Light .
The great institution of materiality has failed .
The false civilization built by man has turned , and like the monster of Frankenstein , is destroying its creator .
Religion wanders aimlessly in the maze of theological speculation .
Science batters itself impotently against the barriers of the unknown .
Only transcendental philosophy knows the path .
Only the illumined reason can carry the understanding part of man upward to the light .
Only philosophy can teach man to be born well , to live well , to die well , and in perfect measure be born again .
Into this band of the elect -- those who have chosen the life of knowledge , of virtue , and of utility -- the philosophers of the ages invite YOU .

British troops are to leave Iraq by the end of July next year , Gordon Brown has said after talks with Iraqi PM Nouri Maliki in Baghdad .
Military operations will end by 31 May and the remaining 4,100 service personnel will leave within two months .
Several hundred trainers will remain , some working with the Iraqi navy .
UK PM Mr Brown , who held talks with Mr Maliki before heading to Basra , said he was proud of British troops adding : " We leave Iraq a better place " .
The withdrawal announcement came after at least 18 people were killed and dozens wounded in a twin bomb attack in Baghdad on Wednesday .
Mr Brown said he would give further details on UK troops in Iraq in a statement to the House of Commons on Thursday .
' New era ' BBC diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams said the announcement ended months of speculation .
I am proud of the contribution British forces have made .
They are the pride of Britain and the best in the world
Gordon Brown
Timeline : UK troops in Basra Mr Brown told the BBC : " I feel that the task that we set out to do is being done and that 's why we can take a decision to bring most of our forces home . "
At a joint press conference , Mr Maliki confirmed that the agreement included a provision for the Iraqi government to request an extension of the British military presence .
However , both leaders indicated it was not expected to be used .
Mr Brown said people had been given an " economic stake in the future of Iraq " and said : " I am proud of the contribution British forces have made .
They are the pride of Britain and the best in the world . "
In their joint statement , the leaders said the role played by the UK combat forces was " drawing to a close " but the partnership between Britain and Iraq would " continue to take on new dimensions " and be strengthened .
Afghanistan
The withdrawal of UK troops is expected to start in the spring although Mr Brown suggested the biggest withdrawals would take place in the summer .
Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup played down suggestions troops would be transferred to Afghanistan .
He said : " We can not just have a one - to - one transfer from Iraq to Afghanistan .
" The net result must be a reduction in our operational tempo because the forces have been overstretched for too long . "
But he added they would have to look at the " requirement on the ground " .
In Basra Mr Brown visited British troops and laid a wreath in memory of the 178 British servicemen and women who have been killed in Iraq since the 2003 invasion .
Gordon Brown paid tribute to servicemen and women who have died Responding to the announcement , shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said it showed " renewed confidence " in the Iraqi government 's ability to maintain security .
But he questioned the timing of the announcement saying the government 's policy had previously been to say troops would leave " when circumstances allowed on the ground " .
" I do n't know why the government would have changed their mind and given such a specific commitment to dates .
" I 'm sure that it 's complete coincidence that it 's done on the same day that we 've got horrendous unemployment figures . "
The Conservatives have reiterated their calls for a public inquiry into the causes and conduct of the Iraq war .
At prime minister 's questions , shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " The learning of lessons that may be relevant to Afghanistan and elsewhere can no longer be delayed . "
Harriet Harman , standing in for Mr Brown at PMQs , replied that the government had made clear there would be no full inquiry while troops were still in Iraq .
" We have to respect the fact that our fighting forces are still in Iraq .
There is no delay , " she said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
We should have left years ago .
Ian , United Kingdom Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said it was a " huge relief " that the end was " at last in sight " .
" There must be a fully independent public inquiry into how this was allowed to happen .
The time when Brown has been able to hide behind our troops ' ongoing presence in the country is coming to an end , " he said .
" The death and injury of hundreds of British troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians in this futile war cannot simply be swept under the carpet . "
The SNP and Plaid Cymru also called for ministers to set out a timetable for a public inquiry into the war .

It ’s All in the Mind …
Mind , Soul , and Body writes Against the clock :
Neurology has traditionally been a rather laid back specialty .
The delight of it for me is the chance to ponder the inner workings of the brain as it affects the nervous system in a systematic and reflective manner .
We do n’t usually go into for the thrill of racing to save someone in a life and death situation .
In fact , at least for me , this is when my brain functions at its worst .
Face to the Sun writes
How challenges of a stroke created opportunity for growth :
At times I still have difficulty understanding concepts ( in conversations ) or information that I know I would have otherwise easily understood ; in which I feel very embarrassed .
This temporary cognitive hindrance causes me to be vigilant about my maintaining a positive self - esteem .
Dr Shock writes Suicidal Behavior as Sixth Axis in DSM V?:
It is suggested in an editorial of the American Journal of Psychiatry that suicidal behavior be considered a separate diagnostic category documented on a sixth axis .
Ridiculous .
Suicidal behavior ( death and attempts ) is a symptom of various psychiatric conditions .
Spiritual Pub writes
The Joy of Being Yourself :
But the question is if there is so much ecstasy and joy in being oneself , then why can not we be so ?
What are we so afraid of ?
What is keeping us from this source of ultimate blissfulness that could flow into our lives any moment ?
Sharp Brains writes Cognitive screenings and Alzheimer ’s Disease :
We see emerging trends that suggest the position in favor of cognitive assessments may in fact gather momentum over the next few years : widespread computerized cognitive screenings in the US Army , insurance companies like OptumHealth adding such tools to its clinical decision - making systems , polls such as the American Society of Aging ’s a couple of years ago indicating a very strong demand for an “ annual mental check - up ” , the availability of useful assessment tools and research - based preventive advice .
The Change Blog writes Why Self Awareness is Fundamental to Personal Growth ( & How to Cultivate It ) :
According to Buddhism , Moha is the most fundamental of the three poisons .
It is a lack of awareness that lies at the root of all our problems .
The cure Buddhism proposes is to extend clarity and awareness down into processes that are normally unconscious .
Highlight HEALTH writes Potential Location of Autism Genes Identified :
The familial association mapping study is compelling because it utilized genomic data , focused in on a target gene and validated the difference between autistic and control samples biochemically .
Even more striking is the involvement of SEMA5A during neural development .
Learn
This writes Why Are You Waiting for Happiness ?
Have it NOW !:
Happiness is one of those long sought after , conceptual ideas and it has turned into a sense of longing and searching for many people instead of a state of being and feeling .
People have learned over centuries to look to the future to find more happiness instead of looking at the here and now with what they have .
Well , did you know you can have happiness now ?
You do n’t need anything else or anyone to be happy .
Timeless Lessons writes Mind Hacks : 10 Offbeat Fun Ways to Grow Your Brain :
Stay Blind in the Shower : Locate the taps and regulate the temperature and flow using just your tactile senses .
In the shower locate all needed props by feel , then wash , shave , and so on , with your eyes shut .
Your hands will most likely notice different textures of your own body you are n’t aware of when you are “ looking . ”
Psypo writes Find More Time To Study / Work – The Blue Locus Technique :
Be engaged in some other activity other than studying .
When you select such an activity , be careful not to select anything that you like more than studying .
The activity should be that you can not make you enjoy , involved in , or responsible , but just engaged .

This interesting National Geographic video shows how Bernd Heinrich designed an experiment to test the intelligence of ravens .
Wall Street is hitting its bankers where it hurts  in the wallet .
Citigroup ’s chief executive and chairman said on Wednesday that they would forgo their bonuses for 2008 and slash the amounts paid to other senior bankers , joining a growing list of financial executives who are passing up some pay .
In a memo to bank employees , Vikram S. Pandit , Citigroup ’s chief executive , said that he and Winfried F. W. Bischoff , the bank ’s chairman , would not take year - end rewards .
“ The harsh realities of 2008 , primarily our earnings results , mean that our bonus pool is dramatically lower than last year , ” Mr. Pandit wrote about a year in which the bank has so far announced more than $ 10 billion in losses .
“ The most senior leaders should be affected the most . ”
But Mr. Pandit ’s remarks may strike some as several weeks late , if not a few million dollars short .
Citigroup , one of the biggest recipients of taxpayer money , has taken in $ 45 billion in capital from the government ’s bailout funds .
THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT BUBBLE TODAY may involve one of the safest asset classes : U.S. Treasuries .
Yields have plunged to some of the lowest levels since the 1940s as investors , fearful of a sustained global economic downturn and potential deflation , have rushed to purchase government - issued debt .
The market also has been supported by comments from the Federal Reserve that it , too , may buy long - term Treasuries .

As a result , the benchmark 10 - year Treasury note yields just 2.40 % , down from 3.85 % as recently as mid-November ....
Vietnam 's Ministry of Information and Communications has reportedly issued instructions on using open source software products at its state agencies .
According to the issued instruction , by June 30 , 2009 , 100 percent of the servers for government IT divisions must be installed with open source software ; 100 percent of the staffs in these IT divisions must be trained in the use of the open source software products and at least 50 percent of those must be able to use the open source software proficiently .
IT divisions at government agencies are comprised of the IT departments of ministries and government agencies , provincial and municipal Departments of Information and Communications .
( Source : vietnamnet.vn )
The instruction also mandates that 70 percent of servers of ministries ' agencies and local state agencies must be installed with open source software products by December 31 , 2009 and that 70 percent of IT staff should be trained in using the open source software , and at least 40 percent of government workers should be able to use the open source software in their work .
By December 31 , 2010 , all staff at these agencies must be able to use open source software in their jobs .
The instruction asks IT associations to assist state agencies with implementing this plan and requests that computer traders not sell PCs that come with cracked software , only open source software .
Open source software products listed are Open Office , email software for servers of Mozilla ThunderBird , Mozilla FireFox web browser and the Vietnamese typing software , Unikey .

After Mr Dance died nine months ago , Fred became depressed and bit off all of his neck feathers .
He also began to bob his head up and down all day as a result of his low mood .
Because my garden supplies about half of my family 's yearly food intake , I do all I can to maximize my vegetables ' nutritional quality .
Based on considerable research and more than 30 years of vegetable growing , I have formulated a homemade garden fertilizer mix that works great in most food gardens .
I call it Complete Organic Fertilizer , or COF .
It is a potent , correctly balanced mixture composed entirely of natural substances .
It 's less expensive than similar commercially compounded organic fertilizers , and it 's much better for your soil life than harsh synthetic chemical mixes .
The use of COF plus regular , minimal additions of compost has a long track record of producing incredible results .
I 've recommended this system in all the gardening books I 've written over the past 20 years .
Many of my readers have written back , saying things like , " My garden has never grown so well ; the plants have never been so large and healthy ; the food never tasted so good . "
Complete Organic Fertilizer
To concoct COF measure out all materials by volume : that is , by the scoop , bucketful , jarful , etc .
Proportions that vary by 10 percent either way will be close enough to produce the desired results .
Making this formula by weight is more difficult and I suggest you do not try to .
I blend my COF in a 20 - quart plastic bucket , using an old one quart saucepan as a measuring scoop .
I make 7 to 14 quarts of COF at a time .
At any cost of materials this mix is a good value when judged by the results it produces , but COF can be unnecessarily expensive unless you buy the ingredients in 50 pound sacks ( 20 kg ) from appropriate vendors .
Urban gardeners may have to do a bit of research to find rural suppliers .
Farm and ranch stores as well as feed and grain dealers are the best sources for seed meals and kelp meal , which are typically used to feed livestock .
If I were an urban gardener , I would visit the country every year or two to stock up .
The other ingredients usually can be found at garden shops , although garden centers may sell them in smaller sized packages at relatively high unit prices .
You also may find the these items on the Internet but they will be less costly from farm / ranch supply stores .

Seed meals and various kinds of lime are the most important ingredients ( Read The Quick and Easy Guide to Homemade Organic Fertilizer for my basic fertilizer recipe ) .
These alone will grow a great garden .
Gypsum is the least essential type of lime , but it contains sulphur , a vital plant nutrient that is deficient in many soils .
If gypsum should prove hard to find or seems too costly , do n't worry too much about it — simply double the quantity of inexpensive agricultural lime .
If you can afford only one bag of lime , in most circumstances your best choice would be ordinary agricultural limestone .
The most fundamental nutrient ratio to get right in your soil is the balance of calcium to magnesium ; it should be about 7 ( calcium ) to 1 ( magnesium ) .
To achieve that you could alternate agricultural lime and dolomite .
First go through two bags of ordinary ag lime and then use one bag of dolomite lime .
I strongly disagree with the many Rodale Press home gardening publications that insisted dolomite lime is the best single choice .
Repeated use of dolomite has caused many organic gardens to become hard and compacted , making it seem that even more compost was needed than was actually required .
Had the same soil had its magnesium to calcium ratio brought into proper balance , it would have loosened up by itself , seeming as though huge quantities of compost had been added .
Bone meal is usually available at garden centers .
Guano , rock phosphate and kelp meal may seem too costly or too difficult to obtain , but they add considerable fortitude to the plants and increase the nutritional content of your vegetables .
Go as far down the recipe as you can afford , but if you can't find the more exotic materials toward the bottom , do n't worry too much .
However , if concerns about money stop you from obtaining kelp meal , rock dust or a phosphate supplement , I suggest taking a hard look at your priorities .
In my opinion , you can't spend too much money creating maximum nutrition in your food — a dollar spent here will save several in health care costs over the long term .
Vindication for anyone who ever tried to convince friends and family to switch away from Internet Explorer came this week , courtesy of a series of benchmarks showing the latest version of the browser up as an extremely poor performer .
ZDNet 's Alex Serpo and Chris Duckett carried out a series of benchmarks on the alpha and beta releases of the next generation of web browser , and the graph they 've build makes interesting reading .
Using the popular Sunspider JavaScript benchmark suite – which cycles through a range of common JavaScript operations , including 3D rendering and AES encryption – the pair ran five next generation web browsers through their paces : Opera 10 Alpha , Internet Explorer 8 Release Candidate 1 , Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 , Chrome 2.0.158.0 , and the Webkit r40220 engine on which it 's based .
While Internet Explorer 's place in the rankings – dead last – wo n't surprise many , the rather poor showing by Opera 's latest and greatest may shock some , especially given its reputation as a fast and efficient browser .
Internet Explorer 8 – which will be the default web browser provided by Windows 7 by Microsoft – fared poorly at the test , taking over four seconds to complete the test .
By comparison , Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 took well under two and a half seconds .
The Webkit engine also acquitted itself well , completing the test marginally faster than Firefox ; strangely , Google 's Chrome browser – which is based on the Webkit engine – managed to perform even better , headlining the benchmark at just over a second .
It 's bad news for Opera , however : the latest alpha build of the Opera 10 took almost as long as Internet Explorer to complete the test suite .
While that 's a poor showing for a browser which has always prided itself on speed and adherence to strict web standards , it can perhaps be explained away as being the onlybuild in a crowd of betas and release candidates .
Hopefully the company will have the performance issues fixed when version 10 gets released to the general public .
Aside from the surprising result for Opera , the tests show what many readers will have come to suspect : pretty much any browser other than Microsoft 's Internet Explorer will vastly improve your web experience – at least , if you use JavaScript a lot .
Mac users feeling left out by the lack of Safari in the test suite can be assured that it was likely to rank pretty highly – Apple 's browser uses the same open - source Webkit engine as test winner Chrome .
Pleased to see your browser of choice thrashing the monopolistic competition , or are you an Opera fan looking for answers as to the poor performance of the alpha release ?
Are these resultsnot enough to convince you to move away from Internet Explorer ?

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - Astronauts on the shuttle Columbia were trying to regain control of their craft before it broke apart in 2003 , but there was no chance of surviving the accident , a NASA report said on Tuesday .
Members of the space shuttle Columbia Reconstruction Team examine pieces of debris from the spacecraft as it is assembled in the RLV Hangar at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral , Florida in this May 7 , 2003 file photo .
REUTERS / Joe Skipper
From the crew ’s perspective , the shift from what appeared to be a normal descent on February 1 , 2003 , into disaster happened so fast that the astronauts did n’t even have time to close the visors on their helmets .
Columbia broke apart about 12 miles over Texas as it headed for landing at the Kennedy Space Center .
The cause of the accident was traced to a hole in one of the shuttle ’s wings , which was hit by a piece of falling foam insulation during launch 16 days earlier .
Seven astronauts , including Israel ’s first astronaut Ilan Ramon , were killed when superheated atmospheric gases blasted inside the breach like a blow torch , melting the ship ’s structure .
The crew cabin broke away from the ship and started spinning rapidly .
Analysis of the wreckage indicated the crew members had flipped cockpit switches in response to alarms that were sounding .
The astronauts had also reset the shuttle ’s autopilot system , the report said .
“ We have evidence from some of the switch positions that the crew was trying very hard to regain control .
We ’re talking about a very brief time in a crisis situation , ” said NASA ’s deputy associate administrator , Wayne Hale .
But rapid depressurization caused the Columbia crew to lose consciousness , and medical findings show that they could not have recovered , said the report , which took four years to compile .
“ This report confirms that although the valiant Columbia crew tried every possible way to maintain control of their vehicle , the accident was not ultimately survivable , ” said Hale , who oversaw the shuttle program during its return to flight after the accident .
TRAUMATIC INJURIES
Analysis shows the astronauts ’ shoulder harnesses failed and their helmets did not adequately protect their heads .
The lack of safety restraints caused traumatic injuries .
The investigation also found problems with the shuttle ’s seats and parachute landing system , which requires astronauts be conscious to operate manually .
Even if the safety gear had worked , the astronauts would have died due to the winds , shock waves and other extreme conditions in the upper atmosphere .
Designing spacesuits that are more automated and integrated into future spaceships is among 30 recommendations made in the report .
“ I call on spacecraft designers from all the other nations of the world , as well as the commercial and personal spacecraft designers here at home to read this report and apply these hard lessons which have been paid for so dearly , ” Hale said .
Also killed in the accident were shuttle commander Rick Husband , pilot William McCool and astronauts Michael Anderson , David Brown , Kalpana Chawla and Laurel Clark .
Much of what is in the report was discovered by the Columbia accident investigation team , which released a series of findings and recommendations six months after the disaster .
The panel advised retiring the space shuttles as soon as NASA finishes using them to complete construction of the International Space Station , a $ 100 billion project of 16 partner countries that has been under way for more than a decade .
The shuttle Challenger broke apart in 1986 .
Since the accident , NASA has flown 11 shuttle missions and has nine left in its schedule .
A 10th mission to fly a physics experiment to the space station is under consideration .

( CNN ) -- German billionaire Adolf Merckle , one of the richest men in the world , committed suicide Monday after his business empire got into trouble in the wake of the international financial crisis , Merckle 's family said Tuesday in a statement .
Merckle , 74 , was hit by a train in the southwestern town of Ulm , police said .
His family said the economic crisis had " broken " Merckle .
He was number 94 on the Forbes list of the world 's richest people .
He had fallen from number 44 on the Forbes 2007 rich list as his fortune declined from $ 12.8 billion to $ 9.2 billion in 2008 .
Merckle 's business empire included interests as diverse as cement - maker HeidelbergCement and generic drug - maker Ratiopharm .
But he lost hundreds of millions of dollars , including company capital , betting against Volkswagen stock last year .
The state government of Baden - Wuerttemberg rejected his petition for financial assistance , and he entered bailout talks with several German banks .
" The financial troubles of his companies , induced by the international financial crisis and the uncertainty and powerlessness to act independently which the financial problems brought about , broke the passionate family business man , and he took his own life , " his family wrote in the news release .
An employee of Germany 's railroad company found the body on the tracks at about 7 p.m. Monday and notified authorities .
Merckle 's family had already reported him missing earlier in the day after he walked out of the house and did not return .
Authorities are currently conducting DNA tests to confirm his identity .
CNN 's Frederik Pleitgen in Germany and Alysen Miller in London , England , contributed to this report .
The following is a response to many comments left on the Skeptic Blog in reply to my previous post on the skeptical battleground of so - called alternative medicine .
There are too many comments for me to reply to individually , so I will answer all the main points raised here .
Many of the usual points on the pro-CAM side were raised , and even though I have gone over all of them before on NeuroLogica and Science - Based medicine , it is worth reviewing them here .
Doctors are bad
Many of the comments made the basic point that the popularity of CAM is the fault of evil , uncaring , incompetent or dangerous doctors .
These comments took one of two forms – using negative claims about doctors and medicine to explain why CAM is popular , and using them to justify CAM .
These are similar but distinct claims .
The latter claim , that CAM is legitimate because scientific medicine “ does n’t have all the answers ” or is uncaring or corrupt , is a non sequitur .
The position of CAM critics like myself is that CAM treatments are unscientific , not proven , and often already proven to be unsafe or ineffective .
There should be a single science - based standard of care for all medicine – not a double standard where fraud and unscientific claims can flourish .
If we are currently not doing an adequate job enforcing the standard of care that is not a justification for abandoning it – it just means we need to figure out how to do a better job .
The claim that people are attracted to CAM because of the failings of scientific medicine seems to be the default assumption on the part of CAM apologists , but there is little evidence to support this claim .
In fact what few surveys that have been done show that dissatisfaction with scientific medicine is a minor factor in using CAM .
Users site the desire to feel as if they have control over their health care and philosophical reasons for their choice of CAM .
Also , 85 % of CAM users continue to use scientific medicine and use CAM only to “ complement ” their health care .
They are not choosing CAM instead of mainstream medicine – they just want to explore all their options .
So motivations for CAM use are more complex than the simple - minded propaganda of “ doctors are bad . ”
But there is a kernel of truth to this claim .
It is true that the experience of mainstream medicine can often be cold and complex .
The current ethical standards of informed consent mean that doctors are obligated to tell patients the unpleasant truth .
Tests are often unpleasant to endure also .
Further , managed care has put tremendous pressure on the health care system and as a result office visits are generaly shorter than they have been in the past .
The bottom line is this – the system is paying for less medicine ( especially for E&M – evaluation and management ) , so patients are getting less medicine .
Many older physicians in the 1990 ’s simply retired , because they literally could not afford to keep their practice open .
For medical practice not based on procedures revenue is down by about 60 % over the last 20 years .
Of course , if patients are willing to pay out - of - pocket then they can get as much time as they want with their physicians .
This is the model of so - called boutique clinics , or some spciality clinics .
It is also the model of most CAM providers , not by coincidence .
My point is that the answer to the challenges of the overwhelming costs and subsequent compromises of modern medicine is not to abandon the scientific standard of care .
Again – that is a dangerous non sequitur .
In fact , CAM just worsens the problem by diverting funds away from standard medicine .
Also , I acknowledge that CAM practitioners have largely mastered the psychological aspects of a positive therapeutic relationship .
Those are the selective pressures they have been under – to tell their clients what they want to hear .
They are not constrained by science , by informed consent – in short , by the truth .
They are free to give a simple explanation for every client that walks through their door , to claim that they have the answer for everything , and to design their treatments to be pleasant rather than effective .
Being disconnected from science and ethics can be very liberating .
There were also some specific claims made that I want to address .
Tracy wrote :
The problem with EBM is it takes too long and does n’t take the human cost of its long delays , or the format of its trials , into account .
The current regulatory setup is incredibly slow and somewhat unethical .
Its unethical to give dying people placebos in trials , yet its what has to be done right now .
This is both misleading and a logical fallacy .
It is another form of the argument from final consequences – people need treatments , therefore they should get them .
But what if no such treatment exists ?
Does that mean it is ethical to make up a fake treatment ?
The statements are also false .
The delay of doing clinical trials is definitely taken into account .
It is even possible to get experimental treatments on a compassionate basis for terminal illnesses .
Researchers and ethicists have actually spent decades being quite thoughtful on all these issues .
Also – it is unethical to withold a proven treatment from someone to put them in a trial – so no one gets a placebo instead of a proven treatment .
Preliminary open ( no placebo ) trials are often done before placebo - controlled trials , and if a treatment were dramatically effective it would be fast - tracked .
When possible the placebo arm is limited to 1/3 of study patients so that the chance of getting a placebo is minimzed .
Also , trials are monitored so that if a treatment is proven adequately to work before the trial is scheduled to conclude it can e stopped early so that that the treatment can be made available right away .
In other words – every effort is made to get effective treatments to dying or suffering patients as quickly as possible .
But Tracy ’s type of comments are common – people who do n’t have any actual experience in medicine or clinical research base their conclusions on assumptions and second - hand information , or perhaps what they see on tv .
But they have no relationship to the actual ethical standard in medicine .
Paula made a similar point when she wrote :
When people do not have satisfactory solutions to their ailments from traditional medicine , what would you skeptics propose they do ?
Just sit around and die ?
Of course not .
Take any reasonable action .
The more desperate one ’s situation , the greater the justification for speculative and risky treatments .
But this is already incorporated into the ethics and practice of scientific medicine .
There is a line , however – do not abandon all science and reason .
There is also a hidden assumption in Paula ’s point – that short of a cure there is nothing to do but go home and die .
This is almost never the case .
When a terminal disease cannot be cured there is often a great deal we can still do to maximize the duration and quality of life .
It is far better to focus your efforts on that – get the most out of the time you have left - then to spend your remaining days spending your family ’s money searching for a cure that does not exist .
I have seen patients spend tens of thousands of dollars on unsafe and unpleasant treatments outside the country , grasping for a sliver of hope that turned out to be a false hope .
They typically greatly regret the experience .
It is like hitting a drowning man over the head with a sledgehammer .
Some blamed the popularity of CAM on the for - profit nature of “ corporate ” medicine .
This is certainly part of the anti-medicine propaganda .
Also , as is commonly the case , there is a kernel of truth .
Conflicts of interest are a problem – but they are recognized and are largely being delt with .
Contrary to one commenters claims – doctors do not get “ kickbacks ” from pharmaceutical companies .
Kickbacks are illegal .
Large gifts from pharmaceutical reps for listening to their sales pitches have mostly already been weeded out .
Small gifts are on the wane also – mainly due to internal criticism by doctors who feel it taints our reputation with the appearance of conflict .
They probably have a point .
But , to be clear , medical decision making is largely driven by the standard of care – not financial conflicts of interest .
Actually , the biggest conflict probably comes from managed care , which provided a huge incentive not to treat .
This is a tangential issue – but it is impossible to design an incentive - neutral system .
Whoever pays for health care will be motivated to minimize it , and whoever profits will be motivated to maximize it .
You can shift the incentives around , but you cannot eliminate them .
And , let ’s remember that the whole argument is the fallacy of inconsistency .
CAM is largely a for - profit cottage industry .
They are just good at attacking their competition .
Doctors kill patients
Several commenters brought up the fact that many patients die from either medical mistakes or adverse drug reactions .
David Paterson specifically concludes that patients would have a better outcome going to a witch doctor than a medical doctor .
This argument , however , is based entirely on a fallacy – considering only the risks and not the benefits .
Dr. Harriet
Hall wrote an excellent recent post on one of the studies David cited , making that same basic point .
First , the numbers cited are likely greatly exagerated , but that is a side point I do n’t have time to go into today .
Even if we take them at face value – the point is that medical decision - making is all about risk vs benefit .
In order for any treatment to be considered ethical and part of the standard of care it must demonstrate benefit in excess of risk .
Standard of care also includes giving informed consent regarding the calculation of risk vs benefit .
Clinical trials are designed to look at the net effects of a treatment – if the only variable is the use of a specific treatment vs a placebo , what are the final outcomes for the patients ?
In fact , my primary criticism of CAM is that they generally have not gone through this analysis .
Most CAM modalities ( I know I am lumping here , but remember I am against the CAM category – every treatment needs to be considered individually , but I am responding to the CAM proponents ) have no proven benefit or have not demonstrated benefit in excess of risk .
It is therefore absurd to criticize scientific medicine in favor of CAM over the issue of risk .
The issue of risk management is medicine is a legitimate and serious issue .
But there already exists mechanisms within mainstream medicine to address the problem of mistakes and failures to meet the standard of care .
A great deal of progress has already been made , but we do need to do much better still .
The answer largely is in putting into place redundant systems that minimize error .
This is increasingly necessary as the practice of medicine becomes more complex .
Of course , if all you are doing is waving your hands over a patient there is not much that can go wrong – but there is n’t much that can go right , either .
CAM is preventive
Some of the commenters made the point that CAM focuses more on prevention .
This is simply not true .
All of the real effective preventive health measures , like diet and exercise , were discovered ( and continue to progress ) through scientific medicine .
Primary care doctors routinely advise patients to quit smoking , lose weight , eat a healthier diet , etc .
Blood pressure is often managed by reducing salt , high cholesterol by dietary changes , and diabetes by going on a diabetic diet and exercising regularly .
Aspirin is routinely prescribed to prevent heart attacks and strokes .
In my own practice I advice withdrawal of dietary triggers ( like caffeine ) or hydration to manage migraines , change in “ sleep hygiene ” to manage sleep problems , and stretching , exercise , gentle massage and moist heat to manage back pain .
I routinely check certain vitamin levels and prescribe supplements as needed .
The list goes on .
It is simply absurd to argue that doctors do not emphasize life - style changes or prevention .
These have already been built into the standard of care .
Such interventions are also often the low - hanging fruit – that ’s where we start because it is easy and low risk .
Medical management is used when the lifestyle changes are not enough , and invasive options , like surgery , are a last resort .
More importantly – we question what we do , we conduct research to find out what the best options are , and we change what we do based upon that evidence .
CAM practitioners do not change what they do in response to scientific evidence .
They certainly have never abandoned a worthless modality .
Can we do better ?
Of course .
That will always be true .
But we are doing better .
Simply taking a snap shot of the current state of medicine and arguing that any deficiencies warrant abandoning science as the standard of medicine is absurd .
Conclusion
I know I did not get to every point .
I could have written a dozen articles this length addressing every side point raised in the comments .
But I hit the highlights – the points that are most commonly raised .
I do n’t expect this entry will end any debate .
This is too complex and emotional an issue .
I do want to emphasize my central theme .
Most of the comments were distractions from the central issue – the public is best served by medical practices that are safe and effective .
The best way to maximize safety and effectiveness of medicine is through a standard of care based upon the best science available .
Magic and false hope are no substitute .
For no special reason I asked myself today what is the largest flower in the world ?
Kids usually ask such questions so better be prepared …

So , back to the answer , the biggest flower in the world is Rafflesia arnoldii a very rare flower that can be found in the rainforests of Indonesia .
It has the world ’s largest bloom , that can grow up to 3 feet across and may weigh up to 15 pounds , has no visible leaves , roots or stem .
Rafflesia arnoldii is actually a parasite that attaches to a host plant for water and nutrients and while in bloom emits an odor similar to rotten meat .
This is how it attracts insects that pollinate the plant .
The dramatic Rafflesia flowers are the largest single flowers in the world ; the leathery petals can reach over 90 centimetres across .
The Rafflesia plant is itself not visible until the reproduction stage when flowers first bud through the woody vine and then open into the magnificent spectacle that is world - renowned today .
The flowers can take up to 10 months to develop from the first visible bud to the open bloom , which may last no more than a few days .
Species of Rafflesia are known from peninsular Malaysia , Sumatra , Java , southern Thailand , Borneo and southern Philippines .
In some pictures it looks beautiful but I ’m sure it ’s not the perfect gift your wife is waiting for .
The trend of using texture in web design has been around for a while , but in 2008 it was taken to a new level .
Not only were there many beautiful sites launched that made use of textures , but there were also lots of useful texture packs created .
I ’ve taken the time to sort through them and hand pick the ones that I feel stand out in usefulness and beauty .

Sharia - compliant , or Islamic , finance is committed to promoting goals any proud progressive would recognise : equity , moderation , social justice .
It is a system that revolves around prudent lending , the reduction of risk , the sharing of profits and an absolute ban on speculation and the short - selling of stocks .
Debt is actively discouraged and so dealings with any organisation that has a balance sheet more than a third of which is debt ( which is to say , all banks ! ) are forbidden , as are investments in enterprises deemed unethical by Islamic scholars , such as casinos or weapons factories .
Perhaps the rarest feature , however , is the prohibition of interest - or making money out of money .
As it is not permissible for banks to charge interest on their loans , sharia - compliant deals are usually structured so that the bank ends up leasing the property to the homeowner , who essentially ends up paying rent until ownership is transferred .
Critics charge that the rent seems suspiciously similar to interest payments .
They also point out that it ends up costing homeowners more to set up and pay off Islamic mortgages than conventional products , like with all other niche products and , in particular , ethical investments : the so - called " piety premium " .
Islamic financiers disagree , stressing the joint - ownership and profit - sharing aspects of the sharia model .
" The relationship between us and the customer is based on sharing risk and sharing the rewards from the financing and investments we make on their behalf , " says Sultan Choudhury , commercial director at the Islamic Bank of Britain , this country 's only stand - alone , sharia - compliant retail bank .
" The returns are based on the amount of profit realised from each transaction . "
Let me declare an interest here ( in case you had not already noticed the name on the byline ) : I am a Muslim myself , a practising , believing Muslim .
Yet , to my shame perhaps , I own not a single sharia - compliant financial product or asset .
Until the recent implosion of the banking system , I had paid very little attention to the Islamic finance industry , assuming it was simply a niche activity at best , or a gimmick at worst .
As a result , my own current account , pension , mortgage , loans and credit cards are all as traditional , conventional and mainstream as the next ( non-Muslim ) man .
Islamic finance marries the freedom of the market economy to the fairness of social democracy
Yet the reality is that Islamic finance is growing faster than any other subset of world banking , at an average annual rate of between 15 and 20 per cent .
The IMF says the number and reach of sharia - compliant financial institutions worldwide has risen from one institution in one country in 1975 to more than 300 institutions operating in more than 75 countries today .
Over the past year alone , sharia - compliant assets across the globe have grown by almost a third to more than $ 639bn , according to the latest analysis of the industry from the Banker magazine .
If the current trends continue , Islamic finance will have broken through the $ 1trn mark by 2010 .
Here in Britain , the Financial Services Authority has licensed five stand - alone Islamic banks - including the Islamic Bank of Britain , which has been reporting a significant increase in the number of non-Muslim customers applying for accounts since the start of the financial crisis .
Bank officials say the numbers are growing because Islamic finance offers a " safer option " for savers and investors , regardless of faith .
According to the Islamic Bank of Britain 's marketing director , Steven Amos : " Our core business will always be Muslims , but the numbers of non-Muslims are really picking up .
We 've had increased interest and it's one of the number of reasons why we 're insulated from the credit crunch . "
To get an Islamic bank account you do n’t have to go to the Islamic Bank of Britain only .
So far , 20 major global banks have set up units to provide sharia - compliant financial services .
HSBC began offering Islamic products and services to its customers in 2003 ; Lloyds TSB followed in 2005 .
The mainstream has gone Muslim .
Emile Abu - Shakra , spokesman for Lloyds TSB , explains .
" We started offering Islamic financial products about three years ago and when we started out we were just in five branches around the country , " he says .
" Now we are in two thousand branches . "
The bank has now expanded its range of products to include a current account , a mortgage , a student account , an investment fund and a business and corporate account .
Its Islamic finance products are designed with Muslims in mind , but anyone can use them if they fulfil their needs .
Does Lloyds TSB believe further growth and diversification in the field are still possible ?
" The principles of Islamic finance could be applied to a number of different products , so there are possibilities for Islamic versions of credit cards , loans , saving accounts and asset finance as well , " says Abu - Shakra .
" It 's just a matter of time . "
The remarkable feature of Islamic financial institutions , products and assets is that , although they may have not produced fantastically high returns in any one year , they have produced consistent returns over the past decade - and continue to do so even now , in the wake of the credit crunch .
This year , global markets are down by more than a third off their peak but the Dow Jones Islamic Financials Index , in comparison , has lost 7 per cent over the same period and actually rose 4.75 per cent in the most recent September quarter .
Such statistics make me truly wonder whether Islamic banking , with its antipathy towards excessive risk , debt and interest , and with its emphasis on linking deposits and investments to real , underlying assets , could have saved us from the credit crunch .
" Had the Islamic financing principle of fairness and the concept of investing in partnership been slightly more prevalent in conventional banking of late , events may have turned out a little differently , " says Dan Taylor , head of banking at the accountancy giant BDO Stoy Hayward .
" The Islamic principle of requiring securities to be backed by assets means that the use of , say , collateralised debt oblig a tions , or CDOs , would not have been allowed by sharia - compliant institutions . "
Professor Rodney Wilson , who teaches Islamic finance at Durham University , agrees .
He mentions that not a single sharia - compliant financial institution has failed since the start of the current crisis .
Why ?
" Islamic banks follow a classical model of funding from their own deposits rather than borrowing from wholesale markets . "
Excessive leverage is therefore not an option for a sharia - compliant bank - as opposed to conventional banks , which in this country by 2008 were lending out roughly £ 700 bn more than they took in deposits , betting that the good times would go on for ever and tomorrow would never come .
Well , it did : the conventional banking sector is now on the verge of collapse .
Meanwhile , Islamic institutions here in Britain continue to make money .
The European Islamic Investment Bank , a UK AIM - listed sharia - compliant investment bank , reported revenues up 14 per cent in June 2008 interims .
On the retail side , the Islamic Bank of Britain reported 5.5 per cent growth in customer numbers and 7.2 per cent growth in customer deposits in the six months to June .
So , it is no wonder that the British government - despite distancing itself from the Archbishop of Canterbury 's ten tative support for sharia law courts - has been proactively encouraging the proliferation of sharia - compliant financial institutions for several years now .
When he was chancellor , Gordon Brown repeatedly urged the City of London to become the " gateway to Islamic finance " .
Just late last month , the government announced the launch of the first sharia - compliant pension funds , and officials are now even considering using special interest - free , asset - backed Islamic bonds , or sukuks , to help fund the building of the athletes ' village for the London 2012 Olympics .
In America early last month , the US treasury
department hosted a course for policymakers called “ Islamic Finance 101 ” .
This followed a visit to Saudi Arabia by the treasury deputy secretary Robert Kimmitt , during which he confirmed that sharia - compliant finance is now firmly on his country ’s agenda .
“ The US government is studying the salient features of Islamic banking to ascertain how far it could be useful in fighting the ongoing world economic crisis , ” he said .
The Islamic finance industry is entering a brave and surprisingly welcoming new world - but obstacles remain .
Determining exactly what is or is n't sharia - compliant , for example , can be difficult .
Banks such as HSBC and Lloyds TSB have their own sharia advisory boards , made up of senior Islamic scholars , but one board 's interpretation of compliance with the sharia is not necessarily the same as another's .
Standardisation of rules and regulations across the sector is vital , but could take some time .
It could also be a while before we even have enough scholars to carry out the standardising - right now , according to one survey , there are only about 260 Islamic scholars worldwide who have the requisite knowledge , business savvy and linguistic skills .
However , others , like Professor Wilson , are more sanguine .
" The shortage of qualified and experienced scholars should not be a problem in the longer run , as there are aspiring British Muslim scholars studying for higher degrees who have a good knowledge of both Islamic law and modern finance . "
So Islamic banking is here to stay .
It is a practical , viable and resilient alternative .
To borrow a phrase from the Archbishop of Canterbury , the spread of sharia finance , if not sharia law , now " seems unavoidable " .
I have even convinced myself : I now intend to invest in a sharia - friendly sukuk and to try to switch my interest - only conventional mortgage to an interest - free Islamic version .
In this era of financial crises and economic chaos , it may be time for all of us - Muslims and non-Muslims , investors and savers alike - to join the halal banking revolution .
It may be our only hope .

The following stunning display of driver ignorance is making the rounds in a number of fan - boy forums across the internet : a Jeep owner mowed over a mattress and decided to press forward .
Only after his vehicle stalled due to lack of fuel after 30 miles did he decide to contact the dealer and see what the matter might be .
What unfolds can only be described as an Escher - like hellscape .

The amalgamation of cord and wires that used to be a mattress wound itself around the driveshaft and rear axle , creating a deadly whip that gashed it 's way through the gas tank .
The draining of his precious fuel , not the terrible shaking , is what ultimately brought the owner into the dealer .
We would 've loved to be part of the laugh - fest that surely took place at said dealer after this mess rolled in .

This guy ran over a mattress and decided to keep going .
The ensuing jumble finally whipped around enough to put a tear in the gas tank ,
the subsequent lack of fuel is what finally brought this vehicle to its knees .

Impeachment spot to run in California David Edwards and Diane Sweet
Published : Monday December 1 , 2008
Print This Email This The National Impeachment Network is planning to run an advertisement on California television during the months of December and January 2009 which advocates for the impeachment of President George W. Bush .
Headed by Ralph Lopez , diarist at the left - leaning Daily Kos , the National Impeachment Network is supported by grassroots groups such as Code Pink , Veterans for Peace and Republicans for Impeachment .
From the network 's website :
" Ralph Lopez at the National Impeachment Network has created this ad for television , a version of which has already run in Vermont on Fox News , MSNBC , CNN Headlines , and other stations .
We are going over the heads of congressmen and appealing directly to their constituents in order to generate pressure for impeachment .
Impeachment can be accomplished in three days with single article like refusing to obey congressional subpoenas .
In an up - or - down vote before the entire Congress , even Republicans who are not part of the rabid right will start hearing from their constituents to impeach .
Bush has no friends left , and he shouldnt .
They can do it .
And the future of democracy will be that much more secure , with his unprecedented law - breaking firmly punished . "
The ad features images of flag - draped caskets and grieving military families , along with George W. Bush addressing the crowd before an annual Correspondent 's Club dinner with now infamous jokes about not being able to find weapons of mass destruction .
It also includes a clip of author and former Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles County Vincent Bugliosi 's congressional testimony regarding the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
The ad encourages California citizens to contact their representatives in Washington to demand impeachment of the President .
The ad , as prepared for broadcast , follows .

Oil players stockpile cheap crude on tankers
Oil demand has plummeted along with home prices and stock market indexes , but discerning where energy demand could go in 2009 is n’t easy .
That ’s why , as oil markets attempt to calibrate in the face of this recession , some traders , refiners , big oil companies and other interests have been buying cheap oil in recent weeks and squirreling it away in storage tanks and ships with plans to unload it months from now when prices are higher .
It ’s difficult to quantify exactly how much oil is being stored in ships , but Frontline LTD , which runs one of the largest crude supertanker fleets , estimates 80 million barrels of oil are drifting slowly on the high seas — roughly equal to a day ’s oil consumption for the entire world .
Storage space for oil has become so tight in the U.S. it ’s tough to find room onshore .
According to the latest report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration , 339 million barrels of crude are in commercial stocks — a 16 percent increase over this time last year and well above the U.S. average .
As oil demand drops , crude has filled tank farms in storage hubs like Cushing , Okla . , and packed an underground network of pipelines .
The demand slump and supply glut are forcing some domestic producers to pull back on exploration for new oil and production of existing reserves .
U.S. oil production is down 2 percent year - over - year , and imports of foreign crude have dipped , according to the Energy Information Agency , a unit of the Department of Energy .
In the last four months , 807 drilling rigs have been taken out of commission — a third of the total that were operating during drilling ’s peak at the end of September , says Jeff Dietert , an analyst with Simmons & Company International .
In addition to dropping 70 percent since its record high closing price of $ 145.29 a barrel on July 3 , the oil market has gone into contango , a condition in which the current price of crude is less than contracts for future delivery of oil months from now .
That ’s motivating players in the energy market to stockpile .
Here ’s why : Oil purchased Friday for $ 41.68 a barrel could immediately be sold through a forward contract for September delivery at a price of $ 52.85 a barrel .
That ’s a gross profit of more than $ 11 per barrel before storage costs .
Those costs vary , but tanker rates have been dropping and Dietert says chartering a vessel that holds up to 2 million barrels of oil is running about $ 60,000 a day .
That means storing oil at sea for six months would cost roughly $ 1 per barrel per month , leaving a profit of more than $ 5 per barrel .
Investors rushed headlong into the contango , as the spread between 1 - month and 12 - month crude futures widened to $ 17 in early December .
That gap between current and future prices narrowed recently to as little as $ 10 per barrel , although on Friday the one - year spread was $ 14.70 a barrel .
Dietert says that when the gap in price between oil contracts closes , the incentive to store oil will disappear .
“ For now the contango is still sufficiently wide to justify continued storage on tankers , ” he says , “ but probably not good enough for new players to start doing this .
Dietert says the gap in oil prices is beginning to close because the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is cutting its production , taking oil off the market in the hopes of stopping the price slide .
“ This could signal we ’re near a bottom in terms of prices , ” he says .
Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading Corp . thinks the oil market ’s contango is far from over .
He ’s projecting a vicious cycle of sorts for the next several months .
As oil prices rise , stored crude will be released into the market , causing a glut that will drive the price of oil back down again and motivating some players to store more of it .
Reports surfaced that some supertankers that had been used to store oil were being unloaded , he says , which resulted in weaker oil prices for a few days .
“ This could be the market saying these guys are dumping oil now but we still think we need to store it . ”
For now , some vessels are idling in the Gulf of Mexico until they get directions to unload at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Loop .
Others are doing slow circles around Scotland ’s Orkney Islands in the North Sea .
Still more are waiting off the coasts of once booming Asian economies .
“ We ’ve got a lot of oil with nowhere to go , ” Dietert says .

Bay sees record heat and maybe driest January BAY AREA

High - temperature records fell like imaginary raindrops in the Bay Area on Monday , among the warmest mid-January days ever .
It 's also shaping up to be one of the driest Januarys ever - if not the driest .
There 's been almost no rain this month , and none is in sight , the National Weather Service says .
The thermometer hit 74 in downtown San Francisco , breaking the old record for Jan. 12 of 67 , set in 1948 .
" We broke the records pretty much everywhere , " said weather service meteorologist Brian Tentinger .
" Breaking them was n't hard .
This was n't extreme heat , but it was very abnormal for January . "
The heat marks got their biggest thumping in Santa Rosa , where it was 84 degrees .
The old mark was 66 , set in 1967 .
The 77 degrees recorded at Oakland International Airport made it the warmest January day ever at that location .
The old mark was 75 , set on Jan. 8 , 1962 .
Downtown Oakland merely set a record for the date at 76 degrees , 11 degrees better than the old mark from 1980 .
In San Rafael , it was 75 , breaking the mark of 68 , set in 1948 .
In San Jose , it was 77 , six degrees warmer than 1948 's record .
Heat records also fell in Kentfield ( 74 , besting the 66 recorded in 1918 ) , Moffett Field ( 72 , beating the 65 set in 1980 ) and Gilroy ( 73 , nudging out the 72 set in 1959 ) .
The unseasonably warm weather is expected to continue , although the temperatures could decline a few degrees in the North Bay , Tentinger said .
That means the highest January temperature ever in San Francisco - 79 degrees - may be safe .
Leone Evans , 89 , of Oakland did n't need a thermometer to tell her that it was " absolutely gorgeous . "
Evans left her home state of Oregon - and its rainy weather - in the 1940s and vowed never to return .
She has n't .
" We have the most beautiful weather in the world , " Evans proclaimed as she took a breather on a bench at Snow Park near Lake Merritt .
Bob Benjamin of the National Weather Service said the main reason it's so warm is " the wind component " - strong gusts coming off the land , the reverse of the Bay Area 's normal , cooler onshore flow .
The strongest gust atop Mount Diablo on Monday morning was 78 mph , and winds elsewhere in the North and East Bay hills exceeded 50 mph .
The warm weather is the result of a fairly strong high - pressure system that is bumping storms far to the north , Benjamin said .
It 's a pattern that has been entrenched most of the fall and winter , an unwelcome development for a state coming off two consecutive years of below - average rainfall .
Since the start of the rain year July 1 , rainfall in San Francisco has totaled just 56 percent of average .
It 's been so dry since New Year 's Day that the National Weather Service is starting to keep an eye on whether this will be the driest January ever in the Bay Area .
The warm weather is not doing the Sierra snowpack any favors .
To state water officials , good weather is bad and bad weather is good .
The snowpack is about 67 percent of normal , said Matt Notley , a spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources .
That figure will go down in light of the next several days of predicted clear skies .
" We 're very concerned we 're experiencing another dry winter , " Notley said .
" Even an average year this year would not bring us out of drought . "
The driest January on record in San Francisco was in 1920 , when 0.26 of an inch of rain fell .
So far this January , the city is 0.02 of an inch short of that .
In Oakland , the driest January was in 1976 , during the first of two straight bone - dry years when mandatory rationing was the norm in Northern California and lawns by the thousands went unwatered .
The January total that year was 0.31 of an inch ; so far this January , Oakland has gotten 0.28 .

Among the pantheon of characters commonly associated with the Christmas season ( both the religious holiday and the secular wintertime celebrations ) , the beloved persona of Santa Claus is somewhat distinctive in that his appearance is neither one that has been solidified through centuries of religious tradition nor one that sprang fully - formed from the imagination of a modern - day writer or artist .
Santa Claus is instead a hybrid , a character descended from a religious figure ( St. Nicholas ) whose physical appearance and backstory were created and shaped by many different hands over the course of years until he finally coalesced into the now familiar ( secular ) character of a jolly , rotund , red - and - white garbed father figure who oversees a North Pole workshop manned by elves and travels in a sleigh pulled by eight reindeer to deliver toys to children all around the world every Christmas Eve .
Although we can identify some of the most influential sources who contributed to the formation of the modern Santa Claus figure ( such as writers Washington Irving and Clement Clarke Moore , historian John Pintard , and illustrator Thomas Nast ) no single person or institution can lay claim to having created him .
Nonetheless , we humans prefer definitive answers :
We want details about time , place , and source and tend to eschew ambiguous , indefinite , open - ended explanations .
We do n’t find satisfying the notion that Santa Claus is an evolutionary figure with no single , identifiable point of origin , so instead many of us have clung to the more satisfying , pat ( and somewhat cynical ) explanation that the modern appearance of Santa Claus was a commercial creation of the Coca - Cola company , who cannily promoted a version of Santa garbed in their red-and - white corporate colors .
It is true that , since Santa Claus is an evolutionary figure , he did not suddenly appear fully - formed one day and immediately supplant every other character traditionally associated with Christmas .
However , it is not true in any realistic sense that Coca - Cola “ created ” the modern Santa Claus : they did not invent the now - familiar rotund , bearded fellow clothed in red - and - white garb , nor did they pluck him from a pantheon of competing , visually different Christmastime figures and elevate him to the supreme symbol of Christmas gift - giving .
The red -and - white Santa figure existed long before Coca - Cola began featuring him in print advertisements , and he had already supplanted a bevy of competitors to become the standard representation of Santa Claus before he began his tenure as a pitchman for Coke .
At the beginning of the 1930s , as the burgeoning Coca - Cola company was looking for ways to increase sales of their product during winter ( then a slow time of year for the soft drink market ) , they turned to a talented commercial illustrator named Haddon Sundblom , who created a series of memorable drawings ( inspired in large part by Clement Clark Moore ’s 1822 poem “ A Visit from St. Nicholas ” ) that associated the figure of a larger than life , red- and - white garbed Santa Claus with Coca - Cola and the slogan “ The Pause That Refreshes , ” such as the following :
However , illustrations of lavishly bearded Santas ( and his predecessors ) , showing figures clothed in red suits and red hats with white fur trimming , held together with broad black belts , were common long before Coca - Cola ’s first Sundblom - drawn Santa Claus advertisement appeared in 1931 , as evidenced by these examples from 1906 , 1908 , and 1925 , respectively :
There was a period of overlap during which the modern Santa Claus character coexisted with other Christmas figures and other versions of himself , as his now - standard appearance and persona jelled and his character grew in popularity to become the dominant ( secular ) Christmas figure in the western world .
However , that period had ended before Coca - Cola began utilizing Santa for their holiday season advertisements .
As noted in a New York Times article published in 1927 , four years before the appearance of Sundblom ’s first Santa - based Coca - Cola ad , the Santa Claus figure rendered by Sundblom was based upon what had already become the standard image of Santa :
A standardized Santa Claus appears to New York children .
Height , weight , stature are almost exactly standardized , as are the red garments , the hood and the white whiskers .
The pack full of toys , ruddy cheeks and nose , bushy eyebrows and a jolly , paunchy effect are also inevitable parts of the requisite make - up .

Leaked Star Wars Battlefront 3 Gameplay Footage
Last week I watched the most frightening horror movie I 've ever seen .
It was about three hours long , and , incredibly , it all unfolded live .
I 'm talking , of course , about the inauguration of Barack Obama .
Yes it was inspiring , yes it was uplifting ... but it was also genuinely terrifying on a very human level , because just like you I was watching it with the terrible nagging suspicion that he might get shot at any moment .
At this point it 's worth stating unequivocally that I 've never wanted to see anyone being shot , thank you very much , whether they 're a president or the world 's biggest arsehole or both .
And fortunately , such things rarely happen .
But I 've seen too many films , and far too much 24 .
I 've been conditioned to almost expect it .
So now , whenever the news cuts live to a politician - any politician - making a speech , I 'm gripped by an eerie sense of dread and have to change the channel .
Obama 's inauguration , however , was too big to miss .
All that hope and expectation distilled into one man whose election has , at a stroke , reminded the world of all that is good and remarkable and inspiring and simply downright wonderful about the most exciting nation on earth : America .
For the last eight years , watching America at work was like watching the scenes in Superman III where Superman , under the influence of red kryptonite , goes " bad " and grows stubble and gets drunk and starts vandalising the city and shouting at kids .
He 's only stopped when his geeky alter ego Clark Kent magically fights his way out from within , and stands blinking before him , in his nerdy suit and thick glasses .
Evil Superman scowls , and the pair have a cathartic bust - up in a junkyard - at the end of which Evil Superman is finally vanquished .
As a battered but unbowed Clark Kent gazes up at the heavens , the theme music swells , and he pulls his shirt open to reveal - ta da ! - a fresh , clean Superman costume he'd been wearing underneath the whole time .
Then he flies off and beats up Robert Vaughn or something , which is a shame because until then it had all been a pretty good metaphor for the redemptive spectacle of last November 's election .
And now it 's just a silly action movie I probably should n't have mentioned in the first place .
Still , Obama really has been elevated to the position of Superman in many minds , to the point where it's hard to keep a check on expectations ; we 're all yearning for him to single - handedly save the world .
Hearing him referred to as " President Obama " on the news still seems too good to be true , like waking up the morning after falling in love and wondering whether you 're dreaming .
But we 're also aware he is n't a Man of Steel ; painfully aware too that the world contains its fair share of racists and paranoid gun nuts , which is why many of those tuning into the inauguration did so with a mixture of joy and trepidation .
Everyone I know had voiced the same dark fears , even in the face of constant updates from the news networks regarding the mammoth security operation surrounding the day .
We were told Obama would be travelling in a mortar - proof vehicle thronged by secret service vans , each filled with about 200 tiny Jack Bauers , packed in like sardines ; there were radio jammers to prevent the detonation of bombs and a magic experimental gas enveloping the Mall capable of transforming bullets into harmless glitter .
Nonetheless , the entire thing unfolded like one of those scenes in a slasher flick when the heroine heads into a spooky old house on her own , and it all goes quiet , and you tense uncontrollably in your seat , knowing that at any moment someone in a hockey mask is going to burst from a cupboard wielding a threshing machine or something .
The rolling news networks , which rarely shy from exploitative gimmicks , clearly missed a trick by not offering an alternative commentary option in which a jittery , paranoid viewer accompanied proceedings with jittery , paranoid narration .
" Here 's the presidential motorcade now ... oh Jesus , he 's stepping out !
He 's in the open !
Where 's security , goddammit ?
Look at the size of that crowd ... let 's hope they frisked everyone on their way in .
He 's approaching the podium ...
That bulletproof glass is a bit low for my liking .
Oh Christ I can't watch . "
And so on .
When the ceremonial cannons went off following the swearing - in itself , you could actually hear buttocks clenching around the world .
Did they really have to do that ?
It just felt downright mean .
Because , quite frankly , the vast majority of people on this planet would be far happier if , for the remainder of his presidency , Obama only makes public appearances encased within a gigantic iron - and - concrete ball , addressing crowds via a Wi -Fi link to a nearby tannoy .
And even then , it'd be more comforting to assume that this was , in fact , a bluff : that the concrete ball was empty , and the man himself was actually speaking to us from a deep underground bunker , ideally one situated on a different planet , made of cotton wool , in another universe altogether , unmarked on any map , somewhere round the back of our most peaceful and powerful collective dreamings .
This week Charlie got halfway through Self - Made Man , by Norah Vincent , a real - life story about a lesbian who disguised herself as a man for a year in a bid to discover what makes males tick : " It was described on the back as ' the most talked - about book of 2006 ' , which was news to me , but it 's fascinating nonetheless .

American golfer John Daly grabbed a spectator 's camera and smashed it into a tree during the first round of the Australian Open at Royal Sydney today .
Daly , who is heading for an early exit from the tournament , pushed his tee shot on the ninth hole - his final one of the round - and walked into a clump of trees when golf fan Brad Clegg tried to take his picture from close range .
It was the last straw for Daly , who was clearly frustrated at his lack of success in three tournaments in Australia this season .
After snatching the camera he stalked up to the nearest tree and hurled it with all his force into the trunk , saying " you want it back , I 'll buy you a new one " .
As Daly completed the hole Mr Clegg , a 15 - handicapper at Sydney club Ashlar , was left to pick up the pieces - literally .
Mr Clegg , who had taken a leave day especially to see Daly play , said it was a disappointing way to finish the day .
" It has n't ended well , " he said .
Asked if he would be seeking compensation , Mr Clegg said : " I do n't think I 'll be chasing him for the money .
He 's a big bloke " .
Mr Clegg said he had come out specifically to watch Daly because it might be the last chance he has .
" It was very unexpected , " he said .
Mr Clegg said he did not think he had provoked Daly .
" I was bold but I was n't unreasonable , " he said .
Daly shot a 6 - over - par 78 and will need something special tomorrow if he is to avoid missing his third cut in as many weeks .
He was paid appearance money to play on the Australian circuit this year and while organisers believe he has pulled people through the gate he has not delivered results on the course .

On January 16 , the Canadian Food Inspection Agency issued another listeria alert following contamination of Hygaard submarine sandwiches , which were distributed in northern Alberta and Saskatchewan .
Now , Prime Minister Stephen Harper will finally appoint someone to investigate the listeriosis outbreak last year in Maple Leaf Foods products , which killed 20 Canadians .
This is according to a story in today 's National Post by Don Martin , who relied on unnamed sources .
Harper ’s handling of this situation suggests food safety is n’t near the top of his political agenda .
He declared there would be an investigation last September , four days before an election was called .
At the time , he claimed that the investigation would be completed by March 15 .
But by mid-January , he still had n’t named anyone to look into the matter .
And when he got around to this -- if Martin 's story is true , and it is n't a trial balloon -- this only occurred after another listeria problem surfaced in luncheon meat in Harper 's home province .
It 's probably no coincidence that the appointment of an investigator , Sheila Weatherill , will occur shortly before Parliament was about to resume , when Harper would face this issue in Question Period .
Now , he will be able to say he can't speak about listeria because it 's under investigation .
In typical Harper fashion , he appears ready to muzzle Weatherill , a former president of the Edmonton Health Authority .
Martin noted that she wo n’t be able to speak to the media until her work is filed with Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz by July 20 — more than four months after the prime minister ’s original deadline .
This will prevent Weatherill from going on talk shows to raise awareness of the issue .
Ritz , who gained national notoriety after cracking jokes about the fatal listeriosis outbreak , will be in a position to release the report in the middle of summer , when the public does n’t pay much attention to the news .
The Conservatives will enjoy the added benefit of doing this while Parliament is on a summer break , ensuring there wo n’t be any nasty exchanges during Question Period while the news of the report is fresh .
But that ’s not all .
Harper appears ready to prevent Weatherill from issuing subpoenas to force people to testify .
This would reduce the likelihood of any whistleblower revelations to Weatherhill .
Harper ’s handling of this issue stands in stark contrast with Maple Leaf Foods , which made its officials available to the media , took responsibility for its errors , and paid a $ 25 - million settlement to the victims .
Harper rode into power in 2006 promising greater accountability to Canadians .
What he delivered was a command - and - control government operated out of the prime minister ’s office .
The investigation into the listeriosis outbreak , which killed 20 people , appears to be another example of this .
What a shame for anyone who cares about food safety in this country .
I fear for future generations , I really do .
They ’ll already be hampered with giant thumbs thanks to the genetic legacy handed down to them by forefathers who spent 23 out of every 24 hours texting and now they ’re destined to drive aimlessly over cliffs because no one in the world will be able to read a map thanks to in - car satellite navigation systems .
A recent report revealed that UK drivers trust their sat -nav systems more than they trust their own eyes ; just allow a few seconds for that sentence to sink into your brain before you take to your bed and weep for a week over the lost innocence of maps .
In the past , sat - nav owners have driven into the River Avon and to the edge of a 100 - foot drop because their tracking gizmos told them to .
An ambulance crew transferring a patient 12 miles from Ilford to Brentwood drove 200 miles in the wrong direction because they were following directions from their sat -nav system .
At some point , surely , you ’d think they might have noticed that the half hour journey was taking around four hours longer than usual .
But no – it ’s this kind of blind obedience that helped Hitler get a foothold in Germany .
The real irony is that the youth of today ( my descent into the world of the bitter old goat continues apace – next I ’ll be berating the charts for not having any songs with lyrics ) absolutely hate being told what to do , yet they ’re all queuing up like lemmings to buy a box which tells them what to do ALL THE TIME .
It does n’t even convert into a TV when it ’s not barking orders at you .
If it ’s not telling you what to do , it ’s telling you just how depressing the road ahead will be ; roadworks , traffic jams , accidents , hairpin bends , hurricanes , plagues of locusts – they all lie ahead .
Frankly , I ’d rather not know .
Being stuck in a motionless line of traffic is the only chance I get to have some of this “ me ” time I ’m always being told about in glossy magazines .
This week , while out and about in my car , two drivers allowed their vehicles to roll backwards into mine while fiddling with their sat-nav .
One had the good grace to wave at me apologetically , the other simply drove away , probably because his sat -nav told him to .
Personally , I like living on the razor ’s edge and relying only on a road atlas bought from a Jet garage in 1988 as a means to convey me from one location to another .
Is n’t part of the joy of a family day trip the prospect of spending at least a quarter of the journey aimlessly winging it and lying to the children about knowing precisely where you are ?
Admittedly , this policy has led to some spectacular “ short cuts ” through Wales on the way from Norwich to King ’s Lynn , but at least I was the master of my own destiny and to my credit , I did n’t end up in a river or dangling from the edge of a cliff .
By the time my children have cars ( which , by the way , will be never unless they arrange a police and paramedic escort for every journey they undertake ) they wo n’t need to drive at all , they ’ll just get in a car , telepathically relate where they want to go to some kind of gigantic brain on the dashboard and then sit back while the on - board robot serves them moon pills and space juice and drives them straight into the nearest reservoir .
Showing my kids a map and asking them if they could use it to get from a to b will be like giving you or I a mangle , a bar of soap and a tin bucket and asking us to spend the entire day scrubbing the family ’s smalls .
They ’ll have braying computers built into their toilets to remind them to wipe their bums and wash their hands and a microchip in their forehead telling them when to breathe .
Before sat - nav salesmen grab their green biros to point out to me that their systems are marvellous and I ’m the kind of technophobe who makes the sign of a cross if anyone uses so much as a microwave oven in my eyeshot , let me point out that new research proves that I ’m right .
Computer
Which ?
a magazine for fearsomely clever boffins who do n’t fly into a panic if people start talking to them about jpegs and motherboards commissioned a survey to see just how reliable sat -nav systems are .
The research revealed that an £ 8 road atlas beat a high - tech satellite navigation system on a simple 70 mile journey , despite the latter costing more than 28 times the price of the book .
Granted , the AA book did n’t look quite as good mounted on the dashboard , but it worked , although to be fair , the survey did note “ you need a level - headed passenger with map - reading skills ” which cancels out a great deal of hollow - skulled halfwits to whom maps are like flat pack instruction manuals written in Sanskrit .
In a manner of speaking , sat - nav systems are a perfect example of Darwinism – if you blindly drive your car into a ford or to the edge of a cliff because a jumped - up calculator tells you to then you ’re proving the theory that only the fittest deserve to survive .
