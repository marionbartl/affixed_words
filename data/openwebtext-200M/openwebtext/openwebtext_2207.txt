Cloture Vote on Housing Bill Passes ; 9 Republicans Step Up to the Plate
Even though it was inevitable that the Democrats would get the cloture vote that Harry Reid was seeking on the Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008 ( aka : Housing Bailout Bill ) , I have to admit that I was quite surprised to see it get the overwhelming support that it did .
T he final vote on H.R. 3221 was 83 yea’s , 9 nay ’s , and then there were 8 member of the Senate who were either running for President , recovering from surgery , or simply did n’t want to show the American people that they had a pair and stand up for what is right .
Regardless of how this vote turned out , there are 9 members of the Senate who deserve our thanks and gratitude for standing up and speaking out against this horrible piece of legislation .
Senators who have a pair :
Senator John Barrasso , Wyoming
Senator Christopher Bond , Missouri
Senator James Bunning , Kentucky
Senator Michael Crapo , Idaho
Senator Jim DeMint , South Carolina
Senator John Ensign , Nevada
Senator Michael Enzi , Wyoming
Senator Jon Kyl , Arizona
Senator David Vitter , Louisiana
And then there are those Senators who simply do n’t get it :

If you ’re covering the post - cloture segments of the Housing Bailout Bill , let me know , I ’d be more than happy to add your link to the list .
Competition is good , and it means there are more options for the customers out there .
It can be a challenge for the shop owners too .
It could backfire , and you can end up not standing out well at all .
Did you know there are simple things that can make your shop stand out from the rest ?
First things first , you need to change your mindset .
The secret is to be different .
It is different in a more fundamental way .
You may need to start with the layout of your store . …
One warning sign :
There are Carter loyalists who still blame Ted Kennedy for his 1980 defeat .
| Composite image by POLITICO Will Clinton take the blame if Obama falls ?
In classic Washington finger - pointing style , the Democratic primary is only barely over but the recriminations are already being teed up .
The main thrust of them is this : Will supporters of Sen. Barack Obama blame Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton if Obama loses in November ?
Advertisement
While the point might eventually prove moot , her decision to remain in the race well past the point in which Obama appeared to have an insurmountable delegate lead has nevertheless generated discussion about what responsibility , if any , she might bear in the event of an Obama loss .
“ If the Democrats do n’t win the White House back this fall there will be a hard core contingent of young Obama supporters who will be extremely disappointed , ” said Alexandra Acker , executive director of the Young Democrats of America .
“ They will be looking for someone to blame and some may look to the long primary . ”
Democratic strategists , elected officials and political analysts interviewed by Politico agreed that any debate that surfaces over her culpability will be colored by how hard Clinton works to heal the rift between now and Election Day .
“ Attitudes about Sen. Clinton among Obama supporters will be shaped almost entirely by her attitude , effort , and success in bringing the party together over the next several months , ” said Jim Jordan , a Democratic consultant , in an email interview .
“ [ The question is ] does Sen. Clinton go through the motions or does she go all out ? ” said Peter Hart , a Democratic pollster .
“ That is easily seen by the voters and the party leaders . ”
Hart noted that the tone of the Democratic National Convention will also determine the course of the blame game .
“ No one blames John Kerry ’s loss on his opponents , ” said Hart .
“ But many of the [ Jimmy ] Carter folks blame Ted Kennedy for the effect of the 1980 convention . ”
Strategists close to the Clintons express confidence that they will work hard for Obama .
“ The Clintons are politically astute and it ’s in their interest to do everything they can to support Obama , ” said Chris Lehane , a Democratic consultant who worked in the Clinton White House and supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign .
Yet even if Hillary Clinton goes to great lengths to ensure Obama ’s election , there ’s no guarantee she ’ll emerge unscathed from an Obama loss .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that fingers will be pointed , ” said Thomas Schaller , a political scientist at the University of Maryland - Baltimore County .
“ Obama supporters will blame Hillary . …
Hillary supporters will say ' I told you so , ' ” said pollster Scott Rasmussen in an e-mail .
Most Democrats , however , express confidence that once the general election begins in earnest , voters will become too absorbed in it to reflect back on the primary .
“ The nature of this race is going to change almost overnight , ” said Mike Feldman , a Democratic strategist who worked for Al Gore and was unaligned in this primary .
“ I do n’t think that people are going to be looking back at the primary . ”
“ I think the mindset will shift very quickly to Obama - McCain , ” said Rep. Artur Davis of Alabama .
If there is an epidemic of finger - pointing in November , say some Democrats , it ’s likely to take root among Obama ’s most devoted constituencies — young voters and African - Americans .
But Davis said that whatever resentment African - Americans may feel toward the Clintons at the moment will be quickly overshadowed by the harsher attacks Obama will face in the general election .
“ If anyone thinks the Clintons ran a divisive campaign , they have n’t seen what the Republicans will do this fall , ” said Davis .
Obama ’s young fans , said Acker , will be watching his reaction closely .
“ I think young people will take their cues from the Obama campaign , ” she said .
“ Sen . Obama will have a lot of power to encourage his young supporters to maintain their enthusiasm . ”
I ’ve got a mini-announcement .
Starting this week about half of my time at Mozilla is going to be spent driving the direction of the brand - new Mozilla Firebug team .
I ’m , understandably , quite excited about this proposition .
Like all web developers I ’ve found Firebug to be an invaluable tool for web development .
We have a great team forming – I ’m going to be joined by :
We ’re in a very primordial stage right now – we ’re meeting at the Firefox Summit at the end of the month and again at the beginning of August for the Firebug Working Group .
We ’ll be setting some major goals for post - Firebug 1.2 development .
I highly suspect that we ’ll be doing some exploratory Firebug extension development as well .
In the meantime we ’ll be hanging out in the Firebug IRC channel , which can be found here :
Server : irc.mozilla.org
Room : # firebug
We ’re going to love to hear any suggestions for feature development – I ’m sure you ’ve got tons of ideas – and we do as well .
I ’m quite excited about all of this .
Here ’s to a bright Firebug future !
Shareholders searching for détente in the battle between Yahoo and Microsoft are unlikely to find it in Microsoft ’s new proposal to buy Yahoo ’s search business , one the Internet company swiftly rejected on Saturday .
The proposal made late last week represents a formal alliance between Microsoft , whose takeover efforts Yahoo had rebuffed for months , and the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn , who is seeking to unseat Yahoo ’s board .
It also represents a newer , more hostile approach by Microsoft , in which the software giant is willing to team up with one of the most aggressive activist shareholders today .
Among its requirements were the replacement of Yahoo ’s board  and a response within 24 hours .
Microsoft ’s muscular approach and Yahoo ’s strong and quick rejection suggest that investors can expect a showdown at Yahoo ’s annual shareholder meeting on Aug .
1 .
“ Microsoft and Mr. Icahn are trying to dismantle the company and deliver our search business to Microsoft on terms that would be disadvantageous to Yahoo stockholders , ” Roy Bostock , Yahoo ’s chairman , said in a statement .
“ We are prepared to let our stockholders , not Microsoft and Carl Icahn , decide what is in their best interests and we look forward to the upcoming vote . ”

Behe vs Lampreys : A modest proposal .
May 10 , 2008 11:09 MST
Intelligent Design advocates regularly claim that Intelligent Design is science .
However , a recent paper on the lamprey genome demonstrates the sharp gulf between science and ID .
One of the key icons of ID is Michael Behe ’s “ irreducibly complex ” clotting system .
In 1996 he claimed that the clotting system was unevolvable , and no simpler clotting system could exist .
In contrast , in 1987 evolutionary biologist Russell Doolittle hypothesised that the clotting system had been built up by co-option of duplicated genes .
Doolittle specifically predicted that fish would lack key elements of the Mammalian clotting system ( elements of the intrinsic or contact clotting system ) .
Let ’s see how those predictions fared .
Since he first made his prediction , Russell Doolittle has been extensively examining the clotting systems of different organisms .
By 2003 , after over a decade of hard work , it was apparent that bony fish did lack the intrinsic clotting system , ironically the system that Behe describes in some detail in “ Darwins Black Box ” .
By 2003 it also seemed that jawless fish also lacked key elements of the intrinsic clotting system , in line with Doolittle ’s prediction and the opposite of Behe ’s claim .
Now , it would have been easy for Doolittle to rest there , with favourable evidence for his prediction .
But no , he and his colleagues put it to a more stringent test , searching for clotting factor genes in the trace archive of the lamprey genome ( a representative jawless fish ) .
This is a massive bit of work , the trace archive is all the gene fragments generated before assembly of the genome , so they had to laboriously assemble and test each putative gene .
What did they find ?
That jawless fish lack factors IX and V .
Now , this is a pretty important chunk of the clotting system to be without .
When it was revealed that whales and bony fish lacked the intrinsic clotting system , Behe effectively replied “ So much the worse for them ” .
But in humans , lack of factor IX produces a bleeding disorder called haemophilia B , lack of factor V also produces haemophilia , and lack of both should result in a very severe bleeding disorder .
The reducible clotting system : Bony fish and jawless fish have a reduced complement of clotting factors compared to mammals .
Jawless fish lack factors IX and V . Tissue factor and factor VII directly activate thrombin , but the explosive coagulation cascade is initiated by factors IX and V acting together .
The older name for Factor V was proaccelerin , the activated from of factor V was known as accelerin , indicating its role in the explosive acceleration of clotting .
Factors IX and V are not peripheral pieces of the clotting system , but are the key section that produces the massive amount of thrombin needed for clotting in vertebrates .
According to Behe , the severe bleeding disorder from loss of factors IX and V shows that the clotting system could not be built up from simpler systems , as the system can only function with all its parts .
To put it in Behe ’s imagery , the clotting system of the Lamprey is a mousetrap without a spring .
Yet jawless fish are doing quite well without factor IX and V .
The implications of this for “ irreducible complexity ” are profound .
An ID advocate might concede that “ yes , the clotting system is n’t really irreducibly complex , what about other systems ? ” .
But this example not only falsifies the claim that the clotting system is “ irreducibly complex ” , but the logic of entire argument Behe uses .
Behe has claimed that it is not possible to directly evolve a system such as the clotting system directly , because a smaller system will not work .
Yet the jawless fish system shows just that , a system that lacks key component (s ) of the mammalian system is completely viable and functioning .
Behe ’s central argument is broken , knocking out parts of a system and showing that the system breaks does not mean it cannot evolve directly from a simpler system .
The work on lampreys provides strong evidence for Doolittle ’s model of generating complex systems by rounds of duplication and divergence .
Note that in all this it has been the evolutionary biologists doing the heavy lifting .
Generating predictions and models , testing clotting systems in various animals , cloning clotting factors , searching databases and finally , assembling genes from fragments .
What have the ID apologists been doing in the 12 years since “ Darwins Black Box ” was published ?
Not a lot .
Given the central role of the clotting system to their claims , one would have expected the ID folks would have been hard at work showing that the clotting system was irreducible .
Now , to be fair a lot of this is specialized work , that needs a serious biochemistry lab .
But when the Fugu genome came out in 2003 , nothing was stopping anyone from searching the Fugu genome for clotting factors .
The databases were public , and you could do it at home in your spare time .
No need to worry about discrimination from co-workers .
Did any ID person do that ?
No , it was the evolutionary biologists who came up with a testable hypothesis , and combed the Fugu database to test it .
Now the Amphioxus genome has come out .
The Amphioxus is a simple , pre-vertebrate chordate , simpler than the Lamprey .
We know that it clots its haemolymph ( the Amphioxus equivalent of blood ) , and that it has a thrombin like molecule in its haemolymph , so we know it has a clotting system .
Evolutionary biologists would predict that it has a reduced clotting system ( see figure ) .
ID advocates would predict that it would not .
So I have a modest proposal .
I would like to invite Dr. Behe , or any other ID advocate , to predict which coagulation factors are present in Amphioxus , search the Amphioxus genome database and report on whether the genes found match their predictions .
The database is free , you can do it at home , and the only cost is your time .
Time for ID advocates to do some science .
How about it ?

As if we needed a reminder that diets mostly fail , The New England Journal of Medicine has published a new report on an intense , tightly controlled experiment involving more than 300 moderately obese people .
After two years of effort the dieters lost , on average , 6 to 10 pounds .
The study , funded in part by the Atkins Research Foundation , seemed designed to prove that low - carb diets trump low - fat diets .
But in the end , all it really showed is that dieters can put forth tremendous effort and reap very little benefit .
Dr. Dean Ornish , a proponent of low - fat diets , is critical of the study design , particularly the fact that the so - called “ low - fat ” diet group was really only a moderate - fat diet that included about 30 percent of calories from fat .
He writes more about the issue in a Newsweek column here .
The New England Journal report also affirmed something many women have believed all along — that low - carb diets work better for men than women .
Male low - carb dieters lost about 11 pounds , compared to about 9 pounds on a Mediterranean diet .
Women low - carb dieters lost only about 5 pounds , compared to about 14 on the Mediterranean diet .

Making good on a promise to a friend to summarize his views on Christianity , Thomas Jefferson set to work with scissors , snipping out every miracle and inconsistency he could find in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John .
Then , relying on a cut - and - paste technique , he reassembled the excerpts into what he believed was a more coherent narrative and pasted them onto blank paper -- alongside translations in French , Greek and Latin .
In a letter sent from Monticello to John Adams in 1813 , Jefferson said his “ wee little book ” of 46 pages was based on a lifetime of inquiry and reflection and contained “ the most sublime and benevolent code of morals which has ever been offered to man . ”
He called the book “ The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth . ” Friends dubbed it the Jefferson Bible .
It remains perhaps the most comprehensive expression of what the nation ’s third president and principal author of the Declaration of Independence found ethically interesting about the Gospels and their depiction of Jesus .

“ I have performed the operation for my own use , ” he continued , “ by cutting verse by verse out of the printed book , and arranging the matter , which is evidently his and which is as easily distinguished as diamonds in a dunghill . ”
The little leather - bound tome , several facsimiles of which are kept at the Huntington Library in San Marino , continues to fascinate scholars exploring the powerful and varied relationships between the Founding Fathers and the most sacred book of the Western World .
The big question now , said Lori Anne Ferrell , a professor of early modern history and literature at Claremont Graduate University , is this :
“ Can you imagine the reaction if word got out that a president of the United States cut out Bible passages with scissors , glued them onto paper and said , ‘ I only believe these parts ? ’ ”
Advertisement
“ He was a product of his age , ” said Ferrell , whose upcoming book , “ The Bible and the People , ” includes a chapter on the Jefferson Bible .
“ Yet , he is the least likely person I ’d want to pray with .
He was more skeptical about religion than the other Founding Fathers . ”
In Jefferson ’s version of the Gospels , for example , Jesus is still wrapped in swaddling clothes after his birth in Bethlehem .
But there ’s no angel telling shepherds watching their flocks by night that a savior has been born .
Jefferson retains Jesus ’ crucifixion but ends the text with his burial , not with the resurrection .
Stripping miracles from the story of Jesus was among the ambitious projects of a man with a famously restless mind .
At 71 , he read Plato ’s “ Republic ” in the original Greek and found it lackluster .
Ever the scientist , he inoculated his wife , children and many of his slaves against smallpox with fresh pus drawn from infected domestic farm animals , according to Robert C. Ritchie , W.M. Keck Foundation director of research at the Huntington Library .

“ For a lot of people , taking scissors to the Bible would be such an act of desecration they would n’t do it , ” Ritchie said .
“ Yet , it gives a reading into Jefferson ’s take on the Bible , which was not as divine word put into print , but as a book that can be cut up . ”
Jefferson , a tall vigorous man who preferred Thucydides and Cicero to the newspapers of his day , was not the only 18th century leader who questioned traditional Christian teachings .
Like many other upper-class , educated citizens of the new republic , including George Washington , Jefferson was a deist .
Deists differed from traditional Christians by rejecting miraculous occurrences and prophecies and embracing the notion of a well - ordered universe created by a God who withdrew into detached transcendence .
Advertisement
Critics of the time regarded deism as an ill - conceived attempt to reconcile religion with scientific discoveries .
For rationalists in the Age of Enlightenment , deism was one of many efforts to liberate humankind from what the deists viewed as superstitious beliefs .
Jefferson was a particular fan of Joseph Priestley , a scientist , ordained minister and one of Jefferson ’s friends .
Priestley -- who discovered oxygen and invented carbonated water and the rubber eraser -- published books that infamously cast a critical eye upon biblical miracles .
Jefferson was particularly fond of Preistley ’s comparison of the lives and teachings of Socrates and Jesus .
Discussions and letters between Jefferson and another friend , Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush , led Jefferson to compile his “ wee little book . ”
In a letter to Rush on April 21 , 1803 , Jefferson said his editing experiment aimed to see whether the ethical teachings of Jesus could be separated from elements he believed were attached to Christianity over the centuries .
“ To the corruption of Christianity I am indeed opposed , ” he wrote to Rush , “ but not to the genuine precepts of Jesus himself . ”
Advertisement
Therefore , Ritchie said , “ for Jefferson , the Bible was a book that could be made and unmade . ”
The Jefferson Bible remained largely unknown beyond a close circle of relatives and friends until 1904 , when its publication was ordered by Congress .
About 9,000 copies were issued and distributed in the Senate and the House .
Today several editions of the Jefferson Bible are available through booksellers .
A few online versions exist , including one on the website of the Jefferson Monticello , www.monticello.org/library/links/jefferson.html.
It is hard to say whether Jefferson would have objected to publication of the book .

“ Say nothing of my religion , ” Jefferson once said .
“ It is known to myself and my God alone .
Its evidence before the world is to be sought in my life ; if that has been honest and dutiful to society , the religion which has regulated it can not be a bad one . ”

CHARLESTON , West Virginia ( CNN ) --
West Virginians will head to the polls Tuesday for the state 's Democratic primary between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
But what will the vote there really mean after new delegate totals show Obama with a sizable lead ?
Some say it could send a sobering message to Obama 's Democratic supporters .
West Virginia is expected to go for Clinton big time -- and the polls show it .
Clinton has a 43 - point advantage over Obama , 66 percent to 23 percent , according to a survey from the American Research Group released Friday .
The poll was conducted after Tuesday 's primary results and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points .
" This state is really Hillary Clinton 's wheelhouse .
It 's an older population , socially conservative , blue - collar workers , " said Kennie Bass , a political reporter for WCHS in West Virginia .
Watch more on the West Virginia primary »
Obama acknowledges that West Virginians favor Clinton .
" She is going to do very well in West Virginia and Kentucky .
She will win those states , in all likelihood , by significant margins , " Obama said this week .
According to CNN 's latest estimate , Obama has 1,860 total delegates to Clinton 's 1,696 .
A big Clinton win will send a powerful message that there are a lot of Democrats not ready to get on the Obama bandwagon .
Watch more on the Democratic primary race . »
" There was just an AP article posted that found how Sen .
Obama 's support among hardworking Americans , white Americans is weakening again , and how the whites in both states that have not completed college were supporting me , " Clinton said in a USA Today interview May 7 .
For the last two - thirds of the 20th century , West Virginia was a solidly Democratic state , and it still is in state politics .
West Virginia had not voted for a non-incumbent Republican for president since Herbert Hoover .
It even voted for Michael Dukakis in 1988 .
Then came 2000 , when George W. Bush surprised everyone by winning West Virginia .
How did he do it ?
With social issues , such as abortion , gays and -- most important -- guns , in a state where more than 70 percent of the voters have a gun in their households .
What you get in West Virginia is not so much Reagan Democrats as Bush Democrats .
Republicans believe that they know how to beat Obama here .
" They would likely paint him , if he 's the nominee , as a far - left liberal who is pro-abortion , pro-gay marriage , pro-civil union .
That will not play well in West Virginia .
Social issues register very high on the meter here , " Bass said .
Democrats can fight back by running hard on the Bush economy .
But they could be in for a surprise .
" As coal goes , so goes the economy of West Virginia in many respects .
Coal prices right now are about $ 100 a ton ; metallurgical coal is trading at nearly twice that .
So these are not difficult times in West Virginia economically , so to speak , " Bass said .
If Obama gets the nomination and it looks like the only way he can win is to get those West Virginia Democrats back , you can be sure he will think seriously about asking Clinton to go on the ticket .
CNN 's Ed Hornick and Alexander Mooney contributed to this report .
All About West Virginia • Barack Obama • Hillary Clinton

A few years ago , a person was almost beaten to death in San Diego in a parking lot .
The perpetrators hollered racist remarks while they were pounding the merde out of him : " Go back to Iraq you bastard !
We�ll come back and kill you if we don�t finish the job now . "
They almost killed the man .
However , he was of Portuguese descent , not Arabic .
The anti-Arab mood is so intense that U.S. bigots don�t care what nationality one is , only that he / she looks like an Arab .
That �s good enough .
The irony is that most Americans have never met an Arab .
They mindlessly make hateful statements without knowing the first thing about their " enemies . "
And this attitude comes from a population made of immigrants .
For the past 18 years , I have made a point of talking to people of Arab backgrounds .
As you see from my writing , I bring up aspects that many journalists evade .
By knowing what Arabs think about various subjects , one can learn much .
It is shameful that no one in the U.S. administrations of Bush I , Clinton and Bush II have shown even the most remote knowledge of Arab culture and thought .
From January 17 to February 28 , 1991 , I spent two hours nightly in an Iraqi - American - owned store in El Cajon , California .
This was the time of Desert Storm .
I took notes and I listened .
What I learned was far from what the media were telling us about Iraq and Iraqis .
To gain meaningful information , one must gain the trust of the Arab people with whom he / she fraternizes .
In the case of the aforementioned store , the owner would give a signal to a person to whom I was speaking and the person then would open up .
Shortly after Desert Storm , the owner of the market sold his store , yet he gave me the names of a few people who would assist me with my quest for knowledge of Arabs and the Arab world .
By 1995 , I numerous Arab friends : Iraqis , Lebanese , Palestinians and Syrians .
Toward the end of the year , I noticed a sign at the corner gas station saying , " Under New Management . "
I went in and heard the new proprietor speaking English with an Arabic accent .
" Where are you from ? " I asked .
" Jordan , " was the reply .
I now had another outlet for meeting people from the Middle East .
Shortly after meeting him , his mechanic approached me and said , " I�m Sabah .
I hear you �re a writer . "
He then said he was working on his PhD and needed an editor for the project .
I offered to help him .
Soon after , Sabah was hired by the largest Ford dealer in the area as a mechanic .
He came by my house to drop off some of his work and I noticed his name tag said , " Sam . "
When I asked him if this was his nickname , he said he was told by the company that he must call himself Sam .
I was irate and told him it was illegal for the company to do that .
The next time I saw him , his name tag said " Sabah . "
He did pay a price for sticking up to using his own name , however .
The company watched him relentlessly and harassed him many times .
His work was impeccable , so the firm could not fire him .
In time , he acquired his PhD and became a professor of business management at Brescia University in Kentucky .
Then 9/11 occurred .
His own personal secretary began to ignore him .
One day , he burst into her office and told her , " I didn�t have anything to do with it , you know . "
When he entered a small store with his daughter ( who had blonde hair ) and asked to use the rest room , on coming out he found that the owner had called the police and reported that " an Arab " had kidnapped the girl .
Since then , he has had many stories to tell .
Another meeting place is a market / restaurant owned by my friend Mahmoud , a Palestinian .
He is very politically aware and I have gained much knowledge from him , as well as he has from me .
For years , he had a small market , but six years ago , he opened his current venture , a much larger enterprise with a restaurant attached .
In that time , the F.B.I. has visited him several times .
They have taken his books away twice to peruse .
One time , an agent asked him , " Have you ever thought of blowing up a building ? "
How many non-Arab U.S. citizens are badgered like this almost every day ?
Mahmoud tells me that customers , on a regular basis , harass him about being an Arab .
They come into his store and tell how great it is that " we�re kicking the Arabs� asses in Iraq . "
He asks why they do this when they know of his background .
I tell him that it�s xenophobia and ethnocentrism run awry .
One day , a new cashier , who was very nervous because it was her first day on the job , was being chastised by a customer whose car heralded a pro-Israel bumper sticker .
He said to the cashier , " You �re a refugee , right ?
You people are all refugees . "
The girl , about age 19 or 20 , responded , " I don�t know what you �re talking about .
I was born in La Mesa . "
The customer then nastily repeated his refugee statement and laughed .
Normally , I am quiet , but some times one must step up to the plate and be heard .
I said , " You are an asshole and should be ashamed of yourself .
An adult trying to humiliate a young person like that . "
Because I was considerably larger than he and in much better shape , he did not respond and quickly left the store .
The girl thanked me .
Had I not intervened , he would have probably continued his line of talk for a few more minutes .
It made him feel superior by demeaning a young girl .
I will end with an anecdote about Mahmoud .
Even though we are in troubled times , we can make some humor of events .
Mahmoud�s entire family was given a few hours to leave their house in 1948 after the state of Israel came into being .
They lost all their land that had been in the family for generations .
Today , his family lives in Jordan after spending years in Kuwait .
They are stateless .
Because of this background , Mahmoud is not exactly a fan of the state of Israel .
A few years ago , a professional wrestler , Bryan Walsh , lived with me for a few months .
He had never met Mahmoud .
One day , I said , " Let�s go down to the market at the corner . "
I then concocted a scheme to confuse Mahmoud .
I entered the store and said " Hi " to Mahmoud and then went into a corner and pretended that I was looking at the large selection of Arabic breads offered .
A minute later , Walsh entered the store .
Mahmoud said , " Hi. May I help you ? "
Walsh asked , " Do you serve Jews ? "
Mahmoud immediately replied , " Of course . "
" I�ll take two , " said Walsh .
I was in the corner and had my mouth covered so I would n't laugh .
Mahmoud was stunned .
He looked toward me and then saw Walsh laughing .
After he put two and two together , he smiled and flipped me off .
非常に切れ者で、さほど切れない連中でさえ鋭さを見せようとする気にさせてしまうNick Carr氏であるが、何がそうさせるのか。最近Atlanticに掲載されたCarr氏の記事に対する批判は、予想通り大変に狭量でやかましいものだ。
話はこうだ。おしゃべり階級はしきたりに異を唱えられれば、いつだって腹を立てるものだ。2003年にCarr氏がHarvard Business Reviewで思慮に満ちた記事「 Why IT Does n’t Matter 」 を公表したとき、多くのテクノロジリーダー、業界紙のオピニオンメーカーの反応は厳しいものだった。
彼らは記事の思わせぶりなテーマを茶化すばかりで、競争力をもたらす資産としてITの重要性が低下したことに関する、より大きな彼の視点を完全に見失っていた。もちろん最終的にはCarr氏が正しかったことが判明した。
今また歴史は繰り返す。思うに、Carr氏の見出しにも問題がある。「
Is Google Making Us Stupid?（Googleはわれわれをばかにするのか？）」という見出しはキャッチフレーズもいいところだ。New York Post の1982 年 の「 Headless Body in Topless Bar（トップレスバーに首なし死体）」に並ぶ名見出しだ。
しかし、これは読者を引きつける誘い文句に過ぎない。Carr氏の真の関心は、新たな脅威としてのGoogleではなく、ウェブに依存することで複数のことを同時に行うマルチタスクという習慣が生まれ、皆が集中力を失っていくのではないかということにあるのだ。
これはいい着眼点かもしれない。もっとも、このことについては例示の小話を出すくらいしか語るすべがない。と言ったところでちょうど、Carr氏と同じことを述べているすごい記事に出くわした。
Google , the Internet search engine company , released plans on Monday for a new generation of wireless devices to operate on soon - to - be- vacant television airwaves and sought to ease fears that this might interfere with TV broadcasts or wireless microphones .
In comments filed with the Federal Communications Commission , Google outlined plans for low - power devices that use local wireless airwaves to access the “ white space ” between television channels .
A Google executive called the plan “ Wi - Fi 2.0 or Wi-Fi on steroids . ”
“ The airwaves can provide huge economic and social gains if used more efficiently , ” Google said in the comments .
Rick Whitt , Google ’s Washington telecom and media counsel , said this class of Wi-Fi devices could eventually offer data transmission speeds of billions of bits a second  far faster than the millions of bits a second available on most current broadband networks .
Consumers could watch movies on wireless devices and do other things that are currently difficult on slower networks .
Reggie Love is Barack Obama 's Cool Body Man ( Photos )
According to , his body manis way cool .
The job description that has propelled the personal aide over the past year is sketchy at best .
He was basically told to go out there and take care of stuff .
That is precisely what he does on a daily basis , as the Democratic presidential candidates right hand man .
Reggie Love is 26 years old and played football and basketball at Duke University , graduating with degrees in political science and public policy .
He stands 6 - foot - 5 , is about three inches taller than Obama and fitter too .
He can bench press more than 350 pounds .
He tried out for the Green Bay Packers and the Dallas Cowboys before applying for a capitol hill internship with Senator Barack Obama .
Love anticipates Obama 's every need and is ready when the candidate calls for a Tide pen to remove a stain , a protein bar , Advil , Purell , Nicorette gum , water , tea , throat lozenges , a Sharpie or stationary .
He is the keeper of Obama 's iPhone , BlackBerry and Canon digital camera and has taken 10,000 photos on the campaign trail .
Reggie enjoys joking with the Secret Service and is quick to high - five members of the media .
According to the candidate , they do n't watch CNN , MSNBC or any of the other talking heads or any politics .
After an exhausting day in the trenches they watch SportsCenter .
A superstition has the candidate and his body man engaging in a pickup game of basketball on the day of each primary contest .
Perhaps it is a stress reliever on those days when the stakes are high and the nerves need calming .
Five months remain until the presidential election .
If Obama end up in the Oval Office , count on Reggie Love to be along for the ride .
The future looks bright for the 26 year old , very bright indeed .

“ The economy has continued to expand , but at a subdued pace , ” Mr. Bernanke said at another point .
In one rare note of optimism , he revised upward the Fed ’s growth estimate for the year and added that consumer spending had somewhat exceeded expectations .
The Fed chief spent the early morning testifying alone , as part of his twice - a- year appearances before Congress , and then joined Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Christopher Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Sitting with them , he endorsed Mr. Paulson ’s plan , unveiled on Sunday , to seek legislation to give the federal government temporary power to help Fannie and Freddie , and he also defended the Fed ’s opening its own lending facility to the two agencies .
Mr. Bernanke offered no timetable for improved economic performance , declaring that while the risks to the overall economy were still “ skewed to the downside , ” inflation “ seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term . ”
The Fed , he said , needed to guard against higher prices ’ spreading through the economy .
That mixed warning about rising costs and a downturn reinforced the message of last month ’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee , the central bank ’s policy - making body , that it would not cut interest rates further and , indeed , that higher rates might be necessary to combat inflation .
Despite snaking around branches of IndyMac Bank and a report from the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that more banks were expected to run into trouble , Mr. Bernanke said he did not think there was a significant danger to the banking sector , most of which he said remained profitable .
“ Of course , all banks are being challenged by credit conditions now , ” the Fed chief said in response to a question from Senator Richard C. Shelby , an Alabama Republican on the banking panel .
“ The good news is that the banking system did come into this episode extremely well capitalized , extremely profitable . ”
Image President Bush tried to reassure Americans on Tuesday .

But concerns that consumer banking could succumb to the ills of the credit crisis clearly rattled official Washington , as Mr. Bush ’s citation of the federal government ’s insurance of bank deposits made clear .
“ Signs are emerging of a possible alliance this fall between Ron Paul , the libertarian - minded rebel Republican , and Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party 's presidential nominee , ” the Boston Globe reported on June 14 .
( 1 ) “ Already Paul and Barr seem to be edging towards a pseudo - alliance , ” echoed the Huffington Post on July 2 . ( 2 )
Those are just two examples of the ongoing main stream media buzz over a Paul – Barr alliance in the general election — speculation that began more than a month ago , but which shows no signs of dying out .
If anything , coverage of the story increased in June , spreading to TV news as well as the press .
This latest round of speculation was touched off by remarks from Ron Paul to CNN on June 12 ( the day Paul suspended his own presidential campaign ) , which contained some of his most pro-Barr comments to date .
Asked by CNN's John Roberts , “ what do you think of Bob Barr ?
Does he faithfully represent the values of the Libertarian Party ? ” , Paul responded by defending Barr against some Libertarians ' criticism of his voting record in Congress :
I think so .
It does n't mean that you can look at his voting record like you look at mine and say there was never any infraction .
That does n't mean that he can't represent these values .
He 's saying the things he should be saying .
He 's joined the Libertarian Party and he presents these views and he talks our language .
So I do really believe that he can have a very positive effect in this campaign and let the people know that limited government is a very , very important message and that people will have a chance [ to hear it ] .
That gives everybody a choice in the matter . ( 3 )
One day later , Barr tossed Paul his own verbal bouquet in a prepared statement :
“ Congressman Ron Paul has fought tirelessly in both the Libertarian Party and the Republican Party to minimize government power and maximize individual liberty , ” said Barr , a former six - term GOP congressman from Georgia .
“ I want to thank him for all that he has done for liberty in this nation , and encourage him to continue his fight through whatever avenues he sees fit . ” ( 1 )
That statement made the news even in Iran , where PressTV interpreted the last conjunct to mean that Barr was “ suggesting a possible alliance with the Republican . ” ( 4 )
The following week , FOX News jumped on the story with its own one - two combination , interviewing Bob Barr on “ Your World with Neil Cavuto ” on June 18 , and Ron Paul on the “ Glenn Beck Show ” on June 19 .
Cavuto sounded almost like an excited schoolboy as he constantly interrupted to pepper Barr with questions : “ What 's the deal here ? …
Have you talked to them , Bob ? …
Have you talked to Ron Paul ?…
And what has he said ?
Will he back you ? ”
Barr was non-committal : “ Ron Paul is a very good friend of mine , I of his .
He supports very much what we 're doing .
I support very much what he is doing .
But I can not speak in terms of what he might do formally for our campaign . ”
He did though remind Cavuto and his viewers that , informally , Paul has “ had some very kind things to say about Bob Barr and our campaign . ” ( 5 )
The next day , Paul confirmed on the Beck show that there had been no formal endorsement , and gave one reason why .
Asked “ Will you be backing the Libertarian candidate , Bob Barr ? ” , he replied : “ I have not made that decision ; as of now , no .
I have n't endorsed anybody for the presidency … .
There 's a friend [ Baldwin ] running on the Constitution Party ticket , as well as Bob Barr on the Libertarian . ” ( 6 )
Paul 's most detailed comments on the story came during a June 13 interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN's “ Situation Room . ”
At that time , he declared flat - out : “ I just will not be endorsing John McCain , nor do I intend to endorse Obama . ”
Blitzer followed that up by asking , “ What do you think about Congressman Barr ? ” to which Paul answered :
I think he 's running a very important race , and I 'm encouraging him .
I have n't endorsed him , but he 's saying the kind of things I 'd like to be heard and said , and I hope he does real well .
But we also have Chuck Baldwin who runs on the Constitution Party [ ticket ] ; his views are very close to mine , and he worked very hard on my campaign , so for me to pick one or the other is not easy .
I hope they both get a lot of votes .
However , Paul left the door open to endorsing either Barr or Baldwin later : “ I do n't have immediate plans ; maybe later in the year I might decide to . ” ( 7 )
Paul hinted at the same possibility on his Beck show appearance : “ As of now , no , I have n't endorsed anybody for the Presidency .
We 're mainly working on a grand celebration of liberty , a rally , in Minneapolis on Sept.
2 . But maybe after that I might think about it . ” ( 6 )
So there we have it :
No endorsement before the Campaign for Liberty rally on Sept. 2 , but perhaps one afterward .
In the meantime , I expect Paul to have more and similar “ kind words ” for both Barr and Baldwin throughout the summer .
I also fully expect to see both those candidates being given prime speaking slots at the Minneapolis rally .
Whether a Paul endorsement occurs later depends on a number of factors : not the least of which is how his supporters fare at the Republican national convention , also on Sept .
2 . If McCain chooses one of Paul's “ friends ” as his running mate ( possibly South Carolina governor Mark Sanford ) , he may still be able to forestall a Paul endorsement of one of his rivals .
But there seems little danger of that happening .
The McCain camp has not only made no effort to accommodate the Ron Paul Republicans to date , but has gone out of its way to belittle them and shut them out .
Any doubts on that score should be laid to rest by the McCain campaign 's appointment of Michael Goldfarb as Deputy Communications Director in June .
Goldfarb was previously editor of the virulently Paul - bashing Weekly Standard blog , where he wrote on the subject in March :
The Washington Times reports : “ Ron Paul says the legions of newcomers his presidential campaign brought to the Republican Party are getting the cold shoulder from John McCain and from the party … . ”
[ L ]et me just say to Ron Paul supporters everywhere , and on behalf of the New Right ( by which I assume Paul means the Jew Right ) , get lost .
There should be plenty of room for the Paulnuts in Obama 's big tent . ( 8 )
One hopes that Mr. Goldfarb has learned something in the past three months , and now realizes that those are not the only options , for either “ Paulnuts ” or American voters in general .

The search is on to stop the chemicals that make a brew taste bad .
Beer might soon withstand the ravages of time more easily .
Punchstock
For connoisseurs of fine beers , there is little more highly prized than a crisp , brewery - fresh flavour .
And there is nothing worse than a beer that has gone stale or sickeningly sweet from being stored too long on the shelf .
For centuries the chemicals behind these flavours have been a mystery , but new research is now revealing the elusive compounds .
As beers lose their freshness they first take on bready flavours , which later shift to flavours known as cardboard , sweet , caramel , wine and sherry .
While some of those might sound delicious , when generated unintentionally they can taste revolting .
Throughout history , efforts to keep beer fresh have centred on the concept of keeping it out of contact with air throughout the brewing process .
Although that strategy keeps some unpleasant flavours at bay , beer still eventually goes bad over time .
This led Adriana Bravo and her colleagues at Polar Breweries and Simón Bolívar University in Caracas , Venezuela , to hunt for other causes of flavour deterioration1 .
Getting a reaction
The team first found that a chemical reaction called the Maillard reaction , in which sugars are broken down by reactions with amino acids , was taking place in beer sitting on the shelf .
“ The Maillard reaction is one that is usually seen in baking and roasting where temperatures are high — that it was taking place during beer storage where temperatures were 15 - 20 °C was really surprising , ” comments Bravo .
Bravo and her colleagues suspected that intermediates of the Maillard reaction , called alpha - dicarbonyls , are involved in the change in flavour , because they had observed a chemical marker of the reaction increasing in beer as it aged and deteriorated .
They could not be certain , however , without putting a stop to the Maillard reaction , so for experimental purposes they added the drug aminoguanidine to the beer .
Aminoguanidine has been under clinical trials in diabetics to control the reaction of sugar with proteins and enzymes inside the body .
The team added it to beer to shut down the Maillard reaction without making the beer toxic .
When they tasted the doctored beer , they found that even though it was old enough to have developed unpleasant flavours , none was present .
The researchers still did not know which particular steps of the Maillard reaction were responsible for the off - flavours , and so they embarked on an in - depth analysis of the ageing process .
Adding a chemical called 1,2 - diaminobenzene ( 1,2 - DAB ) allowed them to isolate and identify trace levels of particular alpha - dicarbonyls as they formed in the beer .
Over 105 days they detected the appearance of 11 different alpha - dicarbonyls , some of which increased in concentration continuously as the beer aged .
This left the team wondering if these highly reactive alpha - dicarbonyls were the ones involved in forming the off - flavours , and what compounds were formed when they reacted with the rest of the beer .
Complex nose
To do this , Bravo and her team used a technique called gas chromatography - olfactometry ( GC - O ) , which combines the high resolution of gas chromatography with the sensitivity of the human nose .
Beer was aged with and without the addition of 1,2 - DAB , and the flavours sniffed by GC - O , which can identify specific chemicals in specific odours .
Comparison of the flavour profiles of both beers showed that 1,2 - DAB had blocked the formation of two compounds – furaneol , which smells like caramel , and phenylacetaldehyde , which smells like roses .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ How these compounds , and the many that are not yet identified , are combining to generate the ageing flavours still eludes us , ” says Bravo , “ but we are hoping to prolong the fresh beer flavour for longer by manipulating the Maillard reaction . ”
Probing the Maillard reaction at room temperature and quantifying the intermediates involved could ultimately help prevent flavour deterioration , explains organic chemist Paul Hughes at Heriot - Watt University in Edinburgh , who was not involved in the study .
“ But whether these specific pathways are the ones that cause the most noticeable flavour changes remains to be seen ... there are thousands of compounds in beer and we still have a lot to learn ” he adds .
A journey to find those pieces of software or technology that facilitate productive and maintainable software development
As a junior network administrator at a small local ISP , Kiefer R.'s job is pretty mundane .
Aside from the occasional bandwidth problem investigating , cable laying , and spline reticulating , there 's not too much excitement .
One morning , Kiefer 's boss said he was going to come down for a chat , so Kiefer loaded up a bandwidth monitoring utility and pretended to be busy .
" Kiefer , " Mike began , " I just wanted to give you a heads up .
We 're having a guy come down next week to run some security checks on our systems here .
Particularly our main web server . "
" So , you need me to show him the ropes , or ... "
" Oh , ha ! " Mike started laughing .
" No , not at all .
This guy is like some kind of Super Hacker ! " he exclaimed while waving his hands dramatically .
" More like he 'll be showing you the ropes !
Ha ! "
Kiefer rolled his eyes .
The Super Hacker arrived the following week .
He was there only for two days while he worked on his mission — shutting down the main web server from outside the network .
He'd be in the office from 9 - 5 , where he could talk to the staff and review some of the code to find sections he might be able to exploit , but he'd only get paid if the server was shut down while he was not in the office .
He did n't receive any usernames or passwords as the testing was meant to simulate an attack on the web site from an average hacker .
Should he accomplish his goal , he 'd earn $ 3,500.00 .
Working in the Super Hacker 's favor was that the aging site was last updated in the late 90s , and almost certainly had pages that would be exploitable .
When Kiefer came in the following morning , his boss was stopped him on his way in .
" Well , our Super Hacker has done it !
Turns out it must 've been a pretty easy exploit , " Mike said , " it hardly took him any time at all .
Plus he 's already patched it ! "
Kiefer could n't deny that he was impressed .
" So how'd he do it ? "
" I 'm not sure — I have n't gotten his report yet .
I should have it by the end of the day . "
Kiefer 's curiosity was palpable .
He asked around for details on the exploit , but no one was talking .
Clearly , some people knew what had happened and just were n't willing to tell .
Finally , someone told Kiefer that the fix was in the form of a Python script , and that if he read the script , he 'd see the exploit .
How the aptly - named Super Hacker had managed to shut down the system remotely and provide a fix so quickly intrigued Kiefer .
After poking around the network , he finally found the Python file that contained the Super Hacker 's fix :
# !usr/bin/ python #
Paying someone $ 10 to pull a power cord for $ 3500 print " ( C ) < Name Removed > 2008 . "
Of course , the fix alone would n't prevent future attacks using that vector , but management 's scolding of the night staff would .
ESPY Awards 2008 Red Carpet Photos
The ESPY Awards were held last night at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles .
The sports award event was created and broadcast by cable network ESPN , who honors , on a yearly basis , excellence in sports performance .
Styled like the Grammy , Emmy and Academy Awards events , the ESPY 's are hosted by a contemporary celebrity .
This year Justin Timberlake took center stage to host the program .
Winners were chosen by online fan balloting from a list selected by the ESPY Nominating Committee .
Tiger Woods won Best Male Athlete ( 5th time ) , Best Golfer ( 4th time ) , and Best Championship Performance for his recent U.S. Open win .
Retired NFL Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre won Best Record Breaking Performance award .
In accepting his award he quipped to Timberlake with a grin , " watchin that makes me want to play again " .
Favre sat for a two part interview on FOX with Greta Van Susteren , stating that he felt pushed into his decision to retire in March of 2008 .
He wants to come back in his old role as Packer starting QB but the team has moved on according to the head office .
They have offered him the backup position - and he 's not amused .
He reportedly is tempted to disrupt their upcoming training camp by reporting for duty .
Timberlake got a huge audience laugh when he went into the audience and hugged new Green Bay starting QB Aaron Rodgers , 2005 first round draft choice .
Favre , sitting nearby , hung his head with a slight smile on his face .
The event will be televised by ESPN on July 20th at 9:00 p.m. eastern time .

LA Governor , Bobby Jindal calls Intelligent Design " Science " Posted by Pile ( 10660 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ Pseudo - Science ]
Add newly - elected Louisiana governor , Republican Bobby Jindal , to the short list of people who think " intelligent design " belongs in science class , despite virtually every scientist of any renown on the planet claiming creationism is not science .
What 's next ?
Alchemy along side Chemistry ?
See the video ...
REID : Let me make a sharp turn here to a different issue , an issue that has raised some controversy .
Now , you were a biology major in college .
I think you had a double major .
But you were a biology major , and you support the teaching of intelligent design in schools .
Do you have doubts about the theory of evolution ?
Gov. JINDAL : A couple of things .
One , I do n’t think this is something the federal or state government should be imposing its views on local school districts .
You know , as a conservative I think government that ’s closest to the people governs best .
I think local school boards should be in a position of deciding the curricula and also deciding what students should be learning .
Secondly , I do n’t think students learn by us withholding information from them .
Some want only to teach intelligent design , some only want to teach evolution .
I think both views are wrong , as a parent .
REID : But how about you personally ?
Where do you stand personally on the issue ?
Gov. JINDAL : As a parent , when my kids go to schools , when they go to public schools , I want them to be presented with the best thinking .
I want them to be able to make decisions for themselves .
I want them to see the best data .
I personally think that the life , human life and the world we live in was n’t created accidentally .
I do think that there ’s a creator .
I ’m a Christian .
I do think that God played a role in creating not only earth , but mankind .
Now , the way that he did it , I ’d certainly want my kids to be exposed to the very best science .
I do n’t want them to be–I do n’t want any facts or theories or explanations to be withheld from them because of political correctness .
The way we ’re going to have smart , intelligent kids is exposing them to the very best science and let them not only decide , but also let them contribute to that body of knowledge .

Reading this makes me sick to my stomach - as a species if we can't even get past something as straight forward as this how are we ever going to tackle large problems .
I have lost faith in my nation , not just the government but the people .

If hes really a catholic , he shouldnt belive in ID .
So hes just making stuff up to appeal to red necks .
When the tides changes he will be a democrat or something , just look a Rommey .
The politicians are the reflet of their voters , they will believe what ever brings up the votes .
Posted by Gliscameria on 2008-06-17 20:16:46 ID ?
Seriously ?
Why not replace all of education with ' because God said so ' ?
The whole point of science it to teach people to follow a logical pattern of thought .
Just because you do n't know every detail and mechanism does n't make a theory invalid .
If we gave up on every theory when it seemed the proof was beyond us and decided to just say " God made it that way " we 'd still be in the stone age .
Families / communities teach religion and the state sticks to logic and science .
Where would our court system be without science and logic ?
Posted by Caterina on 2008-06- 18 10:27:50 Bah , what on Earth are you saying ?
Intelligent Design is part of every Christian doctrine .
ID is right out of the first chapter of the Bible .
Catholics believe in the Old Testament just like any Christian .
BTW , both evolution and ID are theories .
If not presented side by side for each child 's own personal determination as to what is the truth , you 're discriminating against one or the other side .
The only answer is to either teach both side by side , or allow the children who believe in ID opt out .
Tax dollars and public schools should n't be used as a platform to teach Aethism anymore than Christianity .
Posted by Rudy on 2008-06- 20 10:57:58 Caterina , ID is not a theory .
It is a creation myth .
And a scientific theory , as is the theory of evolution through random mutation and natural selection , is not , as you seem to believe , synonymous to " hypothesis " .
Quite the contrary : one or more hypotheses become a theory once overwhelming evidence supports them , as is the case of the theory of evolution .
Evolution is a fact .
The theory explains how it happens .
Quit making false claims
Posted by Regal on 2008-07-15 19:09:19
What is wrong with you evolutionists ?
Why do you attempt to force intelligent design out of existent by ridiculing it ?
Do you realize how foolish previous Catholics look now by attempting to shut up Galileo for supporting Copernicus 's heliocentric view of the solar system ?
Do you realize that there are plenty of scientists that believe in intelligent design ?
Why do you CLAIM evolution is a fact when in reality it is nothing more than a theory ( hence THEORY of evolution ) ?
In SCIENCE a fact is " something that can be verified according to an established standard of evaluation . "
We have MILLIONS of fossils on record .
Why do n't we have one fossil that displays evolutionary behavior ?
Intelligent design uses science and logic as much as evolution .
LOGICALLY , carbon dating has a huge problem when different parts of one dead animal can be dated to different time periods or a recently dead animal can be carbon dated to thousands of years old .
If you really believe evolution has all the answer ( biological , astronomical , otherwise ) why is our universe expanding at a faster rate which conflicts with the current model of the big bang ?
By the way , Einstein believed in God .
Hawkins too .
Sorry but I am so sick of people who happen to believe in evolution having this smug attitude and ridiculing intelligent design as if evolution has been proven .
With all of our technology all attempts to recreate the building blocks of life in a lab have failed .

Nine US soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan , in one of the biggest losses of life in a single incident since operations there began in 2001 .
The troops died when insurgents attacked a military outpost in the north - eastern province of Kunar , close to the border with Pakistan .
The fighting came as international and Afghan forces battled militants on several fronts .
One soldier from the US - led coalition was killed by a bomb in Helmand .
On Sunday , US forces said 40 insurgents had been killed in Helmand province in 24 hours .
Insurgents ' hiding '
A statement from Nato 's International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) said the nine were killed in several hours of fighting in a mountainous area in Kunar province .
It said 15 more Isaf soldiers were wounded along with four Afghan troops .
Isaf currently has 53,000 troops from 40 countries .
Insurgents used rockets , mortars and machine guns to attack the remote Afghan army and Nato outpost .
Isaf and Afghan National Army forces responded with small arms , machine guns , mortars and artillery , the statement said .
Fighter jets and Apache helicopters were also deployed .
Reports quoting Afghan officials say there may also have been civilian casualties .
Nato says the rebels suffered heavy casualties .
It did not name the attackers but there has been a sharp increase in Taleban attacks in the country , and in that region in particular .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says Afghanistan 's north - eastern border with Pakistan is a well - known trouble spot .
The fighting is close to where US forces were accused of killing 47 civilians in an air strike in Nangarhar province a week ago .
The US military said they were militants .
In a separate incident on Sunday , a suicide bomber killed at least 21 people , many of them children , in a market in the Deh Rawud district of Uruzgan province .
No group has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing .
Indonesia lacks the intelligence capabilities to prevent the dumping of hazardous waste in the country , an environmental researcher says .
From 2004 to 2008 , Indonesia 's intelligence agencies managed to uncover just five cases involving the illegal importation of hazardous waste .
These cases included hazardous waste and batteries from Singapore and used condoms from Germany .
" We have to admit that the abilities of our intelligence services are too weak to watch over Indonesia 's large territorial waters , " a senior researcher at the Indonesian Center for Environmental Law , Mas Achmad Santosa , said here Monday after a discussion on the handling of illegal transboundary hazardous waste .
The dialogue was a side event at the ninth Conference of Parties to the Basel Convention , being held in Bali from Monday to Friday .
The Basel Convention is an environmen ...

Nicolas Sarkozy 's plans to increase government control over state TV yesterday sparked an outcry from his political opponents who accused him of tightening a Berlusconi - style grip on the airwaves and dragging France back into its dark age of postwar censorship and propaganda .
The French president 's proposed " cultural revolution " for France 's five state TV channels prompted an uproar when he announced that in future , he and his cabinet would appoint the head of French state TV , instead of an independent body .
Sarkozy , known as the Téléprésident , prides himself on his numerous TV appearances , carefully studies his own ratings and has privately confided that he would have liked to have been a TV executive .
So it was no surprise that he took direct control of the project to overhaul French state TV .
He argued that a government appointment of the head of France Televisions was more " democratic " .
This has reopened the festering row over the president 's influence over the media and closeness to his press and TV baron friends who are willing to lean on , censor or even sack journalists who displease him .
Last month , a fresh row erupted after Sarkozy was accused of influencing the appointment of a newsreader , Laurence Ferrari , to the leading private channel TF1 , run by one of the his closest friends .
Her ousted predecessor was rumoured to have upset the president , who is conscious of his height , by asking if he ever felt " like a little boy in a big boy 's playground " .
The left - leaning daily Liberation yesterday ran a front page headline : " France Sarkovision " .
Staff at state TV and radio unfurled banners saying " Television hold - up " in protest against any future government appointment of their boss .
" This is the methodical organisation of a propagandist strategy to control the media .
It 's low - grade Berlusconi , " said the socialist MP Arnaud Montebourg .
" Unlike Silvio Berlusconi in Italy , Nicolas Sarkozy does n't have the means to buy the television stations he dreams of .
Instead , he has decided to take control of them , with a striking mix of brutality and cynicism , " said an editorial in Le Monde .
The plans sparked warnings of a return to France 's postwar era and the presidency of Charles de Gaulle when government controlled , vetted and censored public media - notably in its heavily repressed coverage of the May 1968 riots which led to journalist demonstrations .
Within Sarkozy 's government , the Europe minister , Jean - Pierre Jouyet warned that the plans had a " whiff " of the de Gaulle era .
The media academic Dominique Wolton said it had taken several decades for French TV to emerge from the grip of the state and " depoliticise itself " but it was now going " backwards " .
The culture minister , Christine Albanel , dismissed the criticisms as " absurd " saying there were enough parliamentary " safety checks in place " so it could not be called " a government takeover " .
Sarkozy announced he would scrap advertising from state TV by 2011 , beginning with a ban on advertising after 8 pm from January .
He argued that scrapping advertising would free state TV to be more creative and public service - minded .
The socialist party accused him of handing gifts to his friends in private TV who would benefit from increased advertising .
Having had a few more hours to think about Industry Minister Jim Prentice 's Canadian DMCA , I am left with one dominant feeling – betrayal .
I have already highlighted the key provisions and coverage ( and note that it will take some time to fully assess the implications of this bill ) but it is immediately apparent that the concerns of thousands of Canadians – now over 45,000 on the Fair Copyright for Canada Facebook group alone – have been realized .
If enacted , the Canadian DMCA would strongly encourage the use of technological locks and lawsuits .
While Prentice has given a handful of new rights to Canadian consumers , each is subject to many limitations and undermined by the digital locks provisions that may effectively render the new rights meaningless .
So why is it a betrayal ?
Because in a country whose Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized the importance of balance between creators rights and user rights , the Canadian DMCA eviscerates user rights in the digital environment by virtually eliminating fair dealing .
Under this bill , the right to copy for the purposes of research , private study , criticism , and news reporting virtually disappears if the underlying content is digitally locked .
Because in a country that rightly promotes the importance of education , the Canadian DMCA erects new barriers for teachers , students , and schools at every level who now face the prospect of infringement claims if they want to teach using digital media .
Because in a country that prioritizes privacy , the Canadian DMCA will render it virtually impossible to protect against the invasion of privacy by digital media companies .
The bill includes an exemption for those that circumvent digital locks to protect their privacy , yet renders the tools needed to circumvent illegal .
In other words , the bill gives Canadians the right to protect their privacy but prohibits the tools needed to do so .
Because in a country that values consumer rights , the Canadian DMCA means that consumers no longer control their own personal property .
That CD or DVD or e-book or cellphone you just bought ?
The bill says you now have the right to engage in " private use copying " but not if it contains digital locks .
Because the Conservative Party of Canada promised to Stand Up for Canada , yet the Canadian DMCA is quite clearly U.S. - inspired legislation , the result of intense pressure from U.S. officials and lobby groups .
Because the government pledged to table treaties for House of Commons debate before introducing implementing legislation and failed to do so .
Claims that this legislation does not ratify the treaties violates the spirit of that commitment .
Because ratification of the World Intellectual Property Organization 's Internet Treaties can be accomplished in a far more balanced manner .
Because countries such as New Zealand and Israel have demonstrated that there is no need to blindly follow U.S. demands on the copyright file .
Because the interests of individual Canadians – including those calling for more flexible fair dealing – is completely ignored .
Because the Canadian DMCA was introduced without consulting consumer groups , education groups , civil society groups , or the Canadian public .
Because Jim Prentice knows better .
He saw first - hand the passion of Canadians calling for balanced copyright and has received thousands of calls and letters on the issue .
Yet rather than genuinely working to craft a balanced solution , he opted to release a fatally flawed bill .
Despite all that , I still also harbour some optimism .
The events of the past six months have demonstrated conclusively that Canadians care about balanced copyright even if the Industry Minister does not .
Over the coming months , I firmly believe that we will see the fair copyright movement expand well beyond what has been just built .
We will see Canadian musicians , songwriters , artists , and filmmakers speak out against this legislation .
We will see companies of all sizes and all sectors speak out against this legislation .
We will see the privacy groups , education groups , and consumer rights groups speak out against this legislation .
We will see the NDP speak out against this legislation .
We will see the Liberals – who are already focusing on the lack of consultation and the prospect of a police state – ultimately identify their Bill C - 60 as a better approach and speak out against this legislation .
We will see Conservative MPs from coast to coast ( including the Conservative candidate from the forthcoming Guelph by - election ) wonder why their party has introduced a bill that runs counter to their own policies and ( quietly ) speak out against this legislation .
We will see thousands of Canadians speak out against this legislation again and again and again until it is changed .
The Canadian DMCA is a kick in the gut to Canadians everywhere .
But I believe we will get back up and demand better .
Start now .
Write to your MP , the Industry Minister , the Canadian Heritage Minister , and the Prime Minister .

The US will not recognise the outcome of Friday 's presidential election run-off in Zimbabwe , a senior state department official has said .
Jendayi Frazer said Robert Mugabe could not claim a credible victory while opposition members were being killed .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has pulled out due to the violence but Mr Mugabe says it will go ahead .
A group of southern African leaders are holding an emergency meeting in Swaziland to discuss the crisis .
Presidents and senior officials from Swaziland , Angola and Tanzania - members of the Southern Africa Development Community ( Sadc ) peace and security committee - are expected to discuss the possibility of a transitional government for Zimbabwe .
The BBC's Mike Wooldridge says there had been speculation South African President Thabo Mbeki might attend , as he is Sadc 's chief mediator .
But he has already spoken to some of those attending the meeting and that input will be added to discussions , our correspondent adds .
We cannot , under these conditions , recognise the outcome if , in fact , this run -off goes forward
Jendayi Frazer
Assistant US Secretary of State
Zimbabwe and the axis of impunity Mugabe 's remarkable comeback New media evades censors Cricket body to mull Zimbabwe ban Meanwhile , UK - based mining giant Anglo American is reported to be investing $ 400 m ( £ 200 m ) in a Zimbabwe platinum mine , a UK newspaper says .
The project , in the central district of Unki , would be the largest foreign investment in the country , the London Times said .
News of the investment comes amid mounting calls for increased sanctions on Zimbabwe 's regime .
Condemnation Mr Tsvangirai , who has been taking refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare since late Sunday , has called for UN peacekeepers to enter Zimbabwe and protect MDC supporters until a new election can be held .
Writing in Britain 's Guardian newspaper , Mr Tsvangirai says the standard diplomatic approach has failed to resolve Zimbabwe 's crisis and calls for a more " activist strategy " .
The opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) says some 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by militias loyal to the ruling Zanu - PF party .
The government blames the MDC for the violence .
Ms Frazer , Assistant US Secretary of State for African Affairs , said Washington would not recognise the result of any vote held on Friday .
" People were being beaten and losing their lives just to exercise their right to vote for their leadership so we cannot , under these conditions , recognise the outcome if , in fact , this run -off goes forward , " she said .
Her comments came amid growing international condemnation of the political crisis in Zimbabwe .
' Open to talks ' The Southern African Catholic Bishops ' Conference issued a statement saying " the politically - motivated violence , intimidation and torture have made a just and fair run-off presidential election virtually impossible " .
" We are deeply concerned at this situation and warn that unless there is a unified effort from the International Community with the leadership of Southern African Countries , the hopeless situation of violence , famine and uncertainty will result in a vast humanitarian crisis that will engulf the whole Southern African region . "
ZIMBABWE AND ITS NEIGHBOURS
Zimbabwe 's opposition wants neighbouring countries to persuade Robert Mugabe to step down .
So how are relations changing ?
South Africa 's leader Thabo Mbeki remains the key mediator .
He has not criticised Mr Mugabe , despite pressure from the ruling ANC .
Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa called Zimbabwe a " regional embarrassment " , before suffering a stroke on 29 June .
Angola 's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos is one of Robert Mugabe 's closest allies .
He has urged Mr Mugabe to end the violence .
Botswana said Zimbabwe 's 27 June run -off vote was so flawed by violence that it could not be considered legitimate .
Namibia is an ally of Robert Mugabe .
It wants to re-distribute white - owned farms to black villagers .
It has not criticised the violence .
Mozambique has hosted some white farmers forced out of Zimbabwe when their land was seized .
It is seen as sympathetic to the opposition .
Tanzania 's ruling party has a history of backing Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party .
Its foreign minister has condemned the violence .
DR Congo's President Joseph Kabila is an ally of Robert Mugabe who sent troops to help his father , Laurent Kabila , fight rebels .
Malawi is seen as neutral .
But 3 m people from Malawi are in Zimbabwe and many were badly hit by the farm invasions .
BACK NEXT 1 of 9 Senegal 's President Abdoulaye Wade who discussed Zimbabwe with Mr Mbeki on Tuesday , said he hoped there could be a power - sharing deal in the form of a transitional government .
Mr Mbeki has so far been keeping with his policy of " quiet diplomacy " towards Zimbabwe .
Mr Mugabe has said he will be open to negotiations - once the poll has gone ahead .
" We are open , open to discussion , but we have our own principles , " The Herald newspaper quotes him as saying .
No observers A network of election observers has decided that it will not observe the re-run .
The Zimbabwe election support network - a grouping of 38 organisations - deployed more than 8,000 monitors during the election in March .
But its vice chairperson , Irene Petras , told the BBC it had been struggling to get accreditation .
The MDC won the parliamentary vote in March , and claims to have won the first round of the presidential contest - held on the same day - outright .
According to official results , Mr Tsvangirai was ahead of Mr Mugabe but failed to gain enough votes to avoid a run-off .

DOJ Official Fired in Wake of ABC News Investigation
The official was fired after refusing to testify at a Congressional hearing .
June 25 , 2008  --
A Department of Justice official was fired yesterday after refusing to testify at a Congressional hearing regarding whether or not her office awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in grants based on political favoritism and personal connections .
Michele DeKonty , Chief of Staff for the DOJ's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Administrator , cited the Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination , and declined to appear at the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing last week .
DeKonty 's departure also comes on the heels of a Justice Department probe into alleged irregular contracting practices within its own ranks according to a federal law enforcement official close to the investigation .
Questions about the agency 's awarding of grants were raised earlier this month by ABC News on Nightline .
( click here to watch the report )
OJJDP staff members were notified of DeKonty 's departure this morning in an email from the office 's administrator , J. Robert Flores , who is also under investigation by the DOJ's Inspector General .
That investigation probes Flores ' hiring of a Honduran Colonel as a contractor on faith - based issues and his alleged golfing during conferences on taxpayer - funded business trips , according to a staff member who was contacted by the OIG .
In the email Flores said , " Over the past 2 years I have had the benefit of working with a talented and professional Chief of Staff in Michele DeKonty .
Yesterday , ended her tenure with our Office . "
House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - Calif. ) told Flores at the hearing last week : " The question before this committee is whether the grant solicitation was a rigged game and whether it has best served children around the country .
Mr. Flores , it seems you 're the only person at the Department of Justice who thinks your process was fair , transparent and served the interest of taxpayers . "
Flores defended himself at the hearing , asserting that he had broad discretion to overrule his career staff 's recommendations as to which grants should be funded : " While some may disagree with my decisions they were made in accordance with the law , within department rules , and in good faith to address the needs of our children , " he said .
A spokesman for DOJ said the Department had " no comment on the matter . "
DeKonty 's attorney , David Laufman could not be immediately reached for comment on this story .
Murray Waas is a Washington - based investigative reporter who primarily covers national security and law enforcement issues .

The conventional wisdom is that the US government is taking a new tack when it comes to confronting the Iranians .
As a recent piece on Breitbart.com  and dutifully posted by Matt Drudge  put it :
" The Bush administration is changing course on Iran in its final months .
The hope is that engagement can jolt a stagnant effort to resolve concerns about Tehran ’s disputed nuclear program where war drums could not . "
This is flat out wrong .
The war drums are still belting out a martial ditty , albeit accompanied by a " diplomatic " chorus .
To get closer to the truth about what is really happening on the front lines of our latest Middle Eastern crusade , take a look at this Washington Post report on the same " diplomatic " dog-and - pony show :
" With negotiations now a real possibility , the Bush administration , which had largely subcontracted the nuclear diplomacy with Iran to its European partners , also appears intent on making sure that Iran hears its voice directly , rather than having it filtered by other interlocutors .
U.S. officials wanted to ensure that the preliminary talks did not veer off course and lose sight of the suspension demand . "
The Europeans , who tend to resent Washington ’s unbridled arrogance , do n’t want a war that would wreck the world economy .
They ca n’t be trusted to deliver our intended message to Tehran : surrender or die .
This is just foreplay  if such a thing can be said of an intended rape  and White House spokeswoman Dana Perino did n’t try very hard to put a good face on it :
“ The substance remains the same , but this is a new tactic .
What this does show is how serious we are when we say that we want to try to solve this diplomatically . ”
The Bush administration is interested only in appearing to be serious about resolving this peacefully , when in actuality this diplomatic " surge " is merely a new tactic aimed at their real goal , which is regime - change in Iran .
Hardline neocon John Bolton was quick to denounce the administration for what he characterized as " a complete capitulation , " but Philip Zelikow , formerly with the State Department , got it right when he told the Post :
“ For some time , we and our allies have been reflecting on ways to reinforce that basic approach while taking away some of the more superficial complaints about it .
This move does that .
But the substantive position remains unchanged . ”
What we are seeing is a variation on the same prelude , almost note for note , that we heard in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq .
A surrogate " dissident " group funnels phony intelligence about " weapons of mass destruction " to its masters in Washington , a full - court propaganda campaign is launched , sanctions are imposed , allies are pressured to get on board , and the whole performance takes place complete with a soundtrack of constant threats .
Nothing ever changes with this administration , in spite of the best efforts of the moderate " realists , " because the War Party is still in the saddle  and because both political parties uphold the principle of American hegemonism .
Their differences are merely over strategy and tactics , and over matters of style and tone , but when it comes to the goal  American domination of every region and continent  " politics stops at the water ’s edge , " as the old foreign policy adage goes .
For example , look at the " debate " that ’s going on between John McCain and Barack Obama : the former wants to stay in Iraq for a hundred years while remaining relatively indifferent to what ’s going on in Afghanistan , while the latter says we should get out of Iraq so we can focus all our military resources on trying to do what the Soviets ( and the Brits ) could never do , and that is subdue the Afghan people .
While the partisan Punch & Judy show takes center stage , and Democratic politico and Obama surrogate Rahm Emmanuel taunts McCain and Bush that they ’re following the mulatto messiah ’s lead on Iran , the wheels and gears of the American regime - change machine are whirring and spinning , getting ready to move when the time comes .
And this is where the Iranian war scenario is scripted a little differently than the Iraqi version : the timeframe is considerably telescoped , condensed into the months remaining before the end of Bush ’s term .
As the sand spirals down in the hourglass , the War Party knows its window of opportunity will soon close .
While Obama is loath to challenge them on this issue , and has done more than his share of kowtowing to the Israel lobby  the principal proponent of military action against Tehran  he’s not likely to guarantee they ’ll be in Tehran by the summer of ’09 , and they do n’t want to take any unnecessary chances .
Yet this hardly means Obama ’s election will save us from the prospect of committing yet more war crimes in that part of the globe .
Just as the Democratic candidate is using the Afghanistan issue to define himself as a " national security Democrat " tough enough to be Commander - in - chief , so he is n’t above using the Iranians to prove the same point .
" Coercive diplomacy " is a pat phrase Obama has used more than once to describe his preferred course of action , and , when it comes to Iran , I would emphasize the coercive side of the equation over the diplomatic .
The American elites are unanimous in their verdict that the US must establish and maintain an American enclave in the Middle East : the only " debate " is over where the main forward base is to be located .
McCain says Iraq , and Obama prefers Afghanistan .
Obama ’s rise is based on a promise he is n’t prepared to deliver  and never made .
Whether the voters wake up to that before election day does n’t really matter , because the alternative is at least just as bad , and probably worse .
What is needed is n’t just a new President  we sorely require a new foreign policy .
Or , rather , a return to the old one , a policy derived from the traditional stance of the Founders of this country , who warned against foreign adventurism , disdained entangling alliances , and realized , above all , that the acquisition of an overseas empire would amount to taking a poison pill that would kill off our republican form of government for good .
The American people yearn for real change , especially when it comes to our dangerously crazed foreign policy , but it is unlikely their hopes will be fulfilled this time around .
Remember : our own intelligence apparatus is telling us [ .pdf ] that the Iranians abandoned efforts to weaponize their nascent nuclear technology years ago .
Yet both McCain and Obama deem Iran a " threat " to the US  the latter even characterized Tehran as “ the greatest strategic challenge to the United States in the region in a generation . ”
The only " change " I see is in the names of our overseas victims , whom we target , demonize , and destroy .
By the way , under the terms of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  which , unlike the Israelis , the Iranians are signatories to 
Tehran is perfectly entitled to develop nuclear power for peaceful uses .
Given the long lines for gas in Iran , that is no doubt what they ’re doing .
Like us , they realize that the world ’s oil supply is limited , and  also like us  they want to achieve illusory " energy independence , " whatever that may mean .
This , however , is one illusion we ’re not willing to share with just anyone , and certainly not with the Iranians .
MPs finally agreed to ditch the controversial " John Lewis list " today - but still clung to the right to kit out their second homes at the taxpayers ' expense .
The latest drive to reform MPs ' allowances descended into recriminations after Gordon Brown blocked an attempt to end all expenses claims for household goods and furniture .
Instead , MPs will now only be able to claim £ 2,400 a year for such items - 10 % of their total £ 24,000 second homes allowance .

The Commons also agreed to scrap the " John Lewis list " - which details how much MPs can claim for an array of goods based on prices at the up - market department store .
But the Tories , who had called for an end to any furniture claims under the Additional Costs Allowance ( ACA ) , insisted the new cap did not go far enough .
Shadow leader of the House Theresa May accused the Government of replacing the " John Lewis list " with an " Ikea list " .
The package accepted unanimously by the Commons today will also introduce an element of independent scrutiny of MPs ' expenses , although well short of what was recommended by a recent review .
The National Audit Office ( NAO ) will oversee the procedures for new internal checks on expenses claims and approve new rules governing the allowances .
The Members ' Estimate Committee , which conducted a " root and branch " review of expenses earlier this year , had called for the NAO to scrutinise claims itself .
Today 's vote was an attempt by MPs to make amends after their rejection of reforms of their expenses earlier this month sparked public uproar .

But they were nevertheless described as " half - hearted " by the TaxPayers ' Alliance .
Chief executive Matthew Elliott said : " Taxpayers are fundamentally unhappy with MPs spending our money on furniture and TVs , and while a £ 2,400 limit is an improvement , it is still £ 2,400 too much .
" The NAO audit is yet another unsatisfactory compromise .
We urgently need proper transparency and accountability , which means all receipts must be submitted and published in full . "
The Tories brought the issue back to the Commons in the form of an Opposition Day debate , although the Government insisted it had been working on proposals for weeks .
All parties backed the abolition of the " John Lewis list " - the now - notorious table of furniture and home improvement claims available to MPs , based on prices at the department store .
They include £ 10,000 for a kitchen , £ 6,000 for a bathroom , plasma televisions and other electricals , furniture and any white goods .
But a Tory bid to end ACA claims for anything but utility bills , council tax and mortgage interest or rent was defeated by 295 to 238 after Labour opposed it .
The Government , led by the Prime Minister , instead proposed that claims for household goods out of the £ 24,000 ACA be capped at 10 % .
Mr Brown was left embarrassed earlier this month when the Commons threw out reforms of the second homes allowance .
The vast majority of the MPs who rejected the shake - up then were Labour , including 34 ministers , among them Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and Culture Secretary Andy Burnham .
Ms May said : " The Government is treating people like fools ; they are just replacing the John Lewis list with the Ikea list .
" MPs should not be able to buy their TVs and furniture at the taxpayer 's expense .
When will this Labour Government get the message ? "

The first excavation inside the ring at Stonehenge in more than four decades gets under way on Monday .
The two - week dig will try to establish , once and for all , some precise dating for the creation of the monument .
It is also targeting the significance of the smaller bluestones that stand inside the giant sarsen pillars .
Researchers believe these rocks , brought all the way from Wales , hold the secret to the real purpose of Stonehenge as a place of healing .
The excavation at the 4,500 - year - old UK landmark is being funded by the BBC .
The work will be filmed for a special Timewatch programme to be broadcast in the autumn .
' Magical stones '
The researchers leading the project are two of the UK's leading Stonehenge experts - Professor Tim Darvill , of the University of Bournemouth , and Professor Geoff Wainwright , of the Society of Antiquaries .
We believe that this dig has a chance of genuinely unlocking part of the mystery of Stonehenge
John Farren , BBC Timewatch editor
Follow the dig with Timewatch
They are convinced that the dominating feature on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire was akin to a " Neolithic Lourdes " - a place where people went on a pilgrimage to get cured .
Some of the evidence supporting this theory comes from the dead , they say .
A significant proportion of the newly discovered Neolithic remains show clear signs of skeletal trauma .
Some had undergone operations to the skull , or had walked with a limp , or had broken bones .
Modern techniques have established that many of these people had clearly travelled huge distances to get to south - west England , suggesting they were seeking supernatural help for their ills .
But Darvill and Wainwright have also traced the bluestones - the stones in the centre of Stonehenge - to the exact spot they came from in the Preseli hills , 250 km away in the far west of Wales .
Neolithic inscriptions found at this location indicate the ancient people there believed the stones to be magical and for the local waters to have healing properties .
' Scientific proof ' Darvill and Wainwright hope the dig will demonstrate such beliefs also lay behind the creation of Stonehenge , by showing that the make - up of the original floor of the sacred circle at the monument is dominated by bluestone chippings that were purposely placed there .
The last dig inside the Unesco World Heritage monument was in 1964
The dig will also provide a more precise dating of the Double Bluestone Circle , the first stone circle that was erected at Stonehenge .
The original setting for this circle is no longer visible .
The bluestones seen by visitors today are later re-erections .
Archaeologists tried to date the first circle in the 1990s and estimated that it was put up at around 2,550 BC ; but a more precise dating has not been possible .
Principally , this is because materials removed in earlier excavations were poorly recorded and cannot be attributed with any certainty to specific features and deposits .
The 3.5 m by 2.5 m trench that will be excavated in the new effort will aim to retrieve fragments of the original bluestone pillars that can be properly dated .

The BBC - funded excavation goes ahead with the full support of English Heritage , which manages the site for the nation .
" Theories about Stonehenge are cheap ; proof is precious , " commented BBC Timewatch editor , John Farren .
" I 'm delighted that Timewatch , the BBC 's flagship history programme , is able to offer the possibility for some hard scientific proof to further our knowledge of the dating of Stonehenge and to bolster this remarkable new theory .
" It 's taken us 18 months ' hard work to get all the elements for the dig in place . "
Professor Wainwright added : " This small excavation of a bluestone is the culmination of six years of research which Tim and I have conducted in the Preseli Hills of North Pembrokeshire and which has shed new light on the eternal question as to why Stonehenge was built .
" The excavation will date the arrival of the bluestones following their 250 km journey from Preseli to Salisbury Plain and contribute to our definition of the society which undertook such an ambitious project .
We will be able to say not only why but when the first stone monument was built . "
Dr Simon
Thurley , chief executive of English Heritage , commented : " Very occasionally , we have the opportunity to find out something new archeologically - we are at that moment now .
" We believe that this dig has a chance of genuinely unlocking part of the mystery of Stonehenge . "
BBC Timewatch will follow the progress of the Stonehenge dig over the course of the next two weeks .
Catch daily text and video reports on the programme 's website .
A BBC Two documentary will be broadcast in the autumn and will detail the findings of the investigation

What are these ?
Programming language snobs are penny pinchers .
That ’s a tough sentence to write for some that just finished holding a workshop to help people learn Lisp of all languages .
Why would I make such a bold , inflammatory statement ?
( No , not to troll .
Most of the criticisms in this article are aimed at myself , based on my own actions over the last few years . )
I had an unpleasant realization after listening to two excellent talks that developed this idea planted in my head by Raganwald with this post he quoted a few months ago :
“ … you can count the number of games written in a purely functional style on one hand .
Is it that language tinkerers are less concerned about writing real applications ?
That they know you can solve any problem with focused grunt work , but it ’s not interesting to them ?
That the spark and newness of a different language is its own reward ?
Either way , the BASIC programmers win when it comes down to getting projects finished . ” â€” James Hague , Slumming with BASIC Programmers
The gist of the post is that uber - languages like Lisp , Erlang , Ruby , and even C are worlds ahead of BASIC , but somehow a group of Neanderthals put down their clubs and wiped away their drool long enough to write a slew of various and impressive computer games using BASIC .
OK , he did n’t say that , his exact words were “ … largely written by people with minimal programming background . ”
I was just translating for the language snobs out there .
But then , mid-gloat , he hits them , you ( even me ) with that damning quote above about getting projects finished .
Ouch .
I was looking back at what I ’ve produced over the last few years ( both personally and professionally ) and the list is pretty short .
Maybe it ’s a byproduct of too much school , or not being able to take things apart as a kid , but I tend to default to waterfall mode .
Research , plan , gather as much knowledge as possible to build a mental model so complete that the perfect solution will fly from my fingertips like a glorious winged Viking ship sailing off to enjoy another toasty Greenland winter .
Alas , I usually just end up learning enough useful knowledge about a subject to write and converse about it but not enough to work with it .
Hence my dusty portfolio .
Take my involvement with Lisp , for instance .
I ’ve become a slightly respected name in the ( admittedly small )
Lisp community because of what I ’ve written about history , Emacs and SLIME , how to learn Lisp , how to setup an environment , access documentation , and the right mindset for developing in Lisp .
Heck , I even organized a workshop to help other people learn Lisp !
Notice all the working software on that list ?
[ Cricket , cricket , cricket … ] .
What does all that have in common ?
It ’s all preparation for the day when I ’m going to write all this great software in Lisp .
Oops .
So why , when I ’ve been using C# and .
Net at work for 5 years now , am I so worried about having the perfect Lisp environment and knowledge of how to use it ?
So that when I finally get around to writing something , I will be able to do it quickly because of all the power at my disposal .
That ’s right , I do n’t have a lot of time to spend , so I ’m very , very , very gradually building up my ability to write software quickly .
That certainly makes more sense than writing a little software at a time , right ?
Where was I ?
Oh yeah , OOPSLA .
OOPSLA
The ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Object Oriented Programming , Systems , Languages , and Applications ( OOPSLA ) is one of the premier conferences on software development , and despite the title , does n’t have much to do with object - oriented programming anymore .
Twenty years or so when it started , OO was hot , cutting edge stuff , and as time marched on , the conference people decided that rather than stick with objects , they would stick with the hot , cutting edge .
For the highly regarded 2007 conference , they recorded their keynote speeches and made a podcast out of them .
What outstanding marketing !
( The Singularity Summit did this too . )
I was interested in OOPSLA because of what Dan W. and others had written about it , but getting to hear the actual speeches put this year ’s conference in Nashville at the top of my wishlist .
[ Note : if anyone is looking for a way to feel really good about themselves , why not sponsor my trip to OOPSLA 2008 ?
No , really , please !
I promise to take pretty pictures and write lots about it . ]
Two of those keynotes made a huge impression on me , to the point where I ’m scared what will happen if I listen to the 5 remaining talks .
First , in Second Life : The World ’s Biggest Programming Environment ( download 40.5 MB mp3 ) , two Second Life employees gave a similar argument to Hague ’s above .
They started out by trashing the Second Life scripting language ( LSL ) and sharing details of its sordid past .
For instance , all scripts have to run in a 16 K virtual machine .
This virtual machine was written in one week , replacing the first version that was written in one night .
There is no IDE , no debugging , no tracing – all editing happens in - world .
Most appealing language features are missing , and the language is n’t even pretty .
Bleak , huh ?
Well , there are hundreds of thousands ( millions ? ) of people writing scripts in LSL , with over 2 million simultaneous scripted objects and over 2.5 billion lines of code in this terrible language .
Why do people put up with it ?
Because the payoff is so rewarding – there is a whole world full of animated objects scripted by participants .
People love to write in it since there ’s immediate , tangible feedback for doing so – you literally change the world your character lives in !
The second talk was by Kathy Sierra , called ( no surprise ) Creating Passionate Users ( download 38 MB mp3 ) .
I ’m a confessed Kathy Sierra fan , so I looked forward to getting reacquainted with old Kathy .
Her remarks enlightened and expanded the points made by the Second Life people – people want high bandwidth experiences , they want feedback , they want their effort to produce results !
Why was that such a revelation to me ?
I mean , I got it , but I did n’t get it until I heard her say it .
There are so many examples of this principle :
people use PHP because it ’s installed on every web host in the multiverse , so they do n’t have to muck around much with deployment
people use Ruby on Rails because they can make a blog in 15 minutes
people use
Agile because they always have working software and can see changes immediately
people do n’t use Lisp because there ’s no easy download
and people use BASIC and LSL because they want to get stuff done
That brings me to the two parts of my inflammatory title :
Language Snobs
Language Snobs stress the superiority of one programming language over others .
Some languages are extremely guilty of this ( Lisp , SmallTalk , Python , Ruby , Scala , Haskell , etc ) while others are n’t ( Java , C# , VB , BASIC , PHP , Perl , C , etc ) .
The snob languages talk about why they ’re so great , and the other languages just point to what has been written in them as proof that they ’re great ( or at least good enough ) .
Granted , this definition is n’t perfect ; Lisp has everything on my Lisp Companies page to brag about , but it seems small in comparison to the hot air that gets circulated ( including by me ) in its favor .
I think Ruby is crossing over into the non -snob category , based on the massive popularity of Rails and all of the sites written in it .
The important point is that the language snobs are n’t wrong !
There is no denying that abstractions are useful , that more powerful tools help , and that a sharp , well - trained mind can accomplish things that a simple one can’t .
The dearth of machine language and assembly written nowadays is proof of that .
But the language snobs are working in the realm of what ’s theoretically possible , what can be accomplished in the best possible conditions .
This could be in small startups founded on the best principles , or on large companies like Google and ITA that have kept that environment as they ’ve grown .
But most people and most business do n’t operate anywhere near that theoretical maximum , so the bulk of the software gets written by the competent mean , by the bulge in the middle of the standard distribution .
Language snobs are also working in the future , since advanced topics tend to trickle down over time ( hence the rebranding of OOPSLA ) .
Penny Pinchers
A penny pincher is someone who is frugal , who “ knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing ” .
Language snobs know what languages are most powerful , so they are loath to use anything less than the best .
They do n’t want to endure the cost of code duplication , cut - and - paste , reading un - refactored code , leaky abstractions , etc .
Everything has to be perfect , and when you add up those little bits of perfection , you get something great .
But life , business , and software are full of trade - offs .
If you can accept a little imperfection here , some cruft there , and sloppy duplication there , they you can hire from a bigger pool of employees , deploy to a wider range of platforms , hit more markets more frequently .
The key point that the penny pinchers miss is that while using inferior tools has a cost associated with it , so does not using those tools .
The important thing is to Always Be Shipping .
Wasabi
It ’s not only language snobs that are guilty of penny pinching .
A classic example of the non -snob language fans pinching was in reaction to Fog Creek ’s Wasabi programming language .
For anyone who missed it , here ’s the first mention :
FogBugz is written in Wasabi , a very advanced , functional - programming dialect of Basic with closures and lambdas and Rails - like active records that can be compiled down to VBScript , JavaScript , PHP4 or PHP5 .
Wasabi is a private , in - house language written by one of our best developers that is optimized specifically for developing FogBugz ; the Wasabi compiler itself is written in C# .
This simple comment set off a crazed irrational firestorm of criticism , cataloged here .
People even thought it was a joke !
These people were pinching pennies because they did n’t realize that writing a compiler where you control both the input and the output is n’t that hard if you have smart people working for you .
Joel wrote a response to the Wasabi firestorm explaining all this :
Since we are not blub programmers , we like closures , active records , lambdas , embedded SQL a la LINQ , etc. etc. and so those are the kinds of features we put into Wasabi …
Most people do n’t realize that writing a compiler like this is only about 2 months work for one talented person who read the Dragon book .
Since the compiler only has one body of code to compile , it is much easier to write .
It does n’t have to be a general - purpose compiler .
It does n’t have a math library , for example …
And we have the ability to add any feature to the language that we want easily … this is the same power Paul Graham talks about in On Lisp , the power to invent new language features that suit your exact application domain .
Lisp does this through a mechanism called macros …
He also explains the very sound business reason for it , balancing the cost of developing the Wasabi language and compiler ( smaller than people think ) against the support cost of setting client servers up with .
Net , Mono , or PHP on Windows ( larger than people think ) and the lost opportunity cost of people that wo n’t even consider buying your product because they do n’t support your language ( MUCH larger than people think ) .
37signals at least acknowledges this foregone opportunity , but 37signals has WAY more business savvy than people give them credit for .
And despite the bashing Joel gets for writing “ a crappy bug - tracking program for stupid windows programmers ” or something like that , he has managed to increase his revenue by 17 x since September 2003 .
There ’s a very important lesson to be learned from two very successful companies – make balanced strategic decisions , but make sure you understand the consequences of doing so .
Conclusion
It turns out that this was n’t much about languages at all ; languages was just the topic that springboarded the idea .
The real message is about people , passion , results , business , and most importantly , balance .
If you find yourself focusing too much on one single aspect of your product or your business , there had better be a good reason .
If you love your language because you can mold it ( Lisp ) , or because strict functionality and a strong typing system prevent errors ( Haskell , OCaml ) , those features had better be extremely important to the problem you ’re trying to solve .
If you ’re running a software business and all you do is code , you ’d better be getting your first version ready to release as soon as possible .
All successful companies are balanced companies .
If you ’re too focused on one area , you ’re guilty of premature optimization and unless you are ready to make some painful adjustments , you should get comfy on your local maximum .

UPDATE : Joel and Jeff at the stackoverflow podcast had a strikingly similar discussion in Episode # 8 .
Joel said that for the niche tools ( that ’s how he characterized what I called “ snob languages ” ) , there are two reactions to the pain that the limitations ( documentation , fewer programmers , less mature tools , etc ) cause : admitting that your platform just is n’t that good yet , or convincing yourself that your platform is so good that it ’s worth the pain because it makes you so much more productive .
Choosing the first option causes jarring cognitive dissonance whereas the second choice feels good , so these niche languages and platforms have vocal , fanatic followers who have convinced themselves that they are using the Good Lord ’s Own tools .
If you ’re using a snob language but still think you ’re rational and open - minded , listen to it or read the transcript ( not finished yet but will be soon ) .
It ’s between 6:57 and 16:56 .
EVANSTON , Ill . ---
Using " virtual peers " -- animated life - sized children that simulate the behaviors and conversation of typically developing children -- Northwestern University researchers are developing interventions designed to prepare children with autism for interactions with real - life children .
Justine Cassell , professor of communication studies and electrical engineering and computer science , recently presented a preliminary study on the work at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
" Children with high - functioning autism may be able to give you a lecture on a topic of great interest to them but they can't carry on a ' contingent ' -- or two - way -- conversation , " said Cassell , director of Northwestern 's Center for Technology and Social Behavior .
Cassell and researcher Andrea Tartaro collected data from six children with high - functioning autism aged 7 to 11 as they engaged in play during an hour - long session with a real - life child , and with a virtual peer named Sam .
In an analysis of those interactions , they found that children with autism produced more and more " contingent " sentences when they spoke with the virtual peer , while their sentences did not become increasingly contingent when they were paired with the real - life children .
" Certainly we 're not saying that virtual peers make the best playmates for children with autism , " said Tartaro .
" The overall goal is for the children with autism to generalize the skills they learn in practice sessions with virtual peers to meaningful interactions with real - world children . "
Nor are Northwestern researchers saying they can teach " contingency " -- appropriate back and forth conversation -- in a single session .
But their findings hold promise that virtual peers can be useful in helping children with autism develop communication and social skills .
And virtual peers have some distinct advantages over real - life children when it comes to practicing social skills .
For starters , children with autism often like technology .
" It interacts to us , " said one child with autism upon first meeting a virtual peer .
What 's more , said Cassell , virtual peers do n't get tired or impatient .
" We can program their conversation to elicit socially - skilled behavior , and we can vary the way that they look and behave so children with autism are exposed to different kinds of behavior . "
Cassell and Tartaro 's study is part of larger efforts taking place in the Articulab , the Northwestern University laboratory where Cassell and colleagues explore how people communicate with and through technology .
In the Articulab , Cassell , who was trained as a psychologist and linguist , and Tartaro are teaming up with psychologist Miri Arie to develop assessment and intervention procedures that they hope will give them a better understanding of peer behaviors of children with autism .
A major challenge for children with autism is learning the rules of social behavior that typically developing children seem to learn intuitively .
" Although children 's play appears spontaneous and wild , it follows certain basic social rules , " said Arie .
" We hope virtual peers like Sam will allow children with autism to practice the rules behind joining a game , holding a conversation and maintaining social interaction .
Then they can apply their newly acquired skills to real - life situations . "

According to an anonymous source close to MTV News , Microsoft will soon launch a Wii Remote imitator for Xbox 360 , replete with Mii knock - offs , in an effort to capitalize on Nintendo 's raging success .
" They want the usual assortment of ' Halo ' / ' Gears ' / ' Forza ' / whatever , just in waggle form , " the nameless developer said .
" Microsoft is trying to decide how to get something out by the end of the year . "
The loose - lipped mole sketched a design of the last - known prototype , that looks eerily similar to the Wii Remote , but says development problems have arose because Microsoft is impatiently trying to ship the product .
" The whole thing is a colossal cluster ---- , " the source went onto say .
" [ Microsoft ] marketing just want it so they can match the Wii point for point .
The biggest parts of their marketing materials outline how easy it would be for third parties to port their Wii games to the 360 . "
MTV
News added that it has " confirmed Microsoft 's active interest in developing a motion - sensitive controller with other industry sources . "
Previously , Microsoft has publicly doubted the long - term viability of motion as it pertains to video game controllers while noting the initial success Nintendo has so far enjoyed .
Microsoft declined comment on Monday when contacted by GamePro .
" We do not comment on rumors or speculation , " a representative said in an email .
In a February 2008 interview with GameDaily , Sony 's VP of product marketing said a Wii - like controller would not be needed .
" I think a Wii Remote style would feel a bit less innovative on the PS2 , so I do n't think we have any plans to go there , " said Scott Steinberg .
" I think it 's interesting to think of what different controller configurations could do for the PS3 and possibly for the PS2 , but as a Wii Remote knock off , I do n't think we 're in the business of creating knock offs . "
This story , " Sources : Microsoft to Launch Wii-like Controller in 2008 " was originally published by GamePro .
All of the discussion about next March 's Watchmen movie has focused on whether it'll be faithful to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ' seminal graphic novel .
But really , they 're missing the point - Watchmen should n't be a movie at all .
It only makes narrative sense as a comic book , because so much of its strengths are tied to the comics format and it's all about the history of comics .
A movie version , no matter how faithful , will be empty and pointless .
Advertisement
This really hit me while I was watching an interview with Watchmen director Zack Snyder the other day , and he was talking about trying to do justice to the graphic novel .
Judging from his Spartan war movie 300 and the early Watchmen images , Snyder 's a graphic - novel fetishist who will do everything in his power to do a perfect " cover version " of Moore and Gibbons ' comic .
And I do n't really doubt that we 'll end up with a note - for - note mimicking of the graphic novel , transplanted to the screen .
But will it be worth watching ?

Here are some reasons I do n't think Watchmen will be that great of a movie :
It 's about the history of comics .
Originally , Moore was writing a comics series about the old Charlton comics heroes , like The Question , the Atom , Blue Beetle , and so on .
At the time , DC had just acquired these properties , and Moore was going to have free reign to fuck them up .
But then someone at DC decided to play it safe , and Moore had to come up with all new characters : Nite Owl instead of Blue Beetle , Rohrschach instead of the Question , Dr. Manhattan instead of Captain Atom .
In the process of developing all these new characters , Moore came up with a whole detailed history of their Minutemen superteam , including a ton of backup documentation , including Hollis Mason 's book Under The Hood .
The result is like a history of superhero comics , going back to the Golden Age and showing how the superhero in comics had matured and darkened .
It influenced the generation of superhero comics that followed .
Advertisement
Why could n't we have had a Watchmen movie that commented on the history of superhero movies in the same way that the graphic novel commented on comics history ?
With sly references to the 1966 Batman movie and Tim Burton 's 1989 version , and the weird history of Supergirl / Elektra girl spinoff movies ?
And the Corman Fantastic Four versus the superslick recent ones ?
Would n't that have been more interesting than a slavish Alan Moore tribute ?

It 's about experimenting with the comics format .
Moore , of course , does n't want there to be a Watchmen movie because of his struggles with Hollywood in general .
But he also makes an important point , in an interview :
The problem with taking Watchmen to another medium is that we deliberately set out to establish - hard - some territory for comics .
We tried to exploit the things in comics that cannot be done in any other medium ...
In a perfect world I 'd rather see it as a comic .
This insistence that if something is a success in one medium then it can automatically be translated to another and still be a success …
Advertisement
The most famous format experiment in Watchmen , of course , is the Black Freighter comic that we see a kid reading .
It 's a weirdly meta moment : not just a comic within a comic , but also a comic portraying the experience of reading a comic book and being caught up in it .
The Black Freighter wo n't be in the theatrical release of Watchmen at all , of course - it'll be a separate animated DVD , and included in a DVD version at some point .
But either way , it wo n't represent the same kind of experiment with the comics format that the graphic novel was .
Advertisement
Also , Moore explained in another interview :
What I 'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating .
Like in Watchmen , all that subliminal shit we were getting into the backgrounds .
You are trapped in the running time of a film – you go in , you sit down , they 've got two hours and you 're dragged through at their pace .
With a comic you can stare at the page for as long as you want and check back to see if this line of dialogue really does echo something four pages earlier , whether this picture is really the same as that one , and wonder if there is some connection there ...
Watchmen was designed to be read four or five times .
Advertisement
According to Moore , Terry Gilliam was looking at directing Watchmen , but he got stymied thinking about all the texture and narrative complexity he was going to have to cut out to make it work .
Gilliam ended up coming around to Moore 's point of view .
Advertisement
Watchmen is of its time .
Just look at this set photo from Snyder 's movie .
It 's trying very , very hard to look like New York , circa 1985 - and it's mostly succeeding , way more than the American version of Life On Mars manages to capture 1972 Los Angeles .
But it 's also missing the point : Watchmen is supposed to take place in the present day , an alternate present where Richard Nixon is still president , superheroes are real , and the Cold War is even more fucked up than it really was .
The storyline loses a lot of its impact if you put it 24 years into the past , no matter how lovingly you construct that past .
And it 's going to take a lot more than gorgeous sets and obsessive attention to detail to conjure the long - gone Cold War mindset for moviegoers , many of whom were in diapers when the Berlin Wall fell .
Without being too spoilery for an old comic book , the story 's climax depends heavily on understanding Reagan - era concepts like Mutually Assured Destruction and the winnable nuclear war .
Even people who were grown - ups back then can barely wrap their minds around those things now .
Advertisement
The movie will pander to fans .
That 's the thing that will probably doom Watchmen , actually - it 's aimed at the ultra - obsessive fans of the graphic novel .
Not just the people who read it and enjoyed it once or twice - the people whose original copies are dog-eared and sweat - stained , and who then went out and bought the Absolute edition for $ 100 .
Advertisement
Not just because of the obsessive copying of every facet of Moore and Gibbons ' accomplishment - even down to using newsreels to copy the text portions of the story - but also because of the story 's insularity , and the way it comments on superhero narratives .
Snyder 's 300 worked because it was a fairly simple story that really was from history , as opposed to Watchmen 's byzantine wheels - within - wheels story .
In short : the Watchmen movie wo n't be able to duplicate the things that were awesome and juicy about the original graphic novel .
And in its attempt to grasp at something that can't be captured , it may wind up being kind of boring .

Additional research by Lauren Davis .
The following clip from Kill The Messenger , a documentary about Sibel 's case , discusses some of Hastert 's involvement as mentioned in Vanity Fair .
In researching the Vanity Fair article , journalist David Rose interviewed various congressional staffers and counter - intelligence officials who are familiar with the case .
He reported that there were three separate types of bribes paid to Hastert :
" ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert ’s campaign funds in small checks . "
" ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars in surreptitious payments in exchange for political favors and information . "
" ( A ) t least $ 500,000 "
Hastert was lucky that there was literally zero follow - up in the mainstream media to these most serious charges .
Hastert did not sue Vanity Fair for libel , instead , Hastert got his spokesman to send Vanity Fair a bizarre Letter to the Editor in response , 6 months later .
BradBlog has the letter here , along with Sibel 's effective debunking of Hastert 's response .
The only action taken in response to the startling revelations in Vanity Fair was by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington ( CREW ) which filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) asking them to investigate the " ( T ) ens of thousands of dollars to be paid to Hastert ’s campaign funds in small checks . "
According to the Vanity Fair article , these bribes were funneled into Hastert 's campaign in amounts less than $ 200 , which would mean that the contributions were below the threshold for reporting .
The Federal Election Commission droppedthe investigation in early 2006 without answering the specific charge .
The bribes identified in Vanity Fair are probably just the tip of the iceberg , merely down - payments on what was promised to him when he left office , and could ' earn ' a multi-million dollar salary as a lobbyist .
Sibel describedhow the process works , using another member of her " Rogues Gallery , "
former State Dept official Marc Grossman as an example :
" For example , look at Mr. Marc Grossman .
He used to be the U.S. ambassador in Turkey and used his position within the State Department to secure future higher - level positions while in office — and I would like to emphasize this — while in office and with several agencies knowing about it .
Some people in these agencies wanted to investigate these cases but they were prevented from going forward .
.. And just take a look at where Mr. Grossman is today .
Within a few months after he gave his resignation , he obtained a position with a semi-legitimate Turkish company that is supplying him with a very attractive monetary reward , ( and ) he obtained ( another ) position with a lobbying firm that represents ( Turkey ) . "
And Sibel has made the same case elsewhere :
" Please do not make the grave and naive mistake of assuming that Grossman found and obtained his highly lucrative and questionable positions after his resignation in January 2005 . "
It appears that these arrangements are n't the typical ' Revolving Door ' retirement packages , but rather specific quid pro quo deals .
People like Hastert and Grossman and the others quite literally sell out their government while in office on the specific promise that they will be rewarded when they leave .
Hastert wo n't actually be a ' Lobbyist ' according to Dickstein Shapiro , he 'll be " providing strategy advice to the firm and its clients " - spending half his time in Chicago and half his time in DC .
Most likely , some of that ' strategy advice ' will include advice on how to corrupt some of the sitting congressmen :
The people who bribed Hastert and the others need to ensure the continuity of their operations , regardless of who is sitting in Congress .
Sibel says that the foreign entities who are successful in this business simply need to follow a basic recipe :
" Get yourself a few ‘ Dime a Dozen Generals , ’ bid high in the ‘ former statesmen lobby auction ’ , and put in your pocket one or two ‘ ex - congressmen turned lobbyists ’ who know the ropes when it comes to pocketing a few dozen who still serve . "
Dickstein Shapiro , Hastert 's new employers , were deeply involved with Turkey and the Central Asian region during the time that Hastert was caught taking these bribes - 1996 to 2001 .
For example ,
It was Dickstein Shapiro , in conjunction with the Baker Botts law firm , who put together the ' contract of the century ' - the Baku - Tbilisi - Ceyhan ( or BTC ) pipeline which was to carry oil from Azerbaijan to the West , via Georgia and Turkey .
Some of Dickstein Shapiro's other claims to fame include :
1 ) Defending " former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams in connection with the Iran- Contra investigations . "
2 ) " ( S ) uccessfully defended and represented prominent clients in a number of other high - profile cases such as ... BCCI Bank "
3 ) Employing convicted felon Lewis Scooter Libby ( and his wife ) , who was a partner at the firm from 1986 to 1989 .
If there 's any justice in the world , Dickstein Shapiro will soon be adding Dennis Hastert to their ' Ex - employees who are now convicted felons '
Hall of Fame .
UPDATE : Has Fox News turned on Hastert ?
They are running a piece about Hastert 's shady land deals .

Admonish the young women to love their husbands , to love their children , to be discreet , chaste , homemakers , good , obedient to their own husbands , that the word of God may not be blasphemed .
NKJV
Prairie Muffins is a term used by some conservative evangelical Christians in the United States to refer to married women who choose to pursue what they hold as the biblical role of women as quiet homemakers who protect the innocence of their children .
The idea is taken from the New Testament passage in Titus 2:4-5 :
The origin of the term stems from an incident when R.C. Sproul , Jr. in a good - natured , joking , and in - passing manner referred to his wife as a " Prairie Muffin . "
The term is proudly worn by those who self - define as such , although people who see the term and its lifestyle as form of patriarchy may use it as a pejorative .
The husbands of those who self - define as Prairie Muffins sometimes refer to themselves as " Prairie Dawgs " .
Prairie Muffin women are likely to be Quiverfull , homeschoolers , and to live in a rural area .

Bill Moyers Journal , which unfortunately is probably not on the top of most Americans TIVO list for Friday nights , dove head on into some of our country 's darker days .
Days that many in the South would probably prefer to forget , when slavery was no longer legal , but still practiced by an economy addicted to slavery , and unwilling to let it go .
Bill Moyers interviewed Douglas Blackmon , author of the book , Slavery by Another Name , and it is truly worth your time to watch the entire interview .
With a Presidential election that has brought the issue of race front and center and forced us to confront the reasons for racial divides , understanding the past and how it relates to the racial tensions that still exist in this country is an important discussion for anyone who would like to finally heal those wounds .
Hopefully , one day we may move to a place where race is no longer an issue , or a way to keep a segment of the population from ever achieving equality .
Douglas Blackmon delves into a time that has helped to shape the views of African Americans towards our judicial system , our law enforcement , and our legislators .
Open dialogue about what happened during those dark days , and how we move forward to make sure that it does not continue today is a discussion I hope more Americans have as we ponder whether we may have our first black President and what that will mean for our country and the future of race relations .
Tomgram : Why We Can't See America 's Ziggurats in Iraq
[ Note for TomDispatch readers : Just a reminder .
Today 's post on the mega - bases in Iraq represents but one of the missing stories of the Bush years that TomDispatch has been dedicated to covering .
The site 's new book , The World According to TomDispatch : America in the New Age of Empire , just published , is , in essence , a striking history of the missing stories of our mad age , the stories the mainstream media chose to ignore .
I urge TomDispatch readers to pick up a copy .
It 's a great way to support the site and -- if you care to give it to a friend -- to introduce others to a source of information that has , for years , been an " antidote to the mainstream media . "
If you can , do recommend the book and the site to your private e-lists and suggest , as well , that people consider going to TomDispatch.com to sign up -- in the window at the upper right of the main screen -- for the regular emails indicating that a new post has gone up .
There will be surprises galore this summer as TomDispatch explores the Bush legacy and whether what the Bush administration has embedded in our lives can ever be unbuilt .

The Greatest Story Never Told
Finally , the U.S. Mega - Bases in Iraq Make the News
By Tom Engelhardt
It 's just a $ 5,812,353 contract -- chump change for the Pentagon -- and not even one of those notorious " no - bid " contracts either .
Ninety - eight bids were solicited by the Army Corps of Engineers and 12 were received before the contract was awarded this May 28th to Wintara , Inc. of Fort Washington , Maryland , for " replacement facilities for Forward Operating Base Speicher , Iraq . "
According to a Department of Defense press release , the work on those " facilities " to be replaced at the base near Saddam Hussein 's hometown , Tikrit , is expected to be completed by January 31 , 2009 , a mere 11 days after a new president enters the Oval Office .
It is but one modest reminder that , when the next administration hits Washington , American bases in Iraq , large and small , will still be undergoing the sort of repair and upgrading that has been ongoing for years .
In fact , in the last five - plus years , untold billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent on the construction and upgrading of those bases .
When asked back in the fall of 2003 , only months after Baghdad fell to U.S. troops , Lt. Col .
David Holt , the Army engineer then " tasked with facilities development " in Iraq , proudly indicated that " several billion dollars " had already been invested in those fast - rising bases .
Even then , he was suitably amazed , commenting that " the numbers are staggering . "
Imagine what he might have said , barely two and a half years later , when the U.S. reportedly had 106 bases , mega to micro , all across the country .
By now , billions have evidently gone into single massive mega- bases like the U.S. air base at Balad , about 60 miles north of Baghdad .
It 's a " 16 - square - mile fortress , " housing perhaps 40,000 U.S. troops , contractors , special ops types , and Defense Department employees .
As the Washington Post 's Tom Ricks , who visited Balad back in 2006 , pointed out -- in a rare piece on one of our mega - bases -- it 's essentially " a small American town smack in the middle of the most hostile part of Iraq . "
Back then , air traffic at the base was already being compared to Chicago 's O'Hare International or London 's Heathrow -- and keep in mind that Balad has been steadily upgraded ever since to support an " air surge " that , unlike the President 's 2007 " surge " of 30,000 ground troops , has yet to end .
Building Ziggurats
While American reporters seldom think these bases -- the most essential U.S. facts on the ground in Iraq -- are important to report on , the military press regularly writes about them with pride .
Such pieces offer a tiny window into just how busily the Pentagon is working to upgrade and improve what are already state - of - the - art garrisons .
Here 's just a taste of what 's been going on recently at Balad , one of the largest bases on foreign soil on the planet , and but one of perhaps five mega - bases in that country :
Consider , for instance , this description of an air - field upgrade from official U.S. Air Force news coverage , headlined : " ' Dirt Boyz ' pave way for aircraft , Airmen " :
" In less than four months , Balad Air Base Dirt Boyz have placed and finished more than 12,460 feet of concrete and added approximately 90,000 square feet of pavement to the airfield Without the extra pavement courtesy of the Dirt Boyz , fewer aircraft would be able to be positioned and maintained at Balad AB .
Having fewer aircraft at the base would directly affect the Air Force 's ability to place surveillance assets in the air and to drop munitions on targets ...
The ongoing flightline projects at Balad AB consist of concrete pad extensions that will provide occupation surfaces for multiple aircraft of various types . "
Or here 's a proud description of what Detachment 6 of the 732nd Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron did on its recent tour in Balad :
" ' We constructed more than 25,000 square feet of living , dining and operations buildings from the ground up , ' said Staff Sgt. John Wernegreen ' This project gave the [ U.S. ]
Army 's [ 3rd Squadron , 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment ] and Iraqi army [ soldiers ] a place to carry out their mission of controlling the battlespace around the Eastern Diyala Province . ' "
And here 's a caption , accompanying an Air Force photo of work at Balad : " Airmen of the 407th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron pavement and equipment team repair utility cuts here June 11 .
The team replaced approximately 30 cubic meters of concrete over newly installed power line cables . "
And another : " Expeditionary Civil Engineer Squadron heavy equipment operator , contours a new sidewalk here , June 10 .
Sidewalk repair is being accomplished throughout the base housing area to eliminate tripping hazards . "
( The sidewalks on such bases go with bus routes , traffic lights , and speeding tickets -- in a country parts of which the U.S. has helped turn into little more than a giant pothole . )
Or how about this caption for a photo of military men on upgrade duty working on copper cable as " part of the new tents to trailers project . "
It 's little wonder that , in another rare piece , NPR 's defense correspondent Guy Raz reported , in October 2007 , that Balad was " one giant construction project , with new roads , sidewalks , and structures going up all with an eye toward the next few decades . "
Think of this as the greatest American story of these years never told -- or more accurately , since there have been a few reports on a couple of these mega - bases -- never shown .
After all , what an epic of construction this has been , as the Pentagon built a series of fortified American towns , each some 15 to 20 miles around , with many of the amenities of home , including big name fast - food franchises , PXes , and the like , in a hostile land in the midst of war and occupation .
In terms of troops , the President may only have put his " surge " strategy into play in January 2007 , but his Pentagon has been " surging " on base construction since April 2003 .
Now , imagine as well that hundreds of thousands of Americans have passed through these mega- bases , including the enormous al - Asad Air Base ( sardonically nicknamed " Camp Cupcake " for its amenities ) in the Western desert of Iraq , and the ill - named ( or never renamed ) Camp Victory on the edge of Baghdad .
Troops have surged through these bases , of course .
Private contractors galore .
Hired guns .
Pentagon officials .
Military commanders .
Top administration figures .
Visiting Congressional delegations .
Presidential candidates .
And , of course , the journalists .
It has been , for instance , a commonplace of these years to see a TV correspondent reporting on the situation in Iraq , or what the American military had to say about Iraq , from Baghdad 's enormous Camp Victory .
And yet , if you think about it , that camera , photographing ABC 's fine reporter Martha Raddatz or other reporters on similar stop - overs , never pans across the base itself .
You do n't even get a glimpse , unless you have access to homemade G.I. videos or Pentagon - produced propaganda .
Similarly , last year , the President landed at Camp Cupcake for a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki with reporters in tow .
You could see shots of him getting off the plane ( just as he does everywhere ) , goofing around with troops , or shaking hands with the Iraqi prime minister but , as far as I know , none of the reporters with him stayed on to give us a view of the base itself .
Imagine if just about no one knew that the pyramids had been built .
Ditto the Great Wall of China .
The Hanging Gardens of Babylon .
The Coliseum .
The Eiffel Tower .
The Statue of Liberty .
Or any other architectural wonder of the world you 'd care to mention .
After all , these giant bases , rising from the smashed birthplace of Western civilization , were not only built on ( and sometimes out of bits of ) the ancient ruins of that land , but are functionally modern ziggurats .
They are the cherished monuments of the Bush administration .
Even though its spokespeople have regularly refused to use the word " permanent " in relation to them -- in fact , in relation to any U.S. base on the planet -- they have been built to long outlast the Bush administration itself .
They were , in fact , clearly meant to be key garrisons of a Pax Americana in the Middle East for generations to come .
And , not surprisingly , they reek of permanency .
They are the unavoidable essence -- unless , like most Americans , you do n't know they 're there -- of Bush administration planning in Iraq .
Without them , no discussion of Iraq policy in this country really makes sense .
And that , of course , is what makes their missing - in- action quality on the American landscape so striking .
Yes , a couple of good American reporters have written pieces about one or two of them , but most Americans , as we know , get their news from television and -- though no one can watch all the news that flows , 24/7 , into American living rooms , it 's a reasonable bet that a staggering percentage of Americans have never had the opportunity to see the remarkable structures their tax dollars have paid for , and continue to pay for , in occupied Iraq .
This is the sort of thing you might expect of Bush - style offshore prisons , or gulags , or concentration camps .
And yet Americans have regularly and repeatedly seen what Guantanamo looks like .
They have seen something of what Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq looks like .
But not the bases .
Perhaps one explanation lies in this :
On rare occasions when Americans are asked by pollsters whether they want " permanent bases " in Iraq , significant majorities answer in the negative .
You can only assume that , as on many other subjects , the Bush administration preferred to fly under the radar screen on this one -- and the media generally concurred .
And let 's remember one more base , though it 's never called that : the massive imperial embassy , perhaps the biggest on the planet , being built , for nearly three - quarters of a billion dollars , on a nearly Vatican - sized 104 - acre plot of land inside the Green Zone in Baghdad .
It will be home to 1,000 " diplomats . "
It will cost an estimated $ 1.2 billion a year just to operate .
With its own electricity and water systems , its anti-missile defenses , recreation , " retail and shopping " areas , and " blast - resistant " work spaces , it is essentially a fortified citadel , a base inside the fortified American heart of the Iraq capital .
Like the mega - bases , it emits an aura of American , not Iraqi , " sovereignty . "
It , too , is being built " for the ages . "
A Land Grab , American - style
The issue of the mega - bases in Iraq first surfaced barely days after Baghdad had fallen .
It was on April 20 , 2003 , to be exact , and on the front - page of the New York Times in a piece headlined , " Pentagon Expects Long - Term Access to Key Iraq Bases . "
Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt wrote : " American military officials , in interviews this week , spoke of maintaining perhaps four bases in Iraq that could be used in the future , " including what became Camp Victory .
The story , and the very idea of " permanent " bases , was promptly denied by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld -- then essentially disappeared from the news for years .
( To this day , again as far as I know , the New York Times has never written another significant front - page story on the subject . )
Now , however , the bases are , suddenly and startlingly , in the news ( and , of course , being written about and discussed on TV as if they had long been part of everyday media analysis ) .
This week , in fact , they hit the front page of the Washington Post , due to protests by Iraqi leaders close to the Bush administration .
They were angered by , and leaking like mad about , American strong - arm tactics in negotiations for a long - term Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) that would officially embed American - controlled bases in Iraq for the long - term , potentially tie the hands of a future American president on Iraq policy , and represent a sovereignty grab of the first order .
( A typical comment from a pro-Maliki Iraqi politician in that Post piece : " The Americans are making demands that would lead to the colonization of Iraq " )
The growing Iraqi protests -- in the streets , in parliament , and among the negotiators -- certainly helped spark coverage in this country .
A persistent and intrepid British reporter , Patrick Cockburn of The Independent , helpfully broke the story of Bush administration demands days before it became significant news here .
But most of the credit should really go to the Bush administration itself , which , despite the long - term flow of events in Iraq , still wanted it all .
Greed , coupled with desperation , seems to have done the trick .
In all the years of the occupation , the officials of this administration have had a tin ear for the post - colonial era they inhabit .
It 's never penetrated their consciousness that the greatest story of the twentieth century was the way previously subjected and colonized peoples had gained ( or regained ) their sovereignty .
The administration indicated this , back in 2003 , with its very dream of garrisoning a major , potentially hostile , intensely nationalistic Arab nation in the heart of the oil lands of the planet .
That the building of enormous American bases and the basing of troops in relatively peaceful Saudi Arabia after the First Gulf War led to disaster -- think : Osama bin Laden -- mattered not a whit to top administration officials .
It could n't have been clearer just how little they cared for Iraqi sovereignty or pride when L. Paul Bremer III , George W. Bush 's personal representative and viceroy in Baghdad , before officially " returning sovereignty " to the Iraqis in June 2004 , signed the infamous ( though , in this country , little noted ) Order 17 .
As the law of the land in Iraq , among other things , it ensured that all foreigners involved in the occupation project would be granted " freedom of movement without delay throughout Iraq , " and neither their vessels , nor their vehicles , nor their aircraft would be " subject to registration , licensing or inspection by the [ Iraqi ] Government . "
Nor in traveling would foreign diplomats , soldiers , consultants , security guards , or any of their vehicles , vessels , or planes be subject to " dues , tolls , or charges , including landing and parking fees , " and so on .
When it came to imports , including " controlled substances , " there were to be no customs fees or inspections , taxes , or much of anything else ; nor was there to be the slightest charge for the use of Iraqi " headquarters , camps , and other premises " occupied , nor for the use of electricity , water , or other utilities .
And all private contractors were to have total immunity from prosecution anywhere in the country .
This was , of course , freedom as theft .
Order 17 would have seemed familiar to any nineteenth century European colonialist .
It granted what used to be termed " extraterritoriality " to Americans .
Think of it as a giant get - out - of - jail - free card for an occupying nation .
Now , imagine , that , even after years of disaster , even in a state of discontrol , with unsecured global oil supplies surging toward $ 140 a barrel , the Bush administration remained in the same Order 17 frame of mind .
They began their negotiations with the Iraqis accordingly .
Cockburn ( and other journalists subsequently ) would report that they were asking for Order 17 - style immunity for the U.S. military and all private contractors in the country , as well as the use of up to 58 bases , even though they evidently " only " had 30 major ones in the country .
( A leading politician of the Badr Organization claimed that American negotiators were actually pushing for the use of a startling 200 facilities across the country . )
They also evidently insisted on control over Iraqi air space up to 29,000 feet , the right to bring troops in and out of the country without informing the Iraqis , and the right to " conduct military operations in Iraq and to detain individuals when necessary for imperative reasons of security , " again without notification to the Iraqis , no less approval of any sort .
They may even have insisted on the freedom to strike other countries from their Iraqi bases , again without consultation or approval .
In addition , reported Cockburn , they were attempting to force their Iraqi counterparts to agree to such a deal by threatening to deny them at least $ 20 billion in Iraqi oil funds on deposit in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .
Gulf News reported as well that , under the American version of the agreement , " Iraqi security institutions such as Defense , Interior and National Security ministries , as well as armament contracts , will be under American supervision for ten years . "
This was partially confirmed by the Washington Post 's Walter Pincus , who reported on a multi - year contract just awarded to a private contractor by the Pentagon to supply " mentors to officials with Iraq 's Defense and Interior ministries [ who ] would ' advise , train [ and ] assist ... particular Iraqi officials . ' "
Had the Bush administration exhibited the slightest constraint , they might have constructed a far more cosmetic version of the permanent garrisoning of Iraq .
They might have officially turned the mega - bases over to the Iraqis and leased them back for next to nothing .
They could have let the stunning facts they had built on the ground speak for themselves .
They could have offered " joint commands " and other palliative remedies ( as they are now evidently considering doing ) that would have made their long - term sovereignty grab look far less significant -- without necessarily being so .
But their ability to strategize outside the ( Bush ) box has long been limited .
Think of them as " the me generation " on steroids , going global and imperial .
Or give them credit for consistency .
They 're mad dreamers who still can't wake up , even when they find themselves in a roomful of smelling salts .
Instead , with their secret SOFA negotiations , they 've attempted to fly under the radar screens of both the U.S. Congress and the Iraqi people .
They wanted to embed permanent bases and a long - term policy of occupation in Iraq in perpetuity without letting the matter rise to the level of a treaty .
( Hence , no advice and consent from the U.S. Senate . )
Not surprisingly , this episode , too , is threatening to end in debacle .
The Iraqi leadership is in virtual revolt .
Across the political spectrum , as Tony Karon of the Rootless Cosmopolitan blog has written , the negotiations have forced upon the Iraqis " a kind of snap survey or straw poll on the long - term U.S. presence , and goals for Iraq " from which the Americans are likely to emerge the losers .
The idea of timetables for American departure is again being floated in Iraq .
According to Reuters , " A majority of the Iraqi parliament has written to Congress rejecting a long - term security deal with Washington if it is not linked to a requirement that U.S. forces leave , " and unnamed American officials are now beginning to mutter about no SOFA deal being achieved before the Bush administration leaves office .
The administration 's man in Baghdad , Prime Minister Maliki , has declared the initial U.S. proposal at a " dead end " and has even begun threatening to ask American forces to leave when their UN mandate expires at year 's end .
( Though much of this may be bluff on his part , what choice does he have ?
Given Iraqi attitudes toward being garrisoned forever by the U.S. military , no Iraqi leader could remain in a position of even passing power and agree to such terms .
It would be like stamping and sealing your own execution order . )
The Sadrists are in the streets protesting the American presence and their leader has just called for a " new militia offensive " against U.S. forces .
The pro-Iranian , but American - backed , Badrists are outraged .
( " Is there sovereignty for Iraq -- or is n't there ?
If it is left to [ the Bush administration ] , they would ask for immunity even for the American dogs . " )
The Iranians are vehemently voting no .
Opinion in the region , whether Shiite or Sunni , seems to be following suit .
The U.S. Congress is up in arms , demanding more information and possibly heading for hearings on the SOFA agreement and the bases .
Presidential candidate Barack Obama has insisted that any deal be submitted to Congress , the very thing the Bush administration has organized for more than a year to avoid .
And miracle of all miracles , the mainstream media is finally writing about the bases as if they mattered .
Someday , before this is over , all of us may actually see what was built in our names with our dollars .
That will be a shock , especially when you consider what the Bush administration has proved incapable of building , or rebuilding , in New Orleans and elsewhere in this country .
In the meantime , the President appears headed for yet another self - inflicted defeat .

Cheap oil !
Get your cheap oil here !
Well , “ cheap ” may be pushing it .
But even as benchmark crude futures have soared above $ 130 per barrel , there ’s still oil out there for about $ 105 a barrel .
The bad news : it ’s nasty stuff .

The Marlin Company 14th Annual Attitudes in the American Workplace Poll reports the following results on June 24 .
More than one third ( 41 % ) of US workers are cutting back on utilities , nearly half have reduced food purchases ( 48.5 % ) and a large percentage are buying less clothing .
The national survey of US workers , conducted May 12 - 14 , 2008 , also found that younger workers ( between the ages of 18 to 29 ) are being hit the hardest by the economy and are the most desperate about their economic future .
More than one third ( 34.3 % ) of young American workers say their financial situation has caused them to “ feel hopelessness or despair about their economic future . ”
That compares with 28.8 % of workers age 30 to 49 , 23.5 % of workers 50 - 64 and 17.9 % of workers 65 or older .
Nearly a third ( 31.4 % ) of workers report being occasionally kept awake at night because they worry they will not meet housing payments , credit cards , or other personal expenses , 36.8 % of whom were between the ages of 18 and 29 .
And nearly one fourth ( 23.4 % ) of US workers say their financial situation has distracted them on the job , with the most distracted being young workers , age 18 to 29 ( 36.8 % ) .
“ US workers are hurting on multiple fronts , and their pain is growing , ” stated Kenna .
“ This year ’s poll clearly illustrates exactly how damaging the current state of the US economy is to its workers . ”
In particular , with gas prices topping $ 4 a gallon this summer , more than a quarter of workers ( 25.7 % ) are already choosing alternatives to driving into work – such as carpooling or public transportation ; 35.9 % were between the ages of 18 and 29 , with more females ( 32 % ) than males ( 23.1 % ) conserving .

When was the last time parents lived in the same world as their kids ?
While it may happen rarely , it is definitely not regular .
For instance , I am a high school senior .
I have had a PC since I was in 6th grade .
I program , talk to my friends ( both RL and Internet only ) over email , have premarital sex , deal with issues like homosexuality , AIDs , the shadow of Columbine , and watch DVDs .
My parents got a TV around 6th grade .
They fixed cars or typed , felt telephones were too impersonal , dealt with the Vietnam War , and flower power .
VCRs were n't around yet .
And yet they think they went through the same experience I did .
Add to that the fact they were a jock and a prep and you better believe they had a different experience than I .
It is called the Generation Gap and its huge .
The Roaring 20s generation had many differences with the WWII generation .
The WWII generation did n't get the Baby Boomers .
They do n't get Generation X and the current generation .
In the last 3 generations , TV , computers , CDs , the Internet , the pill , cell phones , pagers , rock n roll , punk , rap , techno , the electric guitar , civil rights for blacks , spaceships , and nuclear bombs , were invented .
Each has changed how we look at life .
And still parents believe they went through the same things as their kids .
My parents are bright .
My father was a jock , but at Boston Latin ( a magnet school in Boston ) , and both went to college .
Yet , they have little to no chance of understanding what my life is like outside our home .
And this is how it works .
Add to this that many parents do n't want to understand , but only wish to direct their children into the way they want them to grow up , and they use when I was your age to try to direct their kids towards their desired traits and all it shows is the parent 's cluelessness .
Sorry for the rantlike writeup .

Review by Duane Graveline MD MPH :
One might ask why , with the thousands of books that have been written about Alzheimer 's disease , I should choose this book by Henry Lorin , an obscure member of the health care team whose only claim to authority in this disease is to observe his step - father die before his eyes - of Alzheimer's .
This man is an independent researcher who has come on to a novel interpretation of the Alzheimer 's story .
After a comprehensive review of the literature he has focused on a compelling role for cholesterol insufficiency as the fundamental cause of this disease , excepting only those relatively few associated with heredity , trauma or debilitating conditions .
Since I am focused on the wide scale use of statin drugs , designed purely to decrease the synthesis of cholesterol , naturally I was attracted to his hypothesis .
He begins his story well :
There is a bias against cholesterol in the medical and medical research worlds , Lorin acknowledges .
This is parallel to the bias in the health and medical agencies of the government , in the health book publishing business , and in many parts of the food processing industry .
He understands why this bias exists .
It is because heart disease is a major killer of people in the industrialized nations and most importantly , it is because people have been conditioned to believe that heart disease is caused purely by cholesterol in the foods we eat .
Then Lorin acknowledges that cholesterol is not only the most important molecule in our bodies , it is practically the only one that is common to all of the different types of cell membranes in the organs and tissues .
Ordinarily the demand for cholesterol is high but under certain conditions demand exceeds supply introducing the second major actor in this Alzheimer 's play , amyloid .
All cells have a ready supply of amyloid in the form of amyloid prescursor protein .
When cholesterol is needed but cannot be supplied it is this amyloid that becomes an emergency , temporary filler .

The New York Times today put out a piece on this year ’s unexpected rise in home gardening .
Seed companies and garden shops say that not since the rampant inflation of the 1970s has there been such an uptick in interest in growing food at home .
George C. Ball Jr. , owner of the W. Atlee Burpee Company , said sales of vegetable and herb seeds and plants are up by 40 percent over last year , double the annual growth for the last five years .
“ You do n’t see this kind of thing but once in a career , ” he said .
Ball said this year ’s produce price spike is the main reason people are going back to the garden .
“ People are driving less , taking fewer vacations , so there is more time to garden . ”
With a big enough garden , people say you can take up to 30 % off your weekly grocery bill .
Inspired , I decided to start my own vegetable garden .
On the patio of my condo .
Clearly , I wo n’t be reaping the advantages of scale .
But I figure a few tomato and pepper plants will at least save me a little money .
In truth , it ’s looking kind of expensive .
Here ’s the price breakout .
2 potted tomato plants : $ 16 ( note to self : do not buy tomatoes at Whole Foods .
Or anything else , for that matter . )
3 potted bell pepper plants : $ 10
One potted basil plant : $ 4 ( Again , the high price comes from Whole Foods . )
Fertlilizer : $ 8
Soil : $ 5
Total costs : $ 43
Savings :
3 pepper plants .
Each pepper plant produces 15 peppers .
Cost to me : 38 cents per pepper .
Cost of organic peppers at the store : $ 2.39 each .
2 tomato plants .
Each plant produces 10 tomatoes , for a total of 20 tomatoes .
Cost to me : 80 cents per tomato .
Grocery cost for organic tomatoes : $ 1 per pound .
Grocery store cost : $ 20 ( assuming each tomato weighs a pound ) .
One basil plant , which is the equivalent of 2.5 packages of basil .
Cost to me : $ 4 .
Grocery store cost : $ 10 .
Total savings : $ 10 ( basil ) + $ 20 ( tomatoes ) + $ 35.85 ( peppers ) – $ 43 ( total costs of plants and supplies ) = $ 22.85 .
Not bad .
Not phenomenal , either .
After revising my math ( thank you , commenters ) , I found that the savings are good .
Of course , my yields could be bigger , or prices could once again increase by the time my veggies ripen .
Still , in the language of gardens , it looks like if you want to save significant amounts of money , plant seeds and go big .
Time for a real garden plot .
A British man who allegedly hacked into the Pentagon 's computer network should not be extradited to America because US prosecutors tried to intimidate him into cooperating with them , the House of Lords was told today .
Gary McKinnon , a systems analyst who faces up to 60 years in jail if his extradition goes ahead , was the victim of an abuse of process , the panel of five law lords was told .
The 44 - year - old is accused of causing £ 475,000 in damage by hacking into 97 computer systems operated by the Pentagon , Nasa and elsewhere in the US military .
McKinnon , a self - taught hacker who operated under the name Solo , admits accessing the computers but insists he only did so to try to find evidence for UFO landings , and that he was only able to gain access because of lax security .
His activities , described by British prosecutors in 2005 as the " biggest ever military computer hack " , were carried out using a low - speed dialup connection from a room in his girlfriend 's aunt 's house in Crouch End , north London .
McKinnon was first arrested in 2002 but has never been charged in the UK .
Last year , he lost a high court appeal against a government decision to grant his extradition to the US .
Addressing the Lords today , his lawyer , David Pannick QC , said McKinnon was told by US authorities that unless he agreed to plead guilty and to extradition he faced a much heavier jail sentence .
A US embassy legal official involved in the case had also quoted New Jersey authorities as saying they wanted to see McKinnon " fry " , said Pannick , an apparent reference to the electric chair .
It was " not in dispute " that a UK court had the power to turn down an extradition if it was thought there had been abuse of process , Pannick told the law lords .
" The US prosecutors sought to impose pressure on the appellant through his legal advisers to consent to extradition and plead guilty , " he said .
McKinnon was told that if he cooperated he would receive a jail sentence of between 37 and 46 months and would be repatriated to the UK for possible parole after half this time , the lawyer said .
" By contrast , the appellant 's representatives were told that if the appellant declined to cooperate , this sentence would be in the region of eight to 10 years , possibly longer , " Pannick said , adding that one threat was to treat the matter as a terrorism case , resulting in a possible 60 - year term .
US officials additionally said any transfer to the UK would also be ruled out if McKinnon fought extradition , Pannick told the law lords .
" This was pressure of an unacceptable degree , " he said .
A judgment is expected within three weeks .
“ We caught the whole thing on tape , so to speak , ” Dr. Soderberg said in an interview .
“ I truly won the astronomy lottery .
A star in the galaxy exploded right in front of my eyes . ”
She and 42 colleagues from around the world have now told the tale of this discovery in a paper in Nature to be published Thursday and in a telephone news conference Wednesday .
The observations , they say , provide a new window into the process by which the most massive stars end their lives and give astronomers new clues on how to look for these rare events and catch them while they are still in their most explosive , formative stages .
Most supernovas , Dr. Soderberg explained , are discovered and classified by their visible light , but that typically does not happen until the explosion is a month or more old and has brightened enough to be seen over intergalactic distances .
The true fireworks , she said , happen much earlier when a shock wave from the imploding core hits the star ’s surface , producing so - called breakout light , which lasts only a few minutes .
“ The physics of the explosion is encoded in the breakout light , ” Dr. Soderberg said , adding that the chance that the Swift telescope was observing during those moments was “ unfathomable . ”
Astronomers now know , however , that X - rays from the breakout can be an early alert .
“ Supernova 2008D was the first to be found from its X - ray emission , ” said Robert Kirshner , a supernova expert at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , referring to the supernova by its official name , “ but if we build the right type of X - ray satellites , it wo n’t be the last supernova we find this way . ”

Republican presidential candidate John McCain has called for a change in federal policy that would allow coastal states to choose whether to allow oil exploration in offshore waters .
The proposal did not go down well with most U.S. environmentalists .
The reaction of groups in lockstep with Democrats , such as the Sierra Club , was scathing .
But there was more in McCain ’s Houston speech than offshore drilling .
McCain reiterated his position that the U.S. must adopt a cap - and - trade plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
Anyone who thinks that ’s an easy sell in Texas should have been to the state Republican convention in Houston last weekend .
There , you would have heard earnest people insisting that sunspots are the cause of global warming .
McCain said that conservation is more than a personal virtue .
That was a clear rebuke of Vice President Dick Cheney , who in 2001 said that conservation may be virtuous but cannot be the sound basis of an energy policy .
Yes it can , Mr. Vice President .
It must .
Conservation is the foundation for shifting towards what McCain called an energy economy of “ new and cleaner power sources . ”
Finally , McCain reiterated his opposition to oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , a 19 million - acre Alaska nature reserve that was established by the Eisenhower administration in 1960 .
That ’s not an easy sell in Texas either .
In fact , it ’s not an easy sell for Republicans in most states .
In U.S. energy politics , the Arctic Refuge is the Holy Grail for both conservationists who want to keep America ’s largest wildlife sanctuary pristine and the pro-drilling crowd , which is moved to tears about the billions of barrels of oil thought to exist beneath the refuge ’s coastal plain .
Support for drilling “ AN - WAHR ” is de rigueur in many Republican circles .
It is common to hear drilling supporters , most of whom have n’t stepped within a thousand miles of the place , call the refuge a barren wasteland .
For those of us who have been privileged to visit the distant refuge , its silent beauty is extraordinary .
McCain ’s reason for bucking party orthodoxy on this issue is spot-on .
Drilling the Arctic refuge and other special places would be as awful as drilling the Grand Canyon or the Florida Everglades .
So why does McCain support more offshore drilling ?
Even if his plan were adopted now , there is no way it would add supplies anytime soon .
Many U.S. states do n’t want it .
California , for example , is very particular about protecting sugary beaches that draw hordes of spendthrift tourists .
And a worldwide shortage of the pricey rigs needed for deepwater drilling will hamper exploration for a few years yet .
There are a couple of reasons for the stance he has taken .
One is that McCain thought it important to send a signal to OPEC that the U.S. has other plans for meeting its energy needs besides begging the cartel ’s potentates to loosen the knobs a bit .
Another is the peculiar Electoral College system by which America elects its presidents .
Both McCain and Barack Obama must appeal to diverse constituencies in order to secure the 270 Electoral College votes necessary for election .
That ’s why Obama had kind things to say about coal when he visited the coal - mining states of West Virginia and Kentucky last month , even as his coal - hating environmental allies gnashed their teeth .
McCain is paddling a middle course on the environment that contrasts with both Obama on the left and current Republican dogma on the right .
It ’s a delicate exercise for McCain , who is trying to both build the diverse constituency he needs to win and to help his fellow Republicans rediscover their heritage as the party of Theodore Roosevelt .
Earthbag
Building with earthbags ( sometimes called sandbags ) is both old and new .
Sandbags have long been used , particularly by the military for creating strong , protective barriers , or for flood control .
The same reasons that make them useful for these applications carry over to creating housing : the walls are massive and substantial , they resist all kinds of severe weather ( or even bullets and bombs ) , and they can be erected simply and quickly with readily available components .
Burlap bags were traditionally used for this purpose , and they work fine until they eventually rot .
Newer polypropylene bags have superior strength and durability , as long as they are kept away from too much sunlight .
For permanent housing the bags should be covered with some kind of plaster for protection .
There has been a resurgence of interest in earthbag building since architect Nader Khalili , of the Cal - Earth Institute , began experimenting with bags of adobe soil as building blocks for creating domes , vaults and arches .
Khalili was familiar with Middle Eastern architecture and the use of adobe bricks in building these forms , so it was natural for him to imagine building in this way .
The Cal - Earth Institute has been training people with his particular techniques , and now the whole field has expanded considerably with further experimentation by his students and others .
I have taken Khalili's ideas of building with earthbags that are laid in courses with barbed wire between them , and come up with some hybrid concepts that have proven to make viable housing .
Instead of filling the bags with adobe soil , I have used crushed volcanic rock .
This creates a very well insulated wall ( about as good as strawbale ) that will never rot or be damaged by moisture .
As a covering for the earthbags I used papercrete ( see the papercrete page ) .
This worked to seal the bags from the sun and the weather , without necessarily creating a vapor barrier ... the walls remain breathable .
But papercrete may not be sufficiently durable or a good choice in warm and humid climates because mold could form on it .
A record percentage of Americans have used the internet to participate in the most closely - watched presidential election in decades , finds a newly - released survey from the non-partisan Pew Internet & American Life Project .
The spring 2008 survey finds that a record - breaking 46 percent of all Americans have used the internet , e-mail or cell - phone text messaging to participate in the political process .
The survey found that the internet is becoming an increasing part of the norm of political participation – people are using it to read the news , share their views , or to participate in some other process to get others to take political action .
" In this season , just the twelfth year of presidential politics online , there is no disputing the fact that the internet has moved from the periphery to the center of national politics , " write Aaron Smith , a research specialist and Lee Rainie , the Pew project 's director in the new survey .
Bloggers in general are having a huge impact on the course of election , but the kind of audio and video that they 're digging up is playing a significant role in driving the news cycle , the researchers write .
The Huffington Post ' recording of Barack Obama calling a portion of the electorate bitter over job losses and clinging to their guns and religion at a San Francisco fund - raiser is an example , they write .
" The event became a central narrative of the campaign heading into the Pennsylvania primary , " they write .
Other pivotal internet moments that the researchers point to : the online conversation and video - viewing of Obama 's former pastor the
Reverend Jeremiah Wright and his incendiary sermons ; and the controversy stirred up by blogger Bruce Wilson over the sermons of John Hagee , a preacher and televangelist .
John McCain severed his ties to Hagee after
Wilson posted audio of the preacher arguing that Hitler was an agent of
God .
Almost half of online adults have watched some kind of online political video , finds a new survey from the Pew Internet & American Life Project .

Those findings are particularly interesting given that the most popular political activity among those surveyed was the watching of videos .
" Some 47 percent of online adults have watched at least one type of online political video ( out of a list of five possible types of videos , ) " write the Pew researchers .
That amounts to 35 percent of all adults .
Overall , the surveyors found that just under a third of all internet users have participated in the online political process through a variety of means :
They either forwarded or wrote their own political commentary , signed online petitions , signed up with the campaigns themselves to receive information , forwarded online audio or video segments , or signed up to volunteer for events related to campaigns .
Fewer than one percent of those surveyed had created their own political video or audio recordings , the survey found .
In many ways , the survey 's numbers simply confirm anecdotal evidence of the nature of the online campaign so far .
For example , the authors of the survey write : " Simply put , Democrats and Obama backers are more in evidence on the internet than backers of other candidates or parties . "
Then they add : " Among Democrats , Obama 's supporters are more likely than Hillary Clinton 's supporters to be internet users – 82 % vs. 71 % . "
Unsurprisingly , the survey found that almost two thirds of Obama supporters get their political news and information on the internet , versus 56 % of McCain supporters .
Obama 's supporters are more politically active on online social networks , according to the Pew Internet & American Life Project .
* Data from : * The Pew Internet & American Life Project
The survey also finds that Obama supporters are more " more politically active social networking users than McCain supporters when the two candidates are compared head to head . "
At the same time as Americans ' use of the internet has grown in the political sphere , there 's also a healthy dose of skepticism .
Sixty percent of those surveyed , for example , agree with the statement that " The internet is full of misinformation and propaganda that too many voters believe is accurate . "
Thirty two percent disagreed with that .
A surprising 74 percent of those surveyed disagreed with the statement that they would not be as involved with the campaign if it were n't for the internet .
But age could be the factor that explains that finding .
When the Pew researchers broke that out among age groups , a larger portion of the younger groups of people tended to agree that the internet is important in helping them to stay active and connected with the campaigns .
The survey also finds that Americans are eager to view source materials for themselves – almost 40 percent of internet users and a third of all adults have gone online to read or watch unfiltered campaign material , such as archived debates , speeches and announcements and position papers .

The Pentagon has released footage of an air strike that Pakistan says killed 11 of its troops in the Mohmand frontier region .
The US said the footage proves that US forces were legitimately targeting pro-Taleban militants and its forces had acted in self - defence .
Pakistan 's military said earlier that the soldiers had died as a result of an " unprovoked and cowardly act " .

Yet South African President Thabo Mbeki continues to make excuses for Mr. Mugabe  who is more brutal than Ian Smith ever was  out of misplaced deference for a common history in the liberation struggle .
Zimbabweans suffered so much for so many decades from white racism that the last thing they need is excuses for Mr. Mugabe ’s brutality because of his skin color .
Life expectancy in Zimbabwe has already dropped from the low 60s to the high 30s .
It ’s true that he has created more trillionaires than any other country , but that ’s only because inflation may be as much as 10 million percent .
Anyone with $ 90 is a trillionaire in Zimbabwean dollars , and buying a small loaf of bread costs one billion Zimbabwean dollars .
When I grew up in the 1970s , a central truth was that Ian Smith was evil and Mr. Mugabe heroic .
So it was jolting on my last visit to Zimbabwe , in 2005 , to see how many Zimbabweans looked back on oppressive white rule with nostalgia .
They offered a refrain : “ Back then , at least parents could feed their children . ”
Africa ’s rulers often complain , with justice , that the West ’s perceptions of the continent are disproportionately shaped by buffoons and tyrants rather than by the increasing number of democratically elected presidents presiding over 6 percent growth rates .
But as long as African presidents mollycoddle Mr. Mugabe , they are branding Africa with his image .
Image Nicholas D. Kristof Credit ... Fred R. Conrad / The New York Times
To his credit , Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa has taken the lead in denouncing Mr. Mugabe ’s abuses , and Nelson Mandela bluntly deplored Mr. Mugabe ’s “ tragic failure of leadership . ”
Mr. Mandela could also have been talking about Mr. Mbeki ’s own failures .
The Internet : Killer Virus of the State
By Bill Frezza , Columnist
Our civic fabric is unraveling .
And as it does , uncontrolled , undigested and unmanaged information is spewing out .
Free reign is being given to a wild cornucopia of ideas and opinions that would never have passed into broad circulation filtered through the conformity of the old media .
Watch carefully as the various organs of state waken to the threat and fire up their immune systems .
Congress can enact all sorts of restrictions on strong encryption .
The FBI can hire thousands of informants to monitor Usenet groups .
Grandstanding senators can rail against electronic hate speech and digital pornography .
Local DAs can embark on witch hunts pursuing out - of - state bulletin board operators .
The Justice Department can declare war on computer companies that get too powerful to be allowed into the banking business .
The IRS can use pattern analysis to track electronic money launderers .
Even the U.S. Postal Service can get into the act , offering to " validate " e-mail : Today a service - tomorrow a requirement ?
But each assault on freedom - of - the - Net will breed 10 technical work - arounds .
Cybercrats can't outfox cypherpunks .
Let Gingrich and Gore hail the arrival of the information superhighway that " the people " can use to talk back to our " leaders . "
Their illusive dream of " participatory democracy " will be short - lived .
Because this highway does n't lead to Washington .
Networked computers and the torrent of information they carry are inherently decentralized , destabilizing , and uncontrollable - a virtual Ho Chi Minh trail of cyber - insurgency .
The information revolution will transform the politics of power just as surely as the broadcast media did 70 years ago .
Only this time , power will devolve back toward its sources , not inward toward demagogues seeking to gather it .
The Net will subvert the centralized economic and social control mechanisms that allowed the great welfare - warfare states [ 33 ] of the 20th century to dominate our commerce , our psychic landscape and even our definition of who we are .
Why do so many people reflexively see government as the solution to their problems ?
Why have we been herded into fractious groups with labels designed to instigate sound - bite wars ?
Who is relentlessly whipping us from crisis to crisis in an effort to focus our attention on whatever social policy initiative happens to top the agenda in Washington ?
Why have we , the citizens of the only nation [ 22 ] ever founded on the primacy of the individual , sunk into such habits of dependency that we can't think and act and take care of ourselves ?
What has made us so effete as a people ?
Could it have something to do with the way old media has dominated public discourse ?
From FDR 's fireside chats to Hitler 's propaganda machine to the dutiful White House press corps soaking up Bill Clinton 's " message of the day , " old media has been the handmaiden of the leviathan state [ 33 ] .
But not new media .
Watch what happens when " the people " break out of their herds and fan out across the Net in search of whatever discourse and ideas suit their own predilections .
Wait for the day when citizens , incessantly polled by leaders trying to jump out in front of each passing parade , do n't even bother answering the questions .
" Do you feel that your group is going to get its fair share of the booty your elected representatives plan to pilfer from that group ? "
Get lost .
I am an American , but my children will be free citizens of the Net .
They may reside in this country [ 22 ] or that , but their economic and social intercourse will effortlessly span the globe .
And their children will wonder in puzzlement at sovereign - centric concepts like a " national balance of trade " just as we would be perplexed if Connecticut passed punitive tariffs to stem the influx of goods from New Jersey .
And best of all , never again will a generation of youth be frog - marched off to die in foreign jungles in a decades - long media - manipulated clash of " national ideologies . "
War can go back to being a pointless local tribal affair , incomprehensible to all but the pitiable antagonists .
What if they gave a press conference and nobody came ?
We know your company uses open - source applications .
We also know many of you already have an open - source policy .
Sort of .
As CIO.com discovered when researching the adoption of open - source in enterprise IT , a quarter of respondents have a formal policy in place to control how such software is chosen , supported and deployed .
Another 18 percent expected to adopt such a policy in the next 12 months .
But those who have some kind of policy are n't necessarily thrilled with it ; just 45 percent said their policies are very effective .
" Somewhat effective " policies are like " somewhat effective " security ; clearly , there 's more to be learned .
CIO.com asked CIOs and other people in the trenches about what 's working — and what 's not working — with their open - source usage policies .
We found that most people do n't really have a formalized policy .
What they do have , though , are common concerns .
Considered carefully , these issues should help you get a handle on how to better manage open - source software in your company .
Once that 's out of the way , you 're in a better position to decide what you want in a formal policy that 's right for your own company .
While a company may not have a formal policy , for all practical purposes , many do have an open - source software acquisition and usage policy .
For example , Amy Begg De Groff , IT director for Maryland 's Howard County Library system , says the library does n't have a policy on software selection at all for open - source or proprietary software .
Instead , she writes , " We have an understanding that we will select the least expensive / most effective software to meet the needs we 've identified .
So , we focus a lot of energy on needs analysis .
Then we seek open source solutions first , because we have had such super success with open source solutions ( OpenOffice , Firefox , Apache , to name the few key ones . )
Each time , we 've found an open source product to meet our needs .
Then , we 've made sure it was an established product , with a large user / developer base and received good ' press ' and reviews . "
Formal ?
No .
But , there 's a clear policy here .
De Groff 's policy springs from that rarest of things : a mission statement that clearly states the organization 's goals : " Howard County Library uses a wide range of open source computer software in order to : expand access to library collections and services ; exceed customer expectations , and to contain hard costs for software licenses and computer hardware . "
Other small enterprises handle open - source deployment issues on an ad hoc basis .
Dayna DeLaVergne , director of IT for the H. E. Butt Foundation , a Christian charitable foundation , says his organization generally deals with open - source deployment questions by a discussion of IT personnel , and sometimes the end user , to see if the open - source application is an appropriate solution .
" We examine what needs to be accomplished and determine if the open - source solution can meet the need .
In addition to considering whether it can produce the desired end result , we consider whether the user is already familiar with traditional software of this type , features , ease of use , user reviews and the likelihood of the need for support , " says DeLaVergne .
Other IT executives are slowly moving to a more formal open - source usage policy .
Robert D. Hirsch , vice president and CIO of specialty tool vendor QEP freely admits , " We do not have a policy for open source today .
However , it is inevitable that we will need one .
Our younger developers have been brought up on open source and see it as a way to build and prototype applications quickly . "
Accidental Open- Source Developers
This touches on a side issue .
Your company may not be in the software business , but that does n't mean that your in - house developers are n't modifying open - source programs for your own internal use .
That 's not a problem by the rules of even the strictest open - source license .
But if you ship a product that contains modified open - source code , you 'll need to obey the license 's rules or face possible legal consequences .
Verizon , for example , ran afoul of this when it shipped wireless routers for its Fios ( fiber - optic service ) Internet that contained a GPL ( General Public License ) program .
Some corporate executives , such as David Allen , CTO at Sparta Consulting , an SAP consultantry , are already painfully aware of the potential trouble with using and developing open - source software .
" I am a big fan of open source , use it every day , but I 'm concerned that too many CIOs do not have an adequate grasp on their responsibilities with the various licenses that we generically describe as open source .
As a new CTO , I have taken the responsibility of creating our IP development standards / policies .
Beware of trying to walk the line between ' use ' and ' development . '
The line between configuration and extension or development is fuzzy at best . "
To avoid this kind of misstep , and to make sure that authorized in - house programs are green - lighted before going into production , Hirsch says his company plans to have its policy " state that open source can be used for experimentation , prototyping and investigative application development without permission .
However , any production designed applications or utilities will require an approval by the CTO / CIO and the business owner before open source can be used in a production environment . "
So long as you use any customized open - source software in - house , Gordon Haff , principal IT advisor for the Illuminata Group , does n't see too much for companies to worry about .
" Anecdotally , when I 'm in an end user audience , I do n't see much interest in or knowledge of open source software licensing nuances and issues .
And , truth be told , for a lot of end users , it does n't matter much .
If you 're strictly an end user developing software for your own internal use , you can use pretty much any open source software you like without knowing or caring about the differences between GPL v2 and BSD . "
Managing Software
Making proper use of open - source software is the central concern for most companies and organizations .
Alan Young , CIO of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe , is focused on coming up with a viable open - source deployment policy .
" Given the budget pressures that IT faces and the business objectives , sometimes it makes good sense to think about open - source applications , but the road is fraught with scary consequences . "
Among the concerns that Young plans to address are :
What is the formal organization behind the open - source entity ?
Are they organized ?
Are they a one - man show ?
" I prefer the more organized [ approach ] where ' donations ' can be made for support of source , " says Young .
What is the release schedule for source code ?
Does the open - source project have a life that makes sense ?
Like more than one month or one year ?
" I would prefer three to five years at least , " says Young , " since some of the development is a balance - sheet item . "
Is there a maintenance / support plan for the open - source project ?
Points out Young , " Once you deploy open source into your enterprise you have to keep up with operating system , hardware configuration changes , database changes and the like . "
After all , as Young observes , for all open - source benefits , " If the project dies , guess who 's left holding the bag ?
Me ! "
That 's a position no CIO ever wants to be in .
On a larger scale , Roger Valade , vice president of technology for Entertainment , the company behind the Entertainment Book marketing program , says the company has effectively adopted a number of open - source components , " providing both significant cost savings and environmental standardization . "
Entertainment 's open - source philosophy is purely practical : " Our policy right now is 'use it whenever you can — it is a productivity improvement .
Do n't code what you can download . '
Sometimes we have battles ( Hibernate vs. iBatis ) [ Both are services to make it easier for programmers to connect objects with database queries ] and that is when it gets interesting . "
In the future , Entertainment plans on refining its open - source strategy by developing a policy that considers such things as existing skill set , availability of training , availability and cost of outside resources , strength of the user community and appropriate cost model .
Says Valade , " To a large degree this is a subset of the portfolio management initiative with a specific focus on open source given both its popularity , subtlety and long - term impact . "
John Rafuse , executive VP at HeavyLifters Network , a Canadian - based business and IT consulting firm , would agree with Valade .
Rafuse sees open - source software management as being " exactly the same as controlling any software asset . "
To track HeavyLifter 's software use , Rafuse uses the open - source program The Verified Software Repository .
Closed or open , Rafuse believes that companies can save huge amounts of time and money by using a shared repository .
If they do n't , he says , " I saw in one instance that they had built no less than 12 case management systems instead of having a central code base and manipulating it for their needs . "
Several other people CIO spoke with made the same point :
Open - source software is n't a special case , and overall software management is what 's really key to any enterprise .
In particular , several mentioned Spiceworks , another open - source software inventory and management program , as being quite helpful in cutting costs and helping bring management order to software use .
For the most part , though , companies seem to be making their open - source policies as they go along .
Jay Lyman , an open - source analyst for The 451 Group , sees companies with open - source champions creating more formal open - source software policies : " Those organizations that do n't have champions — or perhaps their champions are n't as far along , as experienced or as comfortable as other champions — would fall into the category of ' make it up as you go . ' "
Lyman continues , " We do see organizations attempting to apply traditional software and licensing policies and procedures to open source , but free and open - source software and its licensing are very unique and have more significant implications on things such as development model , business model , etc .
So , open source really needs its own dedicated approach to get the most out of it .
Here again , the champions tend to know how to go about it , and the organizations that have them are most likely to benefit .
This " make it up as you go along " approach to managing open - source software concerns Douglas " Dougie " Stevenson .
Enterprise Monitoring SME ( subject - matter expert ) at Savvis , a SaaS ( software - as - a - service ) vendor .
Stevenson points out , " You put controls on what goes into production based upon how IT is going to support the services , what the application provides and what it does in your environment .
Open source still needs to have user training / orientation , you still need to field issues with it and you still need to adapt it to your business needs . "
So what does all this mean ?
Open - source management policies deal with the same issues over and over again , whether they 're written up in a formal statement or ( as is far more likely ) is the collected wisdom of IT executives and staffers .
These include :
Project stability : Can you trust the project to be there when you need it ?
Project support : Can you get support when you need it ?
Internal software management :
Does your company know what open - source programs it 's using ?
How it 's developing and deploying them both in - house and to customers ?
In general , companies do not appear to be handling these issues in a formal manner .
Some of them , perhaps for the best , are incorporating open - source software management into general software management .
As long as these companies avoid producing software for external use and avoid such traps as producing devices that include such programs , this approach should work .
In any case , CIOs should set up a framework to answer these common open - source concerns .
That alone will take you a long way toward having an open - source policy that will work both for you and your company .

Watch a spiny anteater reveal its bendy penis with four heads
The bizarre sex life of the spiny anteater has been exposed by researchers – the male ejaculates using only one half of its penis .
New findings about the creature ’s sex life may seem salacious but they could help shed light on an evolutionary mystery .
It seems that the way the mammal ejaculates is similar to the way reptiles do – by shutting down one side of its penis before secreting semen from the other side .
Reptiles have a pair of male members called hemipenes for sex , and they use only one of the two during each act of copulation .
The spiny anteater ( Tachyglossus aculeatus ) , also known as the short - beaked echidna , is a primitive mammal found in Australia and New Guinea .
Like the platypus , it is a monotreme , laying eggs instead of bearing live young .
Monotremes have many features in common with reptiles , and the hope is that by studying them , scientists may find clues as to how mammals evolved .

The spiny anteater , however , is notoriously difficult to observe in the wild and shows little enthusiasm for breeding in captivity , so nobody had managed to observe them ejaculate before .
Four - headed phallus
Then Steve Johnston of the University of Queensland in Gatton , Australia , and his colleagues inherited a male spiny anteater that was not so shy .
The creature had been retired ’ from a zoo as it produced an erection when being handled at public viewing sessions .
By filming this animal , the researchers have been able to describe the unique spiny anteater erection and ejaculation behaviour for the first time .
The spiny anteater ’s four - headed phallus had been puzzling scientists .
“ When we tried to collect semen by [ electrically - stimulated ejaculation ] before , not only did we not get a single drop , but the whole penis swelled up to a four - headed monster that would n’t fit the female reproductive tract , which has only two branches , ” says Johnston .
“ Now we know that during a normal erection , two heads get shut down and the other two fit , ” he told New Scientist .
The heads used are swapped each time the mammal has sex .

The evolutionary significance of one - sided ejaculation is unknown , but may play a role in sperm competition – where sperm from many males may compete to fertilise an egg .
Indeed in the spiny anteater , up to 11 males may form a queue behind one female to copulate with her .
The researchers have also observed that hundreds of sperm team up to form bundles that swim much faster than individual sperm in the spiny anteater ’s semen – another possible adaptation for sperm competition .
“ We can now study echidna sperm much better , which should offer fascinating insights into the evolution of mammals ” , says Russell Jones from the University of Newcastle in New South Wales , who first dissected sperm bundles from dead echidna in the 1980s .

Evangelicals say people often see them as Bible - banging , evolution - hating caricatures .
An estimated 75 million Americans are evangelicals , people who emphasize a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and commit to spreading the message of salvation through his redemptive death .
Where do I start here ?
It sounds like evangelicals feel that they have been misunderstood , stereotyped , and even persecuted .
But they control the American government !
The Bush administration has catered to them in a way now previous administration has ( and with disastrous consequences ) .
How bad can public perceptions be when one of theirs is still in the Oval Office and faith - based programs throughout the country receive federal funding ?
According to Peter Berger , a Boston University sociologist , educated Americans look down on evangelicals .
Well , yes .
Educated Americans do tend to look down on bigotry , whether it is directed at homosexuals , women , ethnic or racial minorities , or even atheists .
How is this a bad thing ?
The crux of the evangelical persecution claim is that there is room for everyone but them under the banner of tolerance .
The problem with this claim is that they re trying to have it both ways - practicing intolerance while whining that we refuse to tolerate their intolerance !
Absolutely !
When they show up on our doorstep waving their bible or try to force our schools to teach manufactured controversy as science , we take notice .
If their complaint is that not all evangelicals are like this , then it is time for those evangelicals to take a stand against those among them who are engaging in door - to - door proselytizing and promoting intelligent design .
Personally , I think a large - scale study of American evangelicals is a good idea .
However , it is disappointing to see that it will be carried out by a research team that includes only Christians .
One , Timothy Shah , is even described as an evangelical .
Worse , his goal involves creating " more room for a religious perspective in various academic disciplines . "
So much for anything scientific here .
If it is true , as Shah claims , that the American culture makes fun of evangelical Christians , we should ask why .
And there is our answer .
Evangelicals believe that they have a " personal relationship " with someone who has been dead for over 2,000 years , if he lived at all , and they want to tell you about it .
This is why they are mocked .
I want to be very clear on what I am about to say so there are no misunderstandings .
Evangelical Christians are ridiculed because of the absurdity of their beliefs and not because of who they are or even what group with which they are identified .
I 'll say it again - evangelicals are mocked because of what they believe .
The fact that what they believe has the label of religion attached to it does not make it immune from criticism or mockery .

As part of his national service agenda which he revealed in speech given in Colorado Springs , CO , Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama called for increasing the military by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines .
“ In this young century , our military has answered when called , even as that call has come too often .
Through their commitment , their capability , and their courage they have done us all proud , ” Obama said .
“ But we need to ease the burden on our troops , while meeting the challenges of the 21st century .
That ’s why I will call on a new generation of Americans to join our military , and complete the effort to increase our ground forces by 65,000 soldiers and 27,000 Marines .
A call to service must be backed by a sacred trust with anyone who puts on the uniform of the United States .
A young person joining our military must know that we ’ll only send them into harm ’s way when we absolutely must , ” Obama continued .
If the Obama is going to end the Iraq war , then why do we need to increase the size of the military ?
It does n’t make much sense .
I know he is trying to appeal to the military vote with this proposal , but it seems to go against what he said he would do during the primaries .

Plus if Obama also carries out some of his proposals , such as more than tripling the size of the AmeriCorps to 250,000 , this might hurt military recruitment by creating a non-military domestic option for young people to earn education benefits .
Obama also proposed doubling the size of the Peace Corps by 2011 and a $ 4,000 tax credit for college students who complete 100 hours of community service in a year .
According to government statistics , about 26.7 % of American adults currently volunteer , with the highest percentage ( 35 % ) being through religious organizations .
Volunteering is a great way to participate in your local community .
Although I disagree with his plan to increase the size of the military , anything that would encourage people to be more active in their local communities is fine with me .

Coffee protects women against heart disease - but not men
Coffee can protect against heart disease , a study has found - but only in women .
Scientists found women who drink two to three cups a day are 25 per cent less likely to die from the disease than those who abstain .
But they are at a loss to explain why coffee appeared to have no effect on death rates for men .
The study contradicted fears that coffee is bad for the health .
Drinking as much as six cups a day did not raise the risk of premature death in either sex .
Women who drink two to three cups of coffee a day are 25 per cent less likely to die from heart disease , according to a U.S. study
The U.S. research , published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine , looked at 84,000 women between 1980 and 2004 , and nearly 42,000 men between 1986 and 2004 .
The volunteers filled in questionnaires about their coffee habits and health every two to four years .
Women who drank two or three cups of full - strength coffee a day were 25 per cent less likely to die of heart disease during the study , compared with women who drank no coffee .
They were also 18 per cent less likely to die from something other than cancer or heart disease .
The research found no link between coffee drinking and cancer .
Those who drank decaffeinated coffee also had lower death rates than those who abstained .
The scientists were unsure whether the coffee itself was cutting the risk of dying prematurely - or whether something else in the lifestyle of female coffee drinkers protects them .
Study author Dr Esther Lopez - Garcia said : ' Coffee consumption has been linked to various beneficial and detrimental health effects , but data on its relation with death were lacking .
' Coffee consumption was not associated with a higher risk of mortality in middle - aged men and women .
' The possibility of a modest benefit of coffee consumption on heart disease , cancer , and other causes of death needs to be further investigated . '
Coffee contains antioxidants and tannins which are good for the heart and arteries .
Past studies have suggested it can also be good for the liver and help reduce the risk of asthma attacks .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush will soon veto the $ 289 billion U.S. farm bill , a White House spokesman said Wednesday , despite signs Congress will override the veto to enact the bill into law .
Congress formally delivered the bill to the White House on Tuesday .
“ The veto will be soon , ” said spokesman Scott Stanzel .
The five - year bill would boost nutrition , land stewardship and biofuels programs .
Bush says it fails to reform subsidies to multimillionaire farmers at a time of high farm income and rising grocery prices .
Leaders of the House and Senate Agriculture committees say they have the votes for an override , which could be completed this week .
A stopgap extension of some Agriculture Department programs expires on Friday , adding to the impetus for action .
To carry out an override , each chamber must call a new vote and pass the bill by a two - thirds majority .
The House passed the farm bill 318- 106 and the Senate vote was 81 - 15 last week .
The omnibus farm bill is nearly eight months overdue .
It raises subsidy rates for wheat and soybeans and would deny one type of farm subsidy to the wealthiest Americans .
Alongside traditional subsidies , the bill creates an optional “ revenue protection ” program for grain , cotton and oilseed farmers that the administration says could cost billions of dollars .
Active Record Screencasts : The Pragmatic Programmers Get Into Screencasting
By Peter Cooper
The Pragmatic Programmers ( who brought us the " Pickaxe " ) have decided to branch into screencasting with Pragmatic Screencasts .
At launch , screencasts for Expression Engine , OS X Core Animation , Erlang , and Rails are available .
On the Rails front , Ryan Bates ( of Railscasts fame ) has been brought on board to create a series called " Everyday Active Record . "
So far two episodes , each focusing on a different area of Rails / Active Record , are available ( at $ 5 each ) but more are promised over time .
The first two episodes are " Designing Models with Associations " and " Finding and Scoping Models . "
I 've watched both and they do a great job of taking a chunk of Active Record / Rails functionality and demonstrating the " right " way to use it .
Ryan 's vast experience makes the screencasts good demonstrations of how to use Rails " properly . "
The screencasts are certainly not for anybody who follows Rails Edge like a hawk and keeps on top of everything Rails , but for those who'd like to gain extra confidence from seeing a Rails master at work with Rails 2.1 's features , they 're a bargain .
They 're well produced , go along at a nice pace , and Ryan makes a good narrator .
I look forward to seeing more from this series in future .
Definitely consider checking them out , especially if you want to support Ryan for the hard work he does with Railscasts .
It 's also worth noting that the Pragmatic Programmers are also looking for other people ( see bottom question ) who might be interested in working with them to produce more screencasts .
They do the post - production and pay 50 % royalties .

Yesterday I discussed how the halo effect , which causes people to see all positive characteristics as correlated — for example , more attractive individuals are also perceived as more kindly , honest , and intelligent — causes us to admire heroes more if they 're super - strong and immune to bullets .
Even though , logically , it takes much more courage to be a hero if you 're not immune to bullets .
Furthermore , it reveals more virtue to act courageously to save one life than to save the world .
( Although if you have to do one or the other , of course you should save the world . )
" The police officer who puts their life on the line with no superpowers " , I said , " reveals far greater virtue than Superman , who is a mere superhero . "
But let 's be more specific .
John Perry was a New York City police officer who also happened to be an Extropian and transhumanist , which is how I come to know his name .
John Perry was due to retire shortly and start his own law practice , when word came that a plane had slammed into the World Trade Center .
He died when the north tower fell .
I did n't know John Perry personally , so I cannot attest to this of direct knowledge ; but very few Extropians believe in God , and I expect that Perry was likewise an atheist .
Which is to say that Perry knew he was risking his very existence , every week on the job .
And it 's not , like most people in history , that he knew he had only a choice of how to die , and chose to make it matter — because Perry was a transhumanist ; he had genuine hope .
And Perry went out there and put his life on the line anyway .
Not because he expected any divine reward .
Not because he expected to experience anything at all , if he died .
But because there were other people in danger , and they did n't have immortal souls either , and his hope of life was worth no more than theirs .
I did not know John Perry .
I do not know if he saw the world this way .
But the fact that an atheist and a transhumanist can still be a police officer , can still run into the lobby of a burning building , says more about the human spirit than all the martyrs who ever hoped of heaven .
So that is one specific police officer ...
... and now for the superhero .
As the Christians tell the story , Jesus Christ could walk on water , calm storms , drive out demons with a word .
It must have made for a comfortable life : Starvation a problem ?
Xerox some bread .
Do n't like a tree ?
Curse it .
Romans a problem ?
Sic your Dad on them .
Eventually this charmed life ended , when Jesus voluntarily presented himself for crucifixion .
Being nailed to a cross is not a comfortable way to die .
But as the Christians tell the story , Jesus did this knowing he would come back to life three days later , and then go to Heaven .
What was the threat that moved Jesus to face this temporary suffering followed by eternity in Heaven ?
Was it the life of a single person ?
Was it the corruption of the church of Judea , or the oppression of Rome ?
No : as the Christians tell the story , the eternal fate of every human went on the line before Jesus suffered himself to be temporarily nailed to a cross .
But I do not wish to condemn a man who is not truly so guilty .
What if Jesus — no , let 's pronounce his name correctly : Yeishu — what if Yeishu of Nazareth never walked on water , and nonetheless defied the church of Judea established by the powers of Rome ?
Would that not deserve greater honor than that which adheres to Jesus Christ , who was only a mere messiah ?
Alas , somehow it seems greater for a hero to have steel skin and godlike powers .
Somehow it seems to reveal more virtue to die temporarily to save the whole world , than to die permanently confronting a corrupt church .
It seems so common , as if many other people through history had done the same .
Comfortably ensconced two thousand years in the future , we can levy all sorts of criticisms at Yeishu , but Yeishu did what he believed to be right , confronted a church he believed to be corrupt , and died for it .
Without benefit of hindsight , he could hardly be expected to predict the true impact of his life upon the world .
Relative to most other prophets of his day , he was probably relatively more honest , relatively less violent , and relatively more courageous .
If you strip away the unintended consequences , the worst that can be said of Yeishu is that others in history did better .
( Epicurus , Buddha , and Marcus Aurelius all come to mind . )
Yeishu died forever , and — from one perspective — he did it for the sake of honesty .
Fifteen hundred years before science , religious honesty was not an oxymoron .
As Sam Harris said :
" It is not enough that Jesus was a man who transformed himself to such a degree that the Sermon on the Mount could be his heart 's confession .
He also had to be the Son of God , born of a virgin , and destined to return to earth trailing clouds of glory .
The effect of such dogma is to place the example of Jesus forever out of reach .
His teaching ceases to become a set of empirical claims about the linkage between ethics and spiritual insight and instead becomes a gratuitous , and rather gruesome , fairy tale .
According to the dogma of Christianity , becoming just like Jesus is impossible .
One can only enumerate one 's sins , believe the unbelievable , and await the end of the world . "
I severely doubt that Yeishu ever spoke the Sermon on the Mount .
Nonetheless , Yeishu deserves honor .
He deserves more honor than the Christians would grant him .
But since Yeishu probably anticipated his soul would survive , he does n't deserve more honor than John Perry .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Contact : ( 202 ) 675-2312 or media@dcaclu.org
Washington , DC – Following a vote in the House of Representatives sanctioning warrantless wiretapping and handing immunity to telecommunications companies for their role in domestic spying , the American Civil Liberties Union expressed outrage at representatives who voted for the unconstitutional legislation .
The bill , H.R. 6304 , or The FISA Amendments
Act of 2008 , passed the chamber by a vote of 293 - 129 , and is expected to be voted on in the Senate next week .
The following may be attributed to Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU ’s Washington Legislative Office :
" It ’s Christmas morning at the White House thanks to this vote .
The House just wrapped up some expensive gifts for the administration and their buddies at the phone companies .
Watching the House fall to scare tactics and political maneuvering is especially infuriating given the way it stood up to pressure from the president on this same issue just months ago .
In March we thought the House leadership had finally grown a backbone by rejecting the Senate ’s FISA bill .
Now we know they will not stand up for the Constitution .
" No matter how often the opposition calls this bill a ‘ compromise , ’ it is not a meaningful compromise , except of our constitutional rights .
The bill allows for mass , untargeted and unwarranted surveillance of all communications coming in to and out of the United States .
The courts ’ role is superficial at best , as the government can continue spying on our communications even after the FISA court has objected .
Democratic leaders turned what should have been an easy FISA fix into the wholesale giveaway of our Fourth Amendment rights .
" More than two years after the president ’s domestic spying was revealed in the pages of the New York Times , Congress ’ fury and shock has dissipated to an obedient whimper .
After scrambling for years to cover their tracks , the phone companies and the administration are almost there .
This immunity provision will effectively destroy Americans ’ chance to have their deserved day in court and will kill any possibility of learning the extent of the administration ’s lawless actions .
The House should be ashamed of itself .
The fate of the Fourth Amendment is now in the Senate ’s hands .
We can only hope senators will show more courage than their colleagues in the House . "

Alabama US
Attorney denies any involvement in university editor 's termination
This ' case is definitely about the first amendment , ' says Harper 's journalist
The abrupt dismissal of a veteran University of Alabama employee who blogged about the firing of seven US Attorneys has added a bizarre new twist to allegations that the state 's US Attorneys targeted political opponents for prosecution .
Roger Shuler -- a high - profile blogger and leading critic of Alabama 's judicial system -- has written extensively about alleged corruption among U.S. Attorneys for over a year .
In particular , Shuler focused on two US Attorneys from his home state : Alice H. Martin of the Northern District and Leura G. Canary of the Middle District .
An editor in the University of Alabama Birmingham publications office for the last 12 years and a university employee for 19 , Shuler was placed on administrative leave May 7 and formally fired May 19 .
" I had worked there for 19 years and never received anything but positive performance reviews , " Schuler wrote RAW STORY in May .
" I never received an oral warning about anything .
Then I was fired without warning , contrary to university policy and almost certainly in violation of federal law . "
Though he admits he can't prove it , Shuler believes that he was fired for criticizing Alice Martin and other high - ranking political players in Alabama , including Canary , and Alabama 's Republican governor , Bob Riley .
He 's not alone .
Scott Horton , a journalist for Harper 's Magazine and a professor at Columbia University who has written extensively about the US Attorney scandal , also believes Shuler 's firing was politically fueled .
" Shuler 's problem arose not because he blogged nor because he did so from his workplace , because it 's clear he didn't , " says Horton , who has been following both the Siegelman and Shuler 's cases closely .
" His problem came from the fact that he wrote critical , well received insights targeting a number of very powerful figures in Alabama , starting with U.S. Attorney Alice Martin and prominent Republicans with which she is aligned , and including a number of major figures in the Alabama media . "
Political Prosecutions
Questions about the politicization of the US Department of Justice emerged in 2007 , after seven US Attorneys were fired with little or no official pretext , kindling a national firestorm that eventually prompted both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to investigate .
Shuler , a 51 - year - old resident of Shelby County , began blogging on the scandal in spring 2007 , particularly as it impacted Alabama and its former Democratic governor , Don Siegelman .
Siegelman was convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to seven years in prison in 2006 .
He had served nearly a year of his sentence by Mar. 27 , 2008 , when an appeals court overruled the lower court decision to hold him pending appeal .
As Raw Story Investigates revealed late last year , Siegelman was indicted on questionable charges brought by US Attorney Leura Canary , a Bush appointee with a direct relationship to former White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Karl Rove .
Leura Canary is the wife of Rove 's longtime friend and former business partner Bill Canary , who also advised the 2002 gubernatorial campaign of Siegelman 's Republican opponent , Bob Riley .
Riley currently serves as the governor of Alabama .
Alabama Republican attorney and longtime GOP opposition researcher Dana Jill Simpson alleges that Rove had a hand in Siegelman 's fall .
Legal Schnauzer
Shuler 's initial goal as a blogger -- at his personal blog , Legal Schnauzer -- was to expose the corruption of a local lawyer and his allies in the local judiciary , he says .
His posts decried the tactics of Alice Martin , US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama .
Martin attempted unsuccessfully to prosecute Don Siegelman for allegations of attempted bid-rigging in 2004 , only to have the case dismissed with prejudice .
Shuler also sought Martin's help in her capacity as a federal prosecutor .
In the summer of 2007 , he complained in writing to Martin about alleged federal crimes by lawyers and judges in the Northern District .
Shuler has accused Martin of deliberately dragging her feet on the investigation to protect political allies .
Shuler asserted that Martin was guilty of the same types of abuses of her official position that she and Canary had so vigilantly policed when they attempted to convict Siegelman and other Democratic elected officials in Alabama , including senior members of the state senate .
A stalwart Republican , Martin has made no secret of her ambitions to hold statewide elected office .
Her political career officially began in 1997 , when she was appointed by Republican Gov. Fob James to fill a vacancy on the Lauderdale County Circuit Court .
She ran unsuccessfully for reelection as a Republican in 1998 .
Two years later , Martin ran for a seat on the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and lost .
President George W. Bush appointed Martin US Attorney for the Northern District in 2001 , at the recommendation of Alabama 's two Republican Senators , Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby .
Martin 's critics say she 's used the power of subpoena to further the Alabama Republican Party 's electoral goals .
During her term , she has shown a particular zeal for rooting out alleged corruption at colleges and universities .
She 's currently engaged in a frontal assault on state legislators who also draw a salary from the state 's 2 - year college system .
Martin has subpoenaed at least a dozen legislators , the majority of them Democrats .
Martin says Shuler 's allegations do n't fall under her office 's purview .
" Mr. Shuler has made , in writing and in person , numerous allegations against various individuals to my office which , if memory serves deals with civil litigation , " she wrote in an email to RAW STORY Wednesday .
" Many of his allegations are set forth on his blog . "
" The US Attorney , when receiving complaints , refers them to an appropriate federal or investigative agency , as we do not investigate cases , " she added .
" His complaints were forwarded to the US Postal Inspection Service , as I advised him in my email , as he asserted the mails were involved .
He was also advised to contact the Alabama Bar Association .
He met with an Assistant US Attorney and presented no evidence of an offense , only has opinions , [ and was referred to agencies ] that could conduct an independent investigation .
I have no knowledge of him contacting those agencies . "
She also denied her office was in any way involved with Shuler 's termination .
" There has been no contact by the office to Mr Shuler 's employer , " she wrote .
Shuler , a journalist by training , has published numerous original investigative reports on Martin , Gov. Bob Riley , and both Leura and Bill Canary .
Riley also has close ties to Alice Martin .
In 2007 , whistleblower Dana Jill Simpson testified before the House Judiciary Committee that she heard Canary promise Gov. Riley that " his girls " would take care of Siegelman .
Canary's " girls " were his wife , Leura Canary , and Alice Martin .
He 's also president ex officio of the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama , and a frequent target of Shuler 's barbs .
Shuler 's blog - based reporting on the Siegelman prosecution and other high - profile cases has won him recognition in Alabama and beyond .
Last month , Shuler was cited as an authority in an appeal filed by attorneys for prominent Mississippi Democrat Paul Minor , whom Shuler has defended as a victim of politically - motivated prosecution .
Shuler 's reporting has also attracted interest from national media , including Scott Horton of Harper 's Magazine , Raw Story , author Mark Crispin Miller and Jay Allbritton of AOL News .
Prior to his dismissal , Shuler appeared on a local TV news segment about bloggers and the Siegelman case .
Like many bloggers , Shuler vociferously expresses his opinions .
His posts offer scathing headlines , such as a five - part series on Alice Martin titled " A Corrupt Bushie in Alabama " -- a sequel to a three - part series , " The Malice of Alice , " which Shuler published shortly after " Alice Martin : Outlaw Woman . "
" How would you define an outlaw ?
I would say it 's a person who operates outside the law and gets away with it , " Shuler wrote on Apr. 24 , " By that definition , Alice Martin , U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama , is an outlaw .
Comforting thought for those of us who live in Martin 's district . "
" Is it possible that Alice Martin is the worst U.S. attorney in American history ? "
Shuler asked in a April 8 post titled " Alice Martin : Bad to the Bone . "
The Firing
The former University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) employee started to become suspicious that he was being targeted for his opinions in late 2007 , when his supervisor , Pam Powell , began what he calls a " harassment campaign " against him shortly after having given him a positive performance review .
He says he found Powell 's sudden change in attitude bizarre , because they had had a good working relationship for the past 12 years .
On Apr. 15 , Shuler received a strange comment on his personal blog from an anonymous user , threatening to report him to his superiors for blogging on university time .
" Schnauzer does your employer UAB know you blog at work , " the anonymous commenter wrote .
In fact , Shuler was on vacation that day .
It 's not clear how the anonymous commenter knew that Shuler worked for UAB .
Shuler never identified himself on his blog as a UAB employee but did describe himself as a " university editor " on the masthead of his blog .
Shuler wrote under his real name and identified himself as a resident of greater Birmingham , so it would n't have been difficult to figure out that he worked for UAB .
According to Shuler , his immediate supervisor Pam Powell , Director of Publications , called him in into her office Apr. 15 and gave him a verbal warning for filling out a leave request form and leaving it on her chair the previous Friday afternoon instead of asking her for permission .
Shuler says Powell had given him conditional permission to take Monday off .
She was out of the office by the time Shuler left work that day , so he filled out the form and left it on her chair , as he'd done many times before .
Shuler 's official termination letter from University of Alabama Associate Vice President Dale Turnbough , dated May 19 , says , " You were verbally counseled on April 15 , 2008 , for failure to seek authorization for time off and for failure to document work time in our billing system .
During this counseling session you displayed belligerent and threatening behavior towards your supervisor and received a written warning for your actions . "
Shuler denies that he threatened Powell when she spoke to him about vacation time and billing .
He also denies violating any UAB policies .
" I 've never had a client claim I overbilled them or falsified their billing in any way , " he wrote in his official grievance protesting his dismissal .
" Pam Powell approves our billing , and she reviews our timesheets .
If I had done anything wrong in timekeeping , it would have been with her blessing . "
Believing Powell had made unfounded accusations about his job performance , Shuler arranged a meeting with Turnbough to discuss his concerns on Apr. 22 .
Shuler says he raised the issue of his blog in the meeting but was assured that it was n't a problem .
Shuler filed a written grievance against Powell the same day .
On Apr. 24 , an anonymous commenter threatened Shuler : " Yours is coming sooner rather than later . "
Google , the company that owns Blogger , refused RAW STORY requests for IP information that might be used to pinpoint the source of these threats .
The official letter of dismissal explains Shuler 's firing as a result of an IT review of his work computer .
According to the dismissal letter , Shuler 's computer logs showed that he averaged nearly 3 hours a day of " non-work related " online activities , including research for his blog .
The letter also cites insubordination , unauthorized use of vacation time , and unspecified inaccuracies in filling out his electronic timesheets .
But Shuler says that at the closed - door hearing , Sean Maher , a university IT staffer who had investigated Shuler 's computer for policy violations supported Shuler 's assertion that he never updated his blog at work .
" A representative from UAB IT testified at the hearing that his investigation showed I had never written anything on my blog from UAB equipment , " Shuler said .
" I have printed news items , things to keep for my story - ideas file -- and they are claiming that was non -work related activity .
In fact , keeping up with such news items is a part of my job description . "
Maher did not respond to requests for comment .
A Closed - Door Hearing
At his June 25 disciplinary hearing , Shuler learned that Powell had his computer audited for Internet use less than a week after he'd filed a written grievance against her .
An audit in retaliation for a grievance would be a violation of university policy .
Shuler readily admits to reading and printing news stories at work , but he insists the sites that showed up in the IT logs represented work - related activity .
As a university editor , Shuler was responsible for keeping up with current events , especially if those that involved the university or members of the UAB community .
" I spend most of every work day writing my own stories , conducting research for my stories or publications , copyediting my colleagues ' stories , proofreading projects that are either my own or my colleagues ' , " Shuler explained in the written grievance protesting his termination , " I constantly use the Web to check or verify information .
It 's a critical aspect of my job -- and of my coworkers ' jobs .
Not only is this activity work related , it is required of my job . "
The Siegelman case was big news at UAB , especially since Siegelman 's co-defendant Richard Scrushy is an alumnus and a major donor .
Alice Martin pursued a major whistleblower lawsuit on behalf of two UAB employees who reported that the University had misused federal grant money , and in 2005 the University agreed to pay $ 3.39 million to settle allegations that researchers double - billed on federal research grants .
Under the terms of the settlement , Martin retained the power to reopen a civil or criminal investigation against UAB officials .
This power , coupled with Martin 's demonstrated enthusiasm for investigating corruption at universities , may have given UAB officials pause .
Shuler contends that he never blogged from his work computer .
He says he can only access his blog through a special password - protected email account , an account which he says he never touched at the office .
At his June 25 disciplinary hearing , Shuler learned that Powell had his computer audited for Internet use less than a week after he'd filed a written grievance against her .
An audit in retaliation for a grievance would be a violation of university policy .
The personnel hearing was closed to the public and the only account of the information regarding the IT investigator 's findings is Shuler's .
Under UAB rules , Shuler was not permitted to bring a lawyer to his disciplinary hearing .
Nor has he been given access to the judgment of the disciplinary committee in writing .
The university made an audio recording of the hearing , but Shuler has not received a copy .
He says that at the hearing , Powell was unable to produce documentation to substantiate her allegations .
Shuler said she had no written record of having given him the verbal warnings alluded to in his official letter of dismissal .
RAW STORY repeatedly phoned and emailed department head Pam Powell , Associate Vice President of Marketing and Public Relations Dale Turnbough , and other UAB officials in an attempt to get UAB 's side of the story .
When asked whether Shuler was fired for blogging , Turnbough wrote in an email , " No , as I said before , that is inaccurate , but we cannot comment further on this personnel matter . "
Turnbough 's comment is the only response UAB has provided to RAW STORY over a two - month period of repeated calls and emails .
UAB staffers declined to comment , even to the point of ignoring requests for confirmations of basic factual details , such as the spelling of their names and their exact job titles .
Press Interest and the Possibility of Reinstatement
Shortly after the June 25 hearing , Shuler was informed that the committee had voted to overturn his dismissal , but he remains unemployed as of this writing .
He is scheduled to meet with Chief Human Resources Officer Cheryl Locke July 11 to discuss the terms of a possible reinstatement .
He says , however , that he is reluctant to return to work under the terms that have been explained to him .
If he goes back to work , he will be assigned to a new position and he will still have two written warnings in his file .
Shuler alleges that Locke told him she was well aware that the media were following the case .
He says she warned him that press coverage might affect her decision , a remark Shuler interpreted as a threat .
Shuler maintains that he 's done nothing wrong and he is determined to clear his name .
He says he wo n't rule out the possibility of legal action if he can't negotiate a fair resolution with UAB .
" In the end , the Shuler case is definitely about the first amendment , and whether it will be a dead letter in Alabama , " Harper 's journalist Scott Horton told RAW STORY .
" There are certainly a number of folks at UAB who obviously wish it were dead .
They may be in for a very unpleasant surprise . "

Schools may not strip - search students for drugs based on an unverified tip , a federal appeals court ruled Friday .
Overturning two other rulings , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said an assistant principal at an Arizona middle school violated the constitutional rights of a 13 - year - old by ordering her to be strip - searched .
He thought the honor student had prescription - strength ibuprofen ; she did not .
The 6 - 5 ruling by the San Francisco - based court reinstated a lawsuit that a divided three - judge circuit panel threw out last year .
The lawsuit was brought by the parents of Savana Redding , who was an eighth - grader at Safford Middle School in southeastern Arizona when the assistant principal ordered her out of math class and into his office to investigate whether she had violated a school policy that prohibited students from bringing medication -- even over - the - counter medication -- to school .
Another student had Savana ’s school planner and some ibuprofen pills , school officials had found .

That “ frightened ” student claimed Savana had given her the pills , the court said .
Savana denied having done so .
After a search of her pockets and backpack yielded nothing incriminatory , Kerry Wilson , the assistant principal , ordered his administrative assistant and a school nurse , both women , to force her to disrobe .
“ The officials had Savana peel off each layer of clothing in turn , ” wrote Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw for the majority .

The girl stood in her bra and underwear while the two officials searched her clothes .
Then she was ordered to partially remove her bra , exposing her breasts , and finally told to shake out the crotch of her underwear .
“ Hiding her head so that the adults could not see that she was about to cry , Savana complied and pulled out her underwear , revealing her pelvic area , ” Wardlaw wrote .
“ No ibuprofen was found . ”
The search was unjustified , the court said , because officials made no attempt to corroborate the claim by a student who was “ cornered ” and “ seeking to shift blame from herself . ”
Forcing Savana to disrobe also was a “ disproportionately extreme measure , ” the majority said .

“ Common sense informs us that directing a 13 - year - old girl to remove her clothes , partially revealing her breasts and pelvic area , for allegedly possessing ibuprofen , an infraction that poses an imminent danger to no one , and which could have been handled by keeping her in the principal ’s office until a parent arrived or simply sending her home , was excessively intrusive , ” Wardlaw wrote , joined by Judges Harry Pregerson , Raymond C. Fisher , Richard A. Paez , Milan D. Smith Jr. and N. Randy Smith .
The court cited arguments by the National Assn. of Social Workers that strip searches of children “ can result in serious emotional damage , including the development of , or increase in , oppositional behavior . ”
“ And all this to find prescription - strength ibuprofen , ” Wardlaw wrote , noting that one pill has the strength of two over - the - counter Advil and might be commonly used by young women to treat menstrual cramps .
The ruling said that Assistant Principal Wilson was liable for monetary damages but that his aide and the school nurse were not because they were acting under his orders .
Advertisement
Judge Ronald M. Gould , joined by Judge Barry G. Silverman , dissented on the grounds that all the school officials had governmental immunity because the law was not clear at the time of the search .
Judge Michael Daly Hawkins , joined by Chief Judge Alex Kozinski and Judge Carlos T. Bea , dissented on the grounds that the search was constitutional .
Hawkins wrote : “ School officials deserve the greatest latitude when responding to behavior that threatens the health and safety of students or teachers . . .
“ When school officials reasonably believe that a student is carrying a weapon or harmful drugs , it will rarely be unreasonable for them to do what they can to neutralize the danger . ”
Advertisement
Although ibuprofen is mild , “ that does not mean it is never harmful , ” Hawkins wrote .
The ruling affects nine states , including California , that are under the 9th Circuit ’s jurisdiction .
But California is one of at least seven states that prohibits strip searches of any student for any reason , the court said .
Adam B. Wolf , a lawyer with the ACLU Foundation , which helped represent Savana , said the ruling “ sends a clear message to school administrators nationwide that they need to respect certain student privacy and that they ca n’t take the drastic step of strip - searching a student based on one uncorroborated tip . ”

Budapest - Right - wing extremists hurled stones and eggs at a Gay Pride procession in the Hungarian capital on Saturday before clashing with police called in to protect the marchers .
Police arrested more than 40 of the assailants , who threw firebombs at the officers and set alight a police minibus .
At least five persons were injured , two of them policemen .
A jazz concert due to be held at the end of the rally was cancelled for security reasons .
Politician Gabor Horn , a leading member of the liberal Association of Free Democrats ( SZDSZ ) , said he was spat upon , slapped and doused with beer by neo -Nazis .
It was the worst violence during the 12 years the Gay Pride parade has taken place in Budapest .
Hundreds of of extremists gathered along the route taken by the 1,500 marchers to give vent to their anger at gays and lesbians .
In the days leading up to the parade , calls were made on Neo - Nazi internet forums for violence to be used against the " unnatural perverts . " ( dpa )
Call me a conspiracy theorist .
But when Donald Rumsfeld spoke , in late 2006 , to the pentagon propagandists the NY Times recently exposed , he , in opining the loss of both houses of congress to the Democrats , suggested that “ the US could benefit from another terrorist attack , ” Jason Linkin of the Huffington post reports .
“ As documented by Newsvine , it all went down at a valedictory luncheon Rumsfeld hosted for those analysts on December 12 , 2006 .
Many of the " message force multipliers " named in the original New York Times piece were in attendance , including David L. Grange , Donald W. Sheppard , James Marks , Rick Francona , Wayne Downing , and Robert H. Scales , Jr. They were treated to an extraordinary conversation ( Newsvine has highlights , the hour - long clip of which can be found here ) with Rumsfeld , that included many jaw - dropping moments , such as Rumsfeld admitting that in Iraq , the U.S. " ca n't lose militarily , but ... can't win by military means alone , " an agreement that Iraq could use a Syngman Rhee - type dictator ( because that 's what democracy smells like ! ) , and a lengthy passage where Rumsfeld jokingly offers a bottle of champagne to anyone who could kill Moqtada al Sadr .
You sure do n't see too many people joking on al Sadr these days !
“ But by far the most extraordinary part of this luncheon is the antipathy the gathered members exhibit toward the American people for having the temerity to vote the Democrats back into power .
When Lt. Gen. Michael DeLong bemoans the lack of " sympathetic ears " on Capitol Hill , Rumsfeld offers that the American people lack " the maturity to recognize the seriousness of the threats . "
What 's to be done ?
According to Rumsfeld , " The correction for that , I suppose , is [ another ] attack . "
Now this is just factual information .
Why do I start this article by saying , “ call me a conspiracy theorist ? ”
Because this slips too easily off Rumsfeld ’s reptilian tongue .
Too easily because perhaps it ’s not at all a new idea .
Perhaps it is an idea that , for him , for all the propagandist sell - out generals , this is not new , that is actually , already tried and true .
One of the oft cited premises of the 9/11 Truth movement is that the attack on the towers was the pearl harbor - like event that the neocons anticipated would be necessary to move the US to embrace the aggressive militaristic tactics manifested in Iraq .
Here , we have Rumsfeld casually joking about it — not a smoking gun , but , perhaps , a clear “ tell ” in poker parlance , indicating ready ability to think in these terms .
The hour - long audio clip was found as part of a data dump done by the pentagon , in response the NY Times Freedom of Information Act request .
The Huffingtonpost article reports ,
Introduction
One of the arguments by defenders of the government 's version of 9/11 is that 9/11 truth is " like a religion " .
In fact , one writer argues that blind patriotism , rather than 9/11 truth , is the " religious " belief system :
Investigation of a crime means reading the evidence , first .
9-11 was spectacular crime leaving behind spectacular evidence .
Spectacle was the whole thing — give people visions they would never forget , embed fears to shadow them forever .
Deep cracks penetrated the American psyche on 9 - 11 , some possibly too deep to heal ; therein lies perhaps the greatest ally of 9 - 11 perpetrators , the collective desperation of Americans for no more damage .
We ’ve been hurt enough !
“ Looking away ” might shunt some pain , and clear the way for explanations that help the wound start to heal , but such neutralizing of evidence offers short - term comfort at best , while actually making things worse with its invitation for greater wounds .
The looking away , refusal to consider evidence , it could be called religion based on fundamental faith that our government …
” OH ! They ’d Never Do THAT ! ”
The truth that they would do that , and actually did — as virtually all evidence proves — not only represents more pain , but makes our enemy hard to define .
The mass emotional steady - state requires an explanation soothing in its finality while providing a clear enemy , a culprit at which victims can focus their rage .
The truth of 9 - 11 rips many people too far from steady - state comfort , presents a dilemma some ca n’t handle .
Thus , the pervasive looking away , which in this case is the worst possible posture .
As long as one ’s head is buried in comforting sand , the ass kicking inevitably gets worse .
Psychiatrists and psychologists support this diagnosis of denial by defenders of the official 9/11 story .
However , given that 85 % of the American population identifies itself as Christian , and millions more identify themselves as Jewish , and probably millions more identify themselves with some other form of religious belief , being " religious " ( or at least " spiritual " ) is not considered a bad thing by most Americans .
The argument made by defenders of the government 's version of 9/11 must therefore be aimed solely at atheists , for whom " religion " is a dirty word .
In order to shift the discussion onto neutral ground -- where both religious folks and atheists can speak a common language , and in order not to offend any readers ( atheists or believers ) --
I will simply address the issue of whether 9/11 truth is an irrational belief system ( thus leaving off the table the debate about whether atheism , religion , or some other form of spirituality is the most rational belief system ) .
Indeed , because 9/11 truth activists are comprised of atheists and religious folks and non-denominational spiritual people , the entire religion discussion is simply irrelevant .
The question is rationality , not religion .
Are 9/11 Questions Irrational ?
Tom Murphy wrote an essay entitled Why the 911 Truther Movement is Like a Religion .
Because Mr. Murphy 's essay is the most well - developed argument of its type , I will quote his essay in full , and address each of his arguments in turn .
(1) Revelation – 911 Truthers KNOW that what they 've been given by the 9/11 Commission and NIST is anything but the " truth " .
This knowledge is revealed by the planning and execution of a false flag operation by others ( most probably the Administration ) .
While the planning and execution were managed very successfully , neither were quite good enough for the cleverness of Truthers discoveries of multiple layers of incompetence – despite the fact that no one has yet confessed to participation in or knowledge of the actual conspiracy .
Response : Virtually all of the people who question 9/11 -- including me -- started out believing the government 's version of events .
I know of less than 10 people who immediately suspected that the attacks were a false flag operation .
Our pre-conception -- like everyone else 's -- was that foreign terrorists were solely responsible for 9/11 .
I was born and raised in the U.S. I 've always loved the Fourth of July , its parades , the Bill of Rights .
It never dawned on me that any government -- let alone my government -- might carry out false flag attacks .
Most people 's doubt in the government story evolved very slowly over many years .
Specifically , most people ran into one claim by the government which was refuted by the evidence , then ran into another one , and then more .
Some people were determined to prove the 9/11 activists wrong , and so spent countless hours investigating the facts . . . only to realize that the government 's story was impossible !
I read one essay by a gentleman like this who spent countless hours trying to debunk the 9/11 questions , and had several sleepless nights as he started to realize he could n't do it .
In fact , most people used the scientific method to test the government 's hypothesis and only gradually , slowly , and reluctantly came to the conclusion that it is very , very , very unlikely .
That is the scientific method : the opposite of irrationality .
In terms of " incompetence " , I have tried to debunk that argument here .
I have tried to debunk the no-confession argument here .
(2) Reminiscence – Disparate 911 Truthers sites occasionally gather in more communal settings entitled " conferences " to listen to each other speak the " truth " .
This is a perfect setting to reminisce about their cleverness at having revealed the truth , while others remain ignorant .
This sharing allows 911 Truthers to integrate their shared thoughts into daily thinking .
Response : I agree that there are conferences where 9/11 truth activists gather , and that people there reminiscence .
From what I hear , though , the emotion is n't gloating over how smart the conferees are , but a mix of the following emotions :
Community : A sense of joy at speaking with like - minded people .
What would it have been like during the Middle Ages -- when people thought that the plague was caused by bad " humors " or what - not -- to attend a medical conference where the bacteria , its epidemiology , and its treatment were discussed ?
( I apologize for the over - the - top analogy , but I think it conveys the sense of community which 9/11 truth activists do develop ) .
Frustration : Frustration that the corporate media is censoring all real questions about 9/11
could
He has a demonstrated history of acting for the good of humanity .
For example , he helped to invent " solar cookers " which are helping many poor people all around the world to cheaply prepare their meals , even in heavily deforested areas
He has impressive scientific credentials
He obviously cares for people , for America , and for mankind
He follows the scientific method in his 9/11 work
(3) Ritual – 911 Truthers use constant repetition of common " truths " ( e.g. , Osama was on the CIA payroll ) and common terms ( e.g. false flag ) .
The repetitive use of these truths and terms lends comfort to Truthers through their ritualistic use .
Similar and consistent approaches are taken against those who disagree with the Movement in a thoughtful and considerate manner when their points are not addressed but their character is questioned openly .
Response :
In fact , such statements are supported by the historical record .
Is Mr. Murphy claiming that the CIA did not -- through the Pakistani ISI -- fund Bin Laden in Afghanistan ?
Or that there is not a well - documented history of false flag terror ?
Are the CIA , the New York Times , and the Founding Fathers wrong when they discuss false flag terror ?
(4) Reverence – 911 Truthers give great weight to so - called " scholars " , architects , engineers , and politicians as verification that their cause is just and " real " .
How could someone such as Steve Jones be ... wrong ?
Response :
In fact , the emphasis on " scholars " and other experts largely arose because the defenders of the official version of 9/11 were stressing " the experts say . . . "
If you do an internet search of the discussions occurring before the formation of the group Scholars for 9/11 Truth , you will see what I mean .
In fact , many 9/11 activists previously said " who needs experts ?
The evidence is obvious even to lay people . "
I have always argued that experts are important as well .
In a jury trial , the jury decides , but each side has their own experts give their opinions .
As one example , Steven Jones , indeed , be wrong .
However , many people promote his work because :
(5) Restrictions – By placing the events of 9/11 into a massive conspiracy , 911 Truthers have placed gateways through which one must pass to be accepted by the followers .
If a person cannot pass , then they are clearly a shill for the enemy or are ignorant of the " truth " .
Response : I believe Mr. Murphy is making a very important point .
While it tries my patience when people look at 2 plus 2 and arrive at 5 , I believe that EVERYONE -- whether they question 9/11 or not -- should be shown some respect .
Because I believe that EVERYONE has a brain and a heart , and EVERYONE has the ability to change .
Indeed , if someone is paid by the government or a government subcontractor to spread disinformation , I think that person should be respectfully approached to try to reach them , because even their grankids will be hurt by the 9/11 coverup , because false flags make all of us unsafe , and all the paychecks in the world wo n't adequately protect the disinformation agent 's kids and grandkids from the harm being caused by those who order false flag attacks .
I do n't know what the odds are of reaching paid disinformation agents , but I think we have to try , in the same way that kind - hearted Jewish people who have shown authentic respect and love to Skinheads have converted them into do - gooders who can successfully reach out to current Skinheads to get them to revise their choices .
(6) Repentance – If one who has passed the gateway but falters in the " faith " , they must be shown the error of their ways or thoughts .
If they repent of their misdeeds , then they are permitted to return to the 911 Truther fold but under a renewed watch for future lapses of " faith " .
Response :
An interesting perspective .
I believe that questions about 9/11 should stand or fall on their own merits .
(7) Reliance – 911 Truthers are optimistic and rely on the belief that once the unwashed masses accept the " truth " , then there will be hope for the continuance of America and its people .
However , things may ( some Truthers would argue must ) get worse before they get better , which could include a re-writing of original principles ( e.g. , the Constitution ) .
Response : Sorry , but I do n't understand what Mr. Murphy is trying to say .
However , it is true that I am optimistic and rely on my belief that if 9/11 truth prevails , then there will be hope for the continuance of America and its people .
Here 's why .
(8) Resurrection – Only through the acceptance of the 911 Truther 's version of the " truth " will America and its people reawaken from its slumber of ignorance and yet again attain its magnificence but as a kinder , gentler , and more globally - conscious and focused nation – willing to share its wealth equitably .
Response : Again , I do believe that 9/11 Truth Has the Power to Stop Fascism .
I actually am concerned with many other issues , as well , and am open to other ways to stop the current slide into fascism .
By the way , people alive in Nazi Germany themselves say that current America looks exactly like Nazi Germany as Hitler rose to power .
That 's the historical record : I did n't make it up .
( Google it . )
(9) Rebellion – By default , 911 Truthers are in opposition to " authority " because it is the government that perpetrated the " crime " .
Naturally , this requires a high level of devotion and dedication to the 911 Truther Movement or " rebellion " because of the possible consequences ... if caught .
Response : I respectfully disagree .
Anarchists comprise only a tiny percentage of those who question 9/11 .
The overwhelming majority are patriots who love America .
Indeed , I 'm going to write an essay quoting one of the Founding Fathers saying something like " do n't tear things down unless you know something better you are going to build " .
Personally , I think that NO system -- whether capitalism , socialism , or whatever - ism -- will guarantee freedom and liberty .
ANY system can be taken over by dictators .
The American system might need fixing , but its as good as any .
It is the corruption WITHIN the system which is destroying America .
( 10 ) Removal – When a 911 Truther finally accepts reality and now understands that they have been deceived by the Movement , they must be removed and disassociated with the " cause " .
The best vehicle for accomplishing this removal is to claim the violator a government plant meant to split the unity of the Movement .
Response : Anyone who has studied the history of Cointelpro knows that the government does infiltrate and disrupt anti-war movements .
However , calling everyone who accepts the government 's version of 9/11 a plant is counter - productive .
Questions about 9/11 have enough power to stand on their own , and it is counter - productive to spend more time labelling people plants than debating the actual facts .
( 11 ) Relevance – The actions and thoughts of the 911 Truther are critical to the times in which they live .
With the presumption that fascism abounds in America and this nation 's world status is in decline because of a reliance upon only its own greatness , a global immorality exists within American culture that only the 911 Truther Movement can reverse .
Response : I may be wrong , but I honestly do n't believe a very high percentage of 9/11 activists believe this .
Alot may believe , however -- at least I do -- that failure to educate Americans will lead to future false flags .
Why ?
Because , if you let a criminal get away with a crime , he may very well commit worse crimes in the future .
And every parent knows that if you let your kids get away with something , they 'll do something twice as bad .
( 12 ) Relationships –
The sharing of knowledge by 911 Truthers via respective web sites , articles , false papers , conferences , etc ... creates social and emotional relations that only strengthen the collective adherence to the " cause " .
Response : Probably true .
( 13 ) Reality – The concept that 9/11 was an inside job gains its own " reality " not by evidentiary examination but by the collective will of the 911 Truther Movement .
The reality is the inertia that IS the collective will of the individual Truthers and surely , this many people cannot be wrong .
Response : I respectfully disagree .
Again , most 9/11 activists did n't question 9/11 until they tested the government 's hypothesis using the scientific method , and found it wanting .
In addition , most of us had n't even heard the term " false flag " before 9/11 .
I had n't .
I was very disappointed to learn about this trickery .
Most importantly , many people hold initial hypotheses questioning 9/11 that they then discard when they run into contradictory evidence .
I myself have discarded certain " inside job " theories I previously held when confronted by contradictory evidence .
That is the essence of the scientific method .
( 14 ) Righteousness –
The leaders of the 911 Truther Movement have established rules ( e.g. , means of transferring their message and adherence to paying lip service to the scientific method ) by which those within the movement must operate .
Adherence to these rules is required and assists the leaders by ensuring that the movement 's way of thinking is aligned to their wills ( Reynolds vs. Jones – the great schism ? ) .
Response : First , there are no " leaders " of the 911 truth movement .
People tend to follow whoever they think is doing the most productive work at any given time .
Personally , some people I previously respected started spouting anti-scientific theories about 9/11 ( they were inside job theories ) and I have stopped supporting them .

( 15 ) Retribution – Prior to repentance , a violator of the Movement must understand that there are consequences for not following the rules .
These consequences include a diminishing of the violator 's words , close association to a leader to learn more of the truth ( or be watched more closely ) , and use as a public front to the " cause " .
Response : I respectfully disagree .
To a large extent , when someone floats a theory that is countered by the evidence , 9/11 activists tend to distance themselves from that person .

Fled Republican , Libertarian Bob Barr to Colbert : Young voters are sick of the two - party system Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Thursday June 5 , 2008

Print This Email This " Bob Barr has a long Libertarian voting record , " explained a satirical Stephen Colbert .
" In Congress he supported such privacy - friendly , small government initiatives as the Defense of Marriage Act , which made the government small enough to fit into a bedroom . "
" I , myself , am a Libertarian , " he said .
" I do n't want big government to infringe on my right to tell other people how to live .
And we Libertarians are finally having our moment in the sun !
This is the year that many believe Libertarians will ' hold some serious sway in American politics . '
We 'll use that power to fulfill our dream of eliminating maximum occupancy rules in elevators and suggested age ranges on board games . "
" We 're a big swing vote this time , " explained Rep .
Barr , running for President on the Libertarian ticket , " because Americans are finally realizing , at long last , that the current two - party system -- the Democrats and the Republicans -- have failed , and failed miserably , and simply will give them more of the same . "
Younger voters , especially , see a bleak future under a corrupt government that grows no matter who is in charge , said Barr .
Libertarians , he continued , have a good candidate , " a fellow named Bob Barr , " with few similarities to the infamous Ralph Nader .
Combined with a solid platform , Barr predicts unprecedented support for the Libertarian ticket in the 2008 election .
" You 're a big advocate of personal privacy , " said Colbert , who then asked : " Is that why you voted for the PATRIOT Act ? "
" I voted for the PATRIOT Act not because of that , " Barr said , " but certainly - - certainly , I have come to realize , as many members of Congress did , who voted for it based on a number of promises that were given to us by the Bush administration -- at the highest level , shall we say ... We realized very quickly those promises meant nothing . "
" What I 've been trying to do over the last five years is to try and undo the PATRIOT Act , " he continued , " and I would do that as President . "

GLOBAL suicide rates have increased by 60 % in the past 45 years and it is now one of the three leading causes of death for people between 15 and 44 years old according to the World Health Organisation .
People in countries with high suicide rates say they are unhappier , according to the “ World Database of Happiness ” maintained by Erasmus University in Rotterdam .
But intrepreting suicide trends is tricky because there is no international standard for reporting and collecting data .
Countries with strong religious or cultural strictures against suicide often report lower rates .

WASHINGTON --
The conventional wisdom on certain subjects is so deeply rooted that no amount of evidence disturbs its hold .
That 's how it is with those dreary predictions that young Americans just wo n't vote .
Since the late 1960s , the same chorus has been heard from election to election :
The young do n't care .
They 're disengaged .
They 're too wrapped up in their music , their favorite sports and their parties to care about politics .
Predicting that the young will vote in large numbers is like saying the Cubs will finally win the World Series .
As it happens , the Cubs are doing well this season , and the evidence is overwhelming that this year , the young really will vote in large numbers -- and they just might tip the election .
The trend started four years ago .
According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement , or CIRCLE , electoral participation among 18 - to 24 - year - olds rose from 36 percent in 2000 to 47 percent in 2004 .
For the larger 18 to 29 group , participation rose from 40 percent to 49 percent .
The 2006 midterm election saw a larger increase in off - year voting among the under - 30s than any other age group .
Then came this year 's primaries : According to CIRCLE , the turnout rate for the under - 30s nearly doubled between 2000 and 2008 , from 9 percent to 17 percent .
None of this means that young people will vote at the same rate as middle - aged people or senior citizens .
The young move around more , and voter registration laws in most states make it harder for the footloose to exercise their rights .
And it 's long been the case that citizens become more involved in politics when they settle down and develop stronger community ties .
Nonetheless , on present trends , it 's a near certainty that young people 's overall share of the electorate will rise substantially this year .
Defying stereotypes , the young are more engaged in this campaign than are their elders .
A Pew Research Center study released earlier this month asked voters whether they considered this year 's campaign " interesting " or " dull . "
Among those 18 to 29 , 67 percent called the campaign interesting , as did 66 percent of those 30 to 49 .
By contrast , 58 percent of those 50 to 64 and 52 percent of those over 65 saw the campaign as interesting .
The increase in political interest among the young is staggering .
Between 2000 and this year , the percentage of those under 30 describing the campaign as interesting was up 36 points ; the increase among those over 65 was a more modest 18 points .
Could the young make a difference in Barack Obama 's favor ?
Again , the answer is clearly yes .
Age is one of the most powerful lines of division in this election .
In Pew 's survey , the under -30s gave Obama his largest lead , 56 percent to 36 percent .
He also led among voters aged 30 to 49 , but ran behind among voters 65 and over .
This is not a one - time trend .
The under -30s were by far John Kerry 's best age group in 2004 -- he carried them over George Bush 54 percent to 45 percent -- and they voted better than 3 - 2 for Democratic House candidates in 2006 .
A study released last week by the Rockefeller Foundation and Time magazine helps explain why the under - 30s are so engaged , and why their political views have more in common with those of the New Deal generation than of the Reagan generation .
According to the survey , nearly half of the under - 30s said that America was a better place to live in the 1990s , and they think the country will continue to decline .
This is a more pessimistic view than that of the older generational groups .
They are also the generation most worried about their own or their family 's economic security , and half of them went without health insurance at some point in the last year , more than double the percentage of any other group .
In light of this , it 's not surprising that the Rockefeller report found that 86 percent of the under - 30s -- significantly more than any other generational group -- said that " more government programs should help those struggling under current economic conditions . "
Young Americans show all signs of being interested enough and upset enough to flock to the polls this year .
If they do , they could be the most politically consequential generation since the cohort of the Great Depression and World War II .
Think of these newcomers as the Engaged Generation .
Karl Rove is fleeing the country !
Obviously he has claimed a long planned foreign trip is preventing him from testifying before congress , but Congress did n’t know .
Well now , I do not really think he is on the run , but what if he is ?
I am convinced there are a lot of people right now in Washington shivering in their shoes .
Why ?
Because impeachment is probably not off the table anymore !
At least not categorically .
Pelosi , who famously declared impeachment to be “ off the table ” before the 2006 election , now suggests that hearings on the president ’s high crimes and misdemeanors are a distinct possibility .
I think you will have to thank Dennis Kucinich , Robert Wexler , Tammy Baldwin , John Conyers and some more officials who have doggedly pursued to hold the Bush Administration accountable .
And as our fellow critter Zooey has pointed out in a comment on this thread , if the President is impeached , there will be no Presidential pardons .
So maybe he fled the country after all !

Drivers across the US are facing higher gasoline bills US inflation rose at its fastest pace for six months in May because of sharply higher energy costs .
Consumer prices rose 0.6 % last month , government figures showed , the steepest monthly increase since last November .
Petrol costs surged by 5.7 % last month , driven by the soaring global cost of oil which recently reached more than $ 139 a barrel .
Rising inflation is a worry for the Federal Reserve , which has cut rates aggressively to stimulate growth .
Above expectations May 's figure topped market expectations and represented a jump from April 's 0.2 % rate .
On an annual basis , inflation touched 4.2 % in May , again above analysts ' expectations .
Gasoline prices rose at their fastest monthly rate this year while food prices rose 0.3 % .
We know oil is flying through the roof .
Consumers are forced to eat the price
Lindsey Piegza , FTN Financial
Excluding both fuel and food costs , so - called core inflation was up 0.2 % on a monthly basis and 2.3 % compared with a year ago .
The figures increase the prospect that the next move in US interest rates could be up .
The Fed has slashed rates in the past eight months as the economy has slowed dramatically but it will be mindful of evidence of growing inflationary pressures .
But analysts said price inflation was largely confined to energy at this stage .
" It is not as bad as it looks , " Lindsey Piegza , from FTN Financial , said of the numbers .
" We know oil is flying through the roof .
Consumers are forced to eat the price .
There is nothing they can do . "

Mexico freezes prices on food items to battle inflation Agreement aims to steady costs as nation reels from rising inflation
MEXICO CITY — Moving to stem rising inflation and civil discontent , President Felipe Calderon and Mexican industrialists announced an agreement Wednesday to freeze prices on more than 150 food items .
The pact , which will be in effect through the end of the year , comes amid escalating costs of corn and other staples of the Mexican diet .
Companies agreed to hold prices steady for cooking oil , tomato sauce , canned soups and tuna , beans , chili sauces and other staples of the Mexican table .
" In recent months a significant increase in the price of food has been felt worldwide , " Calderon said in announcing the deal .
" Maintaining the maximum prices of these products fixed will truly permit an enormous support for the household economy . "
Calderon last month ordered the easing of restrictions on imported corn , wheat and rice to stabilize local prices of those grains .
He has also announced measures — criticized as insufficient by farm groups — to boost agricultural production and lower farmers ' costs .
Worldwide rioting
This year 's sustained price spikes for oil , grains and other commodities have sparked riots across the developing world and parts of Europe .
Food riots forced the resignation of Haiti 's prime minister earlier this year .
Though Mexico's mostly urban population has remained calm , Calderon 's government has been maneuvering to keep food and gasoline prices low .
The price freeze on some items will hold until December only if " there are n't indiscriminate increases in these prices , specifically of raw materials , " said Ismael Plascencia , president of the Concamin , a national organization of various manufacturers associations .
But increasing raw material costs are as likely for Mexican manufacturers as they are worldwide , said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O , whose firm advises some of the largest companies operating here .
" Everything is going up in price , " Ramirez de la O said .
" There is no escape . "
Effect on manufacturers
Larger Mexican companies , some of which have a stranglehold on their industries and enjoy profit margins of as much as 30 percent , likely will be able to absorb the increased costs , Ramirez de la O said .
But many smaller manufacturers could be severely squeezed .
" No one really expects these prices to be fixed for such a long time , " said Ramirez de la O , who also served as economic adviser to the leftist candidate who lost the presidential election two years ago to Calderon .
The price of corn tortillas went up 22 percent early last month , according to the federal consumer protection agency , while the price of rice has spiked by 40 percent since the beginning of the year .
Calderon 's government disclosed recently that nearly all the windfall profits from Mexico 's oil exports — some 1.3 million barrels a day to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries — are being spent to subsidize gasoline sold inside the country .
Mexico imports some 40 percent of its gasoline , most of it from the United States .
Regular gasoline here sells about $ 2.80 a gallon , far lower than the price in the United States .
" This is a populist measure , " Ramirez de la O said of Wednesday 's accord .
" The government is running very short of real alternatives . "

We 're ready for the 3G iPhone , but are AT&T's 3G networks ready for it ?
Om Malik raises the scary possibility that AT&T 's complete HSDPA network might be newly strengthened , but still might not be robust enough to handle the onslaught of 3G traffic , rendering 3G barely more nimble than EDGE .
After a year of waiting for 3G , that 's kind of a nut shot right ?
Consider this :
Even last year , iPhone users chugged nearly five times the data of an average AT&T subscriber , and twice as much as other smartphone owners .
Advertisement
It was n't so harsh on the network , because 55 percent of the data was over Wi-Fi .
But with 3G , why wait for a Wi -Fi hotspot , especially since AT&T 's 3G is , at least in the NYC area , as blazing as AT&T claims .
New iPhone users are going to get on 3G en masse , and pull a lot of data over the air , especially with unlimited data plans .
And it 's fair to assume iPhone users are going to slurp even more than before since they wo n't have to hit up Wi -Fi to do data - intensive stuff .

The standard increase in usage from unlimited plans with more run -of - the - mill phones has already been posing problems for operators , forcing a serious need to upgrade the backend .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
While that report does n't focus on AT&T , it 's worth noting that two major Korean operators - vaunted for their magical networks - were experiencing degraded voice quality from the data hammer .
And AT&T 's network did n't have a stellar track record to begin with .
So a $ 199 3G iPhone that moves millions of data - whoring units could be the worst thing ever , at least if you 're buying that 3G iPhone for , well , 3G data access .
The ball 's in your court , AT&T . [ GigaOM ]
This is my final mission
Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots
Developer : Kojima Productions
Publisher : Konami
Platform : PlayStation 3
Price : $ 59.99 ( Shop. Ars )
Rating : Mature
Note :
If you have yet to complete the full game , please be aware that reading this review may spoil some of the surprises that lie in wait .
In particular , the criticism of the game 's ending , which begins on the third page , does delve into spoiler territory .
Please read with caution .
Also , please be wary that the discussion thread may also contain spoilers .
As the prophesied end of a series that 's as old as the PlayStation brand itself , Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots has to please both fans of the PlayStation 3 hungry for a must - have , blockbuster title and fans of the original series .
Either of these would be a challenge by itself , but to do both at once seems an impossibly tall order .
Like Halo 3 before it , Metal Gear Solid 4 is in a sense the end of a generation and the beginning of a new one .
The story of Solid Snake concludes with this final installment in the Solid sub-series of the Metal Gear franchise .
And though Snake , withered from rapid degeneration because of his clone - borne genes , is at his frailest in this adventure , MGS4 proves to be the most sophisticated and enjoyable entry in the series .
Despite these accolades , though , the game stumbles at times like its aging protagonist , showing its years of wear .
In a nutshell , MGS4 is a compelling mix of straight - forward cinematics , shooting , and stealth .
Gameplay is broken up into a few distinctly different pieces , the most prominent of which are the typical stealth - action sequences .
However , MGS4 does a great job of mixing things up just as you get comfortable .
Initially , the game plays like a standard third - person shooter : stealth is n't really a necessity and , quite frankly , it 's a lot easier to just run and gun .
But that changes drastically as the game plays out .
In fact , the best surprises about Metal Gear Solid 4 came not in terms of narrative revelation , but rather in terms of gameplay innovation .
Snake returns for his final mission .
War has changed
Compared to modern shooters , the combat in Metal Gear Solid 4 is not just remarkably competent but actually stands out when compared to many of its peers — something that could n't necessarily be said of the previous iterations .
For a series that started out as a strictly stealth - based endeavor with massive punishment for gunplay and a camera angle that negated the desire to shoot it out with enemies , MGS4 brings the series into the new shooter age admirably .
Exemplifying this is the game 's opening act , which seems to be ripped right out of the pages of Infinity Ward 's Call of Duty playbook .
Significant improvements to the combat system include a brand new shooting engine and related over - the - shoulder camera angle , the introduction of OctoCamo , a marked increase in the number and variety of armaments and items , the Drebin store and weapon collection , the introduction of psyche and stress meters , and a new radar system .
Those who have n't played a Metal Gear game before probably wo n't appreciate how far the game has come in terms of control .
Though the controls still are n't entirely intuitive and will likely present a bit of a learning curve to newcomers and veterans alike ( it took me hours to stop trying to shoulder my gun by pressing L2 and shooting with R2 ) there 's just so much to the game that complex controls are an unfortunate necessity .
Thankfully , SixAxis controls are used sparingly : you 'll only use them a few times during the game for simple things like peeking out of garbage bins .
Unlike previous Metal Gear games , there 's now a recoil system and an over - the - shoulder camera akin to Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter .
You 'll be able to swap the camera over each shoulder and take out enemies as you run around .
You 'll also have full control of the camera when you 're not shouldered , making it easier to navigate the more complex environments of the game 's early acts .
The camera is n't perfect , but it does make the gunplay infinitely more playable than it used to be .
As a result of these advancements , Metal Gear Solid 4 promotes combat like never before .
It 's hard to deny yourself the satisfaction of turning a corner guns ablaze when the game makes it so much easier to shoot it out .
That 's not to say that the stealth game has been completely abandoned .
Snake has a variety of new moves at his disposal to avoid the enemy , including the ability to hang from ledges , a better cover system , and most importantly the new camouflage system , which has also undergone a massive revamp , making it far more fluid than it was in Metal Gear Solid 3 .
Players will no longer have to constantly cycle through the menus to change camo .
Rather , the new OctoCamo system automatically changes your camo to match your surroundings if you stay still for a few moments .
This makes the flow of gameplay much smoother , as you 'll spend more time deftly moving about the battlefield than plodding through menus .
You can still register specific camo patterns and pick through them if you 'd like , but the automatic OctoCamo and the additional costumes that you gather — which let you blend in with certain enemies — are all you 'll really need .
But you will still end up in the menu every so often to play with the new gun enhancements .
Previous games in the series had a few small upgrades that could be added indiscriminately to specific weapons , but now players can purchase and find a plethora of new add - ons that can be slotted to specific parts on the guns .
Dot sights , scopes , laser sights , grenade launchers , shotguns , grips , flashlights , and suppressors can be mounted to many of the game 's various weapons at a cost .
The numerous cameos will be very rewarding for veteran players .
And you 'll likely be doing this weapon and gear shuffling quite a bit , given the sheer number of weapons in the game .
Metal Gear Solid 4 not only has more weapons than its predecessors , it has more weapons than almost any other shooter I 've seen .
If you 're into gun porn , MGS4 will likely be a choice pick for you — an irony given that the series is still so heavily biased towards stealth .
Tons of weapons in every category , new grenades and explosives , and various support items like Playboys and sleeping gas come into play .
Collecting weapons on the battlefield also becomes important with the addition of the Drebin Store and the weapon collection system .
Weapons scavenged from the battlefield translate into points that can be used to buy or ID - unlock new armaments , ammo , and upgrades from the Drebin store .
This can create a bit of pack - rat syndrome , as you scavenge for more guns and let enemies kill each other in order to reap the rewards .
There are also a significant number of new items .
In addition to the classic rations , cardboard boxes , and the like , there 's a bunch of new items like the barrel , that add new gameplay possibilities , and the iPod , that present fun diversions .
The iPod , in particular , is a surprisingly neat addition : during the game you can find and listen to classic Metal Gear Solid tracks or even podcasts recorded specifically for the game .
( And that 's not all the Mac loving that you 'll find , as Otacon wields a MacBook Pro at every turn . )
Some of the items also support the new Psyche and Stress meters , which replace the injury and sustenance systems from past games .
As you participate in combat , take blows , and perform poorly , your psyche will decrease and your stress will rise .
The less confident you are , and thus the lower your psyche , the more difficult it is to sneak effectively , to aim steadily , and so on .
As your stress rises , your health recovery slows and aim decreases wildly .
You can combat this by keeping yourself in good mind with items or medical advice via Codec , or by achieving a combat high , which is rewarded after successive kills without sustaining damage .
These systems exist transparently for the most part , though at a few key points in the game they 'll become a matter of life or death .
And that 's why learning to use the new Solid Eye , the game 's replacement for the radar system , is so important .
Managing the battlefield is still crucial to success .
When equipped , the Solid Eye acts as a toned down Soliton Radar system .
You 'll be able to see vague enemy positions and movement , but your eyes and ears are much more important now .
It 's a nice change of pace , as enemies become less predictable .
Sadly , the A.I. remains relatively unchanged , which ends up being one of the few negative points to the gameplay engine .
Though some of the new enemies move differently than they have in the past — jumping wildly off walls , for example — they 're still as predictable as they 've ever been .
While this A.I. may have been impressive in Metal Gear Solid 2 , it feels as though no real advancements have been made .
Overall , though , Metal Gear Solid 4 plays great .
It improves on its predecessors by leaps - and - bounds and will likely come to be adored by third - person shooter fans — even those who do n't particularly care for the reasons for and ramifications of Snake 's escapades .
But the first acts are only just a small taste of the overall experience , which changes drastically after the second act .
Pictured : Face of the ' good - looking , pleasant young man ' who inspired Jane Austen 's Mr Darcy
Loved and lost :
The portrait of Irish lawyer Thomas Lefroy , who married another woman but named his daughter Jane
A tiny portrait of the man a young Jane Austen loved and lost - believed to have inspired Pride And Prejudice 's Mr Darcy - is to surface at an antiques fair .
The 3in watercolour of Irishman Thomas Langlois Lefroy was painted by leading English miniaturist George Engleheart in 1798 , two years after the 20 - year - old sweethearts were forced to part .
Lefroy 's family , of Huguenot origin , was not wealthy and expected him to marry a woman of means .
But Austen , the sixth of seven children born to a Hampshire rector , was still 13 years away from her first literary success , Sense And Sensibility , and was not considered suitable marriage material .
The portrait on ivory - on the back of which are several locks of hair - was painted two years after Lefroy 's dalliance with Austen .
It will be exhibited in London 's Grosvenor House Hotel at the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair for a week from Thursday .
Signed with Engleheart 's distinctive ' E ' monogram , it is one of only two portraits of Lefroy known to exist and has an asking price of around £ 50,000 .
Gloucestershire dealers Judy and Brian Harden , who are selling the painting , said they had bought it at auction some time ago without realising its significance .
' We did n't know who Tom Lefroy was when we bought it - it went through the auction house unrecognised - but we were able to identify and discover the history of the sitter , ' Mr Harden said .
Lefroy met Austen while visiting his uncle and aunt in Hampshire .
They were much taken with one another , talking , dancing and apparently flirting .
She referred to him in a letter as ' a gentlemanlike , good - looking , pleasant young man ' and found only one fault with him - ' his morning coat is a great deal too light ' .
Romantic fiction : Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet in the 1995 TV dramatisation of Jane Austen 's Pride And Prejudice
Lefroy 's parents , sensing Austen was contemplating a future with him , whisked the young law student away and the couple never met again .
Just before they parted , she wrote : ' At length the day is come on which I am to flirt my last with Tom Lefroy ...
My tears flow as I write at the melancholy idea . '
Three years later he married heiress Mary Paul and had a successful legal career , becoming chief justice of Ireland .
He named his eldest daughter Jane .
Austen is thought to have used her own experiences of romance - good and bad - in her novels .
Inspiration : James McAvoy portrays Lefroy with Anne Hathaway as Austen in last year 's Becoming Jane
Literary historians believe Lefroy 's family provided the basic plot for Pride And Prejudice and Tom himself was the inspiration for Fitzwilliam Darcy , the handsome , intelligent man who eventually married Elizabeth Bennet , the main female character in the novel .
He was played by Colin Firth in a BBC TV dramatisation in 1995 .
Lefroy himself has been played by James McAvoy , opposite Anne Hathaway as Austen , in last year 's movie Becoming Jane .
Despite attracting several suitors , Austen never married and died in 1817 , four years after Pride And Prejudice was published .

In most American cities public transportation is severely lacking .
Even New York , with its fabled subway , has a system which is old ,
crowded and dirty .
Though the regional trains are new , they are all - steel
and have no suspension which means you fell every tie in the track
rather than having a smooth and seamless ride as you do on the Accela
express trains and in Europe .
I live in Amsterdam , a very small and old city with dozens of canals and narrow roads .
Yet they manage to have extensive buses , light rail ( street trams ) , a metro , regional and national trains and even bicycle taxis , which are private but encouraged by the city for short journeys .

There is only one reason America cannot properly develop its public transport systems : because of the politicians inability to tell difficult truths to the American people .
Truths which , now that the public cannot afford to buy gas , are becoming apparent out of necessity .
European politicians are not afraid to tell the truth .
They have effectively explained to their populations that in order to prevent future growth in traffic , we must undergo a little pain now for less pain later .
If our politicians would suck it up and stop feeding the myth that it is a right to own a car and drive that might be good place to start .
If they started explaining to Americans that instead of $ 200 tax cuts , we can have fast trains and extensive subway systems so they would n't need to drive a car , I 'm sure many people would consider that a savings given that a single fill - up can easily cost $ 80 .

The solution is not to pander or appease , but to do the painful and intelligent thing .
In Los Angeles , for example , there is a clean , efficient new metro .
However it does not serve 80 % of the metropolitan area , and so its use is limited .
Instead of allowing Beverly Hills to interfere with expansion of the metro , the needs of the other 20 million residents of Southern California should outweigh those of the 40,000 in Beverly Hills .
Rather than the current piecemeal system , much of which is owned and operated by
the notoriously corrupt MTA , we need an integrated t
transport systems where underground rail , light rail , monorail and
extensive bus and bike lanes are planned in a coordinated and
overlapping way .
There is plenty of room to put rail on most LA
freeways given the unused space next to the center dividers and on the
shoulders .
On the street two lanes of sacrificed space for light rail
would significantly reduce traffic for the other 4 or 6 lanes of
traffic on most main thoroughfares , thus making the streets themselves more effective , if
smaller .
It is a sham that in a modern , spacious city like Los Angeles
with a gridded street system that has more empty streets than full
cannot seem to get it together to produce a worthy public transport network .
In London , a city with winding narrow roads which is massive and
virtually impossible to navigate , they manage to find space to create
bike lanes , bus lanes ( which are filled to the brim with double decker
buses ) , street cars , automated street cars , the London underground
( subway ) , the London Overground ( commuter rail ) , as well as normal
national rail , which stops all over London and its suburbs .
Now that
is not to say there is no traffic in London : it is absolutely
horrendous .
However the level of obvious effort that goes in the the
planning and construction , if not the operation , of public
transportation in London puts any American city to shame .
It is unfortunate that we seem to have such difficulty with this
seemingly simple issue , and doubly so because rather than trying to
educate a poorly informed population , our leaders appease them in hope
of getting elected , thus perpetuating the proble rather than solving it .
This issue is fundamental to reducing gas prices , traffic , CO2 emissions , and even fair access to services and jobs .
Until we begin to address our transportation dysfunction , we will remain a dirty , wasteful , and gridlocked nation .

A written prayer that Barack Obama left this week in the cracks of the Western Wall , Judaism 's holiest site , asking God to guide him and guard his family was published Friday in an Israeli paper .
" Lord _Protect my family and me , " the Democratic presidential candidate wrote in the note published in the Maariv daily .

Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just .
And make me an instrument of your will . "
( AP Photo / Tara Todras - Whitehil , File ) JERUSALEM ( AP ) 
A written prayer that Barack Obama left this week in the cracks of the Western Wall , Judaism 's holiest site , asks God to guide him and guard his family , an Israeli newspaper reported Friday .
" Lord -- Protect my family and me , " reads the note published in the Maariv daily .
" Forgive me my sins , and help me guard against pride and despair .
Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just .
And make me an instrument of your will . "
The paper 's decision to make the note public drew fire .
The rabbi in charge of the Western Wall , Shmuel Rabinovitz , said publishing the note intruded in Obama 's relationship with God .
" The notes placed between the stones of the Western Wall are between a person and his maker .
It is forbidden to read them or make any use of them , " he told Army Radio .
The publication " damages the Western Wall and damages the personal , deep part of every one of us that we keep to ourselves , " he said .
Another Israeli paper , Yediot Ahronot , published an article Friday saying it had also obtained the note but decided not to publish it to respect Obama 's privacy .
Many visitors to the 2,000 - year - old Western Wall leave notes bearing requests and prayers .
Obama did so during a pre-dawn visit there Thursday , following a day spent meeting Israeli and Palestinian leaders .
Maariv published a photograph of the note , which it said had been removed from the wall by a student at a Jewish seminary immediately after Obama left .
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs would neither confirm nor deny the note was Obama's .
The handwriting appeared to match a message Obama inscribed Wednesday in the guest book at Yad Vashem , Israel 's official Holocaust memorial , and was written on stationery from the King David Hotel , where Obama stayed while in Israel .
The visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories was part of an international tour meant to shore up Obama ' s foreign affairs credentials .
At the Western Wall , Obama was greeted by a crowd of curious onlookers and photographers .
He donned a white skullcap , listened to a rabbi read a prayer , and inserted a folded white piece of paper between the stones .
One hardline Israeli protester shouted , " Obama , Jerusalem is not for sale . "

The beauty prescription :
Why others see you as 20 per cent more attractive than you think you are
Beauty and mind medics Dr Debra Luftman and Dr Eva Ritvo have been best friends and medical practitioners for more than 25 years .
During this time , they 've seen hundreds of women with every kind of beauty concern - from fat thighs and acne to poor body image and low self - esteem .
Now , the two friends have pooled their combined expertise .
The result is The Beauty Prescription - The Complete Formula For Looking And Feeling Beautiful ( £ 13.99 , McGraw - Hill ) .
This new book is the ultimate mind - body guide offering a mix of practical inner and outer beauty advice .
' As a dermatologist , I see clients with more obvious external aesthetic beauty issues , ' says Dr Debra , who is based in Beverly Hills .
Summer beauty : Follow the beauty prescription to feel great
' Perhaps they 're worried about acne , or other skin problems such as sun damage or eczema .
Or they want to do something about their saddle - bags , cellulite or lines around their eyes .
Dr Eva deals with various psychological issues .
' We came up with the idea of a ' beauty prescription ' five years ago while on holiday in Jamaica .
We were talking about how so many of our clients had problems with poor body image and self - esteem .
We were just coming at them from different angles .
' The women I saw were looking for solutions through external , physical treatments - creams , laser surgery or liposuction .
Dr Eva 's clients in South Beach , Florida , were seeking psychological advice .
But , essentially , they all felt the same - that they were n't good enough .
' We realised then that between us we had the knowhow to come up with the perfect beauty prescription to help women feel and look more beautiful , from the inside and out . '
So , what 's so new about wanting to look more beautiful ?
Surely , that 's an ongoing battle for most women .
' There 's no doubt that if you feel more beautiful , this can help you to get more out of life , ' says Dr Debra .
' Just think how you feel when you know you look good .
' You 're more likely to walk into an interview or a party with your head held high .
You feel much more confident than you would when you 've got greasy hair and no make - up .
When you feel happy about the way you are , people can sense this and respond to you more positively .
' But the key here is how you feel .
True beauty is n't about being physically perfect : it 's about maximising your beauty potential .
When you do this , people will subconsciously want to treat you better . '
One of the main messages in the Beauty Prescription is that your physical attributes are only part of what makes you attractive .
Research shows that others see you as 20 per cent more attractive than you think you are .
That 's because , when you look in the mirror , you 're simply judging yourself on looks .
All you can see is your reflection - but none of the personality .
Of course , it 's important to make the best of what you 've got , ' says Dr Debra .
' But , there 's so much more to beauty than looks alone .
' A great figure , shiny hair and lovely skin may turn heads and get you noticed , but it takes more than that to be attractive .
' Beauty is also about the way you move , speak and express yourself .
It 's about good health , warmth , spontaneity and charisma . '
Dr Debra and Dr Eva believe anyone can learn how to feel and look more beautiful .
' The Beauty Prescription is n't just a guide to show you how to make yourself more physically perfect , ' says Dr Debra .
' It 's also a guide to help you develop your inner beauty . '
So , if you feel you could do with an overhaul , here are their top tips on how to become more beautiful inside and out .
THE BEAUTY - BRAIN LOOP
At the core of Dr Debra and Dr Eva 's advice is the Beauty - Brain Loop .
' This is a psychological tool that takes into account four main areas - Inner Beauty , Health , Outer Beauty and Environment , ' says psychiatrist Dr Eva .
' All of these are inter-related .
Each stage affects all the others .
Everything you do shapes how you feel and how attractive you are .
So , how you feel is how you look .
Also , how you think is how you feel . '
Inner Beauty is to do with mental and emotional well - being , self - esteem , self - awareness and self - confidence .
Health is part of the loop to do with taking care of your body and physical health through nutrition , exercise , sleep and leading a healthy lifestyle .
Outer Beauty is to do with maintaining your external looks - skin , nails , hair and make - up .
Environment is to do with the feedback you get from your surroundings : home , work , relationships and friendships .
So , how does the principle of the Beauty - Brain Loop work ?
' It 's about keeping all areas of the loop flowing , ' says Dr Debra .
' For example , when someone pays you a compliment and says you look really beautiful today , you actually start to feel more beautiful .
The more beautiful you feel , the more you want to maintain that feel - good state .
So , you start to look after yourself more , perhaps by exercising , eating better or paying attention to your skincare and make - up .
' In turn , the better you feel and look , the more positive the response you get from your environment .
Your friends tell you how great you look , people are more attracted to you and you feel confident .
' But , just as the Beauty - Brain Loop can be a positive circle , when one area is n't working , this can also set up a cycle of negativity . '
INNER BEAUTY
Want to be more beautiful instantly ?
Then the quickest thing you can do is to change your mindset .
Working on your inner beauty - how you feel inside - will enhance your overall attraction to others .
Dr Eva recommends the following tactics :
• SURROUND YOURSELF WITH BEAUTY :
This has a calming effect on the mind .
• PRACTISE RANDOM ACTS OF KINDNESS :
Do something for others - this will make you feel better about yourself .
• SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS :
When we accomplish things , this is a source of self - esteem .
• HAVE A LAUGH :
Go to comedy clubs , read humorous books , see funny friends .
• GIVE TO OTHERS : Try voluntary work .
• LOVE AND BE LOVED : Appreciate and make the most of all your relationships .
• BE AFFIRMATIVE : Replace negative thoughts with positive ones .
Tell yourself regularly : ' I am beautiful .
I am smart .
I deserve to be happy . '
You 'll be surprised how this can lift your mood .
Attraction : Others will see you as 20 per cent more attractive
HEALTH
If you 're not healthy , it 's difficult to be physically attractive .
These are the five keys ways to maintain good health :
• EXERCISE : Work out 30 to 60 minutes every day .
• NUTRITION : Eat a varied , balanced diet .
• SLEEP : If you scrimp on this , your looks and health will suffer .
• STRESS MANAGEMENT : Stress causes the body to release an excess of the chemicals adrenaline and cortisol .
These can have an adverse effect on the way you feel and look .
For example , many skin problems such as acne or eczema , have a tendency to flare up with stress .
• HEALTH CARE : Make sure you have regular medical checks .
OUTER BEAUTY
• CONSULT A MAKE -UP ARTIST : Learn what shades , texture and tools are best for your face shape , skin type and age .
Do n't necessarily head to the make - up counter of your local department store .
Talk to a make - up artist who is n't affiliated to a cosmetics company .
Ask your local beauty salon for recommendations .
• DAILY SKINCARE :
For healthy skin , follow a daily skincare routine that includes cleansing , toning and moisturising .
During the summer , apply sunscreen before you go out ( minimum SPF 15 ) .
Use exfoliators and masks once or twice a week .
• TAKE CARE OF YOUR COSMETICS .
Make - up can be a haven for bacteria , so make sure you replace products regularly .
• BE CAREFUL WITH COSMECEUTICALS :
These are cosmetics with additives , such as vitamins or alpha hydroxy acids that have effects similar to pharmaceutical products .
If you are not sure how to use these , always consult a dermatologist .
• PRACTISE AND LEARN : Read books and magazines , talk to make - up artists and try new techniques .
• CONSULT A DERMATOLOGIST : Do n't suffer in silence if you have a skin problem such as acne , allergies , eczema and psoriasis .
Ask your GP to refer you to a dermatologist .
• KEEP HANDS BEAUTIFUL :
Have regular manicures in a salon or at home .
• HAIR : Get it cut , coloured and styled .
• TEETH : Have regular dental check - ups .
• MAKE A LIST OF YOUR TOP THREE COSMETIC PRIORITIES :
For example , fat reduction , skin improvement , wrinkle reduction , acne treatment , teeth bleaching , hair colouring .
Work out a budget and timeline for achieving your goals .
Speak to an expert and get an honest assessment of the risk , benefits and costs .
• QUICK BEAUTY BOOSTERS : Enhance your smile : Tooth whitening or veneers can create dramatic results and make you feel more confident .
• Dress up - especially if you 're feeling low .
The worse you feel , the more important it is to make yourself feel better .
• Avoid pro-inflammatory foods that increase cortisol levels .
Cut out alcohol , caffeine , sugars and simple starches .
• Find something you feel passionate about .
The joy will show on your face .
ENVIRONMENT
' YOUR self - esteem , the way you dress , the way you look and act all affect how the environment reacts to you , ' says Dr Debra .
' If you 're constantly stressed , people will form a negative opinion .
' Social approval lifts your confidence and prompts you to look after yourself .
So , the feedback you get from others is important . '
• SOCIAL LIFE : Spend time with people who make you feel good .
• TOXIC RELATIONSHIPS : Avoid them - they will drag you down .
• LITTLE THINGS MATTER : Even something as simple as putting a vase of flowers on your desk can make you feel good .

Interview with Steven Barber
Earlier this month , The Fiction Circus caught wind of the black smell of burning paper , and followed it to find that a student had been kicked out of college after writing a controversial and " dark " short story for his creative writing class .
The guy 's name is Steven Barber , and the college from which he was booted is the University of Virginia at Wise .
We looked at the case and made up our minds about it , and asked him to send us his short story so that we could take a look at it and see what was so wrong .
He was nice enough to do that , and here 's what we discovered : it was a lot better than some of the things you guys send to us .
The story is about a writer who can't think of anything good to write and so he decides to kill himself and do some drugs , but not in that order .
The story has problems , of course , but it is certainly fiction , and it is certainly nothing to worry about .
Some of the drug lore is a bit much , but what college student does n't have Erowid bookmarked on their internet browser ?
Additionally , regardless of content , we firmly believe that judging who is crazy by looking at their works of art is an impossible task ( and unconstitutional ) .
John Wayne Gacy used to paint clowns .
He was a precinct captain for the Democratic Party .
He had high - level security clearance from the Secret Service , and was once photographed with Rosalynn Carter .
They found 27 boys and young men buried in the crawlspace of his house .
In the case of Steven Barber , his creative writing instructor -- uh , Christopher Scalia , son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , son of Eugene Scalia -- decided that his piece of writing was dangerous enough that Barber had to be FLAGGED AND DEALT WITH , before he went on a killing spree , or a " suicidal rampage . " ( Note :
It is a good thing Scalia was n't my college creative writing professor .
I once wrote a story about foreskin bacteria deciding that war is an absolute value and riding off to kill , murder , and rape at the penis 's ragged corona .
My kindly professor at the time said that it had interesting punctuation . )
Anyway , Barber had guns ; Barber just got out of the military ; Barber was a controversial figure on campus for his politics .
The cops gave him the stiff finger , and then they took him to a mental institution .
He is STILL not allowed to go back to school , and he has STILL not received any money from the government to pay for the college he is not allowed to attend .
We wanted to know more , so we offered Mr. Barber the deal we offer famous writers : we will pay for half of your bus ticket to come out to New York if you agree to let us interview you .
When Barber showed up at our offices , he seemed a little bit out of place .
He was nicely - dressed in a suit and tie , and he was carrying a briefcase in one hand and a ham sandwich in the other .
He looked at our wall - sized picture of naked Karl Marx getting a two - sided blowjob from some nice British girls and he raised an eyebrow .
" Yeah , uh , about that , " I said .
He picked up one of the big black dildoes to which we have attached wheels and which we use as race - cars to send messages to each other .
He looked at it , reading the post - it on the side .
" CARTER : MORE DRUGS !!!
WE ARE ARTISTS !!! -- Love , Verdammt " it said .
" Um , " I said .
He looked into the break room , where a group of dirty street urchins were receiving a lecture from Dr. Future on the best way to pick a pocket , and he bit his tongue diplomatically .
I could see that politically we were perhaps in different worlds .
But I saw a faded copy of John Stuart Mill 's " On Liberty " that someone had used to smash roaches in the hallway and I picked it up when he was n't looking .
I wiped off the leg segments and goo and held it up , grinning .
" John Stuart Mill ! " I said .
He seemed to relax .
" John Stuart Mill , " he said , graciously consenting to the interview .*** Barber :
If they insist on giving me so much material , who am I to object ?
In addition to being arrested , lots of writers have also been expelled from college .
John Locke was expelled from Christ 's Church , Oxford .
Robert Frost from Dartmouth .
Tom DeLay from Baylor .
Barber : Bombay Sapphire and Sailor Jerry . [ he grins ]
Seriously , I love Dostoevsky , Hunter S. Thompson , and Tom Robbins .
Barber : A historical anecdote .
When Henry Kissinger asked the Chinese envoy Zhou Enlai what he thought of the French Revolution , he replied " It 's too soon to tell .
" Barber : 90 % of the stuff I read is non-fiction .
I loved William F. Buckley 's " Cancel Your Own Goddamn Subscription . "
As for the last fictional book , it was George Orwell 's " 1984 . "
I picked it up the day they released me from the psych ward .
I only managed to get through about a third of it that day because I kept re-reading paragraphs that were eerily describing my situation .
Barber : I can't get into the groove for fiction .
Every line is pounded out one word at a time .
How that results in such bad judgment sometimes , well - - I have no idea .
Barber : Does politics count ?
Barber : At UVA Wise , I was double majoring in Political Science and Administration of Justice .
At the local community college , I 'm enrolled in a paralegal program .
I would like to go to law school to become " one of them " so I never have to depend on another " one of them .
" Barber :
At the time of the incident , I would guess over two hours a day .
Most of that was for my underground newspaper though .
Barber :
The official newspaper for UVA Wise , " The Highland Cavalier , " refused to publish a letter to the editor I wrote because it was too controversial .
For instance , regarding Ahmadinejad 's trip to Columbia , I wrote that " at least he managed the flight over without hijacking his own airplane .
" They lied about why they would n't publish it , not knowing that I had infiltrated their propaganda machine with spies .
So I started my own underground newspaper espousing some pretty radical libertarian / conservative ideas .
However , we are also the only ones that would publish the president of the Young Democratic Socialists .
The Cavalier 's excuse to ban him was that he used " big words .
"
Anyway , we did a few controversial stories , for instance on how the school is in violation of the federal code for not flying an American flag on campus .
We were loved by some and hated by others .
Barber : I had a creative writing class in high school .
It was really boring and I do n't remember much of it .
Barber :
There really were n't rules per se .
Only suggestions .
After some idiot basically wrote the plot out for the game Counterstrike , a " body count " rule was issued on how many people could die in a given short story .
Ironically , no one dies in mine .
He " preferred " that we not write in first person because it's so hard to separate the narrator from the character consistently , blah blah blah .
Barber : Every day , we circled up and shared criticism about what we were assigned to read .
Sometimes it was another student 's stories .
Sometimes it was something professional .
The structure was fine , and for the most part , I got along with class .
Though at this point I assume some did n't get along with me .
Barber : Work - shopped publicly .
What I submitted was the first draft to face the scrutiny of my peers .
Barber : An intense workshop .
That 's about it .
Barber : Full disclosure : I 'm one of those radical Republicans who really , really likes his dad .
Having said that , his son is an absolute nutjob .
He freaks out every time his dad is mentioned .
My girlfriend ( who was particularly close to Professor Scalia ) wore a shirt that said " Matter of Interpretation " -- the name of Scalia 's book -- as part of a protest in support of me .
He made her cover it up in class .
Barber :
Yes , this story about a girl murdering her boyfriend was great .
A guy wrote about a futuristic dystopia that was amazing .
There was a ghost - story that had me hooked the whole way through .
Professor Scalia 's criticism was " It 's really good except for the ghost thing . "
His favorite TV show is " Flava of Love , " with Flava Flav , by the way .
Barber :
There was a protest at my hearing where I got expelled .
They all had teeshirts with " Steve spoke free and so will we " on them .
Other students would be glad to see me go for any reason , so they were happy .
Most of my professors really miss me .
I keep in touch .
I imagine that there a few professors and administrators that had a few celebratory drinks when I lost my appeal .
Barber :
In theory .
In practice I still have n't seen the first check .
I hate bureaucracy with a hot , hot hate .
Barber : More fun .
Everyone knows the rules .
Everyone knows the traditions that bend the rules .
Everyone has a fair shot to play the game .
In college they make up shit as they go along .
Barber : Looking at the campus police reports , it appears that the administration decided that I was to be " committed . "
They took me to a crisis counselor telling me that it was for " evaluation .
" I did n't know it then , but the crisis counselor is actually a board member of one of the college affiliated organizations .
Anyway , I thought the interview was going pretty good -- I asked to go the bathroom and I told her I had a pocketknife and that she could keep it as a sign of good - faith .
She said that would n't be necessary .
Next thing I know , they have a " temporary detention order " -- a TDO -- from the civil magistrate .
The paperwork for the TDO has contradictions all over it .
One paper says I have only suicidal ideation .
The other says I have both suicidal and homicidal ideation .
She passed the opportunity to mark my mood as depressed ( " circle all the following that apply : Mood : Depressed , Anxious , Nervous , Paranoid " etc. ) but then wrote in my diagnosis that I suffered from a depressed mood .
To fulfill the TDO , I was locked up in a mental institution for three days for intense evaluation .
There was a trial - type thing on the third day with a special justice , defense counsel , my case manager representing the nut - house , and an independent psychologist .
They adjudicated me to be not mentally ill or a threat to myself or others .
No. Shit. Sherlock .
Barber : I 'm a really good actor .
[ he grins again ]
Seriously , I actually did my best to keep my emotions under control .
I apparently did that too well : they categorized my " range of affect " as being " constricted .
" Barber : Probably not .
I would n't be able to resist having the character do the horrible things he was accused of thinking about that led to all of the drama with the administration .
It would be really funny -- but in poor taste .
Barber : I think a professor is free to set whatever standard he or she wishes .
If the goal of the class in the academic sense is to explore beauty , truth , and justice then there should be no limits .
If a professor is just teaching how to write instead of facilitating some literary spirit quest , then they should have the license to restrict a lot , if they wish .
However , these restrictions or lack of restrictions should be explicitly stated on day one .
I really doubt that academia makes for good writing .
Tools , squares , " the man " -- all of these people make for a hostile writing environment .
Why must they insist on immanentizing the eschaton ?
I 'll use an analogy .
If a chess teacher wants to teach his pupils the technical aspects behind hypermodern openings , you can't go off playing the center counter game .
In that sense , there should be some limits .
You are n't trying to win , you 're trying to learn " how to . "
Not everything done in a classroom should automatically have artistic value .
Barber : Yes , actually .
I 'm not sharing them though -- I do n't want to get sent back .
I will say this , however : the place I was at allowed smoking , and even had complimentary cigs for anyone who was taken in without them .
Between lithium and a cigarette , I 'll side with a cigarette every time .
The first night and the next day were scary .
By the time Sunday rolled around , I was having a good time in a " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " kinda way .
Barber : I 'm more concerned with the expulsion .
And making false statements to the commonwealth attorney saying I had been involuntarily committed when I had only been temporarily detained .
These are very , very different things -- legally -- when it comes to firearms .
I got my concealed carry permit as soon as I was 21 and back in the States .
I 've been carrying ever sense .
I lived in a dorm room , so I was uncomfortable having them in my room .
So I kept them in my car .
Only one of them was easily accessible from the driver 's seat .
The third one was n't loaded nor was there ammunition for it in the car .
As for the legality of the guns and the illegality of the gun-ban , Virginia has a pre-emption law which does n't let certain forms of the government restrict firearms .
Specifically it says that state " agencies " can't do this .
UVA Wise and UVA proper are State Agency No. 85 according to the Virginia Administrative Code .
It 's not just that I did n't break the law , the school administration DID break the law .
For the " guns are scary and therefore have no place on campus " crowd , consider this : after 9/11 , Muslims are scary and therefore have no place on campus .
Both those statements are illogical to me .
Barber : I talked to the NRA - recommended lawyer and he said a suit was winnable but would cost about 70 grand .
And because I got in trouble in September , there was no way the NRA would risk paying for it .
So right now I 'm waiting for the Supreme Court to rule on the Heller Case establishing the 2nd Amendment as an individual right .
Our Student Handbook says : " " The College is a community of scholars in which the ideals of freedom of inquiry , freedom of thought , freedom of expression , and freedom of the individual are sustained .
It is committed to preserving the exercise of any right guaranteed to individuals by the Constitution .
"
The next step then is to start pushing for indictments to be filed against administrators of the college .
According to the FBI website , it is " a crime for any person acting under color of law , statute , ordinance , regulation , or custom to willfully deprive or cause to be deprived from any person those rights , privileges , or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution and laws of the U.S.
" So hopefully the legal eagles at Charlottesville will see that they face potential jail time , see that VA has a pre-emption law for firearms that the school violated , and see that they perjured themselves to a commonwealth attorney about me being ' involuntarily committed . '
Hopefully they 'll shit the bed , and offer me free tuition .
Barber :
As for what people have gotten wrong : I was n't involuntarily committed .
I never slept with a gun under my pillow .
At least not in college .
I do n't think it 's logically possible to have a " suicidal rampage " and I sure as hell did n't write about one .
The guns were a loaded .45 , a loaded .22 derringer , and an unloaded 9 mm .
I cooperated with police the whole time .
They did n't " discover " the guns -- I told them about them , about my permit , and I also gave them a rather long lesson on Virginia 's pre-emption law .
The press ALWAYS leaves out that Daphne Blanton , the counselor who issued my TDO , is a board member on a UVA Wise - affiliated organization known as the " Wesley Foundation . "
It 's a case of blatant conflict of interest .
And the other thing the press ignores is that UVA 's gun ban is illegal .
I could talk about it all day , but for a detailed analysis , check out my website .
Barber : A lot of unnecessary tension .
But everyone that 's a friend , family , or love interest supports me .
In fact , I officially proposed to my girl last night .
Barber :
She 's seen me in the nut house , get expelled , castigated in her home - town paper , and she said yes .
I 'm hoping my Jedi mind tricks keep working until she 's bound by contractual agreement .
She 's seen the story and said : " Other than being too colloquial for my tastes , it was interesting and engaging .
" Barber : I would like to write a weekly politics column .
Maybe publish a book later .
Barber :
My advice is do n't take a creative writing class .
Read the classics instead .
Try Running 26.2 Miles In THIS
Running a marathon is hard enough for most people .
Some people , nonetheless , like to mix in some extra sweating and chaffing via elaborate “ marathon costumes ” .
Sometimes these costumes are just for fun , but often they are used to raise awareness and money for benevolent causes .
Below are some of the most creative , hilarious , and uncomfortable marathon outfits ever witnessed .
Save the Rhino – London 2007 – 22 lbs rhino suit + 26.2 miles + 77 °F ( 25°C )
NYC 2005 – to raise awareness for testicular cancer
London 2008 – Michelle Frost , first marathon on stilts – 8 hr 25 min
Spidey ’s up against a new nemesis – the pulled hammy .
Masai warriors from Tanzania compete in traditional dress to raise money to provide their village with water .
If you look closely you can see that they have old car tires as shoes .
– London 2008
These men ran a half - marathon in full fire fighter ’s gear , including oxygen tanks .

Richard Williams smokes marijuana regularly .
But he does n’t consider himself a criminal , and does n’t think he should be treated like one .
The 46 - year - old Richmondville resident has been HIV positive for two decades .
Smoking marijuana , he said , relieves the pain in his joints and helps him cope with persistent bouts of nausea .
He has hepatitis C and a damaged liver , so he does n’t want to take pain medication , which is processed by the liver .
Williams supports legalizing the use of medical marijuana in New York .
He ’s hoping the state Legislature will pass a law that does so before adjourning later this month .
“ I do n’t use other drugs , ” Williams said .
“ I ’m not a drug addict . …
I ’m speaking out because someone has to stand up for what ’s right . ”
Last year the Assembly passed a bill that would legalize medical marijuana ; a new version of the bill has moved out of the codes committee , and another version is pending in the Senate .
Those who support the bill are optimistic that this is the year New York legalizes medical marijuana .
The Assembly bill , sponsored by Rep. Richard Gottfried , D - Manhattan , would allow patients to use marijuana only if they have life - threatening or debilitating conditions , and only if their doctors believe it would be the most effective treatment .
Patients and caregivers would register with the state and receive identification cards that would allow them to legally purchase marijuana for medicinal use .
They would be allowed to grow up to 12 plants and to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana , though a state - regulated distribution system would eventually replace home cultivation .
This transition would hinge on the federal government ’s approval of the state - regulated distribution system .
Last year , the Assembly passed legislation legalizing medical marijuana for the first time , and this year ’s version of the bill attempts to address the concerns that derailed its chances in the Senate .
Some legislators felt that last year ’s bill did not provide for adequate regulation ; the new bill mandates that registered organizations such as pharmacies , nonprofit organizations created for the purposing of selling marijuana to chronically sick people and local health departments handle sale and distribution of the drug .
Twelve states have legalized medical marijuana , with New Mexico , which legalized medical marijuana last summer , the most recent to do .
The Marijuana Policy Project , a Washington , D.C. , advocacy group that supports legalizing medical marijuana and overall reform of the country ’s marijuana laws , is pushing the state to pass the Assembly legislation .
Right now , television advertisements created by the group are running in the Capital Region , Long Island and the Buffalo area .

Burton Aldrich , 45 , a quadriplegic from Kingston , appears in the 30 - second television advertisement .
“ I do n’t know if I would be around if it was n’t for marijuana , ” he says , in the advertisement .
“ It should n’t be a crime to treat pain and suffering . ”
Aldrich became a quadriplegic in 1999 , when he crushed his spinal cord in a diving accident .
He has limited use of his arms and fingers , can wiggle his toes , and remains confined to a wheelchair .
“ I ’m very fortunate , ” he said , in a phone interview .
“ It could have been worse . ”
His body is wracked by intense spasms , and he experiences searing pain in his extremities , as well as pounding headaches that disrupt his sleep .
He said he ca n’t take painkillers because they cause constipation .
But through marijuana and meditation , he said he ’s found a solution .
Aldrich tried marijuana around two years ago , while returning from a sailing trip with a friend .
He was in pain , and his friend offered him some marijuana .
“ My spasms went away , ” he said .
“ My pain went away like a bucket of water dropped on me . ”
“ I do n’t flaunt it , ” Aldrich said , of smoking marijuana .
“ I ’m only pushing it because I do n’t think it should be illegal .
It ’s a medicine . ”
Williams and Aldrich both said they would rather grow their own marijuana than go to state - regulated distribution centers to acquire their drugs .
They said they think the federal government is more likely to raid state - designated distribution centers than individuals growing marijuana for their own use .
The Marijuana Policy Project would like the federal government to legalize the use of medical marijuana .
In lieu of that , the group supports efforts to legalize medical marijuana at the state level .
“ As long as the federal government is opposed , the states are left to deal with it themselves , ” said Dan Bernath , the assistant director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project .
He said the federal government has made it clear that it will not target and raid sick individuals who are using marijuana to reduce symptoms and pain .
“ There are sick people in New York who are relying on medical marijuana , ” Bernath said .
“ They ’re using it with a doctor ’s recommendation , and right now they ’re criminals for doing so .
Arrest is always on their minds .
It ’s a real fear .
They ’re forced to go on the street and deal with drug dealers . ”
People who grow their own marijuana also risk running into trouble with the law , he said .
“ One of the maddening things about the illegality of medical marijuana is that its safety and efficacy has been established .
…
Real people really do need this .
It ’s just unconscionable to let them suffer when we could be doing something to help them . ”
‘ best treatment ’
Treatments for cancer and HIV are always improving — for instance , the side effects from AIDS drugs are not nearly as debilitating as they once were — but that does n’t mean there ’s no need for medical marijuana , Bernath said .
“ There ’s always going to be a subpopulation that finds medical marijuana to be the best treatment , ” he said .
“ I do n’t think anybody sees medical marijuana as a cure for everybody .
But there are always going to be some people who will benefit . ”
Williams , who has purchased marijuana for himself and friends who are chronically ill , is all too familiar with the risks of buying marijuana .
On one excursion to the Bronx , a friend was arrested after buying marijuana for him .
He said marijuana also provides him with mental relief .
“ There are so many good things it does , and so few bad things , ” Williams said .
Because he is on disability , he buys marijuana when he can afford to , “ not all the time . ”
He said he ’s been living on disability since being forced to retire from his job as a press room supervisor .
“ When I was working , marijuana helped me work and deal with the pain , ” Williams said .
“ If I could afford it , and I did n’t have to worry about being busted , I ’d probably use it more . ”
Bernath said it ’s difficult to determine how many New Yorkers would register as users of medical marijuana if it was legalized .
In Rhode Island , he noted , fewer than 200 people have registered , but New York is a bigger state .
Since the very beginning of video gaming there have been reviews and to go with those reviews there have been scores .
These have been useful tools for the public when coming to a buying decision , especially when games are expensive to the point of being overpriced .
And as a tool for the publisher to get an independent ( supposedly ) view on the merits or otherwise of their game .
Of course scores have been the subject of abuse .
By publishers buying a drink , or even more , for the reviewer or their boss and maybe even using the blackmail of advertising spend .
By journalists being deliberately controversial to court publicity for themselves or their journal .
I experienced this at Codemasters when Edge gave Severance , Blade of Darkness two out of ten which was just pure sensationalism from them .
Other examples are Amiga Power giving International Rugby Challenge 2 % and Sega Zone giving Socket : Time Dominator 0 % .
These abuses from both sides reduced the credibility of an individual score for a game .
So it is especially useful if you can see a lot of different review scores for a game at the same time and so discount the obvious aberrations .
This is what Game Rankings does and I have used this countless times as a tool to help in my work .
Most notably to prove to the directors of Codemasters that their game quality was slipping in comparison to their direct competitors .
Then in 2001 Metacritic came along and changed the world .
Firstly they convert all the review scores into percentages , then they average them to come up with one figure .
( They also weight the average so more respected reviewers have more influence . )
This single figure to represent a game is a very powerful thing and everybody in the industry is far more aware now of game Metacritics than they ever were of individual review scores , they have become the standard benchmark for the industry .
In 2004 Jason Hall of Warner Brothers started putting Metacritic scores into contracts with game publishers in order to protect his brands .
Their royalty payments became higher if the game received a low score .
Publishers seized on this idea with their contracts with developers , whose income therefore no longer depended purely on sales , it also depended on Metacritic and therefore review scores and therefore game quality .
This practice has now become widespread throughout the industry with stories of a million selling game netting it ’s developer zero income because it ’s Metacritic was below the contractual minimum .
Investors too have caught up with the importance of Metacritic and now a company ’s stock price will go down sharply when a new game gets a bad score ( and vice versa ) .
This can change the value of a company quite markedly on the basis of the magic number .
With all this it will come as no surprise that game developers now remunerate their staff partly on the Metacritic scores that their work produces .
Bonuses are often directly tied to the score .
The simple fact is that there is a very strong correlation between review scores and sales with only the occasional exception .
“ Activision Chief Executive Robert Kotick says the link was especially notable for games that score above 80 % .
For every five percentage points above 80 % , Activision found sales of a game roughly doubled .
Activision believes game scores , among other factors , can actually influence sales , not just reflect their quality . ”
John Riccitiello , CEO of Electronic Arts , uses Metacritic as one of the most important measures of the performance of his company and is unhappy when they go down , telling Wall Street analysts “ Our core game titles are accurately measured and summarized by these assessments , and that is a very big deal . ”
He is determined to get the company average score over 80 , which is a good target for everyone in the industry to have .
And finally , for consumers spending $ 60 on a game , Metacritic is one of the best ways they can be sure to get value for money .
UPDATE | 6/5 7:40 PM : Comcast objected to the first version of this post , which referred to its method for identifying heavy users as a blacklist .
After several conversations , including a call with Mitch Bowling , Comcast ’s senior vice president and general manger of its Internet service , I ’ve rewritten the headline and a bit of the explanation about how the system being tested works .
Some Comcast customers who actively download software and video files may soon find one set of unexplained delays replaced with a different sort of equally cryptic slowdowns .
Comcast is starting to test new approaches to protecting its network from what it describes as congestion caused by a handful of customers who use far far more bandwidth than everyone else .
Until now , Comcast has been using devices that interfered with the BitTorrent protocol — the most common method for downloading large files from computers of other users .
BitTorrent is often used by people exchanging pornography and illegal copies of movies , but creators of video and software also choose to use BitTorrent as an inexpensive way to distribute their creations .
[ This section has been updated ]
Comcast will test new devices that can identify which Internet customers have been particularly heavy users of bandwidth at any given time .
At times when the network in a given neighborhood is congested , it will slow down the Internet connections of those heavy users .
For now , these restrictions are just as mysterious as the secret blocking of BitTorrent .
The company wo n’t say how much usage will be required to have your connection impaired or how much slower it will get .
Mitch Bowling , Comcast ’s senior vice president and general manger of its Internet service , said the system will look at the bandwidth used over a period of minutes .
That means that someone who downloads a single song wo n’t go into the slow late , but someone that downloaded a whole movie might , regardless of whether the movie is from iTunes or over BitTorrent .
Most significantly , Comcast wo n’t even tell its customers if or when they are having their connections throttled .
Mr. Bowling said that customers certainly would notice a slowdown .
If users stop downloading for several minutes — he would n’t say how long — their connections will be restored to full speed .
Comcast , which was criticized for not being forthright about its restrictions on BitTorrent , has promised to find a new approach that will block heavy users of bandwidth regardless of what content or communication protocol they are using .
It is starting three 30 - day tests , each of a different sort of hardware that it might use as the traffic cop for its new restrictions .
On Thursday , it will start tests in Chambersburg , Penn. , and Warrenton , Va . Later in the summer it will conduct another test in Colorado Springs , Colo .
Charlie Douglas , a Comcast spokesman , said that the test is meant to pick hardware vendor and test different configurations of rules .
He points out that the vast majority of users wo n’t see any changes to their service at all .
“ When we roll this out nationally by the end of the year , all those types of questions will be answered , ” he said .
“ We are trying to figure out what do customers want , what techniques need to be in place to create the best user experience . ”
Still , how the company can test the effect on its customers without explaining the rules to them and giving them visibility into their own usage remains to be seen .
Until that happens , I suspect Comcast will stay on the black list of at least the heaviest users .
The Associated Press recently pulled a Metallica online , and no , that ’s not a good thing .
Metallica , one of the most popular heavy - metal bands of all time , has become a symbol for cluelessness about the Internet -- witness the episode two weeks go , when the band forced music bloggers to take down reviews of its as - yet - unreleased new album after inviting them to hear it .
Last week , the AP sicced its lawyers on the Drudge Retort , demanding the removal of six blog posts and a comment that included excerpts from AP stories .
Each item , in fact , consisted of little more than a headline , a link to an AP story on Yahoo or an AP member ’s site , and a short excerpt -- less than 80 words , or about half the length of the paragraph you just read .
In a letter sent to the Retort , the AP argued that this violated its copyrights and its rights under the Supreme Court ’s “ hot news ” ruling from 1918 .
In that case , the court held that a rival news service owned by William Randolph Hearst misappropriated the AP ’s reporting by siphoning the facts out of breaking news dispatches .
As Jeff Jarvis of the BuzzMachine blog observed , the complaints are painfully ironic coming from a news organization that often recycles its member newspapers ’ work without acknowledging or linking to the original stories .
The AP has an obvious interest in preventing its work from being used for free by outlets that compete with its paying customers , including the Los Angeles Times .
But it seems to misunderstand how the Internet has changed the way people find and discuss the news .
As in so many other industries , the producers of news are losing control over its dissemination .
Readers decide where they want to get news -- for example , at the Drudge Retort , a liberal take - off on the conservative ( and far more popular ) Drudge Report -- and which stories are important .
Trying to stop people from posting excerpts around the Web is akin to asking them not to talk about a story they ’ve read .
Besides , if the AP does its job well , the excerpts will whet readers ’ appetites for the rest of the story , leading them back to the original .
Representatives of the AP and the Media Bloggers Assn. are expected to meet today , and the AP might offer guidelines for what it considers acceptable uses of its material .
But courts decide copyright disputes on a case - by - case basis , and there ’s a well - established fair - use defense for using excerpts for the sake of commentary .
A better strategy for the AP would be to promote its work to bloggers , who can help elevate it above the online news din .
After all , the problem for most news sources is n’t that too many people misappropriate their work online , it ’s that too few see it at all .
" I 'm just one person , I ca n't make a difference " .
All of us probably think this at some point in our lives .
That 's where the problem lies .
We are all just one person .
Even those freaky schizophrenic guys who believe otherwise are still just one person .
Imagine if everybody at the same time thought that they were just a single individual who could n't make a difference and it came time to vote for a new country leader .
Nobody would vote , because nobody thinks his or her vote will count .
Then what ?
We run into the exact same phenomenon when it comes to the environment .
Now I can hear you moan " no , not the environment , I 'm sick of hearing about the environment .
Who do you think you are ?
Al Gore ? "
I 'm not trying to say that we all need to save the environment , but we all need to save the environment ...
Were you just thinking that you are just one person and you can't make a difference ?
What about that single coke can , it 's not going to destroy the planet all by itself ?
It 's all about a united bunch of individuals .
One person can't do anything , but if everybody tried , then something would get done .
We do n't need some big brother to watch us , or somebody to organize this .
We all know what to do , but we think we do n't count .
A bigger problem is when we think " ah , someone else will take care of that " .
That 's when we swallow the cyanide .
If everybody thinks that someone else will take care of whatever it is that needs taken care of , then it will never get done .
Sorry I 'm gonna talk about the environment again , because it 's the best and most relevant example .
We stupid humans keep thinking thatwill clean up the trash , will stop pollution , will save the planet .
No , man !
There is no !
There 's you , and you and you .
Nobody else is going to care if we kill the planet .
So now when we start getting the idea , we sink deeper into our hole of ignorance .
Somebody else will read this , and somebody else will take it to heart and start being an environmentalist .
Cut the shit .
I do n't want anybody thinking that somebody else is even reading this .
I do n't even want comments on this Rambling .
You are the only one who 's reading this , and you are the one who 's got to think for yourself .
The Los Angeles Police Department engaged in religious discrimination by disciplining an employee for off - duty remarks made about homosexual acts , an LAPD sergeant has alleged in a lawsuit filed against the city and the department .
In a fall 2006 eulogy delivered at a fellow officer ’s funeral , Sgt. Eric Holyfield , who also is a pastor , said homosexual acts were “ sinful ” and an “ abomination ” and would lead to condemnation in hell , or the “ lake of fire , ” if one did not repent , according to a lawsuit he filed June 19 in Los Angeles County Superior Court .
After those comments , LAPD passed him up for promotions and pay raises in retaliation , Holyfield alleges in the suit , saying that he was discriminated against for his religion and that his 1st Amendment rights were violated .
Cmdr .
Stuart Maislin , head of LAPD ’s risk - management office , said the department ’s ability to control an off - duty officer ’s speech is a “ very gray area . ”
But remarks by officers may raise red flags , particularly when bias is expressed against a group of people , Maislin said .

“ When it comes to enforcing the law , it has to be done impartially , treating everybody with respect , ” said Maislin , who declined to comment specifically on Holyfield ’s case .
“ We are concerned , clearly , about the type of speech our employees engage in . ”
Holyfield made the remarks in September 2006 at the Whittier funeral of Officer Nathaniel Warthon Jr. , whose family asked the sergeant to deliver a short sermon .
Before a large audience in a chapel , Holyfield identified himself as a sergeant and as the fallen officer ’s supervisor , according to the suit , but was clad in black clergy attire rather than his uniform .
According to the suit , Holyfield quoted Bible passages and elaborated that “ men should not lie with men ; women should not lie with women .
To do so was an abomination or sinful ; one must repent or be condemned to hell . ”
Holyfield , in the suit , said the words came to him through God in prayer and meditation as he prepared for the sermon .
Advertisement
Among those at the funeral was Deputy Chief Charlie Beck , commanding officer of operations in the South Bureau .
Beck , named as a defendant , filed a formal complaint against Holyfield after the funeral .
The suit alleges that Beck ’s actions were based on “ religious biases . ”
The suit alleges that as a result of the complaint , Holyfield was removed from his position in community relations , moved back to patrol and passed up for a number of promotions .
Holyfield ’s supervisor at the time , Capt .
James Craig , told Holyfield that his remarks created a “ buzz ” that went “ all the way to the top ” of the department , according to the suit .
Craig , who is named in the suit , declined to comment .
The department has “ historically discriminated . . . and continues to discriminate against officers that cite from the Holy Bible , ” the suit alleges .

The suit seeks back pay , punitive damages and compensation for distress .

Black Star Sapphire of Queensland Being Held Captive
This story sounds like something seen in a movie theater .
Famous Beverly Hills jeweleris being accused of a pretty big crime .
He could end up paying dearly for it if he is found guilty .
Jack Armstrong and Gabrielle Grobe - Guiton are jewelers and the owners of the valuable 733 - carat Black Star Sapphire of Queensland .
Unfortunately they can't get their hands on it because Harry Winston is holding it hostage .
A lawsuit has been filed with the LA County Superior Court stating that famed jeweler H.W. was sent the gem on loan and now wo n't return the valuable sapphire .
Armstrong is claiming to have a potential buyer for the stone and needs to have the piece appraised but Winston will not give it up .
In the lawsuit Armstrong is asking for $ 5 million in damages and a whopping $ 20 million for punitive damages .
Check out a picture of the stone on TMZ here .
IF BARACK Obama does n't win November 's presidential election in the United States , " you can kiss the Democratic Party goodbye " , the actor and director Robert Redford told an audience in Dublin last night .
Speaking at a public interview in Trinity College in advance of his conferral with an honorary degree by the university today , Redford said he hoped Obama would win because while John McCain " represents yesterday " , the Democrat embodied the sort of change America needed .
Asked by Michael Dwyer , film correspondent of The Irish Times , if he was looking forward to " regime change " in the US , Redford said : " Yes .
Where my country is at the moment , I 'm not confident of anything .
I 'm hopeful .
" I think Obama is not tall on experience . . . but I believe he 's a really good person .
He 's smart .
And he does represent what the country needs most now , which is change .
" I hope he 'll win .
I think he will .
If he does n't , you can kiss the Democratic Party goodbye .
I think we need new voices , new blood .
We need to get a whole group out , get a new group in . "
The 71 - year - old Redford is best known for his roles in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid , The Stingand All the President 's Men .
He won his first Oscar as a director for the emotional family drama Ordinary Peoplein 1980 .
After receiving a standing ovation from a crammed auditorium when he arrived just before 6.30 pm , Redford spoke of his close relationship with the late Sydney Pollack , and of the protracted process of bringing to screen Jeremiah Johnson - an innovatively - made film that still brings him pride but was initially unloved by the distributor - culminating in its proper release four years after it was shot .
Redford told Dwyer he rarely watched his own films .
" I 'm not comfortable with it , " he said , adding that the first time he watched his own performance in The Stingwas when he sat down to show it to his grandson .
" When he told me he had n't seen The Sting , I said : what 's wrong with your mother ?
And then it came out that I had n't seen it either .
So we watched it .
I thought it was great . "
Since the 1970s Redford has campaigned on green issues and has been a critic of the environmental policies of US president George Bush in recent years .
He recalled laconically how , when he spoke out against energy companies ' interests in the 1970s , their representatives would deride him as " only an actor " .
" That had a lot of weight . . . until Reagan was elected .
Now things have changed so much .
You 're not alone out there . "
Asked what he would say to the G8 leaders if he was at their summit in Hokkaido this week , Redford said he would challenge the argument that drilling in places such as Alaska was more essential than ever now that oil prices were so high .
" I would make a great case for why that 's absurd and why there 's a better picture to be drawn from new technologies .
I would hit that point very hard . "
And does he harbour political ambitions of his own ?
" No .
Never did , never would .
That would be a great mistake . "

Credit Card Forensics
Hal Berghel
ROOM KEYS THAT AREN'T
A few years back local law enforcement brought an interesting question to one of my labs :
Why were hookers , tweakers , and thugs carrying around pockets full of hotel room keys ?
Busts of the local street ciminals were producing a virtual cornucopia of hotel room keys of all shapes and sizes .
In addition , the cops found gift cards , rewards cards , player 's cards , calling cards , membership cards - virtually everything that had a magnetic stripe on it .
It turned out that the magnetic stripes contained credit card information .
The source data was either " skimmed " or " duped " from the original card and then recorded on the magnetic stripe of hotel room keys with widely available card reader / writers .
Tthere was a burgeoning industry in this form of credit card fraud , with well - organized groups working within a moderately well - defined chain of command .
The bottom - feeders were collecting the information and passing it up to the criminal leadership who then either imprinted the account information on the room keys , brokered the account information over the Internet , or traded the information with other criminals
The most prevalent threat was skimming since it does n't require separating the card from the owner .
This produces a much longer useful life for the credit card information - by the time the user or credit card company discovers that the card has been compromised , the thieves have already moved on to the next victim .
A common skimming tactic is to " double swipe " - once at the point - of - sale terminal , and once on a hand held device .
Current battery powered skimmers about the size of a thumb , cost less than $ 500 , can hold thousands of credit cards , and have USB interfaces for ease of downloading .
At the time of this investigation , local law enforcement discovered that most of the skimming was taking place in ethnic restaurants .
The wait person could easily conceal the skimmer in their apron or a pocket and complete a shift with dozens to hundreds of credit cards skimmed .
The first batch of discovered hotel room keys produced some confusion .
Local law enforcement was not used to seeing so many hotel room keys on anyone .
But after the credit card information was discovered , the proverbial light went on .
In the State of Nevada it was illegal to possess more than two credit / debit cards in another 's name .
The criminals new if they were found with actual credit cards , they would be arrested .
So their workaround was to copy the magnetic information onto the surrogate cards to avoid detection and detention .
The jig was up when law enforcement found out what kind of information was on the hotel room key magnetic stripes .
DIGITAL CSI
When Deputy Chief Dennis Cobb brought this caper to our attention , he challenged us to develop a hand - held scanner that could detect whether anomalous data was on a magnetic stripe without actually reading or storing the data .
Legally , knowing * that * there is credit card information on a hotel room key is a very different piece of evidence than knowing * what * credit card information was on it .
Our first challenge was to define what it was to be an anomaly in this context .
When IBM created the magnetic stripe card technology in the 1960s they allowed different industries to influence the format of the three tracks on the stripes .
The airlines industry got first pick on track one , where the banking community defined track 2 and the savings / thrifts defined track 3 .
A de facto standard recording density for most industries and applications is 210 bits / in for all 3 tracks .
Track 1 is a 7 - bit format , while tracks 2 and 3 are 5 - bit .
Since track 1 has the larger character set , only it has alphanumeric - cum - special character capability .
Tracks 2 and 3 are limited to the ASCII hex 30 - 3f characters .
Of course , these formats could vary widely by application .
For brevity , we 'll confine our present attention to the financial industry , and more specifically , to credit cards .
There are several ISO / IEC standards that apply to magnetic stripes on credit cards , especially ISO / IEC 7810 - 7813 .
The related specification , ISO / IEC 4909:2006 , applies to the thrift industry and a similar discussion that is beyond our present focus would apply to it .
These standards specify the physical characteristics , layout , track densities and formats , merchant ID codes , etc. for financial transactions cards .
Of specific interest to us were ISO / IEC 7813:2006 relating to the data structure and content of magnetic tracks 1 and 2 .
Of course there is considerable variety in the data specifications between credit card issuers that have to be accommodated when scanning the card .
We 'll deal with a generic case , below :
field length definition example 1 1 start sentinel % 2 1 format code ( alphabetic ) B=format code for bank / financial industry 3 <=19 primary account number 121741512345678 4 1 field separator * 5 <= 26 holder 's name sutton / willie 6 4 expiration date ( MMYY ) 0503 7 3 service code 101 8 5 PIN Verification Value 51395 9 var discretionary data 10 1 end sentinel ^ 11 1 Longitudinal Redundancy Check Character 1
Myriad subtle differences may be found within this generic scheme .
Again , for brevity well only mention that they , too , may be used to authenticate the information as belonging to a credit card .
The over - arching idea behind this analysis is that the more information on the magnetic stripe that conforms to credit card formats , the higher the probability that this information is a credit card record .
The goal is to provide law enforcement with immedidate feedback that produces probable cause for further forensic investigation .
The figures below illustrate some of the features of our scanning system , CardSleuth ( pat. pend ) .
Note that in Figure 1 only the red stop light is indicated ( accompanied by sound ) , meaning that the mag stripe scanned is not what would have been expected .
In this case , we were looking for hotel room key information on the mag stripe , but the red light indicates that we found a credit / debit card information .
This satisfies our requirement of reporting " that " rather than reporting " what . "
Figure 2 is the " forensics " view of the mag stripe information - normally seen by detectives after an arrest / court order / etc. has been issued .
This confirms the format of the data described above .
Figure 3 reports the result of looking for a hotel room key and finding it .
Figure 1 : View from hand held scanner : looking for hotel room key information but finding credit card information .
Figure 2 : : Forensic view of looking for hotel room key information but finding credit card information .
The notion of anomaly deserves further explanation ..
Recall that our goal was to detect anomalies , one example of which is credit card information on a hotel room key .
Of course , the converse would also be an anomaly .
Though we have n't detected this as yet , it 's entirely possible that criminals could put hotel room information on a credit card so that they might conceal that they have access to a victim 's room .
Again , the criminal reasoning would be similar to the more - than - 2  case : if criminal activity were suspected in a hotel room , a holder of a hotel room key to that room might be suspect .
But what is the likelihood that an investigator will swipe a worn , embossing - reduced credit card in a hotel room key ?
CardSleuth is designed to look for such anomalies on a variety of cards with magnetic stripes , barcodes , RFID , cards , etc .
The Cartesian product of these media types against function or use ( e.g. , credit / debit / ATM cards , driver 's licenses , sundry identification cards , passports , visas , room keys , benefit transfer cards , etc. significantly complicate the notion of " anomalous . "
In this column , we discuss just one case .
Figure 3 : : Forensics view of looking for and finding a legitimate hotel room key
THE REST OF THE STORY
The toothpaste is pretty much out of the tube regarding the old hotel room key card scam in our municipality , but its not dead yet .
Not all municipalities and their law enforcement have the same levels of awareness of this exploit .
Further , variations abound .
The most interesting aspect of this story was how a law enforcement agency and university research center could cooperate to prevent crime .
In the course of this project we came up with some interesting observations .
For one , the entire scam could have been avoided if the scanners were configurable with respect to the level of coercivity on the magnetic stripes .
Financial industries use the more persistent and more reliable hi-coercivity magnetic stripes with a flux denisty of 4000 Oersteds .
All of the hotel room keys that were provided to us were lo-coercivity ( 300 Oersteds ) .
The difference in magnetic field strength is easily recognizable by modern electronics .
In our case , simply rejecting any credit card information that appeared on a lo-co mag stripe would have prevented the problem from arising in the first place .
Note that a lo - co block on unattended point - of - sale terminals could have preented this criminal behavior before it got started .
Another byproduct of our work was the prevalence of credit card information on the Internet .
At one point we were experimenting with net bots that could look for and report on financial card information on the net .
As an aside , I can affirm that this research was of little interest to law enforcement for legal reasons .
Ironically , having the ability to find credit card fraud in progress incurs considerable liability to attempt to thwart it which in turn brings in issues of agency , jurisdiction , work flow , and so forth which opens new cans of worms that struggling law enforcement agencies with enormous case loads are ill - prepared to deal with .
Over time , this project has been extended to other identification and card media formats , and functionality that goes beyond law enforcement .
The common theme , however , is the detection of anomalous information on widely - used identification and access control media .
CONCLUSION
I would be remiss if I didnt suggest some guidelines to protect oneself from scams such as that described above .
The Department of Justices SCAM acronym is appropriate here : be Stingy about giving out personal information , Check personal financial information regularly , Ask for copies of personal credit reports periodically , and Maintain careful records of banking and financial accounts .

Le panetterie dei supermercati sono solo delle false vendite al dettaglio !
I più grandi supermercati , soprattutto se presenti nei centri commerciali , hanno oggi bene in vista panetterie interne che sembrano , anche nel profumo , forni veri e fanno uscire ondate di pane , panini , biscotti e torte assortite .
Ai supermercati piacciono perché creano un ’atmosfera da vendita al dettaglio .
I consumatori sono comprensibilmente sedotti dai composti volatili che simulano questi odori di forno .
I nostri sensi non sono così raffinati da dirci se quello che è in forno sia buono o no .
Il pane cattivo emana un profumo invitante quanto quello buono .
Se le panetterie nei supermercati hanno un profumo delizioso diamo per scontato che il loro pane sia buono .
L’ambiente sterile e inodore del supermercato da un confortante effetto di calore e nutre l’illusione che ci siano esperti maestri fornai che preparano un prodotto fresco sul posto .
La panetteria interna al supermercato sembra racchiudere tutte le virtù di un fornaio artigiano tradizionale .
Il suo alone profumato di sapore casalingo fa brillare una luce che rende più attraenti tutte le altre cose in vendita .
Il più alto costo del pane prodotto nel forno del supermercato da l’impressione di una differenza vera dai prodotti standard preconfezionati .
La realtà diventa evidente soltanto quando il pane si raffredda e si può assaggiarlo veramente .
Le panetterie dentro i supermercati hanno fatto la loro comparsa negli anni Settanta .
Furono pensate per aiutarli a competere con i dettaglianti di strada e per dare l’impressione che i supermercati vendevano pane artigianale , anziché quello industriale comprato già fatto e confezionato con il processo di fabbricazione “ del pane istantaneo ” , notoriamente molliccio e senza crosta .
Che cosa è che cuoce in realtà nei supermercati di tutto il paese ?
Il pane più artigianale che si può trovare in un supermercato è pane a pulsante .
Il pane in teoria è fatto a partire dalle materie prime .
Alcune catene ancora si adeguano ad una definizione elastica di cottura delle materie prime .
Hanno perfezionato un sistema altamente meccanizzato che può essere fatto funzionare da personale relativamente non qualificato o addestrato velocemente .
Si mescola un sacchetto di miglioratori del pane con una quantità fissa di farina già pesata .
Si preme un bottone su un misuratore d’acqua e si mescola per creare un impasto “ istantaneo ” .
Si distribuisce la miscela nei pesi prestabiliti .
Si passa l’impasto in un’impastatrice per dargli la forma .
Poi si cuoce .
Questo metodo si chiama cottura su formula .
È il massimo a cui possono arrivare le panetterie dei supermercati .
Le altre offerte dei supermercati sono pani “ cotti a distanza “ : a base di pasta surgelata , preparati in fabbrica e finiti nel supermercato .
Per il supermercato , la cottura a distanza è un’innovazione meravigliosamente redditizia e di successo .
Il prodotto che ne esce garantisce ondate di prodotti da identikit : baguettes , panini , pasticcini e focacce , tutti con nomi meravigliosamente evocativi .
I biscotti di stile Americano possono essere forniti come impasto , oppure in forme congelate e pronte da cuocere .
Anche i muffin americani e i bagel , la pasticceria danese , i croissants alla francese e il pane artigianale dai nomi francesi o italiani possono tutti essere comprati pronti da infornare .
Il pane pronto da infornare viene fuori in forme diverse in varie fasi del processo di panificazione .
Le catene di supermercati possono comprarlo congelato e non pronto , congelato e pronto , o congelato e parzialmente cotto .
Nella sua forma più veloce , il pane da cuocere può aver bisogno soltanto di alcuni minuti nel forno per formare la crosta e prendere un po ’ di colore .
Un fornaio del supermercato mi ha spiegato che l’unica cosa complicata del processo sta nel ricordarsi di tirar fuori dal congelatore il prodotto parzialmente precotto per scongelarlo .
Se certi prodotti – come le focaccine – non fossero scongelati prima di essere infornati , uscirebbero fuori bagnati fradici .
Date un’occhiata all ’etichetta del pane del fornaio del vostro supermercato e vedrete che la data di scadenza è solitamente il giorno stesso o il giorno successivo all ’acquisto .
Come forse avete notato , il pane si secca molto presto e diventa stantio .
L’ironia del pane pronto da cuocere è che a causa di tutti gli interventi diretti a prolungarne la durata prima della cottura , esso non dura molto dopo cotto .
Il pane confezionato … altra fregatura !
Contrariamente ai prodotti della panetteria del supermercato , il pane confezionato che si trova sugli scaffali costa meno e sembra durare sempre – o almeno abbastanza a lungo da confermare il diktat dei supermercati che la spesa si deve fare solo una volta la settimana .
Lasciato ai suoi naturali processi , il pane diventa raffermo quando l’amido in esso indurisce .
Ma i supermercati hanno scoperto che anche se il pane che dura una settimana non può mai essere davvero fresco , può essere fatto sembrare fresco assicurandosi che rimanga morbido .
I panettieri industriali forniscono ai supermercati pane che rimane soffice perché è stato fatto con enzimi ammorbidenti .
La federazione dei panettieri spiega : “ I progressi nella tecnologia degli enzimi permettono che il pane rimanga più fresco più a lungo … Nel Regno Unito questo ha fatto sì che la durata sugli scaffali del pane affettato e confezionato , che solitamente rimane fresco solo per due o tre giorni , si raddoppiasse ad una settimana ” .
Poiché questi enzimi sono classificati come ausili di lavorazione , e non ingredienti , non devono essere dichiarati sull ’etichetta .
Ecco come i supermercati forniscono
pane fresco che dura una settimana .
Nei termini dei supermercati freschezza vuoi dire pane che rimane miracolosamente morbido e apparentemente fresco finché non diventa improvvisamente verde : un tempestivo avviso che è tempo per fare di nuovo un salto settimanale al supermercato .

Everyone loves Google .
They want to be everything to everyone , and they ’re getting pretty damn good at it .
Once you start using their services it gets easier and easier to migrate more of your life to them .
But there ’s a slight problem .
Google , like most other similar services , encrypts login traffic but not your content .
So the moment you ’re signed in they switch to plain - text communications and send everything to you in the open .
This means your mail , the news sources you read , your calendar events — are all able to be read by someone with access to any part of the network between you and Google .
This could be your employer at work , the wireless network at your local coffee shop , whatever .
This is n’t good .
Here ’s an email I just sent myself over the default ( unencrypted ) connection :
And here ’s what I captured via tcpdump
Use Bookmarks for Your Google Services Create bookmarks ( or modify them if you already have them ) for Gmail , Google Calendar , Google Reader , and iGoogle ( your Google homepage ) using https instead of http , like so : https://mail.google.com/mail/.
Do this for every service that you use at Google .
Do n’t Click on Links Within Google to Take You to Your Services
If you use their links Google will often take you to the unencrypted version because it ’s easier on their servers .
Use your links instead to ensure that your sessions are encrypted
That ’s the whole email there for anyone to see .
Luckily it ’s easy to fix …
The more we depend on Google ( or any other monolithic service ) the more we need to safeguard the information they have of ours .
One way we can help is by demanding ( via secure bookmarks and other methods ) that they send us our mail , news feeds , calendars , and other information over a secure connection . :
[ Note : This is not a Google - specific problem .
Most other services work in exactly the same way .
The difference is that Google is so prolific and is becoming very successfully at getting people to use not only their email service but also their calendaring , news reader , instant messaging , their search ( with history ) , etc .
It ’s the all - in - one dynamic that makes it especially important to protect Google traffic . ]
When Mukasey took the same stance last October it briefly threatened to derail his confirmation as attorney general until he assured Democrats in the senate that he would review the legality of the controversial interrogation tactic and report back .
But before the US senate judiciary committee today , Mukasey said he would not rule on whether it was a form of illegal torture because it was not part of the current interrogation methods used by the CIA on terror suspects .
He said current interrogation methods were lawful .
" Given that waterboarding is not part of the current programme , and may never be added to the programme , I do not think it would be appropriate for me to pass definitive judgment on the technique 's legality , " he said .
The Democratic chairman of the committee , Patrick Leahy , accused Mukasey of ducking questions .
It is not enough to say that waterboarding is not currently authorised , " said Leahy .
" Torture and illegality have no place in America . "
Leahy accused President Bush 's administration of having " twisted America 's role , law and values " so that officials were " instructed by the White House not to say that waterboarding is torture and illegal " .
Waterboarding involves strapping a person down and pouring water over his cloth - covered face to create the sensation of drowning .
The CIA and the Pentagon banned waterboarding in 2006 but critics want the justice department to join other nations in outlawing the practice .
However , US intelligence officials fear that doing so could make government interrogators - including those from the CIA - vulnerable to retroactive criminal charges or civil lawsuits .
Waterboarding is at the heart of a justice department criminal inquiry over whether the CIA illegally or otherwise improperly destroyed videotapes in 2005 of two terror suspects being interrogated .
The tapes showed harsh interrogations - possibly including waterboarding - of suspected terrorists Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri in 2002 , when both suspects were held in secret CIA jails overseas .
The tapes were destroyed as intelligence officials debated whether waterboarding should be declared illegal .
Iceman on Everest : ' It Was Easy ' Wim Hof stuns observers worldwide with his ability to withstand extreme cold .
March 7 , 2008  --
It 's a bitterly cold winter day and students on the University of Minnesota campus are bundled up , hurrying to their next class .
Wim Hof , dressed in shorts , sandals and nothing else , appeared from the doorway of a school building .
He 's known as ' The Ice Man . "
Scientists can't really explain it , but the 48 - year - old Dutchman is able to withstand , and even thrive , in temperatures that could be fatal to the average person .
From the Arctic Circle to Mount Everest
It 's an ability he discovered in himself as a young man 20 years ago .
" I had a stroll like this in the park with somebody and I saw the ice and I thought , what would happen if I go in there .
I was really attracted to it .
I went in , got rid of my clothes .
Thirty seconds I was in , " Hof said .
" Tremendous good feeling when I came out and since then , I repeated it every day . "
It was the moment that Hof knew that his body was different somehow :
He was able to withstand fatally freezing temperatures .
Hof began a lifelong quest to see just how far his abilities would take him .
In January of 1999 he traveled 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle to run a half - marathon in his bare feet .
Three years later , dressed only in a swimsuit , he dove under the ice at the North Pole and earned a Guinness World Record for the longest amount of time swimming under the ice : 80 meters , almost twice the length of an Olympic - sized pool .
When he did n't experience frostbite or hypothermia , the body 's usual reactions to extreme cold , his extraordinary ability started to get the attention of doctors who specialize in extreme medicine .
Dr. Ken Kamler , author of " Surviving the Extremes , " has treated dozens of people who tried to climb Mount Everest , and instead nearly died from the frigid temperatures .
He could n't believe it when he got word of a Dutchman making the ascent with no protection other than a pair of shorts .
" People are always looking for new firsts on Everest .
It 's been climbed so many times now , people climb it without oxygen , they … they climb it with all different kinds of handicaps .
But no one has come close to climbing Everest in those kinds of conditions , " Dr. Kamler said .
" It 's … it 's almost inconceivable . "
Hof made the expedition in shorts .
" It was quite easy , " Hof said .
" I was in a snowstorm before , say , on the fifteen , sixteen thousand feet up ' til eighteen thousand feet . "
" I know my body , I know my mind , I know what I can do , " Hof said .
And he says he can withstand heat as well as cold .
Nearly Naked , Surrounded by Ice
Dr. Kamler met
Hof for the first time at the Rubin Museum in New York , where Hof was set to break another Guinness World Record , this time for remaining nearly naked in ice poured up to his neck .
Hof came out of the museum , stripped to his swim trunks and climbed in a 5 - foot tall plexiglass container filled with ice .
Once he got in , they poured more ice into the container until it reached his chin .
All the while , Dr. Ken Kamler monitored
Hof from outside the tank .
Normally , when a person is exposed to freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time , the body goes into survival mode , as its liquids begin to freeze .
Frostbite sets in , and in order to save the major organs , the body sacrifices blood flow to the extremities , cutting circulation from the fingers , toes , ears and nose to keep the blood flowing to the organs necessary for survival .
If not treated immediately , the damage to these extremities is irreversible .
The other danger is hypothermia , an abnormally low body temperature .
At about 90 degrees , body functions start shutting down , and once that starts , you could be dead within minutes .
But Hof stayed in his tomb of ice for one hour and 12 minutes .
Then , the ice was poured out of the tank , and Hof emerged , his skin still pink .
" He 's not moving , he 's not generating heat , he 's not dressed for it , and he 's immersed in ice water .
And water will transmit heat 30 times faster than air .
It literally sucks the life right out of you .
And yet , despite all those negative factors , Wim Hof was very calm , very comfortable the entire time that he was immersed in that water , " Kamler said .
It was a new entry for the Guinness World Records , but really , no one else out there seems able to compete with him .
He just keeps breaking his own records .
Response to Cold ' Completely Obliterated '
At the hypothermia lab at the University of Minnesota in Duluth , scientists who 've studied the cold for years say they 've never seen anything like it .
Dr. Robert Pozos and Dr. Larry Wittmers , director of the lab , hooked up
Hof to heart rate and core temperature monitors to evaluate his body 's response after being submerged in an extremely cold water tank .
A normal response might include intense pain , cardiovascular stress and mounting hysteria , but with Hof , it 's a much different story .
As he went into the tank , Dr. Wittmers explained , " What you 're seeing basically is a situation in which the usual response to a shock or a cold was completely obliterated .
There was no — none of the usual response you would see .
And those responses that you see in most individuals that are exposed to that type of situation are uncontrollable . "
From inside the tank , Hof said , " I feel the cold is a noble force , as they always say , and for me , right now , these readings are important but this is what I do every day in the winter , because I like it . "
Since there 's nothing abnormal about his body , all doctors can tell is that Hof 's secret must lie in the wiring of his brain .
" It 's very easy to speculate that the same mind control that you use to control your heart when you 're scared also can be called upon to control the other organs in the body .
And maybe that 's how Wim Hof does this , " said Kamler .
" That 's … it 's speculation , but it sort of makes sense , and a lot of scientists are working very hard to try to figure this out now . "
One answer might lie in an ancient Himalayan meditation called " Tummo , " which is thought to generate heat .
Hof began practicing the ritual years ago .
" Legends abound of practitioners of Tummo sitting out on the ice naked except for wet sheets that they have draped around them , and as they meditate , the sheets dry and the ice melts around them , even though it 's freezing temperature , " Kamler said .
The Mystery of Swimmer Lynne Cox
If there 's one ice - lover who has baffled scientists as much as Hof , it 's American swimmer Lynne Cox .
At 15 , Cox swam the English Channel in 14 hours , a Guinness World Record .
She has also written two books about her adventures : " Grayson " and " Swimming to Antarctica . "
Like Hof , Lynne soon discovered that she had an almost super - human ability to survive in frigid water .
In 1987 , she became the first person to swim across the Bering Strait , from Alaska to what was then the Soviet Union , in 38 - degree water .
And in 2002 , she set a new goal : to swim a mile through the massive icebergs of the Antarctic .
Like Hof ,
Cox prepares herself by somehow using her mind to control her body 's temperature .
" I went into the cabin and sat down and focused and breathed and thought about how I was gonna enter the water , how I was gonna do the swim .
I sort of … I went through a mental rehearsal of it all .
And that preparation , my body knew that I was going to jump into very cold water , " Cox said .
" Before I went in the water , one of the doctors took my core temperature , my internal temperature , and found it was 102.2 . "
The water was 32 degrees and hovering near the freezing point .
Without a wet suit or a dry suit , in wind gusting 35 knots , Cox used metal steps to enter the water .
" As I came down , it was like stepping on ice trays , " she said .
She began swimming between the icebergs .
" That was amazing to be able to physically do it , " she said .
But how do they do it ?
Kamler said the answer lies deep in the brain .
" It 's a mystery that we have not yet come close to solving , although we do have tantalizing clues , " he said .
" It tells us that there 's enormous potential within the brain that is going untapped .
And if we can study them more , and study people like them more , maybe we can unleash that potential for the rest of us . "
Wim Hof 's charity foundation , Happy People of the World , is based in the Netherlands .

On YouTube ’s Scientology Channel
Last week I asked Google and YouTube press support ( and another Google employee ) whether their Scientology channel was paid .
The channel was listed in the “ Sponsors ” section of the site , for one thing , and Scientology has been seen spending many advertising dollars with Google in AdSense campaigns .
One reason why I asked was that the page included a link to Scientology.org without “ nofollow ” – which would make it a paid link , which would be against Google ’s own webmaster guidelines .
Now , while Google did not reply to me offering a disclosure whether it ’s an ad or not , I can see the links to Scientology from that page are now nofollowed .
Michel , who informed me about the Scientology channel at YouTube , states another interesting bit – but I can’t tell if Michel is right or not ( and his email did not resolve when I tried to follow - up with him ) .
On May 1st Michel wrote :
[ T ]he Church of Scientology launched a new expensive channel on YouTube just a over a week after YouTube deleted the Xenutv1 account owned by one of the loudest of Scientology ’s critics , Mark Bunker !
On April 1 , the Xenutv1 account was deleted by Youtube for “ copyright rules ” ... because the Bunker , the site owner had a former account that posted a copywrited clip from the Colbert Report show .
Therefore , YouTube explains , he was not allowed to open a new account , so they deleted the Xenutv1 account for Terms Of Service TOS violations .
Now , guess what ?
The Church of Scientology had a previous account which was permanently banned due to ToS violations ( posted videos targeting individuals and broadcasting their personal information [ picture , name , location , alleged alias ] ) .
According to Youtube ’s strict rule - set , the “ Church ” is not allowed to have a second account ( “ channel ” ) .
This rule was made VERRRRY CLEAR by Youtube when they banned Mark Bunker ’s account ( XenuTV1 ) .
The XenuTv1 YouTube account was deleted 3 days after Bunker posted a 10 minute interview of the ex-Scientologist , Jason Beghe , that was watched by over a half million viewers before it disappeared .
Bunker was about to post 3 hours of additional interviews with Bunker when his account was deleted .
Michel in his email links out to Wired and GlossLip for further details .

Even as Sen. Hillary Clinton campaigned in South Dakota , giving no signs of conceding , speculation built that an election - night rally Tuesday in New York could mark the end of her long fight for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Facing a steady stream of superdelegates flocking to Sen. Barack Obama , Sen.
Clinton called on her top donors and supporters to attend her speech in Manhattan .
While the Clinton campaign says such invitations have been common on primary nights , many saw it as a sign that she could withdraw from ...
In much the same way the cops had to catch him on the highways , DUI king Robert Castle appears to finally have been nailed by the justice system .
The 51 - year - old Lynnwood bricklayer ’s assistant faces up to five years in prison when he ’s sentenced next Monday in Snohomish County Superior Court for a misdemeanor drunk - driving conviction and a felony eluding charge .
That likely prison term will come on top of an already - astonishing King County Jail sentence handed down recently in Seattle Municipal Court : 910 days .
Last month , muni court judge George Holifield doled out maximum consecutive terms to Castle on four counts stemming from a 2006 DUI bust : 365 days each on convictions of DUI and driving with a suspended license , and 90 days each for refusing to stop and resisting arrest .
The judge is n’t sure if two - and - a - half years is a Seattle record for DUI - related misdemeanor violations .
But with 16 DUI charges to his credit , the state ’s top drunk driver deserved this stiff one , says Holi - field .
“ I do n’t think there has been a case where the defendant has as many contacts with the court system as Mr. Castle , ” he says .
In addition to the time , Holifield tacked on a $ 10,000 fine .
Often chased , sometimes Tazered , and rarely without a bottle between his legs , Castle scored a drunk - driving conviction every year and a half since 1985 ( see “ Slippery When Wet , ” April 9 ) .
Still , his long record wo n’t necessarily play a direct role when he faces a Snohomish judge next week on his first felony - related DUI conviction .
A new state law allows anyone with four or more misdemeanor DUIs within 10 years of one another to be tried and sentenced as a felon for the fifth conviction , but Castle ’s more recent string of cases fell outside the prescribed window .
So rather than try him for just another misdemeanor , Snohomish prosecutors charged him with felony eluding after he tried to run from a 2006 DUI arrest .
Convicted on that charge in 2007 , Castle failed to show for sentencing ; he was also a no - show for his Seattle trial .
But he was nabbed in December for his 16th DUI and has been in custody since .
In a sort of DUI Groundhog Day , he faces a separate DUI / felony eluding charge in Snohomish , and likely another trial in Seattle for the 16th DUI .
If he ’s convicted in the second Snohomish case , he ’ll have tallied the requisite four convictions in 10 years to be tried as a felony drunk driver in Seattle .
He has frequently been given deferred sentences and has n’t done any serious time since 1985 .
But it could now be a while before he tells a cop , as he once did , “ Arrest me ; I ’ll be out soon . ”

Conservative leader David Cameron says their first by - election gain since 1982 marks " the end of New Labour " .
Mr Cameron told cheering supporters in Crewe and Nantwich that Labour had run a negative , xenophobic and class war campaign that " completely backfired " .
He said overturning Labour 's 7,000 majority " can be the start of something different and something bigger " .
Labour leader Gordon Brown said the result showed his task was to tackle people 's concerns about rising prices .
Asked if he thought he would lead Labour into the next election , Mr Brown said voters had shown they wanted him to steer the UK through " difficult economic times " .
' Remarkable victory '
But that view was questioned by Labour MP Graham Stringer , who called for a senior cabinet minister to launch a leadership challenge to save Labour from electoral " disaster " .
Tory candidate Edward Timpson won 7,860 more votes than his Labour rival - a 17.6 % swing from the 2005 General Election .
RESULT AT-A - GLANCE Edward Timpson
Conservative : 20,539 Tamsin Dunwoody
Labour : 12,679 Elizabeth Shenton
Lib Dems : 6,040
Analysis : How will Brown react ?
Profile : Edward Timpson Mr Cameron said it had been a " remarkable victory " but said : " I know that winning a by - election and winning a general election are two different things and we 've still got a huge amount of work to do . "
He said that it was " encouraging " that " thousands of people who have never voted Conservative before have come across and put their trust in the Conservative Party " and said the party would not let them down .
He criticised Labour 's " negative .. xenophobic " and " class war " campaign and said it had backfired .
" I think what happened was that , for Labour , it was the end of being of being the party of aspiration , it was the end of being the party of opportunity , it was the end of New Labour , here on the streets of Crewe and Nantwich . "
' On the rise '
He said he wanted an end to " big , top - down , bossy , interfering government " and people wanted " something different " .
He pledged to build a " coalition for change in our country so we really can remove this government and give Britain a better chance " .
The self - proclaimed " heir to Blair " is trying to use the Crewe and Nantwich result to declare New Labour dead and at the same time he is trying to claim leadership of the Blair coalition for himself

In quotes : Crewe result
The contest followed the death of veteran Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody , who had represented Crewe and Nantwich since the seat was created in 1983 .
Mr Timpson , a 34 - year - old barrister , took 20,539 votes .
The Labour candidate , Mrs Dunwoody 's daughter Tamsin Dunwoody , was second on 12,679 , with Liberal Democrat Elizabeth Shenton third on 6,040 .
Turnout was 58.2 % , high for a by - election , but was down slightly from 60 % at the 2005 general election .
Mr Timpson said Labour had paid the price for the decision to scrap the 10 p rate of income tax and said people " are seeing us as an alternative to Labour " .
The by - election came weeks after Labour 's poorest local election results in 40 years .

Labour 's deputy leader Harriet Harman acknowledged there were " discordant voices " among some Labour MPs .
But she added : " The overwhelming majority of people in the Labour Party - and I speak to constituency chairs up and down the country ... they are fully behind Gordon Brown . "
Mr Cameron is expected to capitalise on the victory by calling an early by - election in Henley , the Westminster seat due to be vacated by new London Mayor Boris Johnson .
' Robust ' campaign Speculation is concentrating on 26 June or 3 July as likely dates for a contest .
HAVE YOUR SAY
At last the country is becoming wise to this terrible Labour Government .
Stuart McGregor , Glasgow During the by - election campaign Ms Dunwoody had criticised Mr Timpson 's " Tory toff " background , but in the wake of defeat she said it was " robust but fun " .
The Liberal Democrat candidate Ms Shenton said the government had been " very wrong " to " support a budget that taxed people on ordinary incomes more than the rich " .
And Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said they had done well to get as large a share they did , saying that normally in by - elections the third party gets squeezed down to 3 % or less .
He told the BBC's Daily Politics the result had been an anti-Labour vote rather than a pro-Tory one .
The Conservative Party 's last by - election gain was in Mitcham and Morden , south - west London , in 1982 .
A survey for BBC 2's Daily Politics programme suggested that twice as many people think David Cameron would make a good prime minister , than Gordon Brown .
Of those surveyed , 46 % thought Mr Cameron would be the best prime minister , 23 % backed Mr Brown and 7 % backed Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .
ComRes carried out the survey of 1,006 adults between 21 and 22 May .
The full results from the Crewe and Nantwich by - election were : Edward Timpson ( Con ) 20,539 ( 49.49 % , 16.93 % increase on 2005 share of vote )
Tamsin Dunwoody ( Lab ) 12,679 ( 30.55 % , - 18.29 % )
Elizabeth Shenton ( Lib Dem ) 6,040 ( 14.55 % , - 4.03 % )
Mike Nattrass ( UKIP ) 922 ( 2.22 % )
Robert Smith ( Green ) 359 ( 0.87 % )
David Roberts ( Eng Dem ) 275 ( 0.66 % )
The Flying Brick ( Monster Raving Loony ) 236 ( 0.57 % )
Mark Walklate ( Ind ) 217 ( 0.52 % )
Paul Thorogood ( Cut Tax on Diesel and Petrol ) 118 ( 0.28 % )
Gemma Garrett ( Ind ) 113 ( 0.27 % )

Sen . Claire McCaskill might be the perfect match for Obama 's running mate .
McCaskill : Obama's ' Wonder Woman ' ?
Why is no one in the punditocracy talking about Missouri Sen.
Claire McCaskill as a possible running mate for Barack Obama ?
A self - made , 54 - year - old Catholic female professional ( hmm — sounds like Hillary Rodham Clinton voters ) , she has won statewide office three times in the fiercely independent Show Me State , without the benefit of a spouse ’s coattails .
Advertisement
A former state legislator and state auditor , she is one of only a handful of United States senators who refuse to pander to their constituents by padding the federal budget with those tax - wasting , bridge - to - nowhere earmarks .
A tough but reasonable former county prosecutor , she had the guts to take on a sitting Democratic governor for her party ’s nomination for that office — and she defeated him , only very narrowly losing the general election in 2004 .
She then bounced back from that one loss in her career to win her Senate seat in 2006 against Republican incumbent Jim Talent .
A former cheerleader and homecoming queen , a divorced and remarried mother of three , and a stepmother of three more children , McCaskill comes off almost as an Everywoman .
And as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , perhaps a Wonder Woman .
Sure , the idea of her as Obama ’s running mate is counterintuitive .
She ’s another senator with little federal experience , and she ’s from the Illinois senator ’s neighboring Midwestern state .
Oh , but wait .
Was n’t Al Gore a fellow baby - boom - generation Southerner from a neighboring state when Bill Clinton tapped him for the No. 2 spot in 1992 ?
Clinton got synergy , not balance , and it worked .
But I have saved the best argument for last .
As someone who for several decades has both practiced and taught the skills needed for effective political communication , I am struck by McCaskill ’s huge talent as a thoroughly authentic communicator .
She has been showcasing that ability for several months now — ever since , prodded by her 18 - year - old daughter , she exhibited the political courage to step out front for Obama when other Democratic women in the Senate took the safe route and endorsed Hillary Clinton .
View some YouTube clips of this woman speaking on Obama ’s behalf .
Start with her Bill Maher interview , perhaps .
Though I realize it ’s not good for my emotional or intellectual health , I have watched countless hours of cable babble this past winter and spring , and McCaskill has been one of the rare voices of sanity and reason among the talking - points - scripted verbal food fighters .
She is unflappable , genuine , likable , feminine , strong , warm , articulate , tough .
The list of pleasing human attributes could go on and on .
If I were Obama , I ’d think seriously about having this former cheerleader boost me in the big campaign pep rally that ’s about to begin .
She sounds like real change to me .
And she has the depth and breadth of experience to provide the most important quality we should always seek in someone a heartbeat away from the presidency : good judgment .
( Would you prefer as a Supreme Court justice a brilliant law professor or an intelligent lawyer who served a term as county sheriff or state ’s attorney ?
The first Cold War president , McCaskill ’s fellow Missourian Harry Truman , was served well by a high school diploma and autodidactic knowledge of world and American history . )
Two candidates on the same ticket with good judgment .
If I can take a little license with Nirvana ’s lyrics , smells like team spirit to me .

After posting my super - deluxe - awesome - sexy actionscript hover tooltip code , I felt dirty .
I mean , me , giving away the source code to something that I could surely have sold for at least $ 1.50 a shot !
It was really disgusting to see such charity from the likes of myself .
And yet , here I am doing the same kind of thing .
Only this time I ’m offering something with a lot more substance : an IRC library for Ruby .
I ’ve had a running bot for about three years now , originally built with the horrific mess that was IRCSocket ’s first release .
Back then , IRCSocket was seriously the only viable IRC framework in Ruby unless I wanted to write my own ( which I did n’t ) , so I slowly expanded on the IRCSocket code to make a better library for myself .
One day I looked at what I had and compared it to where I ’d started , and noticed that the framework was no longer anything like IRCSocket ’s .
I had developed my own framework , relying only on some of the regexes and naming conventions that IRCSocket had given me early on .
The meat of the framework was now all mine .
I realized at that point that even though there are far more options for IRC libraries in Ruby , it probably would n’t hurt to offer mine to the world .
I had built a lot of code for real - world usage , where some libraries seemed to still be concerned more with what seemed cool or “ what could maybe possibly be useful sometime we hope ” .
This may not turn out to matter , as my real - world use could be worthless to others , but what the hell , it ’s not like it ’s hurting anybody to offer this thing up .
So for those who are interested in a very simple IRC library , I suggest you check out my rdoc page for Net : : YAIL , and do a gem install net - yail ( or just download the tarball from Rubyforge ) .
Here ’s a quick sample of what a basic dumb bot could look like :
require ' rubygems ' require ' net / yail ' irc = Net :: YAIL.new ( :address => ' irc.someplace.co.uk ' , :username => ' Frakking Bot ' , : realname => ' John Botfrakker ' , : nicknames => [ ' bot1 ' , ' bot2 ' , ' bot3 ' ] ) irc.prepend_handler :incoming_welcome , proc { irc.join ( '# foo ' ) return false } irc.start_listening while irc.dead_socket == false #

U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich said he is facing a " swiftboat " attack in the March 4 Democratic primary and if he is reelected to the 10th Congressional district he will continue to govern as he has for 12 years .
" I 'm going to keep on working for the people , " he said during an interview on the " Sound of Ideas " on WCPN 90.3 Wednesday morning .
" You have to build consensus .
That 's what I do . "
Swiftboating refers to an attack that is unfair or untrue .
The term comes from the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth ( formerly " Swift Boat Veterans for Truth " ) and their widely - publicized campaign against 2004 Presidential candidate John Kerry .
While not calling him by name , Kucinich was referring to candidate Joe Cimperman , who has been hammering away at his failed presidential bid and his record , which includes passage of one bill .
Kucinich said the Republican Congress made passage of other bills difficult and stressed that he has led the charge against the war in Iraq and for universal health care .
Kucinich , who faces four Democratic opponents , was interviewed in the second half of the show after Cimperman , a Cleveland councilman for 10 years .
Cimperman defended the tone of his campaign , which included delivering a " welcome home " basket with a map of Cuyahoga County to the congressman 's home before he dropped his presidential bid .
" You have to draw contrasts , " said Cimperman , who describes himself as " young , passionate and about tomorrow . "
Cimperman , a former Kucinich supporter , said he does n't regret helping to raise money a few years ago so a portrait of former Mayor Dennis Kucinich could be hung in City Hall .
" The person I supported then is n't the person he is now , " Cimperman said .
Last week , 10th congressional candidates Rosemary Palmer and Barbara Ferris were interviewed on the " Sound of Ideas . "
All of the interviews can be heard here .
Next week , candidate , North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O'Grady will be the fifth featured on the show along with the primary 's two Republican candidates , Jim Trakas and Jason Werner .

A looming battle in Washington state over efforts to create a right - to - die law for the terminally ill is a personal one for two men leading it , both of whom are ill .
Fighting for the measure is a former governor who wants the freedom to exercise such a right ; fighting against it is a former press secretary who ca n’t imagine anyone wanting to .
Proponents are wrapping up a petition drive to put Initiative 1000 , the proposed Washington Death With Dignity Act , on the November ballot .
The initiative would let a doctor prescribe lethal drugs to patients given less than six months to live .
Oregon is the only state with such a law , which the Supreme Court upheld in 2006 .
Booth Gardner , 71 , who served two terms as a Democratic governor in Washington , has Parkinson ’s disease and has declared this his “ final campaign . ”
Advertisement
“ There are people like me everywhere who are coping with pain -- they know that their next step is death , ” Gardner said in an e-mail interview .
“ When death is inevitable , we should n’t force people to endure agonizing suffering if we do n’t have to . ”
The proposed law probably would n’t apply to him , because Parkinson ’s is not terminal .
Still , Gardner -- who has experienced “ steady increasing loss of basic functions ” since his diagnosis 14 years ago -- identifies strongly with the fight .
“ We have all made tough decisions throughout our lives , and we should be trusted to make tough decisions about the end of life , ” he said .
“ It ’s about autonomy , personal choice and respect .
I was in control of my life .
I should be allowed to be in control of my death . ”
On the other side is Chris Carlson , chairman of a coalition opposing the initiative .
A longtime Democratic activist in the Northwest , he was press secretary under Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus .

Carlson , 61 , also has Parkinson’s .
And in 2005 he was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer -- which was later deemed “ dormant ” after experimental treatment .
“ That points to a major flaw in this initiative : Doctors can with some authority tell someone they have six months or less to live .
I was supposed to be dead two years ago , but I ’m still here , ” said Carlson , who considers suicide an “ irrational and selfish act . ”
The coalition opposing I -1000 , as the initiative is called , includes the Roman Catholic Church , conservative Christians , right - to - life groups , and advocates for the disabled .
The Catholic Church underwrote the opposition to a similar measure that Washington voters narrowly defeated in 1991 .
Even the language of the debate is controversial .
Advertisement
Opponents refer to “ assisted suicide ” and say the initiative would create a slippery slope to euthanasia .
Proponents prefer “ aid in dying . ”
The initiative ’s campaign manager , Alex Morgan , said that with death imminent , the terminally ill wanted only the option to avoid suffering .
“ The term ‘ suicide ’ does n’t conjure a neutral image .
Suicide is a violent act , ” he said .
In a victory for the Yes on I -1000 campaign , a county judge ruled in March that “ suicide ” was a loaded term and refused to add the words “ physician - assisted suicide ” to the ballot measure and official voter pamphlet description .
Instead , voters will read that the initiative allows some terminally ill patients “ to request and administer lethal medication ” prescribed by a doctor .
Advertisement
That language riles initiative critics .
“ People ought to be really wary when somebody wants to redefine the English language , ” Carlson said .
“ By definition , they are killing themselves .
To say it is the underlying disease is disingenuous and dishonest . ”
This month , 15 state legislators urged voters not to sign the petition to put the initiative on the ballot .
Democratic state Sen. Margarita Prentice of Renton said the initiative was “ very dangerous ” and would not pass the statehouse .
Proponents say I -1000 has safeguards .
Under the measure , two doctors would have to agree that the patient is mentally competent .
Doctors could only write prescriptions ; they could not assist by , for instance , giving a fatal injection .

“ We can look at 10 years of experience in Oregon and see that all of the horrible things that the fear - mongers said would happen have n’t happened , ” Gardner said .
Oregon ’s Death With Dignity
Act -- which specifies that ending one ’s own life under the terms of the act is legally not suicide -- was passed by voter initiative in 1994 and took effect in late 1997 .
Through the end of last year , 341 people died under the act , records indicate .
Several states have rejected similar bills .
California lawmakers have defeated five bills on medically assisted suicide over the last dozen years .

In Washington , Democratic Gov. Chris Gregoire , who speaks of Gardner as a mentor and friend , will neither support his initiative nor campaign against it .
Said spokesman Aaron Toso : “ Gov. Gregoire believes this is a deeply personal issue , and she is not going to tell people how to believe .
Voters in Washington will have to make up their own minds . ”
Initiative supporters have until July 4 to turn in 225,000 valid signatures to qualify for the November ballot .
“ We do n’t have to worry , ” campaign manager Morgan said with one month to go .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The United States and Poland have reached a tentative deal to place part of a ballistic missile defense system on its territory , a plan that has drawn sharp objections from Russia , a senior administration official said Wednesday .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice was set to go to Poland to negotiate the missile system .
Poland 's political establishment still has to sign off on the deal and determine the next steps , the official said .
The agreement came after several days of negotiations and less than a week before a planned visit by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
The Bush administration has long pushed to base missile interceptors in Poland .
The interceptor rockets would be linked to an air - defense radar system in the Czech Republic , where officials agreed in April to take part in the system .
The interceptors in the Czech Republic could identify and shoot down missiles fired by Iran at Europe or the United States .
Russia fervently opposes basing the interceptors right across its border and says the system 's real target would be Russian missiles , according to Time magazine .

TIME : U.S. missile defense likely delayed
The Czech Republic and Poland are former Soviet satellites , now members of the U.S. - led NATO alliance .
The United States has said the system is intended to defend Europe from a possible missile attack from the Middle East .
There was no immediate response from Moscow about the deal .
But Assistant Secretary of State Dan Fried said the United States has taken to heart Polish concerns over more U.S. cooperation with Russia and NATO on the missile defense shield .
The United States has also agreed to help Poland modernize its military , which it requested as a condition of its support for housing the missile defense system .
Fried told reporters earlier that Polish negotiators were tough and came to the table with " serious suggestions and positions , " but that the U.S. was " quite satisfied " with the status of the negotiations .
Fried called Poland a " magnificent ally " who has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan .
He said the talks have been " strenuous " but that the United States understood that this was important to Poland .

Hundreds of people , including civilians , have been killed in the ongoing clashes .
In Mosul , U.S. and Iraqi troops finally launched a security operation against al - Qaeda .

Most of us , whether we admit it or not , are moral hypocrites .
We judge others more severely than we judge ourselves .
Mounting evidence suggests moral decisions result from the jousting between our knee - jerk responses ( think " survival instinct " ) and our slower , but more collected evaluations .
Which is more responsible for our self - leniency ?
To find out , a recent study presented people with two tasks .
One was described as tedious and time - consuming ; the other , easy and brief .
The subjects were asked to assign each task to either themselves or the next participant .
They could do this independently or defer to a computer , which would assign the tasks randomly .
Eighty - five percent of 42 subjects passed up the computer ’s objectivity and assigned themselves the short task – leaving the laborious one to someone else .
Furthermore , they thought their decision was fair .
However , when 43 other subjects watched strangers make the same decision , they thought it unjust .
Time to think
The researchers then " constrained cognition " by asking subjects to memorize long strings of numbers .
In this greatly distracted state , subjects became impartial .
They thought their own transgressions were just as terrible as those of others .
This suggests that we are intuitively moral beings , but " when we are given time to think about it , we construct arguments about why what we did was n’t that bad , " said lead researcher Piercarlo Valdesolo , who conducted this study at Northeastern University and is now a professor at Amherst College .
The study , funded by the university , will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology .
The researchers speculate that instinctive morality results from evolutionary selection for team players .
Being fair , they point out , strengthens mutually beneficial relationships and improves our chances for survival .
Loathe to admit
So why do we choose to judge ourselves so leniently ?
We have a lot wrapped up in preserving a positive self - image , said Valdesolo , and thus are loathe to admit , even to ourselves , that we sometimes behave immorally .
A flattering self - image is correlated with rewards , such as emotional stability , increased motivation and perseverance .
" It is a very functional part of our psychology … but it is not always a desirable one , " explained Valdesolo .
Since , in real life , we ca n’t drive everyone into a state of pronounced distraction , he continued , the hard part is figuring out how moral instincts may be better harnessed .
When asked if this meant ubiquitous Blackberries and iPods may make society more just , Valdesolo said , laughing , " our research suggests it . "
Fed up with the orgy of mindless violence and sewer - mouthed profanity that passes these days for your average family film ?
Scared to take your kids to the flicks in case they have to sit through naked cartoon animals and rude words like " ass " ?
Fear not !
A variety of parental and religious websites have sprung up , telling you exactly what offensive material you will encounter .
Which means innocently stumbling into a screening of Cannibal Holocaust II with little Johnny will be a thing of the past .
It also means that pretty much every film ever made apart from Stuart Little is a no - go .
So , can you guess the films from their warnings ?
1 " The father of the family is often rude to his wife and children , yet usually ends up apologising , recognising his folly ( to some degree ) , and echoing his wife 's determination to maintain their marriage .
However , he is physically abusive to his son ( attempting to strangle him when he misbehaves ) , and lies when the police ask him if he dared his son to skateboard naked through their town ( the son is briefly shown from the front , completely nude ) .
References are made to bestiality ( a man considers kissing a pig ) and offensive comments are directed towards Christians , Buddhists and homosexuals .
Two rude anatomical terms are used . "

2 " Some non-explicit , but sexually related dialogue is present , while sexual encounters occur off - screen ( including the protagonist having sex with a man she has n't known for long , and only days after breaking up with her boyfriend ) , some models are briefly seen in scanty attire , and varying amounts of cleavage are observed .
A song had what sounded like several uses of ' hell ' in it , but we were n't able to confirm that .
Phrases include : ' My job sucks ' , ' A total psycho ' , ' The dragon lady ' , ' I 'm one stomach flu away from my goal weight ' , ' Glamazon ' , ' You bet your size - six ass ' .
Some kids may be enticed to act in a snooty manner toward others . "
www.screenit.com
3 " A home - made porn film is briefly and partially seen and heard , male full frontal and rear nudity is seen live and in photos , and other sexually related comedy ( involving masturbation , homosexual behaviour , prostitutes ) occurs .
The overall way in which the protagonist speaks himself might be enticing for some kids to imitate .
There are purposeful bad attitudes ( racism , misogyny and more ) played for comedy .
Violence - based comedy is present ( including a man - on - man nude battle over a magazine ) . "
www.screenit.com
4 " XXXX uses sweeping cinematography , absolute attention to detail , sensitive direction , and the sincere desire to paint a picture of what it really was like to be a man of homosexual tendencies in the early 1960s and on into the next 20 years , especially in the ultimate macho male environment embraced in cowboy and rodeo life .
I 'm not saying this is n't Oscar material .
What I am saying is , this is not Christian material .
It is filled with very homosexual images .
Included are several scenes of men kissing each other passionately .
These scenes are very realistic , and honestly left me with a sick feeling long after .
The images are haunting , and spiritually dangerous for anyone who is not completely grounded in Scripture ! "
www.christiananswers.net
5 " Comedy style violence includes scenes of fighting between people and some bears , while a dog is punted off a bridge ( but is later okay ) .
A woman states that a man 's strong cologne smells like a diaper filled with Indian food , while another thinks it smells like ' Big Foot 's d*ck '
He also sucks liquor from a glass through his jazz flute and blows it from the instrument over a flame , causing a flamethrower effect . "
www.screenit.com
6 " The creators do try to be ' equal - opportunity ' offenders .
They pick on both the conservatives and the liberals .
I do n't think there is anyone whom they have n't tried to offend .
This film 's story about terrorists begins with the group recruiting a Broadway actor .
The deal is sealed when our handsome actor is offered the gift of a beautiful lady .
The scene between these two is nothing short of puppet porn .
This film gives crudeness a whole new definition .
It is the MOST tasteless movie I have ever seen .
Is there a law against ' puppet abuse ' ? "
www.christiananswers.net
7 " Profanity is extreme with 40 'f - words ' .
Sexual humour abounds and includes a scene of a man masturbating , others scenes of implied oral sex , and an extended scene dealing with a man who 's got his privates stuck in his zipper .
In other scenes , the ' villains ' give a woman 's dog amphetamines and barbiturates ( at different times ) .
Beyond doing that to the dog , it 's also electrocuted ( trying to revive it , but also catching it on fire ) and wrestled with ( in a slapstick fashion ) . "
www.screenit.com
8 " There 's been a lot of discussion about this series growing darker , and certainly in tone and mood this film fulfils that prophecy .
The death of a character is discussed , and we see a bloodied face in a few quick flashbacks .
All other violence is through magic manipulation and people being ' shocked ' or knocked over by metaphysical forces .
Sexual content is limited to a single ( highly publicised ) kiss .
Parents sensitive to depictions of occult and satanic - like themes may not find this film suitable for their children . "
www.parentpreviews.com
9 " Despite the attempt at realism , the film falls short when it comes to consequences .
Rising from a virtual unknown to the pinnacle of popularity , XXXX crashes into the depths of scandal when she is accused of pushing a girl in front of a bus .
Although she has snubbed her real friends , lied to her peers and falsely accused a teacher of drug trafficking , her return to acceptance is surprisingly simple .
Money , good looks and the power of popularity should n't prevent these girls from paying for their actions .
However they do seem to contribute to a short - lived fall from grace .
Tackling the topic of teenage trauma is a worthy undertaking , but the finale of this film comes off a bit too glossy and lighthearted . "
www.parentpreviews.com
10 " There is a lot of fighting and death throughout the film , including a bear 's jaw being completely ripped off , not to mention one character 's attempt to kill her own mother .
There are a number of twisted biblical references and a play on biblical names .
There is some immodesty and sensuality seen in one character , who is shown always wearing form - fitting , 30s - inspired dresses .
The final books [ in the trilogy ] , though , are the ones that cover [ the author 's ] horrific view of God , and Christianity as a whole .
Pray for [ the author ] .
Pray about the negative influence of his works .
And pray for humility and wisdom in your own response .
[ The author ] is a man who , somewhere along the way , has fallen into a perilous pit of treachery . "

Mothers , here 's another reason to encourage your daughters to be physically active : Girls and young women who exercise regularly between the ages of 12 and 35 have a substantially lower risk of breast cancer before menopause compared to those who are less active , new research shows .
In the largest and most detailed analysis to date of the effects of exercise on premenopausal breast cancer , the study of nearly 65,000 women found that those who were physically active had a 23 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause .
In particular , high levels of physical activity from ages 12 to 22 contributed most strongly to the lower breast cancer risk .
The study is by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Harvard University in Boston .
"
We do n't have a lot of prevention strategies for premenopausal breast cancer , but our findings clearly show that physical activity during adolescence and young adulthood can pay off in the long run by reducing a woman 's risk of early breast cancer , " says lead investigator Graham Colditz , M.D. , Dr.P.H. , the Niess - Gain Professor and associate director of Prevention and Control at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes - Jewish Hospital .
" This is just one more reason to encourage young girls and women to exercise regularly . "
One - fourth of all breast cancers are diagnosed in women before menopause .
Numerous studies have shown that physical activity reduces the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer , but the few studies that have looked at the influence of exercise on breast cancer risk before menopause have produced conflicting results .
For the current analysis , researchers examined data on a subset of women enrolled in the Nurses ' Health Study II , a prospective study of registered nurses ages 24 to 42 .
These 64,777 women had filled out detailed annual questionnaires about their levels of physical activity from age 12 on .
After six years of follow - up , 550 women had been diagnosed with breast cancer .
The researchers found the age - adjusted incidence rates for invasive breast cancer dropped from 194 cases per 100,000 person - years in the least active women to 136 cases in the most active .
The levels of physical activity reported by the most active women were the equivalent of running 3.25 hours a week or walking 13 hours a week .
The benefit of exercise was not linked to a particular sport or intensity but related to total activity .
" You do n't have to be a marathon runner to get the risk - reducing benefits of exercise , " Colditz adds .
One leading theory to explain the lower risk of breast cancer among active young women is that exercise reduces their exposure to estrogens .
Numerous studies have shown that the more estrogen a woman is exposed to , the greater her risk for breast cancer .
Thus , women who begin menstruating later or enter menopause early have a lower risk of breast cancer .
And young women who are physically active are more likely to start their periods later and less likely to have regular cycles when they begin their periods .
The research was funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society .

Britain on alert for deadly new knife with exploding tip that freezes victims ' organs
Senior police officers have been warned to look out for a new knife which can inject a ball of compressed gas into its victim that instantly freezes internal organs .
The ' wasp knife ' , which can deliver a ball of compressed gas capable of killing its victim at the press of a button , may be heading for Britain , the Metropolitan Police fear .
A needle in the tip of the blade shoots out the frozen ball of gas which instantly balloons to the size of a basketball , freezing organs .
The Metropolitan Police have told colleagues in the West Midlands to be on the lookout for the blade , which is designed to kill sharks and bears .
Police fear that the ' wasp knife ' - designed to kill bears and sharks - may soon hit the streets of Britain
Police are concerned that the £ 200 weapon could fall into the wrong hands .
The American - made weapon is sold to hunters and divers and injects the frozen gas when the small handle - mounted trigger is pressed .
The manufacturer describes it as perfect for downed pilots , soldiers and security guards and boasts that it will " drop many of the world 's largest land predators " .
It can snap - freeze all tissue and organs in the area surrounding the blast .
A source close to West Midlands Police said : " The Met is obviously concerned about this and that is why they have circulated the information .
" This knife will almost certainly kill and the Met must have intelligence that they are in circulation .
" I think it is only a matter of time before one of these is used because the internet makes it much easier to find and buy weapons like this . "
Labour MP for Perry Barr in Birmingham , Khalid Mahmood , said : " Weapons like this are absolutely disgraceful and there is no reason at all why people should be walking around the streets with them .
" There should be high - profile operations and high - profile arrests against anybody caught with them .

Macs garnered an 8.5 percent share of the U.S. PC market during the second quarter of the year , pushing Apple past Acer in the national rankings and into third place overall , according to preliminary data released Wednesday by market research firm Gartner .
Gartner 's estimates
The Cupertino - based company saw Mac sales rise more than 38 percent to nearly 1.4 million units in the US during the three - month period ending June , making it the country 's third largest PC manufacturer behind Dell and HP , who saw sales rise 11.9 percent and 5.6 percent to 5.25 million and 4.167 million units , respectively .
Overall , Apple 's share of the US PC market was up more than 2 percent compared to the same period last year .
Total US PC shipments reached 16.5 million units in the second quarter of 2008 , a 4.2 percent increase from the same period last year .
" Dell continued to be the market leader with PC shipments accounting for 31.9 percent of the U.S. market in the second quarter of 2008 , " said Mika Kitagawa , principal analyst for Gartner 's Client Computing Markets group .
" Apple 's PC shipments grew 38.1 percent in the quarter .
The home PC segment continued to be the strongest driver for Apple , as well as sales into the education segment . "
Apple edged out Acer , who saw sales decline more than 20 percent , by a little over 65,000 units .
Meanwhile , Toshiba saw its own PC sales rise just 2.8 percent to 907,000 units , good enough for a 5.5 percent share and fifth place .

Overall , global PC shipments reached 71.9 million units in the second quarter of 2008 , a 16 percent increase year - over - year .
Apple , however , did not place within the top five manufacturers worldwide , meaning its global share of the market remains behind the 4.4 percent achieved by fifth place holder Toshiba , which sold a total of 3.14 million units in the second quarter .
" Mobile PCs continued to lead unit growth across all regions as the average selling price ( ASP ) of mobile PCs declined sharply relative to desk - based PC ASPs , " Kitagawa said .
" Economic uncertainties have hit PC revenues , resulting in steep ASP declines , especially in markets such as the United States and the Europe , Middle East , and Africa ( EMEA ) region . "

Holding on to its No.1 worldwide ranking was HP , which shipped just over 13 million systems , representing 17.1 percent growth and a 18.1 percent share .
Dell followed with sales of more than 11.2 million systems for a 15.6 percent global share , representing 21.9 percent yearly growth .
Acer ( 9.4 percent share ) , Lenovo ( 7.8 percent share ) , and Toshiba ( 4.4 percent share ) rounded out the top five .
IDC 's estimates
Slightly more cautious than its research rival , IDC said Wednesday in its own second - quarter study that Apple has finally broken through a symbolic barrier and will likely wind up tied for the third spot among U.S. computer vendors .
The Mac maker is said in the IDC prediction to have shipped just short of 1.33 million computers between April and June , which would give it the same 7.8 percent estimated American market share as Taiwan - based Acer .
Apple 's surge signals a year - over - year growth in sheer units of about 31.7 percent , continuing a relatively rapid sales acceleration that began roughly during the company 's switch to Intel processors .
Acer technically grew faster at 49.9 percent but was primarily helped by its merger with Gateway in the past year ; if the combined share of the two is measured from last year , the unified entity actually shrunk by 28.1 percent , according to IDC .
Apple remains unlikely to challenge the top two vendors in the country , Dell and Hewlett - Packard , any time soon , as the two alone account for more than half of all US sales in the most recent results at 32 percent and 25.1 percent of the market respectively .
The two are nonetheless growing relatively slowly at 12.1 percent year over year for Dell and just 5.9 percent for HP .
Toshiba lost share over the period , dipping from 5.4 percent to 5.2 percent .
PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has a 48 % to 41 % lead in the latest Gallup Poll Daily tracking presidential election trial heat , based on June 7 - 9 polling .
Voting preferences have been fairly stable over the last three individual days of tracking polling , all conducted since Hillary Clinton officially suspended her candidacy and publicly endorsed Obama for president on Saturday .
The seven percentage point advantage is Obama 's largest to date since Gallup began tracking the general election in March .
In turn , McCain has led Obama by as many as six percentage points in early May .

But every so often a group of animals get out of hand and humans need to set their massive intellect to the task of dealing with them .
And usually , it goes hilariously wrong :
Humans and animals live in peace for the most part , and many of us enjoy the company of a faithful dog to fetch our slippers or a sinister monkey to pick pockets from tourists while we grind our organ .
6 Indian Monkey Gangs
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
While the average North American is apt to think monkeys are all super cute and wear human clothes , they become less cute when you consider that , in India , they 're known to roam neighborhoods in gangs .
They break into houses to steal food , or just hang out and pleasure themselves .
The deputy mayor of Delhi actually died from a monkey attack , trying to fight off a screeching swarm of the things before tumbling off his balcony .
Adding to the problem is the fact that in many parts of India , monkeys are revered animals ( the monkey god Hanuman is so widely worshiped , he was named the chairman of an Indian business school ) .
Monkeys are not allowed to be trapped or killed and many people will leave food out for the monkeys , only to find out that such kind gestures often go unrewarded in monkeydom .

The " Solution "
The city of Delhi decided that fighting fire with fire was the only way to take on the monkey problem and has started making use of langurs ( small apes that are bigger than the monkeys already causing problems ) to protect buildings and scare off the little jerks .
Experts say this solution ranges from " stupid " to Planet of the Apes .
There is apparently a pretty good chance that in time , the two species of monkey will end up living peacefully .
Peacefully with each other , that is , and not with the humans .
Humans have a thing about not getting along peacefully with wild animals .
At this point we 're assuming they 'll need to get even larger monkeys to get rid of the problem they 've created until one day there 's nothing but monkeys of various sizes roaming the streets , and all the people have to move down the road a few miles .
Award - winning comparisons you can trust
It 's always nice to know you 're on the right track .
Over the years , as we have striven to improve the services we provide to our clients and users , we have been pleased to receive recognition for our efforts from both industry and consumer bodies .
The HSUS was founded more than 50 years ago as an organization focused on national cruelties , such as dogfighting , inhumane transport and slaughter of farm animals , and pet theft for research and testing .
A group operating on that scale was needed because local humane societies , consumed with animal care responsibilities within their communities , did not have the resources or the reach to challenge these national industries .
This strategic focus is more important now than ever , except that our reach must today be global , since most of the industries that cause harm to animals operate on that scale .
We attack the root causes of problems for animals , and we bring to the battle not just our enormous membership , but professional campaigners , lawyers , lobbyists , veterinarians , subject experts , communications specialists , undercover investigators , field staff , and others .
This nation needs a powerful , mainstream voice to take on institutionalized cruelty , and to advocate for a better way in dealing with the animals of the world .
While our advocacy work has expanded dramatically during the last five - plus decades , so have our animal care operations .
The HSUS is focused on preventing cruelty and tackling the root problems , but we also rescue and care for animals in need of our help .
And this week , I am pleased to announce the creation of our fourth animal care facility —
The HSUS 's Duchess Sanctuary in southern Oregon .
© The Ark Watch Foundation
These rescued horses will soon find a new home at The Duchess
Sanctuary .
The Duchess Sanctuary , which will be a sanctuary and rescue facility for horses located near Roseburg , Ore. , is an 1,120 - acre ranch and will serve as a sister facility to the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch , which is located in east Texas and operated by The HSUS and The Fund for Animals .
The creation of this new animal care facility comes at an opportune time , given that the slaughter industry and its allies are making outlandish claims about unwanted horses in response to our successful efforts to shut down all of the U.S. - based horse slaughter plants .
We will now have two 1,000 - plus - acre operations to care for abandoned or abused horses .
The new horse sanctuary also provides
The HSUS with greater geographic diversity of our hands - on services for animals — with Black Beauty Ranch in the South , the Cape Wildlife Center in the Northeast , The Fund for Animals Wildlife Center in southern California , and now The Duchess Sanctuary in the Pacific Northwest .
( The HSUS and The Fund for Animals are sister organizations , and our operations are fully integrated . )
The purchase of the Duchess Sanctuary property and some operational support is made possible thanks to a $ 3.5 million donation from the Roberts Foundation , the Ark Watch Foundation and its founder Celine Myers .
The sanctuary is named in honor of the first horse owned by Celine Myers ’ family and after Black Beauty ’s mother in Anna Sewell ’s famous novel .
With our network of sanctuaries and shelters , we are providing care for individual animals in need of a helping hand .
And at the same time , through our advocacy programs , we are fighting to reform institutional practices and behaviors that cause animals to be in distress or in danger in the first place .
If you 'd like to make a donation to support The Duchess Sanctuary and other programs of The Fund for Animals , please do so here .

Feds : Republican treasurer embezzled over $ 500 k
Federal prosecutors are aiming to block the sale of the home of Christopher J. Ward , former treasurer of the National Republican Congressional Committee , over allegations that he shifted over $ 500,000 from Senate Republicans into his personal accounts over a four - year period to make mortgage payments and fund remodeling jobs .
According to the Department of Justice and an internal NRCC audit stemming from its accusations against Ward in March , he began embezzling in 2003 .
$ 198,841 in particular has been isolated by investigators , $ 95,000 of which is said to be from the 2006 President ’s Dinner , to pay for work done on Ward ’s house .
Also diverted , say court documents , was $ 72,000 to make mortgage payments .
Ward , under investigation by the FBI , has been relieved of his duties with the NRCC but has yet to be charged criminally .
Five GOP - connected organizations so far have implicated Ward in the misappropriation of at least $ 47,000 , a far cry from what could have gone missing from the NRCC ; an internal audit there suggests a figure of up to $ 600,000 , but that audit is still in progress , said Karen Hanretty , NRCC ’s communications director .
Ward worked for the NRCC starting in November of 1995 , taking on the role of treasurer in 2003 .
He stepped down in July of 2007 but stayed on as a consultant until January 28 , 2008 , when it was discovered that he was not auditing NRCC ’s 2006 finances as previously believed .
An internal investigation by Chairman Tom Cole revealed that the last calendar year successfully audited was 2001 , with Ward fabricating reports for 2002 through 2006 .

Like calcium and iron , gold is a mineral that 's safe to eat , although it 's not an essential part of the human diet .
It may be pricey by the pound , but a small shaker of 23 K gold sprinkles ( 80 mg ) costs only $ 30 at Fancy Flours in Bozeman , Mont .
The store also carries flakes of gold leaf called " petals " - $ 45 for 150 milligrams - and packs of 25 small sheets of gold leaf for $ 75 .
Store owner Nancy Quist says all three versions sell exceptionally well : Bakers and bartenders use the precious metal to make dazzling treats for holidays and other special occasions .
An opera cake , for example , is a traditional layered sponge cake blanketed in chocolate ganache and adorned with crumbled pieces of gold .
For elaborate parties , people add gold sprinkles to glasses of Champagne or signature martinis .
One customer even used gold leaf to cover an entire Christmas turkey .
" Gold is a very over - the - top decoration , " Quist says .
" It 's insanely popular around the Oscars - people use it for drinks and to make Oscar - shaped cookies . "
The media attention being paid to Senator Barack Obama 's trip to Afghanistan this week has all the usual wing - nuts crying that the press is n't doing enough to cover Republican Presidential candidate George W. John McCain .
" ' The question really needs to be posed : Is this type of coverage fair ? ' said Rep. Eric Cantor , R - Va .
' This is nothing but a political stunt . ' "
" Talk show host Rush Limbaugh said none of this should be a surprise .
' My prediction is that the coverage of Obama on this trip will be oriented toward countering the notion he has no idea what he is talking about on foreign policy and defense issues and instead will prop him up as a qualified statesman , ' Limbaugh told The Associated Press .
' McCain , on the other hand , is a known quantity on these issues and his position does not excite nor fit the mainstream media 's narrative on Iraq and Afghanistan , so they simply ignore it and him . ' "
But news executives point out one nagging , little detail : viewers do n't want to tune in to hear McCain 's fucking bullshit .
Like CBS New Veep Paul Friedman , who wonders , " what are we supposed to do , go gin up some story about McCain to get some rough equality of airtime ?
I do n't think so . "
" NBC News President Steve Capus said he finds it funny this is an issue , considering how much people have accused the press corps - and still do - of being too cozy with McCain .
The Arizona senator had been a frequent guest of ' Meet the Press . '
" ' We 're just trying to do our jobs , ' Capus said .
' There 's no question that there 's great news value in Sen .
Obama 's trip overseas .
That 's why we are doing this . ' "

Walking Small :
There 's a New Sheriff in Town Kentucky boy tracks locals speeding through his neighborhood .
July 18 , 2008  -- Landon Wilburn of Louisville , Ky. has a thing that 's called " radar love . "
Fed up with drivers speeding through his neighborhood , the 11 - year old uses his Hot Wheels toy radar gun to police his neighborhood .
About a month ago , he put on an orange safety vest , took a battery - powered flashlight with a built - in siren , and along with his radar gun , he hit the road .
" I got the vest from my dad , and then the radar gun I got from somebody else ... we made a trade for it , " Landon said today on " Good Morning America . "
Landon had heard adults talking about the high volume of speeders on his street and the city 's sluggish plan to install speed bumps .
" I wanted to help the community , to help people slow down , " he said .
And so once or twice a week , he points his radar at speeders .
Landon says he 's clocked cars doing close to 40 in a 25 - mph zone .
" When I saw it happening , I got the biggest kick out of it , " George Ayers , who lives near the Wilburns , told The Louisville Courier - Journal .
" People were locking up their brakes when they saw him . "
Landon and his mother , Julia Wilburn , visited the " GMA " studios , where Landon was able to clock the speeds of Times Square drivers .
He said the fastest cars sped through the Square at around 30 mph .
" He 's very creative and thoughtful ; such a blessing , " Julia told " GMA 's " Chris Cuomo about her son .
" He 's always looking for ways to make a difference . "
The oldest of Julia 's four sons , she said he 's always had an interest in safety .
So is a career in law enforcement in Landon 's future ?
He told " GMA " that he 's interested in more than just policing traffic , and that he 's been thinking about a career in law enforcement for three years or so .
Does his radar gun slow down traffic ?
" Some slow down , but some just do n't care .
They just go right by , " said Landon .
But this young man could have a bright future in law enforcement .
" I commend him on his commitment , " said Chief Robert White of the Louisville Police Department .
But , " I encourage him to put his law enforcement efforts on hold for the next 10 or 20 years .
I think he 'll make a great applicant . "
PITY us poor mobile - phone users in America .
While the rest of the world enjoys network speeds that let people watch television on the move , surf the mobile web in its living glory , download videos in a trice , or exchange video messages with one another , we celebrate Apple 's launch of its iPhone 3G today as if were some great leap for mankind .
Not to belittle Apple 's heroic efforts .
The updated smartphone is a considerable improvement over its predecessor .
As its name implies , it can now use the third - generation ( 3G ) mobile networks that have become the norm around the world .
It is also much cheaper to buy , if not to own .
AFP
When introduced a year ago , the first iPhone was stuck in the 2.5G slow lane with a technology called EDGE ( Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution ) .
This offered download speeds little better than the dial - up connections computer users were lumbered with a decade ago .
The problem then was that the iPhone 's carrier in America , AT&T , had n't built anywhere near enough 3G transmission towers to provide a reliable high - speed network .
That 's changed over the past year .
Now EDGE 's successor , a 3G - wireless technology called HSDPA ( High - Speed Download Packet Access ) , provides transmission rates of 400 to 700 kilobits per second .
Speed freaks moan that 's still only half as fast as typical broadband connections used in the home .
For sure , it 's nowhere near brisk enough to beam seamless video to a mobile phone without hiccups .
Hence the 3.5G networks rolled out over the past few years by mobile carriers elsewhere in the world , and the trend to even faster 4G services , capable of download speeds of 20 megabits per second or more .
Even so , your correspondent still believes — as he suggested earlier this summer ( see article ) — that by doubling the speed and halving the price , as well as adding a heap of new features , Apple could still make the iPhone appeal not only to the fashionistas and faithful , but also to the rest of us who want a “ converged ” mobile device we can take anywhere and use to do practically anything .
Apart from its superb screen and intuitive interface , Apple iPhone has matured a good deal over the past year .
Some of its new grown - up features will make it a whole lot more attractive to business users .
One of the most important is Apple 's deal with Microsoft to use the latter 's ActiveSync and Exchange technology .
That will allow the iPhone to work with Microsoft Outlook and receive “ pushed ” e-mail , contacts and calendars , just like a BlackBerry .
Also , the new iPhone should now run Cisco's VPN ( Virtual Private Network ) — the gold standard for encrypted access to corporate networks .
Together , such features could help make the iPhone a force to be reckoned with in the business world .
But before that can happen , work needs to be done to make the iPhone secure and robust enough to quell concerns of corporate IT departments .
There 's also the problem of the iPhone 's built - in battery , which can't be swapped without a trip to the factory .
Many business travellers carry a fully - charged spare for the moment their phone runs out of juice .
Bizarrely , in terms of basic business tools , the iPhone still lacks a simple way of cutting - and - pasting chunks of data from one software application to another .
Road warriors spend much of their time clipping snippets from downloaded company reports and spreadsheets to e-mail to colleagues and clients — a task that is all but impossible for iPhone users .
Meanwhile , AT&T has been coy about whether it will allow the new iPhone to be used as an “ untethered ” 3G modem .
Such a feature would save businesses considerable sums by obviating the need for separate 3G mobile modem cards for popping into employees laptops when they are away from WiFi hotspots .
While IT managers are understandably leery about recommending the iPhone for company employees , individual owners are going to be sneaking their prized possession into the office to access e-mail and corporate information .
Bosses , too , who become enamoured of the iPhone will be insisting the firm support it .
Against their better judgment , many IT managers will doubtless comply .
No question , Apple 's innovative design has sent a wake - up call to smartphone makers everywhere .
From tiny Palm , the struggling smartphone pioneer , to Research In Motion ( RIM ) , the BlackBerry manufacturer , and the dozen or so handset makers who build smartphones based on Microsoft 's Windows Mobile , as well as the 800 - pound gorilla of the business , Nokia — all have been forced to react to the iPhone 's touch screen , intuitive software and iconic appeal , not to mention its rapid penetration of the market .
Apple has sold more than 5 m iPhones over the past year .
Practically all have been bought by individuals at their own expense , rather than their employers ' .
The iPhone now accounts for 19 % of the smartphone market in the United States .
That 's ahead of Palm 's 13 % , but still well behind RIM's 45 % .
Over the past few months , competing 3G smartphones with touch screens and a host of features have been coming thick and fast .
Sprint has started to offer Samsung 's Instinct , which seeks to trump the iPhone with a higher download speed , better video , picture messaging , navigation and applications , plus a battery that can be removed .
Verizon has unleashed two touch - screen 3G smartphones recently that match the new iPhone in speed and visual impact .
The Voyager from LG in South Korea is a clamshell that opens to reveal a full QWERTY keyboard .
The Dare , also from LG , is a stylish iPhone lookalike that likewise uses a virtual keyboard on its screen .
Both have been designed to use Verizon 's fast EV - DO ( Evolution - Date Optimised ) network capable of speeds in excess of 2.4 megabits per second .
Palm has been staging a comeback with its Centro , a trim little 3G phone and e-mail device aimed squarely at consumers .
The Centro costs half as much as even the latest iPhone and is selling briskly .
Meanwhile , to defend its home turf , RIM recently announced an iPhone killer called BlackBerry Bold .
This has the Canadian maker 's classic keyboard and trackball , WiFi , Bluetooth and GPS navigation .
But it also has a fast processor , a brilliant screen plus four separate radios for tapping the vast majority of 2G , 3G and 3.5G networks around the world .
RIM has clearly learned a lot from its recent foray into the consumer side of the business , with its BlackBerry Pearl and Curve models .
Its 16 m base of corporate users includes some 60 % new subscribers .
Clearly , the BlackBerry Bold raises the game for corporate users everywhere .
But perhaps more importantly , it also represents RIM 's most determined effort yet to show consumers that a real smartphone is more than just a pretty face .
Waiting in the wings are any number of open - source smartphones based on the nifty Linux operating system .
Apple will need to pull out all the stops if the iPhone is not to be swept aside by the flood of do - it - all smartphones heading for American shores .
While his friends scramble for jobs flipping burgers or bagging groceries this summer , 18 - year - old Mike Everest will be working as a trader in the fantasy Web world of Entropia Universe , buying and selling virtual animal skins and weapons .
His goods exist only online , but his earnings are real .
In the past four years , he 's made $ 35,000 .
Mr. Everest , of Durango , Colo. , is among a new breed of young entrepreneurs seeking their fortune online in imaginary worlds .
As the pool of traditional summer jobs shrinks , tech - savvy young ...
TIFF starts today .
We ’ve already posted some reviews some but this film is probably the most requested .
As we ’ve mentioned before , Saoirse Ronan has her first ever nude scene in Ammonite .
About three quarters of the way into Ammonite , Kate Winslet enters a well - lit bedroom where Saoirse Ronan is lying in bed .
Kate joins Saoirse in bed and the two start making out .
Saoirse then starts kissing Kate ’s left breast and soon has her hand down between Kate ’s legs but nothing is shown .
Kate then lifts up Saoirse ’s nightgown a bit so we can maybe see some bush .
It ’s pretty dark and shadowy so possibly a merkin .
We do see Kate put her hand between Saoirse ’s legs briefly .
Kate then removes her own nightgown while Saoirse puts her head between Kate ’s legs and performs oral sex .
We see Kate ’s breasts and just the top of her very hairy bush when Saoirse moves her head away for a brief second .
Saoirse then climbs on top of Kate ’s face and we see part of her butt .
Saoirse then proceeds to remove her own nightgown and we get a couple of views of her butt and Kate ’s breasts as Kate is going to town .
Kate then reaches down and touches herself between her legs and we see more of her bush .
This is interspersed with cloesups of Saoirse ’s face as she is in ecstasy .
Finally , we see Saoirse ’s right breast briefly as she climbs off of Kate .
We can also get a tiny peek at Saoirse ’s left breast as well as maybe a hint of bush or merkin .
There are a couple of quick views of Kate ’s breasts as they embrace while the scene ends .
That is the only nude scene in the film .
Earlier , there ’s a scene where Kate goes down on Saoirse but Saoirse keeps her dress on so nothing can be seen .
There is also a scene where Saoirse goes into the sea with Kate .
Saoirse is wearing a white dress so there might be something there but it did n’t seem like it .
The scene right after this has Kate naked in bed beside a clothed Saoirse but nothing can really be seen .
Stay tuned for more reviews from TIFF , Venice , and other fall festivals over the next little while .
Researchers have invented a new material that will make cars even more efficient , by converting heat wasted through engine exhaust into electricity .
In the current issue of the journal Science , they describe a material with twice the efficiency of anything currently on the market .
The same technology could work in power generators and heat pumps , said project leader Joseph Heremans , Ohio Eminent Scholar in Nanotechnology at Ohio State University .
Scientists call such materials thermoelectric materials , and they rate the materials ' efficiency based on how much heat they can convert into electricity at a given temperature .
Previously , the most efficient material used commercially in thermoelectric power generators was an alloy called sodium - doped lead telluride , which had a rating of 0.71 .
The new material , thallium - doped lead telluride , has a rating of 1.5 -- more than twice that of the previous leader .
What 's more important to Heremans is that the new material is most effective between 450 and 950 degrees Fahrenheit -- a typical temperature range for power systems such as automobile engines .
advertisement
Some experts argue that only about 25 percent of the energy produced by a typical gasoline engine is used to move a car or power its accessories , and nearly 60 percent is lost through waste heat -- much of which escapes in engine exhaust .
A thermoelectric ( TE ) device can capture some of that waste heat , Heremans said .
It would also make a practical addition to an automobile , because it has no moving parts to wear out or break down .
" The material does all the work .
It produces electrical power just like conventional heat engines -- steam engines , gas or diesel engines -- that are coupled to electrical generators , but it uses electrons as the working fluids instead of water or gases , and makes electricity directly . "
" Thermoelectrics are also very small , " he added .
" I like to say that TE converters compare to other heat engines like the transistor compares to the vacuum tube . "
The engineers took a unique strategy to design this new material .
advertisement
To maximize the amount of electricity produced by a TE material , engineers would normally try to limit the amount of heat that can pass through it without being captured and converted to electricity .
So the typical strategy for making a good thermoelectric material is to lower its thermal conductivity .
In Heremans ' lab , he used to work to lower the thermal conductivity by building nanometer - sized structures such as nanowires into materials .
A nanometer is one billionth of a meter .
Those nanostructured materials are not very stable , are very difficult to make in large quantities , and are difficult to connect with conventional electronic circuits and external heat sources .
For this new material , he and his colleagues took a different strategy : they left out the fancy nanostructures , and instead focused on how to convert the maximum amount of heat that was trapped in the material naturally .
To do this , they took advantage of some new ideas in quantum mechanics .
Heremans pointed to a 2006 paper published by other researchers in the journal Physical Review Letters , which suggested that elements such as thallium and tellurium could interact on a quantum - mechanical level to create a resonance between the thallium electrons and those in the host lead telluride thermoelectric material , depending on the bonds between the atoms .
" It comes down to a peculiar behavior of an electron in a thallium atom when it has tellurium neighbors , " he said .
" We 'd been working for 10 years to engineer this kind of behavior using different kinds of nanostructured materials , but with limited success .
Then I saw this paper , and I knew we could do the same thing we'd been trying to do with nanostructures , but with this bulk semiconductor instead . "
Heremans designed the new material with Vladimir Jovovic , who did this work for his doctoral thesis in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Ohio State .
Researchers at Osaka University -- Ken Kurosaki , Anek Charoenphakdee , and Shinsuke Yamanaka -- created samples of the material for testing .
Then researchers at the California Institute of Technology -- G. Jeffrey Snyder , Eric S. Toberer , and Ali Saramat -- tested the material at high temperatures .
Heremans and Jovovic tested it at low temperatures and provided experimental proof that the physical mechanism they postulated was indeed at work .
The team found that near 450 degrees Fahrenheit , the material converted heat to electricity with an efficiency rating of about 0.75 -- close to that of sodium doped telluride .
But as the temperature rose , so did the efficiency of the new material .
It peaked at 950 degrees Fahrenheit , with a rating of 1.5 .
Heremans ' team is continuing to work on this patent - pending technology .
" We hope to go much further .
I think it should be quite possible to apply other lessons learned from thermoelectric nanotechnology to boost the rating by another factor of two -- that 's what we 're shooting for now , " he said .
This research was funded by the BSST Corporation ; the State of Ohio Department of Development ’s Center for Photovoltaic Innovation and Commercialization at Ohio State University ; the Beckman Institute ; the Swedish Bengt Lundqvist Minne Foundation ; and NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory .

Square Enix is still playing coy when talking about its exclusivity deals that concern upcoming RPG titles for the Xbox 360 .
In a statement made on Yahoo Japan 's financial site , the company affirms that there are no plans to release the just - announced Star Ocean : The Last Hope on the PlayStation 3 .
This is of course careful wording – " no plans " – because it was quite clear at the Microsoft RPG event earlier this week that there was never any announcement of an exclusive release for the Xbox 360 ( unlike the trumpeting of exclusivity for Tales of Vesperia and Infinite Undiscovery ) .
* Star Ocean 4 * will launch in 2009 on the Xbox 360 ; that 's it for now .
This game of exclusivity and timed - exclusivity is really getting ridiculous .
Sure , it 's entirely understandable that
Sony and Microsoft both want to get any advantage they can in the current - gen console wars , but it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that a company is hedging its bets in terms of multi-platform releases .

If the answer to the latter question is " to knock my grandmother 's head off to let out the evil spirits that gave her cancer " , then maybe the problem is actually unrelated to jackhammers
( CNN ) -- Federal officials vastly overestimated the value of hurricane relief supplies given away earlier this year , the Federal Emergency Management Agency reported Monday .
Debra Reed lived in a tent after Katrina and says she needed the supplies given away by FEMA .
The General Services Administration , which manages federal property , over - counted cases of toilet paper , plastic sporks and other cutlery , by mistakenly counting a single item as being worth as much as multiple items contained in a package of goods .
The original GSA estimate of $ 85 million should have been $ 18.5 million , according to figures released by GSA and FEMA .
The household goods were supposed to go to people whose homes were destroyed by hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
But the items were stored in warehouses in Louisiana , and then Fort Worth , Texas .
A recent CNN investigative story exposed that those materials never made it to storm victims .
GSA officials were asked recently to reassess the total cost of donated items in what the agency called a routine audit .
" In doing so , it was determined that some of the unit costs were ' eaches ' and others were ' for - case ' lots .
The final adjustments reveal there was a significant overstatement in the total asset valuation , " GSA officials reported to FEMA , which released the findings Monday .
For example , each spork was assigned the value of an entire case , inflating the original estimated value of the supplies a thousandfold to $ 36 million from $ 36,000 .
Packs of toilet paper originally estimated to be worth $ 1.5 million dropped to about $ 18,000 , and plastic cutlery kits , from $ 6.3 million to about $ 25,000 .
" The actual total value of the surplus property was determined to be approximately $ 18.5 [ million ] , and this figure was validated by both FEMA and the GSA Office of Personal Property Management , " FEMA told CNN in an e-mail .
GSA spokeswoman Viki Reath said Monday she would investigate whether it is unusual for the agency to make such a large accounting mistake .
The agency told CNN in February that the value of the FEMA items was about $ 85 million .
FEMA 's decision to give the items to states and federal agencies as surplus rankled aid workers and officials in Mississippi and Louisiana .
Relief workers in those states are still working to resettle many of people displaced by Katrina .
Members of the House and Senate homeland security committees are scheduled to hold a joint hearing into the give - away Thursday in Washington .
" To hurricane survivors in need , $ 18.5 million is a huge amount of money , " said U.S. Sen .
Mary Landrieu , D- Louisiana .
" FEMA 's mistake in tallying the cost of the household goods it deemed surplus does not change the situation . "
A CNN investigation revealed in June that FEMA gave away 121 truckloads of material from the Fort Worth facility .
The agency said it was paying about $ 1 million a year to store the supplies , which were purchased as starter " living kits " for hurricane victims .
Officials in Louisiana originally declined the supplies when FEMA gave them away ; the state 's surplus property agency told CNN it was unaware of the need .
Mississippi distributed items it received to prisons , fire departments , colleges and even the agency that regulates the state 's casino industry .
In the wake of the CNN investigation , Landrieu was able to get several truckloads of the surplus property returned to Louisiana , where nonprofit groups will distribute it to Katrina victims .

When Baron P. Hill , the local congressman , endorsed Barack Obama last week , his surprise announcement was greeted with a roof - raising cheer from more than 12,000 people crowded into the basketball arena at Indiana University .
“ Can we work together to change the tenor and tone of politics in Washington ? ”
Hill hollered , and the crowd of Obama supporters joined in : “ Yes , we can ! ”
But Donald Bobbitt was puzzled by Hill ’s decision .
The 70 - year - old retiree likes Hill and helped elect the Democrat to one of the most competitive congressional seats in the country .
Obama , however , is “ too much Islamic , ” Bobbitt said a day after the announcement , as he manned the amateur radio exhibit at the annual Dogwood Festival in Orleans , about 40 miles south of the Bloomington campus .
“ We do n’t need that in this country . ” ( Obama actually is a practicing Christian . )
Voters in Indiana and North Carolina go the polls today in the biggest day of balloting left on the waning presidential primary campaign calendar .
Most have little at risk .

But for members of Congress , who are among the superdelegates holding the outcome of the Democratic contest in their hands , the stakes are more personal .
For those facing tough reelection fights -- in North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Florida and here in Indiana -- political survival could depend on their choice and on which candidate , Clinton or Obama , leads the ticket in November .
“ It certainly makes a difference ” in closely fought districts , said James E. Campbell , political science chairman at the State University of New York at Buffalo and an expert on presidential coattails .
He says that a candidate sharing the ballot with a strong presidential nominee can pick up a substantial number of votes .
“ Somebody unpopular at the top of the ticket can actually cost you votes , ” Campbell said .
That could be decisive here in southeastern Indiana , where the seat in Hill ’s 9th Congressional District has gone back and forth -- Democrat , Republican , Democrat -- three times in the last six years .
Starting in the liberal bastion of Bloomington , the district meanders south to the Kentucky border and east to Ohio .
Small towns dot its winding roads ; some consist of little more than a gas station , a small grocer , some grazing cows and a few scattered homes .

As the rolling countryside opens up , accents flatten and broaden into a soft Southern twang .
The feel is much closer to Appalachia than Indianapolis , the state capital , which is less than 100 miles away .
Hill comes from Seymour -- the “ small town ” John Mellencamp sang about -- near the center of the district .
A high school basketball star , former insurance salesman and onetime president of the local Jaycees , Hill faces an election rematch in November against Republican Mike Sodrel .
It is the fourth straight time the two have competed .
Sodrel , who founded the Free Enterprise System charter bus company and boasts of grease under his fingernails , intends to make Hill ’s support of Obama an issue .
“ This district is 20 counties ; more trees per square mile than people , ” Sodrel said with a drawl as he motored up Interstate 65 to a fundraiser .
“ It ’s the rural areas that Sen. Obama talked about in San Francisco .
Yeah , they own firearms and go to church .
But they do n’t feel ‘ bitter . ’
They just feel that ’s normal . ”
Hill conceded that his endorsement was a gamble , especially given the region ’s conservative tilt .
Outside Monroe County , home to the university , the 9th District is overwhelmingly white and working - class .
Bobbitt , for one , says he plans to bolt the Democratic Party and vote for Republican John McCain in November .

“ If I ’d made a political decision , I just would have stayed out of it , ” Hill said in a telephone interview from Washington .
“ The endorsement , I think , in the short run probably wo n’t be helpful to me .
I ’m hopeful in the long run it will be . ”
Like many ,
Hill is eager for an end to the party ’s extended nominating fight .
He talks up Obama ’s promise to shun party labels and work across partisan lines , something Hill has attempted as a member of the centrist Blue Dog Democrats on Capitol Hill .
Obama “ deals with Democrats and Republicans , liberals and conservatives , black and white , like I nobody I have ever seen , ” Hill said .
Many Democrats also calculate that Obama , more than New York Sen. Clinton , can inspire legions of new voters -- particularly young people -- to turn out in November .
They see a greater potential to draw independents and crossover Republicans as well .
That is one reason Obama continues to pick up superdelegate endorsements even after Clinton ’s victories in Ohio and Pennsylvania , and as controversy flares over the Illinois senator ’s relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .

Indiana was central to the Democratic takeover of the House in 2006 .
The party gained three seats here , including the one held by Hill , who first went to Congress in 1998 .
He lost in 2004 , then beat Sodrel in 2006 to reclaim the seat .
Hill ’s record reflects the duality of his district , where many voters are culturally conservative but still think of themselves as Democrats .
Hill opposes the war in Iraq and voted against a constitutional flag - burning amendment , but has an A rating from the National Rifle Assn. and supports restrictions on abortion .
He describes his constituents as “ common - sense , hardworking people who have a great deal of faith in Jesus . ”
Hill ’s accommodation was evident in his remarks at the Bloomington rally -- “ If we can change the tone and work together . . . we can begin solving the problems of this country ” -- which Obama echoed after they embraced and linked arms in front of the crowd .
“ Baron is working for the kind of change that we need in Washington , because he does n’t stand for rigid partisanship , ” said Obama , who went to unusual lengths praising Hill .
“ He ’s trying to bring Democrats , Republicans , independents together to actually get something done . ”
Advertisement
Whether the endorsement helps or hurts is unknowable for now .
It depends almost entirely on how Obama is perceived in the fall , should he win the nomination .
“ If Obama can redefine the party away from its old standard Democratic liberalism , as he ’s trying to do , it could help Hill some , ” said Gerald Wright , who teaches political science at Indiana University .
“ On the other hand , if he gets painted as a black militant . . . that would be real bad . ”
Given the potential downside , Hill might hope skeptics respond like John Scoggan , 65 , a retired tool - and - die maker .
He was running errands on a blustery day in Bedford when he paused to consider the presidential candidates .
Scoggan is no Clinton fan and does n’t care much for Sen. McCain of Arizona .
But he prefers either to Obama .
“ I do n’t like his preacher more than anything , ” Scoggan said of Wright , who was Obama ’s pastor for 20 years .
“ I think if he ’s been with him that long , he ’s got the same ideas .
He ’s just trying to hide them now . ”
Advertisement
Told of Hill ’s endorsement , Scoggan scrunched his face , then reconsidered .
He has voted for Hill in the past and will probably do so again .
“ He has a right to his opinion and I do mine , ” Scoggan said .
“ That ’s what it ’s all about . ”

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - Unlucky for some ?
Dutch statisticians have established that Friday 13th , a date regarded in many countries as inauspicious , is actually safer than an average Friday .
A study published on Thursday by the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics ( CVS ) showed that fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays .
“ I find it hard to believe that it is because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home , but statistically speaking , driving is a little bit safer on Friday 13th , ” CVS statistician Alex Hoen told the Verzekerd insurance magazine .
In the last two years , Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday , the CVS study said .
But the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500 .
There were also fewer incidents of fire and theft , although the average value of losses on Fridays 13th was slightly higher .

" Back in the 1990s , the government outlawed computer - generated ( " CG " ) images of sexualized children .
But a few years later , ruling in a case called Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , the Supreme Court said CG child porn is legal ... the general consensus was that the technological state - of - the - art for CG human images was n't so good anyway .
If you concocted a CG image of a child having sex , the thinking went , it would n't fool anyone , because it was too low - tech to seem real .
Within a couple of years , though , people caught with child porn images were going to court and claiming they did n't have anything real , only CG — and that if the government thought otherwise , it would have to prove it .
The government developed several responses .
One : find the actual child depicted in the pornography , and bring that real child into court , or bring in the cop who handled her case .
This would show beyond a doubt that the defendant 's material was not computer - generated .
Another strategy is to match the images in evidence to others previously collected by the feds , then show that the whole set dates to pre-Photoshop times , back when anything that looked like a photograph of a real kid really was real .
But what if child victims and old photo sets are n't available ?
A third government technique is to tell courts that the average person ( an FBI agent , a jury member ) can still distinguish what 's real and what 's CG , just by looking with the naked eye .
Is this true ?
The government would like us to think so .
But in point of fact , the boundary between real and CG is getting fuzzier by the year – and the feds are nervous . "
" After [ the experts ' ] presentations , it seemed clear that the technology exists to make real child porn look fake .
And — much more significantly — to make CG porn which looks genuine enough to fool ordinary people .
An obvious question that comes to mind , then , is : how much of this sophisticated child CG porn is already on the Internet ?
My sense from attending the workshops is : Probably hardly any .
But the scarcity has little to do with technology .
The digital world is now rife with graphics professionals and hobbyists who spend lots of time creating reasonably real - looking virtual people as still images – adults and kids .
CG adults ( especially women ) often look “ sexy . ”
Sometimes they 're even having sex .
But virtual kids are not portrayed sexually ( though teen girls often look “ come hither ” ) .
CG kids remain chaste , probably , because there 's no commercial market for child porn and thus no significant money to be made by doing virtual renditions of the stuff .
Hobbyists , of course , do n't need money to pursue their passions .
But even they are probably reluctant to do CG child porn .
It 's not like they can post it on graphic arts websites and get props from fellow artists .
Plus , virtual child porn is legal in the US , but it 's outlawed in many other countries .
If an American 's CG smut got emailed overseas , he could get in big trouble . "
" Given the above , I bet most defendants and their attorneys who raise the CG defense are bullshitting .
They 've probably been caught with the real thing .
But for how long will almost everything on the net be real ?
One thing is certain : if something becomes possible for human beings to do , someone will do it . "
from reporter Debbie Nathan , who attended a research convention of The Academy of Forensic Sciences to discover what the geeks at the FBI have learned about the relationship , and potential , between " real " and " computer - generated " pornographic images .
The police 's particular interest , in this case , is child abuse .
Sexualized images of real children are illegal , but computer - generated images are not prosecuted in the U.S. , as yet , because they do n't show actual kids .
This debate has gotten hotter , because it's now difficult to tell what 's real — computer - editing programs are facile enough to turn anyone , theoretically , into an amateur touch - up artist .
Many questions also arise from the Feds ' investigations .
Do virtual pictures attract people with ill intent or actions toward children ?
Or is this a bizarre , if preferable , method of harm reduction ?
Debbie Nathan is perhaps best known for her book , Satan 's Silence : Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt about some of the widely covered sex panic cases that rocked the U.S. in the ' 80s and '90s , such as the McMartin preschool case in California .
Here 's what she wrote after returning from the forensic scientists ' conference .
Check out Debbie 's site to see more incredibly realistic ( G- rated ! of course ) computer - generated images , and to read the rest of her story ... it 's a science fiction novel come to life : Nathan 's final conclusion ?
From btrfs Wiki
Conversion from other filesystems ( ext2 , ext3 , ext4 , reiserfs ) to btrfs
Btrfs has very few pieces of metadata that live in fixed locations , making it relatively easy to implement an in place conversion utility from other filesystems .
Copy on write algorithms allow Btrfs to preserve an unmodified copy of the original FS , and allow administrator to undo the conversion , even after making changes in the resulting Btrfs filesystem .
The conversion program btrfs - convert uses libe2fs to read the ext3/ 4 metadata , and uses the free blocks in the ext3 filesystem to hold the new Btrfs filesystem .
The basic conversion algorithm works like this :
Duplicate the first 1MB of the device
Duplicate directories and inodes , creating copies in Btrfs
Take references on ext3 file data blocks from the Btrfs files
This does create copies of all the ext3 metadata , but the Btrfs files simply point to the same blocks used by the ext3 files .
This shares the bulk of the blocks in use between the two filesystems .
Because Btrfs uses copy on write for all file modifications , the original ext3 version of the file data blocks is preserved .
The first 1MB of the device is copied to an alternate location so that Btrfs metadata may be written there .
Undoing the conversion simply involves restoring these blocks .
The result of the conversion looks something like this :
The conversion program creates a snapshot in Btrfs that references all of the blocks used by ext3 , allowing the administrator to control how long the original ext3 filesystem is preserved .
If the admin wishes to recover the space used by ext3 , the snapshot can be deleted and the conversion will be permanent .
Until the snapshot is deleted , only blocks that were marked as free in ext3 are used to hold new Btrfs modifications .
This means the conversion can be undone at any time , restoring the original ext3 FS .
The converter creates a sparse file to hold all of the references to the original ext3 filesystem , and the offsets in this file correspond to offsets on the block device .
This allows the admin to mount the image file via readonly loopback and see the original ext3 filesystem and the converted Btrfs filesystem at the same time .
The manual page contains further information how to use the conversion utility .
Example usage
# Always run fsck first fsck.ext3 -f /dev/xxx # Convert from Ext3/4-> Btrfs btrfs - convert / dev/xxx #
Mount the resulting Btrfs filesystem mount -t btrfs / dev/xxx / btrfs # Mount the ext3 / 4 snapshot mount -t btrfs -o subvol=ext2_saved / dev/xxx / ext2_saved # Loopback mount the image file mount -t ext3 - o loop , ro / ext2_saved / image /ext3
In the example above , the files in /ext3 and in / btrfs will be identical .
Any modifications made in / btrfs will not show up in / ext3 .
If you wish to roll back the conversion :
# Completely unmount the Btrfs filesystem umount / ext3 umount / ext2_saved umount / btrfs # roll back the conversion btrfs - convert -r / dev/xxx # use the original filesystem mount -t ext3 / dev/xxx /ext3
Or , if you wish to recover the space used by the original Ext3/4 FS and make the conversion permanent , simply delete / ext2 _saved / image .
Once the image is deleted , the disk will look something like this :
Before first use
Suppose you 're satisfied now and do not intend to rollback .
Delete the saved subvolume :
# on a mounted filesystem btrfs subvol delete ext2_saved
Wait until all it's fully deleted , this happens on the background .
You can check whether there 's a DELETED subvolume in the listing of btrfs subvol list -d / mnt .
Now any logical relation to the original filesystem is removed .
The new filesystem inherits the block placement and file data fragmentation .
Due to this it is highly recommended to do full defragmentation and full rebalance before " production " use .
It is not required for general operation but will impact performance .
A notable caveat is that a balance can fail with " ENOSPC " if the defragment is skipped .
This is usually due to large extents on ext being larger than the maximum size btrfs normally operates with ( 1 GB ) .
A defrag of all large files will avoid this :
btrfs fi defrag -r / mnt btrfs balance start / mnt
Alternative to defragment only files larger than 1 GB :
find / mnt - type f - size +1G - print - exec btrfs fi defrag {} \ ; btrfs balance start / mnt
Please note , that the balance process can take very long , you may want to do it in smaller steps , eg. metadata only , then data .

June 6 , 2008  -- David Jacobs , a convicted steroids dealer who created one of the largest illegal performance - enhancing drug networks in the country , committed suicide , according to the Dallas County Medical Examiner .
Plano , Texas , police found Jacobs , 35 , and Amanda Jo Earhart - Savell , 30 , dead of gunshot wounds Thursday in Jacobs ' home .
The medical examiner said Friday that Jacobs suffered a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the abdomen and another to the head .
Earhart - Savell was shot several times , but the examiners could n't say more about her death at this time .
Jacobs , a former amateur bodybuilder , met recently with NFL security officials and gave them names of players he said had bought steroids from him .
Jacobs was fined $ 25,000 May 1 and sentenced to three years ' probation by a federal court when he pleaded guilty in Dallas to possession of anabolic steroids with the intention to distribute .
The Dallas Morning News reported that Plano police investigated Jacobs ' home on Honey Creek Lane and found Earhart - Savell , a professional fitness competitor , also shot to death alongside Jacobs .
The paper reported that Plano police spokesman Rick McDonald said that some of Earhart - Savell 's family members had called the police a few minutes after midnight Wednesday because they did not know where she was , although they suspected she might be at Jacobs ' Plano house .
Neighbors said they did not see or hear any suspicious activity before the bodies were found .
" We offer our sympathy to the families of David Jacobs and Amanda Jo Earhart - Savell , " NFL spokesman Greg Aillo told ESPN .
" As we have previously confirmed , our security representatives interviewed David Jacobs on two occasions .
We are reviewing the information to determine if there is documented evidence establishing any violations of our program and will follow up on any other information that is provided .
" It is premature to comment on any specific player at this time .
Anyone found to have violated our policies will be subject to discipline , including suspension .
We will continue to be responsive to any needs of law enforcement on this matter . "
Jacobs admitted last month that he provided former Dallas Cowboys player Matt Lehr with steroids between the spring of 2006 and the spring of 2007 , profiting from his sales by tens of thousands of dollars .
Jacobs further stated that Lehr agreed to have China ship boxes of raw steroid powder to his home in Georgia .
Jacobs ' attorney , Hank Hockeimer , however , did not provide The Dallas Morning News with the names of other players who have bought performance - enhancing drugs from Jacobs , although Jacobs revealed the names of some of his customers to Dallas NFL security officials May 21 .
After his arrest last year , Jacobs abided by federal authorities ' requests .
But until Jacobs was sentenced to three months ' probation on May 1 , he sold -- monthly -- about 1,000 bottles of anabolic steroids and 1,000 growth hormone kits that he received illegally from China .
He also suggested to 10 of his customers that they use finasteride , a drug to counteract balding , because it conceals the use of performance - enhancing drugs during drug tests .
Lehr , who also played for Tampa Bay and Atlanta , tested positive for an illegal substance and was suspended from the Atlanta Falcons for four games in October 2006 .
ESPN said that Lehr played for Tampa Bay last season and joined the Saints during the off - season .
Since his suspension , Lehr has not used illegal substances and has passed NFL drug tests , according to Lehr 's attorney Paul Coggins .
In Lehr 's defense , Coggins said that because Lehr did not pay Jacobs ' legal fees , Jacobs made unproved accusations out of vengeance .
Before Jacobs sold steroids and growth hormones to bodybuilders , police officers and NFL players , he had a nutritional supplement business .
He recently told The Dallas Morning News he wanted to rekindle his business .
He had financial problems , however , and his former clients were no longer receptive to his product promotions .
Jacobs , a former Marine , is credited with beginning one of the biggest networks for steroid trafficking in the United States , according to The Dallas Morning News .
Last year , he received three years ' probation on the condition that he help in a countrywide effort to combat illegal steroid usage .
He wanted to rebuild his life , and on May 21 , he said he planned to arrange sessions to educate children about the dangers of illegal performance - enhancing drugs .
" They are being scheduled now , everyone is really supportive ! " Jacobs wrote in an e-mail to The Dallas Morning News last month .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .
Do not misunderstand our argument .
Controlling Medicare costs is essential to restoring budget health .
But no politician , least of all Mr. McCain , is simply going to slash the life out of the program .
Even reform of Social Security , which Mr. McCain has also promised and which also must occur to restore long - term fiscal balance , would not right the budget anytime soon .
Any feasible reform ( not that Mr. McCain has one ) would have to phase in over decades .
Which leads us to conclude that Mr. McCain is merely talking the balanced - budget talk .
Mr. McCain and his advisers must know that his numbers do not add up .
But adding up is not their point .
Their point is to perpetuate the fantasy that Americans can have ever bigger tax cuts and a balanced federal budget .
They cannot .
The unbalanced budgets of the Reagan years and two Bush presidencies are proof .
No one  not presidents , not members of Congress , not the voters  has ever been willing , and rightly so , to starve government to the point that would make never - ending tax cuts affordable .
But feeding the fantasy is easier than presenting tough choices , and it worked for Mr. McCain ’s Republican predecessors .
Following in those footsteps does not , however , make a good case for his candidacy .
Americans face hardship in the years to come .
The demands of a tanking economy , coming on top of years of unmet needs  for health care , infrastructure repair and alternative energy , to name a few  will require the next president to spend more and to raise taxes to support that spending .
A blanket commitment to cutting tax cuts while balancing the budget precludes sensible discussion of how to do that .
Longer term , the challenge is perhaps even more daunting .
Saving more is ultimately the only way to dig out of the budget hole that the nation is in .
That will be painful , because higher government savings , done properly , means higher taxes and restrained spending .
Candidates for president do not like to be pessimistic , or even candid , really , about the economy .
But a leader who wants to steer the nation through tough times should not spend the campaign telling Americans they can have it all .
WASHINGTON , June 16 ( Reuters ) - Democrats in the U.S. Congress , who came to power last year on a call to end the combat in Iraq , will soon give President George W. Bush the last war - funding bill of his presidency without any of the conditions they sought for withdrawing U.S. troops , congressional aides said on Monday .
Lawmakers are arranging to send Bush $ 165 billion in new money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , enough to last for about a year and well beyond when Bush leaves office on Jan. 20 .
" It 'll be the lump sum of money , veterans ( funding ) and that 's it , " said one House aide familiar with the negotiations on the legislation .
The aide was referring to the funding for the unpopular Iraq war , now in its sixth year , and a measure being attached to expand education benefits for combat veterans .
A House of Representatives vote on the war - funding bill was expected this week .
Anything the House passes would have to be approved by the Senate before the legislation is sent to Bush .
With the Pentagon running out of money to continue fighting the two wars , Congress is trying to approve new funds before its July 4 holiday recess .
With this bill , Congress will have written checks for more than $ 800 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , with most of the money going to Iraq .
Since January , 2007 , when Democrats took majority control of the House and Senate , they have tried to force Bush to change course in Iraq , mostly through troop withdrawal timetables and requirements that U.S. soldiers be more thoroughly trained , equipped and rested before returning to combat .
And while various versions have passed each chamber since then , there have not been enough votes in Congress to enact the war conditions over Bush 's objections .
DEMOCRATS LOOKING TO BUSH SUCCESSOR
The result is that the 110th Congress will wrap up most of its work this fall , before November 's congressional and presidential elections , without forcing any changes to Bush 's open - ended war policy , the defining issue of his presidency .
Anti-war Democrats instead are looking to Bush 's successor , hoping it is fellow - Democrat Barack Obama , to bring at least some of the 147,000 U.S. troops home from Iraq .
Speaking to reporters in Michigan where he was campaigning , Obama said he was " encouraged " by the reduction in violence in Iraq , but underlined the importance of beginning " the process of withdrawing U.S. troops . "
John McCain , the Republican candidate for president , has backed Bush 's opposition to Congress setting timetables .
Democrats enter this campaign season poised to expand their House and Senate majorities .
Instead of Iraq being the dominant issue this campaign season , it has been the U.S. economy , jolted by skyrocketing energy prices and mounting home foreclosures , that has gotten most of the attention .
The war - spending bill has been the staging ground for a Democratic initiative to expand domestic unemployment benefits , in addition to the added veterans benefits .

The jumpers were leaping over five or six infants at a time
Grown men have been leaping over rows of babies in the north Spanish village of Castrillo de Murcia in an annual rite meant to ward off the Devil .
Jumpers dressed as the Colacho , a character representing the Devil , bounded over clusters of bemused infants laid out on mattresses .
Nobody appeared to get hurt in this year 's festive event .
Castrillo , near Burgos , has been holding the event since 1620 to mark the Catholic feast of Corpus Christi .
The feast is widely celebrated in Spain , often with processions and mystery plays .
Pageants can feature dancers depicting demons and angels or other characters .

When it comes to global warming , extreme scare stories abound .
Al Gore , for example , famously claimed that a whopping six metres of sea - level rise would flood major cities around the world .
Gore 's scientific adviser , Jim Hansen from Nasa , has even topped his protege .
Hansen suggests that there will eventually be sea - level rises of 24 metres , with a six - metre rise happening just this century .
Little wonder that fellow environmentalist Bill McKibben states that " we are engaging in a reckless drive - by drowning of much of the rest of the planet and much of the rest of creation . "
Given all the warnings , here is a slightly inconvenient truth : over the past two years , the global sea level has n't increased .
It has slightly decreased .
Since 1992 , satellites orbiting the planet have measured the global sea level every 10 days with an amazing degree of accuracy – 3 - 4 mm .
For two years , sea levels have declined .
( All of the data are available at sealevel.colorado.edu . )
This does n't mean that global warming is not true .
As we emit more CO2 , over time the temperature will moderately increase , causing the sea to warm and expand somewhat .
Thus , the sea - level rise is expected to pick up again .
This is what the UN climate panel is telling us ; the best models indicate a sea - level rise over this century of 18 to 59 centimeters ( 7 - 24 inches ) , with the typical estimate at 30 cm .
This is not terrifying or even particularly scary – 30 cm is how much the sea rose over the last 150 years .
Simply put , we 're being force - fed vastly over - hyped scare stories .
Proclaiming six meters of sea - level rise over this century contradicts thousands of UN scientists , and requires the sea - level rise to accelerate roughly 40 - fold from today .
Imagine how climate alarmists would play up the story if we actually saw an increase in the sea - level rise .
Increasingly , alarmists claim that we should not be allowed to hear such facts .
In June , Hansen proclaimed that people who spread " disinformation " about global warming – CEOs , politicians , in fact anyone who does n't follow Hansen 's narrow definition of the " truth " – should literally be tried for crimes against humanity .
It is depressing to see a scientist – even a highly politicised one – calling for a latter - day inquisition .
Such a blatant attempt to curtail scientific inquiry and stifle free speech seems inexcusable .
But it is perhaps also a symptom of a broader problem .
It is hard to keep up the climate panic as reality diverges from the alarmist predictions more than ever before : the global temperature has not risen over the past 10 years , it has declined precipitously in the last year and a half , and studies show that it might not rise again before the middle of the next decade .
With a global recession looming and high oil and food prices undermining the living standards of the western middle class , it is becoming ever harder to sell the high - cost , inefficient Kyoto - style solution of drastic carbon cuts .
A much sounder approach than Kyoto and its successor would be to invest more in research and development of zero - carbon energy technologies – a cheaper , more effective way to truly solve the climate problem .
Hansen is not alone in trying to blame others for his message 's becoming harder to sell .
Canada 's top environmentalist , David Suzuki , stated earlier this year that politicians " complicit in climate change " should be thrown in jail .
Campaigner Mark Lynas envisions Nuremberg - style " international criminal tribunals " against those who dare to challenge the climate dogma .
Clearly , this column places me at risk of incarceration by Hansen & Co .
But the globe 's real problem is not a series of inconvenient facts .
It is that we have blocked out sensible solutions through an alarmist panic , leading to bad policies .
Consider one of the most significant steps taken to respond to climate change .
Adopted because of the climate panic , biofuels were supposed to reduce CO2 emissions .
Hansen described them as part of a " brighter future for the planet . "
But using biofuels to combat climate change must rate as one of the poorest global " solutions " to any great challenge in recent times .
Biofuels essentially take food from mouths and puts it into cars .
The grain required to fill the tank of an SUV with ethanol is enough to feed one African for a year .
Thirty percent of this year 's corn production in the United States will be burned up on America 's highways .
This has been possible only through subsidies that globally will total $ 15 bn this year alone .
Because increased demand for biofuels leads to cutting down carbon - rich forests , a 2008 Science study showed that the net effect of using them is not to cut CO2 emissions , but to double them .
The rush towards biofuels has also strongly contributed to rising food prices , which have tipped another roughly 30 million people into starvation .
Because of climate panic , our attempts to mitigate climate change have provoked an unmitigated disaster .
We will waste hundreds of billions of dollars , worsen global warming , and dramatically increase starvation .
We have to stop being scared silly , stop pursuing stupid policies , and start investing in smart long - term R&D. Accusations of " crimes against humanity " must cease .
Indeed , the real offense is the alarmism that closes minds to the best ways to respond to climate change .

Bernie Mac , who is the comedian , endured some heckling and a campaign rebuke during a surprise appearance Friday night at a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
Toward the end of a 10 - minute standup routine at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Chicago , the 50 - year - old star of “ The Bernie Mac Show ” joked about menopause , sexual infidelity and promiscuity , and used occasional crude language .
Mac revealed , “ My little nephew came to me and he said , ‘ Uncle , what ’s the difference between a hypothetical question and a realistic question ? ’
I said , I do n’t know , but I said , ‘ Go upstairs and ask your mother if she ’d make love to the mailman for $ 50,000 . ' ”
As the joke continued , the punchline evoked an angry response from at least one person in the audience , who said it was offensive to women .
A man shouted from the crowd , which paid $ 2,300 each to support the Illinois senator , revealed , “ It ’s not funny .
Let ’s get Barack on . ”
About 15 minutes later , Obama tried to smooth things over with a joke of his own .
Sen . Barack Obama said , “ We ca n’t afford to be divided by race .
We ca n’t afford to be divided by region or by class and we ca n’t afford to be divided by gender , which by the way , that means , Bernie , you ’ve got to clean up your act next time .
This is a family affair .
By the way , I ’m just messing with you , man . ”
The incident drew response from Obama ’s campaign , which criticized Mac for his choice of material .
Jen Psaki said in a statement after the event , “ Sen. Obama told Bernie Mac that he does n’t condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate . ”
Bernie Mac , who was a Chicago native , said he ’s a longtime Obama supporter and called the presumptive Democratic nominee a “ man ’s man ” while offering him advice for the duration of the campaign trail .
He continued , “ People like rumors .
They ’re going to say things like you was at the club with Lil ’ Kim , and you and Kanye West got into a fist fight , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t get upset .
You ’ve got to keep hope alive . ”
Mac ’s appearance was Sen. Obama ’s first celebrity event of the evening .
Later at a Lincoln Park nightclub , Sen . Obama spoke to a raucous crowd of music fans , who paid up to $ 500 per person to see a performance by Wilco lead singer Jeff Tweedy , and two other band members .
Sen .
Obama added , “ Before these guys go , I want them to know that I had heard a rumor that they had suggested that I had nothing by them on my iPod .
That is not true .
I love Wilco . ”

The terror suspect was released from Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire
A terror suspect said to have " direct links " with Osama Bin Laden has been freed on bail , the Special Immigration Appeals Commission ( Siac ) has said .
The Algerian , who can be identified only as " U " , has been released from Long Lartin high - security prison , in Worcestershire .
He had spent more than seven years in jail awaiting deportation .
It comes two weeks after Abu Qatada , described as Bin Laden 's right - hand man in Europe , was freed on bail .
" U " won a judgement in the Court of Appeal overturning Siac 's ruling that he could be deported to Algeria .
His lawyers have now successfully argued that following the appeal court ruling it is wrong to keep him in custody .
A Siac spokeswoman said : " As of today I can confirm he [ " U " ] has been released . "
' Threat posed '
The Home Office said it had sought the strictest bail conditions possible for " U " while deportation proceedings against him continued .
A Home Office spokesman said : " It is our position that individuals who are not British nationals who pose a threat to the national security of the UK should be deported .
" Bail conditions are a matter for the court , but we argued for and received very strict conditions indeed . "
Siac is protecting the anonymity of the terror suspect but inadvertently revealed his bail address .
Officials accidentally sent his secret bail address to journalists covering the story .
A court order banning the media from naming the man or repeating his address remains in force .
' Security risk '
Earlier court rulings described " U " as someone who had had direct links to Bin Laden and had a senior position at a mujahideen training camp in Afghanistan .
" U " was also allegedly associated with a group that planned to bomb the Christmas market in Strasbourg in 2000 .
He had been in custody since February 2001 , when he was picked up at Heathrow airport attempting to board a flight to Saudi Arabia with a false passport .
Siac stated in May last year : " We share the security service 's assessment that he remains a risk to national security .
" He has shown no sign of disavowing his former beliefs or associates . "
Abu Qatada , 47 , was released from the same prison after winning his fight against deportation to Jordan .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said an appeal would be lodged against that ruling .
If elected president , Senator John McCain would reserve the right to run his own warrantless wiretapping program against Americans , based on the theory that the president 's wartime powers trump federal criminal statutes and court oversight , according to a statement released by his campaign Monday .
McCain 's new tack towards the Bush administration 's theory of executive power comes some 10 days after a McCain surrogate stated , incorrectly it seems , that the senator wanted hearings into telecom companies ' cooperation with President Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , before he 'd support giving those companies retroactive legal immunity .
As first reported by Threat Level , Chuck Fish , a full - time lawyer for the McCain campaign , also said McCain wanted stricter rules on how the nation 's telecoms work with U.S. spy agencies , and expected those companies to apologize for any lawbreaking before winning amnesty .
But Monday , McCain adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin , speaking for the campaign , disavowed those statements , and for the first time cast McCain 's views on warrantless wiretapping as identical to Bush's .
[ N] either the Administration nor the telecoms need apologize for actions that most people , except for the ACLU and the trial lawyers , understand were Constitutional and appropriate in the wake of the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . [...]
We do not know what lies ahead in our nation ’s fight against radical Islamic extremists , but John McCain will do everything he can to protect Americans from such threats , including asking the telecoms for appropriate assistance to collect intelligence against foreign threats to the United States as authorized by Article II of the Constitution .
The Article II citation is key , since it refers to President Bush 's longstanding arguments that the president has nearly unlimited powers during a time of war .
The administration 's analysis went so far as to say the Fourth Amendment did not apply inside the United States in the fight against terrorism , in one legal opinion from 2001 .
McCain 's new position plainly contradicts statements he made in a December 20 , 2007 interview with the Boston Globe where he implicitly criticized Bush 's five - year secret end - run around the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
" I think that presidents have the obligation to obey and enforce laws that are passed by Congress and signed into law by the president , no matter what the situation is , " McCain said .
The Globe 's Charlie Savage pushed further , asking , " So is that a no , in other words , federal statute trumps inherent power in that case , warrantless surveillance ? "
To which McCain answered , " I do n't think the president has the right to disobey any law . "
McCain 's embrace of extrajudicial domestic wiretapping is effectively a bounce - back from Fish 's comments , made at the Computers , Freedom and Privacy conference in Connecticut last month .
When liberal blogs picked up the story that McCain had moved to the left on wiretapping , the McCain campaign issued a letter insisting that he still supported unconditional immunity , as well as new rules that would expand the nation 's spy powers .
The campaign 's response was consistent with McCain 's past positions and votes .
But it riled Andrew McCarthy at the conservative National Review Online , who read the campaign 's position as a disavowal of Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , and a wimpy surrender of executive power to Congress .
" What does it mean when he says Sen. McCain does not want the telecoms put into this position again ? "
McCarthy asked .
" Is he saying that in a time of national crisis , the president should not be permitted to ask the telecoms for assistance that is arguably beyond what is prescribed in a statute ? "
That 's when the campaign issued the letter explaining McCain 's new views of executive power , and revealing that McCain would , in certain future circumstances , rely on the same theory of executive power in wartime .
A spokesperson for McCain 's camp did not respond to a request Monday for an explanation of the difference between the new policy and the December interview .

Melbourne passenger Sarah Lucas she was shocked to see a gash of between 1.8 and 2.4 metres where the wing intersects with the plane 's fuselage .
Ms Lucas , who was flying with her 19 - year - old sister Olivia , said she initially thought a door had opened mid-flight until she saw the torn metal .
" We were in the business class cabin and we heard a loud bang .
We thought one of the doors had become open because there was a lot of papers rushing through the cabin ... it felt like a gush of wind , " Ms Lucas said .
" The plane began to fall quite quickly and then it levelled out . "
Ms Lucas said the plane seemed to lose pressure for about five minutes before stabilising .
Oxygen masks had dropped from the ceiling but passengers had remained calm and quiet , she said .
" I did n't realise how bad it was until we got down , " she said .
" I thought maybe the door had somehow come off , that 's all I could really think of .
" When we landed there were a lot of people who rushed up to see the ( right - hand ) side of the plane so I knew there was something on that side and then we walked around to have a look . "
She said the pilot had made announcements to flight crew throughout the incident but passengers had not been told what had happened .
" We did n't really know what was going on , " she said .
" Most people were just sitting there , not saying anything , everyone was just quiet . "
Manila airport operations officer Ding Lima told local radio the plane lost cabin pressure shortly after takeoff from Hong Kong and the pilot radioed for an emergency landing .
" There is a big hole in the belly of the aircraft near the right wing about three metres in diameter , " he said .
" Upon disembarkation , there were some passengers who vomited .
You can see in their faces that they were really scared . "
During the emergency part of the plane 's flooring gave way , exposing some of the cargo in the hold , he said .
Part of the ceiling also collapsed .
Melbourne woman June Kane , who was on the plane , told ABC radio that baggage was hanging out of the hole in the plane .
" You assume that there 's a few bags that may have gone missing , " she said .
Kim Jeffers said her husband Jason rang her from Manila to say that he had landed safely after the mid-air drama .
Mrs Jeffers said her husband Jason " heard a loud bang like something falling over , " Mrs Jeffers said .
Ms Lucas ' father , Alistair Lucas , said his daughters had told him the plane was forced to make an emergency landing .
Melbourne father Alastair Lucas said his two daughters who were on the flight who told him the plane was forced to make an emergency landing .
Qantas chief executive officer Geoff Dixon confirmed a B747-400 had been diverted after a loss of cabin pressure and landed in Manila about 11.15 am .
He said inspections on the ground revealed a hole in the plane 's fuselage that was being inspected by engineers .
Mr Dixon said all 346 passengers and 19 crew had disembarked normally and there were no reports of injuries .
He said the flight crew had performed emergency procedures after oxygen masks dropped .
" The Australian Transportation Safety Bureau and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have been notified of the incident and Qantas is sending its own engineers to Manila , " Mr Dixon said .
" Qantas has provided all passengers with accommodation and a replacement aircraft has been arranged . "
Mrs Jeffers said her husband had described crowds of people watching the plane land safely and filming the descent with their mobile phones .
The Australian Transportation Safety Bureau 's director of aviation safety investigations , Julian Walsh , said the plane dropped nearly 20,000 feet before flying to Manila .
He said the plane was flying at 29,000 feet and was about 200 nautical miles from Manila when it experienced " rapid decompression " .
" As a result of a rupture in the fuselage , a hole , the oxygen masks dropped down , as would happen in a decompression , and ( there was ) a rapid descent to 10,000 feet , " he said .
" Once the aircraft was at 10,000 feet it diverted to Manila where it landed uneventfully and ... passengers disembarked normally . "
Mr Walsh said there had been no reports of injuries .
He said arrangements were being made to send aviation investigators to the Philippines .
Mr Walsh refused to speculate on what could have caused the hole .

Two armies are about to do battle , and both pray to you , their god , for victory .
How do you decide who to help ?
( CNN ) --
By the year 2050 , China will no longer be the most populous country in the world .
India will see its population grow by 700 million people by 2050 , the U.S. Census bureau estimates .
That distinction will pass to India , where more than 1.8 billion people could be competing for their country 's resources , according to the U.S. Census Bureau 's International Data Base .
The 2007 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and the United Nations Population Division set China 's current population at around 1.3 billion people , and India 's at around 1.1 billion .
If population continues to grow at the estimated rate , such rapid growth in India between now and mid-century could lead to overpopulation and an uncertain future for the environment and the people living there .
And while organizations like the Population Institute and the United Nations Population Fund are working to promote the human rights and environmental consequences of overpopulation , not everyone views the newest population estimates with pessimism .
" Nothing ever continues at its present rate , neither the stock market nor population growth , " said Doug Allen , the dean of the school of Architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology , and an expert in the history of cities and urban design , which he 's taught for more than 31 years .
" There is a substantial body of evidence that the world population will flatten out in about 30 years , " he said .
" Built into that model would be an assumption that more of the world 's population will become urban , and as such the population will begin to decline . "
In Stores Now Own CNN 's award - winning documentary " Planet in Peril "
Available in U.S. stores now Planet in Peril »
Citing historical evidence of falling birthrates in urban populations , Allen looks to Italy as a current example of the phenomenon .
" Italy right now [ is ] not at a point where it can sustain its current level .
And I do n't think that 's because people in Italy have suddenly become aware of the need to conserve resources .
I think it has more to do with decisions that are made by families on the margin not to have as many children . "
Consequences of overpopulation
Overpopulation occurs when a population 's density exceeds the capacity of the environment to supply the health requirements of an individual , according to the Environmental Protection Agency .
Environmentalists have long been concerned about the resources threatened by rapidly growing human populations , focusing on phenomenon such as deforestation , desertification , air pollution and global warming .
But the worst - case scenario for people experiencing overpopulation , according to Lawrence Smith , president of the Population Institute , is a lack of fresh , clean water .
" If the water goes , the species goes , " he said .
" That sounds kind of alarmist , " Smith conceded , " considering there 's water all around us , but 97 percent plus is saltwater , and the freshwater that we use to sustain ourselves is just native to 3 percent .
...
So the accessibility of water , the competition for water , the availability of water is going to be a major , major threat , " he said , noting world population growth estimates at more than 9 billion people by 2050 .
Nine billion is an exceptional amount of people , considering the world 's population only reached 1 billion in 1830 , according to the Population Institute , a nonprofit organization that works to fund population and family planning programs around the world .
By 1999 , world population reached 6 billion , and in the relatively short time between 2007 and 2050 , there could be roughly 2.4 billion more people on Earth needing clean water , space and other natural resources from their environment in order to survive .
Governments facing overpopulation will also struggle to manage waste , said Allen .
" Handling your waste and the public health consequences of not handling it well is the biggest problem that will be faced in rapidly growing urban areas in the developing world . "
When London , England , faced a population boom in the 1850s , for example , its infrastructure was not prepared for the excess waste , which resulted in Cholera outbreaks .
" Huge outbreaks , " said Allen .
" Fifty - thousand people dying over the summer .
That 's the kind of thing that in the developed world we no longer have problems with , but in the developing world are very , very real . "
Smith said that 97 percent of world population growth between now and 2050 will occur in the developing world , where governments face serious economic and social challenges .
" I would say most of this is in sub-Saharan Africa , where by every other health indicator , they rank at the bottom , " Smith said .
" This growth rate is taking place despite the high levels of HIV and AIDS and [ tuberculosis ] and malaria . "
Health care -- and the lack of it -- is also a factor in the rising populations in developing countries , according to Stan Bernstein , United Nations Population Fund senior policy adviser .
" We 've seen a global trend of people wanting smaller families , but in the poorer settings that 's not quite the case yet , " Bernstein said .
" And it 's certainly not the case within countries that the poor [ do not ] have access to the kinds of services that the wealthy avail themselves of . "
Globally , Bernstein said the poorest fifth of people in countries with rapid population growth have twice as many children , on average , as the wealthy people in those same countries .
Birthrates make a difference
The massive growth in developing nations is due in large part to fertility rates , where women during their reproductive years will have an average of five children , said Smith .
" That 's considerably higher than it is in the developed world . "
In addition to the growing demands of developing nations , emerging countries like China and India are rapidly industrializing , said Smith .
" Their demands for food alone will have considerable impact on global markets . "
China 's government has instituted population control methods in order to curb growth .
Their controversial " one child " policies have garnered an uneasy reception , especially in rural populations , where people complain of stiff fines or forced sterilizations and abortions as a result of breaking population laws .
Traditionally , rural populations are larger than urban populations , said Smith .
This is because rural families need to be larger in order to work and live off the land , and urban populations -- with better education , health care and family planning opportunities -- offer parents the luxury of choosing how many children they will have , he said .
This year is the first year that rural and urban populations are nearly equal , according to the United Nations Population Fund 's annual report .
This creates a mixed bag of concerns , according to Smith , that include susceptibility of young urban populations in poor countries with weak governments to recruitment for terrorism and conditions of instability .
" We have never in the history of the world experienced urban growth rates or metropolitan growth rates at the same level that we are experiencing now , " said Allen .

A brawl outside a Phoenix home turned into a fatal shooting Saturday morning , when officers were forced to take serious measures with a suspect who tried to use a Taser stun gun on them .
Police responded to a burglary call at 3:05 a.m. at a house near 7th Ave and Wilshire after the homeowner saw someone in his yard and heard the person in his carport and shed .
An officer confronted a man who was clutching two metal flower stands in the front yard of the house .
The officer ordered the suspect to drop the stands , but he refused .
When the officer shot the man with a Taser , the suspect dropped the stands and removed the Taser 's wires from his body .
When officers tried to arrest the man , he fought back , grabbed an officer 's Taser and tried to use it on police .
� The suspect shocked both officers at different times during the fight , � said Phoenix police spokeswoman Stacie Derge .
A third officer arrived during the scuffle and shot the suspect , who died at the scene .
The officers were not seriously injured , but received minor scrapes in the fight .
The homeowner stayed in his house throughout the incident and was not injured .
IN the months to come , John McCain and Barack Obama will be vying for the support of various voting blocs .
It is safe to say , however , that one group wo n’t get much attention : economists .
The American Economic Association represents only a small fraction of 1 percent of the electorate .
In every election season , we economists expect to be largely ignored , and , unlike many of our other forecasts , that one often turns out to be right .
But suppose it were otherwise .
Imagine that those running for office tailored their economic positions to attract the experts in the field .
What would it take to put the nation ’s economists solidly behind a candidate ?
On many issues , from universal health insurance to increased taxes on the rich , economists do not speak with a single voice .
But on some issues we do .
Here is an eight - plank platform designed to attract a majority of economists .
It is based on discussions I have had with my colleagues  call them focus groups , if you ’d like  and polls of my profession :
SUPPORT FREE TRADE
Economists are nearly unanimous in their support of an unfettered system of world trade .
Here , Senator Obama lags behind Senator McCain .
Senator Obama ’s bad - mouthing of Nafta and his opposition to free - trade pacts with Colombia and South Korea make most economists cringe .
We all know that Django is great Python web framework , however one thing that bothers me is the lack of good development tool ( Yes , I know there is VIM , and there is Emacs but guys it is 2008 . )
In my humble opinion best development tool for python is PyDev , Eclipse plugin for Python .
The irony is that the best Python IDE is written in Java :) .
With PyDev and Aptana , another irreplaceable plugin( but that is another story ) , you can do great Django development .
There are lot ’s of tutorial how to use Django and PyDev ( Configuring PyDev to work with Django : configuring pydev to work with django is a good place to start ) .
One thing that is very nice in Django is interactive shell , but this feature must be integrated with IDE , I missed this feature for long time , but in version 1.3.15 PyDev released new interactive console , great feature .
First you need PyDev version 1.3.15 or higher ( try to use latest one ) .
You can start interactive console from Console View by clicking on the button Open Console ( look picture below ) .
You will get a dialog asking for a type of console you want to open , select Python console and press OK .
That is it , you have now working python interactive console .
Out of the box you get some nice features like autocompletition and syntax coloring .
What we want do next is to have interactive console for Django .
Here is a little tutorial how take advantage of PyDev interactive console for Djagno shell .
Open Window– > Preferences … In Preferences Window go to PyDev ->
Interactive console
3. In initial interpreter command put following code :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 import sys from YOUR_OWN_PROJECT import settings from django.core .
management import execute_manager execute_manager ( settings , [ '' , ' shell ' ] ) import sys ; print ' %s %s ' % ( sys .
executable or sys .
platform , sys .
version ) from django import get_version ; print " Django version %s " % get_version ( ) from django.core .
management import execute_manager from slavus import settings execute_manager ( settings , [ '' , ' shell ' ])
Where YOUR_OWN_PROJECT is the name of yours top level Django project .
It is important to mention that if you have multiple Python / PyDev projects in your workspace you have to change your preferences configuration every time you want start interactive console for anathor project .
After starting the shell , you will get output something like this :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 import sys ; print ' %s %s ' % ( sys .
executable or sys .
platform , sys .
version ) C : \ Python25 \ python . exe 2.5 . 2 ( r252 : 60911 , Feb 21 2008 , 13 : 11 : 45 ) [ MSC v . 1310 32 bit ( Intel ) ] from django import get_version ; print " \Django version %s " % get_version ( ) \ Django version 0.97 - pre - SVN - 7568 from django.core .
management import execute_manager from slavus import settings execute_manager ( settings , [ '' , ' shell ' ] ) >>>
Python 2.5 . 2 ( r252 : 60911 , Feb 21 2008 , 13 : 11 : 45 ) [ MSC v . 1310 32 bit ( Intel ) ] on win32
Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information .
( InteractiveConsole ) >>>
That is it , you have working Django interactive console .
Now you can do things like this :
1 2 3 from slavus.article.models import Article Article .
objects . all ( ) [ < Article : example1 > , < Article : example2 > , < Article : example3 > ]
But there is also autocompletition :

Clean Tech Intro : The Solar Family
July 21st , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Solar power means more than solar panels .
These days it can also mean collectors , towers , dyes , oh my !
Here ’s a guide to ( most of ) the different kinds of solar technologies that are out there today .
First , the basics :
Anything that uses solar energy as a source of power is solar - powered .
Simple , right ?
Well let ’s not forget that the sun gives us more than a whole spectrum of light , it also gives us heat .
Both are used for a wide variety of applications , not just electricity .
1. Solar Thermal
Solar thermal technologies use heat .
Cleantechnica has already introduced solar thermal .
The cheapest , easiest , and most financially sound solar investment you can make for a house is to install a solar thermal collector .
It collects solar energy to provide warm water or warm air for your house , even in the far north .
On a larger scale , mirrors can be used to focus heat from the sun to boil water and turn a turbine .
Generating electricity with this method is called Concentrated Solar Power ( CSP ) .
Large scale CSP projects are already underway in deserts around the globe , and in some places they are invigorating the economy .
The cool thing about CSP is that it overcomes one of the major problems with renewable energy .
It used to be true that solar farms stopped producing energy as soon as the sun went down .
No longer .
Heat is much easier and cheaper to store than electricity , so you can save it for the hours or days when the sun does n’t shine .
Power towers and molten salt are just two methods of producing solar power whenever we need it .
2. Photovoltaics
Photovoltaics are solar technologies that transform light into electricity .
Certain elements and chemicals , called solar cells , can lose electrons when exposed to photons ( light ) .
Under the right conditions , these electrons are harnessed as electricity .
For a more technical explanation , check out Wikipedia .
3. Silicon
This is the most widely used and recognizable material used to make solar panels .
Paired with solar cells , silicon can produce high efficiency solar panels .
However , silicon panels tend to be more expensive to make , transport , and install because they ’re heavy , rigid , and require plenty of high - quality materials .
Thin - film silicon panels attempt to overcome these obstacles .
The downside : silicon panels work best on cloudless days when the sun is directly overhead .
That ’s why silicon panels are often positioned on racks to face the sun .
The cost of these racks , and loading the panels on them , often consume 50 % of the cost of silicon panel installation .
Another strategy to reduce the cost of silicon panels is to use less of them , but still generate plenty of energy .
This is possible by concentrating sunlight onto the panel .
More intense light means more energy … if you do n’t melt your panel in the process .
This technology is called Extreme Concentrated Photovoltaics ( XCPV ) .
4. Thin Film
Thin film solar panels are very thin and flexible ; the solar cells can be placed on sheets of plastic or aluminum .
They should not be confused with silicon thin - films , which use a different manufacturing method .
Thin film solar panels tend to be easier to make , use fewer and cheaper materials , and are easier to transport and install .
Some thin films absorb different wavelengths of light , which can make them more practical in cloudy regions .
The downside : they ’re still less efficient than silicon panels , so they do n’t produce as much energy .
Their efficiency can sometimes degrade over time , depending on the materials and environment .
5. Solar Dyes
Here is another promising technology that is still being developed .
Invented by the Swiss in the 1990s , the idea is to produce solar cells in cheap , easy , attractive dyes that can be painted or sprayed onto almost any surface .
The benefit is both cost and application : the dyes are only one tenth of the cost of silicon panels and you can boldly take them where solar has never gone before .
Imagine painting your house with solar cells and reaping just enough energy to power your microwave .
That is the downside : solar dyes are not yet as efficient as thin film solar , and many dyes only last several years instead of decades .
6. Radical Solar Technologies
Some tech exists that push the definition of “ solar power ” .
For example , algae can be used to produce biodiesel and ethanol .
If you fill your car with this fuel , is your car solar powered ?
What about passive solar technology , which controls how and when sunlight affects buildings ?
Since the sun is a major engine driving our planet , the possibilities for harnessing its energy are infinite .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WARNER BROTHERS
If you ’ll recall , the motion - picture Batmobile has remained fairly similar in form since its introduction in 1989 when Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight — large vertical wings , a huge jet engine sticking out the back , about two inches of ground clearance , and a general cartoony feel .
As much as we love it , the Batmobile has been a bit corny since its inception and only got worse as time passed .
By the time the Governator was chasing Mr. Clooney around in 1997 , Batman ’s ride looked like something out of The Fast and the Furious : Gotham Drift .
It ’s All About the Tumbler , Baby
In bringing a breath of fresh air to the Batman franchise , Batman Begins director Chris Nolan saw fit to liven up the Batmobile .
While trying to bring a more realistic feel to our favorite superhero ( do n’t tell Superman ) and his city , the director realized he needed to build a vehicle to match .
“ What I love about Batman is that he has no super powers except for his extraordinary wealth , ” Nolan says .
“ Looking at it from that point of view , if you had limitless financial resources , and therefore a lot of power in material ways , how could you apply that to the creation of some amazing gadgets and crime - fighting techniques ? ”
The Tumbler , that ’s how .
A veteran of 12 James Bond films , special - effects supervisor Chris Corbould is no stranger to bringing automotive dreams to life .
Looking more like something out of a military catalog than a comic book , weighing in at about 2.5 tons , and sporting six tires you ’d normally find on a lifted Jeep , the new , scratch - built Batmobile — a.k.a. the Tumbler — is still capable of reaching 60 mph from a standstill in a claimed seven seconds flat .
Warner Brothers notes that , without the bodywork and “ armaments , ” it ’ll do the deed in five .
This is presumably the work of some sort of engine , but neither Corbould nor Warner Brothers could tell us what powers the Tumbler or Batman ’s other Dark Knight ride .
Corbould adds that the Tumbler did all its own stunts .
“ We did lots of tests so that we could jump it .
I think our longest jump was 60 to 70 feet , ” he tells us .
“ We could actually jump this , land , and carry on with the shot . ”
As you might have seen in The Dark Knight trailers , Bruce Wayne will continue to ride in style in his Lamborghini Murciélago LP640 when he ’s out of costume and in the Tumbler as Batman .
However , when times call for something more agile and not so huge , our man now has an alternative .
WARNER BROTHERS
“ Will You Be Wanting the Bat Pod , Sir ? ”
“ It ’s a two - wheeled vehicle , but it ’s definitely not a motorcycle , ” Chris Nolan says about the Bat Pod .
“ In essence , the Bat Pod is to the world of motorcycles what the Tumbler is to the world of cars . ”
The original Bat Pod was conceived in Nolan ’s garage by himself and production designer Nathan Crowley .
With little to go on but an idea , Nolan recalls thinking , “ Let ’s just go for it .
Let ’s build it full - size . ”
So they did .
They constructed the concept out of anything they could find that might fit , so it was n’t long before they had the basic model made .
Then it was again up to Chris Corbould and his team to bring it to life .
Corbould tells us it took awhile to get the vehicle steering right , saying , “ That was my main concern as soon as I saw the design of the Bat Pod because the wheels and the tires were very wide on it .
What I did was instruct my engineers to very quickly put something together just so we could see what problems we were going to have with the steering . ”
Round and Round , or Not
The tread on a motorcycle ’s tires is rounded because a bike has to tilt to turn correctly and the tire ’s contact patch must tilt with it .
Since the Bat Pod ’s tires are extremely wide and flat , Corbould ’s team was given a daunting task in making it roadworthy .
To alleviate some of the handling issues , they began experimenting with shaving the tires down to give them a little more control while turning .
“ Originally , we shaved the front and the back tires , ” Corbould tells us .
But stunt rider Jean - Pierre
Goy blew too many rear tires locking up the back wheel and whipping the bike around , so they decided to leave the back tire alone .
In finished form , the Bat Pod is quite amazing to take in .
Sporting 40 mm cannons , .50 - caliber machine guns , and grappling - hook launchers , the Pod is ridden from a prone position and weighs an estimated 1100 to 1300 pounds .
It perfectly matches the character of its four - wheeled counterpart .
Other noteworthy design features include exhaust that ’s ducted through the framework and the steering system , which utilizes inputs from the rider ’s arms and shoulders rather than the traditional wrists and forearms .
If you ’d like to see the Bat Pod or the Tumbler in person , you ’re in luck — both vehicles are touring the U.S. until the film ’s release overseas when they will cross the pond for promotions there .
If you have the time , check out these beasts in person before going to see The Dark Knight , in theaters and IMAX on July 18 .

As somebody keens on stuff this way , I chose to get it and compose a legit survey on it .
So here goes …
On the whole , What Are Some Of The Benefits Of Running Your Car On Water ?
Before we hop into the Water Car Pro guide , how about we experience a portion of the advantages of running your vehicle on water .
The principal one is that you get to truly curtail your gas costs a considerable amount .
Shockingly , it ’s unrealistic to run your vehicle ONLY on water .
Be that as it may , with something like Water Car Pro , you can divide your gas costs .
So on the off chance that you take the amount you as of now spend on gas , and afterward split that number … then that is the amount you ’ll save money on gas .
Other advantages incorporate higher Miles Per Gallon ( MPG ) , expanded execution , fewer greenhouse emanations , and IRS discounts .
These additional together are unquestionably worth the issue of changing over your vehicle to keep running on water .
So Should You Get Water Car Pro ?
My legitimate sentiment is yes .
I have attempted a few aides online , for example , Water 4 Gas , Drive Water and Run Your Car On Water , however as I would like to think , Water Car Pro is a greatly improved item than every one of them .
The primary concern I like is the way it is written in a bit by bit way and how nearly everything is clarified in straightforward visual cues , rather than wordy sections .
I accept that the individual composition this guide certainly recognizes what they are discussing .
You ’ll realize what sort of parts you need , and how to collect them ( if vital ) .
here is likewise a considerable amount of accentuation on wellbeing , and there is nothing there that would make your hazard your vehicle .
What ’s more , the whole process is reversible , so it does n’t void your vehicle ’s guarantee .
If you are extremely specialized , and you would n’t fret experiencing much more stuff and spending more cash , then you might need to get a guide like Water 4 Gas .
However , if you simply need to get your vehicle running on water as quickly as time permits , and you would prefer not to spend a fortune , then Water Car Pro is the guide for you .
Impeach for Peace sent Dennis Kucinich a huge box of Do - It - Yourself Impeachment Petitions from citizens across the country on July 14th , which in Kucinich ’s words along with other efforts gave him “ a great deal of encouragement to hang in there . ”
Regarding the Do - It - Yourself Petitions , Kucinich mentions :
“ I just got a box of petitions yesterday , a full box that weighs about 25 pounds of petitions from all over the country of people who are demanding that the House take action . ”
Kucinich spoke on Alex Jones ’ Radio Show on July 23rd about the upcoming congressional committee hearing on Bush ’s abuses of power , and what efforts lead to the forming of that committee .
He credits efforts like this ours with “ opening the door ” which gave us “ for the first time a chance to talk about impeachment in front of a congressional committee . ”

NFL superstar Andre Johnson claims his charity got stiffed by Wal - Mart -- it all involves water and ice .
Yes , ice .
Johnson ordered 750 bicycles to be given to underprivileged kids at an event sponsored by the Andre Johnson Foundation -- in return for the purchase , Wal - Mart agreed to donate water and ice for the May 3 event .
But there was a problem with the order , so Johnson ended up buying fewer bikes than planned .
Wal - Mart countered by not giving the water and ice as promised .
That 's cold .
How America is snooping on YOU ... and may soon be snooping a whole lot more
Under western eyes : US authorities are leaning on European governments for personal information about their citizens
Dutch Liberal MEP
Sophie I n’t Veld was becoming irritated .
Whenever she tried to board a flight in America – something she does several times each year – she was delayed by special security checks , subjected to questioning , additional searches of her bags and screening for explosives .
‘ No one has ever accused me of involvement with terrorism or organised crime , ’ I n’t Veld said .
‘ So I tried to discover why I was being singled out . ’
Security expert I n’t Veld , 41 , wrote to three US government departments – State , Justice and Homeland Security – asking what they had on her in their files .
She especially wanted to know whether she had unjustly been deemed ‘ high - risk ’ under a scheme known as ATS , the Automated Targeting System .
It is a secret computer database whose conclusions can , under American law , be shared with a wide range of US and foreign government agencies and in some cases , employers .
Despite invoking America ’s Freedom of Information Act , I n‘t Veld got nowhere .
Last week , she filed a US lawsuit , the first of its kind , demanding access to her records .
‘ They say there are means of redress if US agencies hold damaging but inaccurate information about you , ’ she said .
‘ They do n’t seem to work . ’
Her case comes at a critical juncture .
Since the start of this year , operating almost entirely beneath the public radar , the US Government has been making a concerted , multi- faceted push for unrestricted access to vast volumes of personal data held by governments on this side of the Atlantic .
What the US is after goes far beyond the ability to make requests case by case .
They seek the ability to go on electronic fishing expeditions among British and other European databases held by law enforcement , immigration , financial and other official bodies – without even having to inform the databases ’ custodians , let alone their subjects .
Some of this information – misleading police intelligence reports based on malicious hearsay , for example – might well turn out to have much more serious consequences than whatever titbit is responsible for inconveniencing Ms I n’t Veld at airports .
Theoretically , it could lead to the extradition of British subjects to face criminal trial in America on the basis of unverified information derived from UK files , even in cases where authorities in Britain do not consider prosecution justified .
The 2003 Extradition Act has already made American extradition requests effectively immune to legal challenge , by removing any need for a prima facie case .
Last week Statewatch , the civil liberties monitoring group , obtained a copy of the final report of a group of senior US and European Union officials – the ‘ High Level Contact Group on information sharing and privacy and personal data protection ’ .
Supposedly , its job was to agree some international standards to ensure the rights of EU citizens will remain protected under agreements to make European data available to America .
In practice , these safeguards look alarmingly weak .
The report says the Americans want instant information from EU members ’ databases for ‘ the prevention , detection , suppression , investigation or prosecution of any criminal offence ’ , as well as ‘ non-criminal judicial or administrative proceedings ’ – in other words , pretty much anything .
It is difficult to read the report ’s final section without feeling chilled .
There is , for example , no prohibition on supplying details of someone ’s ethnic origins , political , religious or philosophical beliefs , or personal information about health or sexual life .
Confidential data transferred to America under the terms of the document could also include details of personal investments , bank and credit - card spending .
All information could be disseminated to US agencies , and in some circumstances , to third countries .
There must , the report promises , be ‘ independent oversight ’ .
Yet it accepts that , sometimes , decisions could be taken by machines .
For example , a computerised warning making it impossible to board an aircraft might be issued because a piece of American software determined a person posed a threat .
The report says such ‘ automated decisions ’ can be taken ‘ without human involvement ’ , as long as there are ‘ appropriate safeguards in place , including the possibility to obtain human intervention ’ .
‘ In the real world , such protection is meaningless , ’ said Tony Bunyan , Statewatch ’s director .
‘ If there ’s no right to be informed what a database says about you , the first you ’re going to know is when you ’re wrongly arrested , when you do n’t get that job , or when you ca n’t get on that plane . ’
While the High Level Contact Group has been busily diluting future data protection , the Americans have spent the past several months making some sweeping , more immediate demands .
Their chosen vehicle is the Visa Waiver Programme – the system that allows British and most EU citizens to visit America without passport visas .
Henceforth , under the 9/11 Commission
Act , passed in the US last year , visa waiver countries will be obliged to agree to stringent new security standards – including access to data .
In the words of the Act , decisions on whether to allow nations visa - free travel will depend on whether America decides they are ‘ actively co-operating with the US to prevent terrorist travel , including sharing counter - terrorism and law enforcement information ’ .
America ’s demands – set out in May by Richard Barth , assistant secretary for Homeland Security – in recent secret negotiations with the EU and individual states have been extraordinarily broad .
What the US sought , Barth said , was ‘ requirements to provide certain information on air passengers , serious crimes , known or suspected terrorists , asylum and migration matters , and timely reporting of lost and stolen passport data , as well as co-operation on airport and aviation security . ’
Of course , sharing information internationally can play a key role in combating terrorism and serious crime .
But it is vital there must be rigorous methods of quality control and means to correct inaccurate records .
Neither Barth nor his officials have made any mention of this .
Yet another secret EU document leaked to Statewatch suggests Europe has already conceded America ’s requests without putting up resistance on these key issues .
Dated April 11 , it is the EU ‘ mandate ’ setting out the terms of Europe ’s negotiating position – and accepts as its starting point that the EU should ‘ explore the scope for agreement ’ to the provisions of the 9/11 Act .
The document does say that any US - EU deal must ‘ comply with fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals including the rights to privacy and data protection ’ .
But as to how this lofty objective might be achieved , it is silent .
‘ The safeguards are so minimal they might as well not exist , ’ Bunyan said .
‘ I ’ve yet to see an occasion where Europe has refused American demands .
They are in effect the 28th member of the EU . ’
Civil libertarians like former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis have , rightly , become concerned at British Government measures such as 42 - day detention for terrorist suspects .
But for most ordinary citizens , the pressure to share data from across the Atlantic is a far greater threat .

Humans alone practice religion because they ’re the only creatures to have evolved imagination .
That ’s the argument of anthropologist Maurice Bloch of the London School of Economics .
Bloch challenges the popular notion that religion evolved and spread because it promoted social bonding , as has been argued by some anthropologists .
Instead , he argues that first , we had to evolve the necessary brain architecture to imagine things and beings that do n’t physically exist , and the possibility that people somehow live on after they ’ve died .
Advertisement
Once we ’d done that , we had access to a form of social interaction unavailable to any other creatures on the planet .
Uniquely , humans could use what Bloch calls the “ transcendental social ” to unify with groups , such as nations and clans , or even with imaginary groups such as the dead .
The transcendental social also allows humans to follow the idealised codes of conduct associated with religion .
“ What the transcendental social requires is the ability to live very largely in the imagination , ” Bloch writes .
“ One can be a member of a transcendental group , or a nation , even though one never comes in contact with the other members of it , ” says Bloch .
Moreover , the composition of such groups , “ whether they are clans or nations , may equally include the living and the dead . ”
Modern - day religions still embrace this idea of communities bound with the living and the dead , such as the Christian notion of followers being “ one body with Christ ” , or the Islamic “ Ummah ” uniting Muslims .
Stuck in the here and now
No animals , not even our nearest relatives the chimpanzees , can do this , argues Bloch .
Instead , he says , they ’re restricted to the mundane and Machiavellian social interactions of everyday life , of sparring every day with contemporaries for status and resources .
And the reason is that they ca n’t imagine beyond this immediate social circle , or backwards and forwards in time , in the same way that humans can .
Bloch believes our ancestors developed the necessary neural architecture to imagine before or around 40 - 50,000 years ago , at a time called the Upper Palaeological Revolution , the final sub-division of the Stone Age .
At around the same time , tools that had been monotonously primitive since the earliest examples appeared 100,000 years earlier suddenly exploded in sophistication , art began appearing on cave walls , and burials began to include artefacts , suggesting belief in an afterlife , and by implication the “ transcendental social ” .
Once humans had crossed this divide , there was no going back .
“ The transcendental network can , with no problem , include the dead , ancestors and gods , as well as living role holders and members of essentialised groups , ” writes Bloch .
“ Ancestors and gods are compatible with living elders or members of nations because all are equally mysterious invisible , in other words transcendental . ”
Nothing special
But Bloch argues that religion is only one manifestation of this unique ability to form bonds with non-existent or distant people or value - systems .
“ Religious - like phenomena in general are an inseparable part of a key adaptation unique to modern humans , and this is the capacity to imagine other worlds , an adaptation that I argue is the very foundation of the sociality of modern human society . ”
“ Once we realise this omnipresence of the imaginary in the everyday , nothing special is left to explain concerning religion , ” he says .
Chris Frith of University College London , a co-organiser of a “ Sapient Mind ” meeting in Cambridge last September , thinks Bloch is right , but that “ theory of mind ” – the ability to recognise that other people or creatures exist , and think for themselves – might be as important as evolution of imagination .
“ As soon as you have theory of mind , you have the possibility of deceiving others , or being deceived , ” he says .
This , in turn , generates a sense of fairness and unfairness , which could lead to moral codes and the possibility of an unseen “ enforcer ” – God – who can see and punish all wrong - doers .
“ Once you have these additions of the imagination , maybe theories of God are inevitable , ” he says .

それは、一通のメールから始まった。GoogleSatTrackをとても気に入ってくれたという、ごく普通の感想メール。でもそこには、こんな言葉が...
" I cover space flight for CBS News , and this is a great help . "
え、CBS News ?
CBSって、あのアメリカで一番大きなニュースネットワークの？後で調べてみたら、実はこの方、アポロ7号の頃からCBSで宇宙関連ニュースのプロデューサーをやっているというこの業界の重鎮中の重鎮。というか、何でそんな人が僕のページなんか見てるんですか？
で、恐る恐 る 「その道のベテランの方に気に入ってもらえるなんて、すごく光栄です！」と返事をしたら「やー、友達と一緒に見てたんだけどさ...」といって、山ほどリクエストが来た。曰く、精度を上げてほしい、グラウンドトラックを表示して欲しい、経度緯度の線もあるといいな、表示のあるなしを切り替えられるともっといいね、そうそうクッキーで設定を覚えてくれると便利かも...おいおい、容赦ないな。
で、この 「友達」というのが、実はCBS
News でSpace Placeを担当してい るBill Harwoodさん。友達って、えええええ！この方、NASA関連のニュースを追いかけている人なら、たぶん知らない人はいないくらいの有名人。アメリカの宇宙開発、とくに国際宇宙ステーションとスペースシャトルのミッションに関してはこの人の右に出る人はいない。っていうか、僕あなたのサイトいつも見てますよ！メルマガとってますよ！NASA-TVの記者会見でしょっちゅうお見かけしてますよ！著書も持ってますよ！な、何でそんな人が僕のサイトにダメだししてるんですか？
したさ、コーディング。死ぬ気でしましたよ。軌道計算の方法を勉強しなおすところから始めて2週間。ほとんど睡眠をとらずに、仕事と食事以外の時間をほぼ全てコーディングに当てて、どうにか新しいバージョンをリリース。結局ほとんど一から全部書き直すことになったけれど、リクエストにあった機能は全て実現できた。プログラムも前よりずっとよくなった。「できたよー」とメールを出したら、「早っ！ 」
「リクエストしたのが全部できてる！」「すげー！」と二人とも大喜びしてくれた。よかった、寝不足の甲斐があった。
そして数日後、ふと気付くとページのアクセス数が爆発的に増えていた。どうやらHarwoodさんのCBS
News Space Placeからリンクされたらしい。ページヘッダの右端に、まるで公式サイトであるかのようにGoogleSatTrackの文字が...なんですか、そのすごい位置は。メルマガでも紹介、参考URLとして毎号必ずアドレスが載っている。そしてどんどん増えていくリンク先。宇宙関連のニュースサイトやフォーラム、ブログは言うに及ばず、ヨーロッパ宇宙機関、フランス宇宙局、ドイツ宇宙局...なんだ？何が起きているんだ？
そしてある日、その連絡が来た。もしかしたら、次のシャトルの打上げを招待席からみられるかもしれないという。どうやら、GoogleSatTrackを気に入ってくれた人がNASAに掛け合ってくれたらしい。
そして今、僕の手元 にNASA からの手紙がある。
封筒を開くとき手が震えた。書かれていた" National Aeronautics and Space Administration cordially invited you ... "
の文字を見て泣いた。なぜだかよくわからない。しばらく涙が止まらなかった。
僕が何をした？何も特別なことなんかしてない。大好きなものを、大好きだといっていただけだ。自分が見てみたいと思ったものを作っただけだよ。なのに世界中にそれを気に入ってくれる人がいて、沢山の人がCoolとかGreatとか言っていて...
挙句の果てに子供の頃から夢にまで見たかの地から招待状が届いた。こんなことがあっていいんだろうか？
出発まであと数日。飛行機も取ったし、ホテルも押さえた、レンタカーの予約もした
。でも、僕はまだ自分に起きたことが信じられない。ほんとに夢でも見ているんじゃないだろうか？
Last.fm and Universal Music Group have announced today a partnership that will allow Last .fm users to view " thousands of full - length music videos " from UMG 's catalog .
The videos — which will include those from popular artists like Jay - Z , The Killers , Amy Winehouse , and Kanye West — will be available on - demand and for free , and UMG says that artists will get a payout every time a video is streamed .
The two companies claim that the partnership provides a " massive boost " to Last . fm 's music video collection and that Last.fm will be able to provide recommendations to users watching certain videos based on their musical tastes ( also known as " scrobbling " ) .
Like other videos on Last.fm , users can leave comments on each video and watch them in fullscreen mode , but they wo n't be able to embed them on their personal blogs like they can with YouTube videos .
Although UMG and Last.fm say that the streaming videos will be ad - supported , they are n't being treated in the same way as Last . fm 's streaming music .
The videos do n't have any ads before , during , or after them ( which is quite nice ) , and it appears as if you can watch them as many times as you want without being prompted to pay for anything .
The companies say that the share of revenue that artists get will come from ads shown next to the video content , but for now , it does n't appear as if those ads actually exist yet .
Still , it 's clear that Last.fm is quite proud of the deal , as it plans to showcase UMG 's videos exclusively on the site for the first month .
" This is a hugely empowering partnership that really takes Last.fm to the next level , " Last .fm cofounder Martin Stiksel said in a statement .
" We want to offer a video library that rivals our unparalleled music catalogue , as we work towards Last . fm becoming the only place you need to go to for all music - related content , and this deal marks the first step towards that goal . "
Indeed , it is only the first step , as there are a handful of other sites where users can watch music videos .
YouTube is still the de facto standard for most of the Internet - using public looking to watch music videos for free , and YouTube has even stated that it wants to eventually host " every music video ever created . "
MySpace Music is also hopping on the bandwagon , not only with music downloads but also with streaming videos from the plethora of artists that showcase their music on the site .
And , of course , there 's always Yahoo Music 's video selection , as well as MSN Music 's videos .
If the mediocre quality of videos on other sites are n't enough , users can head on over to Plugged In , launched this April , that offers high - definition videos directly from Universal , EMI , Sony BMG , and a handful of videos from Warner Music .
So what , exactly , is the benefit of watching music videos on Last . fm instead ?
For one , it makes Last.fm a more complete destination for users ' general music needs , as it now offers both music and video streaming for free ( in addition to Last. fm 's famed scrobbling feature , of course ) .
If you 're already a Last . fm fan , there 's no longer a reason to go to yet another site in order to watch the latest Kanye video — you can watch it right there !
However , attracting users of other sites ( ones that are n't Last. fm users already ) may prove to be a challenge because of the level of competition elsewhere on the ' Net .
IRS sends mixed messages to nonprofits
Will the role of the Internal Revenue Service in policing the political activities of nonprofit organizations be an issue in next year ’s election ?
History suggests it should be .
The IRS ’s actions in the past election cycle leave nonprofits , especially church organizations , concerned and uncertain about the future .
Last month , All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena , Calif. , announced that the IRS had sent it a letter closing the IRS ’s examination into alleged political activities of the church in 2004 .
Advertisement
The examination had been triggered by a sermon delivered by a guest speaker at the church on the Sunday before the presidential election , on the topic , “ If Jesus Debated Sen. Kerry and President Bush . ”
After praising both candidates for being “ devout Christians , ” the guest pastor assured the congregation that “ good people of profound faith will be for either George Bush or John Kerry for reasons deeply rooted in their faith ” and expressly stated , “ I do n’t intend to tell you how to vote . ”
The IRS nevertheless asserted that the sermon constituted campaign intervention , which is prohibited for churches and other tax - exempt organizations under section 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code .
Yet curiously , and somewhat confusingly , it still closed the examination .
The IRS ’s perplexing action in the All Saints examination follows similar false starts that it has recently made in attempting to enforce the prohibition against political campaign intervention by 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) organizations .
For instance , the IRS initially asserted that the NAACP had engaged in such activity when its chairman , Julian Bond , made a speech at the organization ’s national convention in 2004 that was critical of Bush administration policies .
It later gave up on that theory after the NAACP threatened to take the issue to court .
The IRS similarly quit its examination of Focus on the Family , which was alleged to have violated its exemption conditions when its chairman James Dobson endorsed Republican candidates in 2004 .
And those are just the publicly known cases .
Anecdotal evidence suggests that the IRS has issued other churches self - contradictory letters such as the one issued to All Saints , both asserting a campaign intervention violation and letting the church retain its exemption without further action .
In the wake of the IRS ’s actions , and going into another presidential election year , the scope of the prohibition against campaign activities is still unclear .
The IRS has issued guidance on the subject , but it ’s so vague and general as to be of practically no assistance for organizations that may have a legitimate reason , consistent with their underlying charters or focus , to speak out on current moral or policy issues .
Moreover , the IRS ’s uneven efforts to apply the campaign intervention rules leave it open to the charge that it pursues selective enforcement based merely on whether the organization has a high profile or , worse yet , based on the political content of the actions at issue , such as whether the organization is perceived as being for or against the Bush administration .
Certainly All Saints and the NAACP had reason to believe that they were subjected to examination only because they had hosted speakers highly critical of Bush administration policies .
Of course allegations that the IRS has been used improperly by a presidential administration in power are not new — and have usually turned out to be wrong .
For example , the Watergate hearings revealed that the Nixon administration attempted to target its political enemies for IRS investigations , an effort that was thwarted only when cooler heads in the Treasury Department and IRS ignored the request .
In the late 1990s , there were numerous claims that the IRS had commenced examinations of Clinton administration opponents , to the point that the Joint Committee on Taxation was eventually commissioned to review the matter .
After an exhaustive investigation , it issued a report in 2000 concluding that there was “ no credible evidence ” that individuals or organizations had been improperly selected for examination based on their political views .
To avoid such suspicions , the IRS must follow the law scrupulously and act with great tact and care .
Sadly , that does not appear to have been the case in the IRS ’s recent efforts .
For instance , the Internal Revenue Code contains a unique requirement that an examination of a church can be started only after approval by a “ high - level Treasury official , ” defined as a regional commissioner or someone higher .
But the IRS has recently admitted that at least some examinations of churches were commenced improperly without such review and approval .
Documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the All Saints and NAACP examinations were commenced based primarily on media reports of the speeches at issue , even though the actual texts were also publicly available .
Yet , because the organizations declined to cooperate with the IRS , the agency later closed both cases based on no more information than was available when it started the investigations .
All Saints has also learned that high - level career employees of the Justice Department were involved early in its examination and long before any formal referral of a case from the IRS .
Whether political appointees of Justice were also involved remains to be investigated .
This is not the way to build confidence that the IRS is administering its examination and enforcement efforts fairly .
The IRS ’s haphazard selection of cases to investigate , followed by its confused and self - contradictory resolutions of such cases , only adds to the uncertainty facing exempt organizations .
When coupled with the large gray areas in the law , the IRS ’s activities may justifiably lead organizations to believe that the IRS seeks to intimidate rather than provide clear and helpful guidance on political intervention .
One hopes that in the coming election year the IRS does a better job .

Serial rabbit killer uses Google maps to find victims

Serial rabbit killer uses Google maps to find victims
( you have to admit , even though the killings are horrifying , the end of this video is adorable ) …
The roll call of victims is growing longer by the day .
They have names like Rocco , Fussel , Marianne and Fluffy — and a five - man police unit has a file on each and every one .
The so - called “ bunny murders ” — 40 domestic rabbits killed at night in their hutches , heads and sometimes paws sliced off , their bodies drained of blood — is stunning communities across western Germany .
“ Nobody knows where the killer will strike next , ” said Inspector Volker Schütte .
One theory is that a group of Satanists is behind the wave of killings , because there is an almost ritualistic pattern .
Amputated paws have been placed on doorsteps ; the blood may have been drained into phials for use in an initiation ceremony .
So far , inquiries in Satanist and cultist groups have turned up little — but a child ’s coffin and a red velvet cloth were found recently near the scene of the rabbit killings .
The coffin was empty but there was rabbit hair on the cloth .

The first part of his tutorial provides a brief overview of the fundamental methods and applications of statistical machine learning .
The other speakers will detail or built upon this introduction .
Statistical machine learning is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that learn from observed data by constructing stochastic models that can be used for making predictions and decisions .
Topics covered include Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood modeling ; regression , classification , density estimation , clustering , principal component analysis ; parametric , semi-parametric , and non-parametric models ; basis functions , neural networks , kernel methods , and graphical models ; deterministic and stochastic optimization ; overfitting , regularization , and validation .
In March , a woman named Cara Schaffer contacted the Student / Farmworker Alliance , saying she was a student at Broward Community College .
Her eagerness aroused suspicions , but she was allowed to join two of the group ’s planning sessions .
Internet searches by the alliance revealed that she was not a college student .

Ms. Schaffer is the 25 - year - old owner of a private security firm .
Her company , Diplomatic Tactical Services , seems like the kind of security firm you ’d find in one of Carl Hiaasen ’s crime thrillers .
Last year Ms. Schaffer was denied a private investigator ’s license ; she had failed to supply the Florida licensing division with proof of “ lawfully gained , verifiable experience or training . ”
Even more unsettling , one of her former subcontractors , Guillermo Zarabozo , is now facing murder charges in United States District Court in Miami for his role in allegedly executing four crew members of a charter fishing boat , then dumping their bodies at sea .
In an interview , a Burger King executive told me that the company had worked with Diplomatic Tactical Services for years on “ security - related matters ” and had used it to obtain information about the Student / Farmworker Alliance ’s plans  in order to prevent acts of violence .
“ It is both the corporation ’s right and duty , ” a company spokesman later wrote in an e-mail message to me , “ to protect its employees and assets from potential harm . ”
But the Student / Farmworker Alliance and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers are not dangerous , extremist groups .
Both are pacifist , mainstream nonprofits inspired by the work of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The coalition is supported by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Foundation , the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) and Pax Christi , the Catholic peace movement .
The Bill of Rights was adopted to protect Americans from the abusive power of their government .
I ’ve come to believe that we now need a similar set of restrictions to defend against irresponsible corporate power .
Today companies like Wal - Mart and ExxonMobil have annual revenues larger than the entire budgets of some states , and they employ former agents from the F.B.I. , the C.I.A. and the Secret Service to do security work .
Unlike government agencies , whose surveillance activities are supposed to be conducted according to strict guidelines and court orders , these private firms operate with a remarkable degree of freedom .
At the moment , federal laws against the practice of “ pretexting ”  using a false identity to obtain personal information  apply only to financial and telephone records .
The other day I wrote a post that exposed McCain for being a ‘ D’ student and graduating 5th from the bottom of his class .
By the looks of it , I ’d say we found the other 3 below him .
By recycling embarrassing news clips , a short “ spoof ” is created that features John McCain , Phil Gramm , Bill O’Reily , and Mitt Romney ; aka The D - Team .
Queue the cheesy music …
“ The fundamentals of our economy are very strong . ” – John McCain
A lot of people were upset when McCain ’s adviser Phil Gramm called America “ a nation of whiners ” but none were more vocal about it than Jim Cramer .
“ Wait a second !
If you ’re payin ’ more … at the pump [ and ] your food prices doubled , do n’t you really have something to whine about ? ”
Increasing homeless veterans , rising gas prices , and the mortgage crisis are only a handful of distressing topics covered in this episode .
By the end of the video you realize that McCain is wrong when he claims that “ the fundamentals of our economy are very strong . ”
Very wrong .

With the economic news of the week of July 14 — the continuing crisis among mortgage lenders , the onset of bank failures , the announced downsizing of General Motors , the slide of the Dow - Jones below 11,000 — we are seeing the ongoing collapse of the U.S. economy .
Even the super - rich are becoming nervous as cries for an emergency suspension of short selling ring out .
What is really taking place , however , is that the producing economy of working men and women is being crushed by the overall debt burden on households , businesses , and governments that could reach $ 70 trillion by 2010 .
The financial system , including mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , is bankrupt , as the debts it is based on cannot be repaid .
This is because the producing economy of people who work for a living simply can no longer generate enough purchasing power for people either to pay their debts or allow them to purchase what is being sold in the marketplace .
In turn it is the debt burden and the loss of societal purchasing power that are crashing the stock market .
Thus the collapse of the financial economy has started to destroy the producing economy as well .
It ’s a “ perfect storm , ” the result of a 200 - year - old financial system where money is largely created by bank lending and where since 1980 our industry and jobs have been increasingly outsourced abroad to cheap labor markets .
Thus domestic incomes have stagnated while the nation ’s GDP has not been able to keep up with the exponential growth of debt .
While the mainstream media are blind , deaf , and dumb as to the causes , the victims within the middle and working classes are seeing their livelihoods ruined , jobs taken away , pensions eroded , homes foreclosed on , and are being saddled with ever - increasing debt and forced to work under more and more stress due to rising burdens of taxation , gas and food price inflation , and bureaucratic rules and regulations .
The only places a more - or - less normal life may still be possible will be the wealthiest imperial centers like Washington , New York , Houston , Chicago , or San Francisco .
All that the current bailouts being engineered by the Federal Reserve are doing is to create more debt to shore up failing financial institutions .
No new wealth is being created .
It ’s band - aids on band - aids .
The problem politically is that control of the U.S. long ago was turned over to the bankers and the financiers of the Western world .
It was called financial “ deregulation , ” accelerated under President Ronald Reagan , and has run amok since then .
From a longer historical view , it ’s the same phenomenon that first created and then ruined the British Empire , and it ’s what created and is now ruining the American Empire today .
A side - effect of control by the bankers and financiers is that they are also Zionists , so we have the added multi-trillion dollar burden of trying to conquer the Middle East on behalf of the international oil interests and the state of Israel .
The situation has deteriorated sharply since the 1970s as U.S. affairs have been managed on behalf of the financial interests by what you might call the “ Three Amigos ” — Henry Kissinger , Paul Volcker , and Alan Greenspan .
Kissinger , while Nixon ’s secretary of state , made the U.S. dependent on the Middle East for oil , lavished billions on Israel ’s war machine , and created the petrodollar to support our trade and fiscal deficits .
Volcker , while chairman of the Federal Reserve , crashed the U.S. producing economy in the recession of 1979 - 1983 , leading to the rise of the “ service economy . ”
Greenspan , during his own Federal Reserve chairmanship , presided over the bubble economy which was created through massive official fraud in home mortgage lending and is now sinking like the Titanic .
The politicians have enabled these financial crimes .
Above all it ’s been the Bush family which has served as a political Trojan Horse for the financiers for three generations , with affairs having become much worse since George H.W. Bush invaded Iraq for the first time in 1991 .
The enablers have included a majority of the members of the U.S. Congress .
( See the conclusion of Patrick Buchanan ’s new book , Churchill , Hitler , and the Unnecessary War for an account of how the U.S. since the Bush I presidency has replicated the catastrophic errors of failed British imperialism . )
The American people are not entirely innocent .
We have been so lulled to sleep by the financier - owned media that we have allowed these disasters to take place and are now reaping the consequences .
We have been the fodder for their wars and the signers of their loans .
We have tried to carve out our own piece of the pie which is now crumbling .
What is taking place is not just the collapse of the U.S. , but more than likely the final crash of Western civilization , since we are the last of the world empires to go down the drain .
World War I saw the end of the German , Austro - Hungarian , Russian , and Ottoman empires .
World War II saw the disappearance of the French , British , Japanese , and Italian empires , along with Nazi Germany .
The Soviet empire collapsed in 1991 .
The American is next .
The danger is that we may lash out and start a nuclear World War III out of frustration and to appease the elitists of the world who see war and famine as their pathway to world control .
Such a war would also mean a military takeover domestically to manage the pathetically weak nation that we are becoming .
The bankers and financiers do not care if nations and empires destroy themselves and each other , because they are internationalists .
In fact , the more war and mass starvation there is the better off they feel .
All they need is a base from which to operate .
London has been their main base of operations since the Bank of England was founded in 1694 , though they have a strong presence in other nations .
They have been especially influential in northwest Europe , where elitism in the form of Freemasonry endeavored since the time of the French Revolution to destroy the authority of the Catholic Church .
In fact , World War I was a project of the Freemasons in dismembering Germany and the Austro - Hungarian Empire , both largely Catholic .
This destruction allowed the masters of usury to flourish within the atheistic and materialistic culture that Freemasonry fostered across Europe .
World War I also resulted in the virus of Communism , largely egged on by the internationalists and Freemasons , though it had such a tragic impact on Russia and Central Europe before spreading to China and East Asia .
It is theoretically possible that the US as a nation could still save itself through an internal revolution , while playing a much reduced role in the world .
After all , England , France , and Italy still exist as shadows of their past greatness .
But , realistically , all ordinary people can do today is try to survive , perhaps by working with friends and neighbors in planting food and living within the underground economy .
At least people might not then have to starve to death , because hard as it is to believe that “ it could happen here , ” widespread famine in the U.S. seems a real possibility over the next several years .
Nations take such risks when they allow capitalist agribusiness to destroy local agriculture .
On a national level , it is likely that as a response to the economic crisis some attempt will be made by desperate politicians to try to replicate the New Deal , but to do this effectively would require political control by a nationalistic reform party .
Even then , additional reform measures such as control of credit as a public utility , a basic income guarantee , and a national dividend would be needed for real economic security to replace the current madness that could soon make the U.S. a relic of history .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Sensing the start of a personal computer revolution , Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to start Microsoft Corp and pursue a vision of a computer on every desk and in every home .
File photo shows Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates speaksing to students at Stanford University in Palo Alto , California February 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Robert Galbraith
Three decades later , Gates is set to step down on Friday from what is now the world ’s largest software company to work full - time at the charitable organization -- the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- built by his vast fortune .
No longer the world ’s richest man -- he has been topped by investor Warren Buffett and Mexico ’s telecoms tycoon Carlos Slim --
Gates says great wealth brings with it great responsibility .
The 52 - year - old , whose boyish looks seem at odds with his graying hair , will leave behind a life ’s work developing software to devote energy to finding new vaccines or to micro-finance projects in the developing world .
As Microsoft ’s biggest shareholder , Gates will remain chairman and work on special technology projects .
His 8.7 percent stake in Microsoft is worth about $ 23 billion .
Gates first programmed a computer at 13 , creating a class scheduling system for his Seattle high school .
As he gained more experience , he realized the potential that software held to change how humans worked , played and communicated .
“ When I was 19 , I caught sight of the future and based my career on what I saw .
I turned out to have been right , ” Gates wrote in his 1995 book “ The Road Ahead . ”
Gates realized at an early stage of the PC revolution that software would be more important than hardware .
Working with boyhood friend Paul Allen , Gates founded Microsoft , naming the company for its mission of providing microcomputer software .
PRIVILEGED UPBRINGING
Gates was born October 28 , 1955 , the second of three children in a prominent Seattle family .
His father , William Henry Gates Jr. , was a partner at one of the city ’s most powerful law firms , while his late mother , Mary , was an active charity fund - raiser and University of Washington regent .
He was introduced to computers at the exclusive Lakeside Preparatory School , where the teen prodigy began programming in BASIC computer language on a primitive ASR - 33 Teletype unit .
It was at Lakeside that Gates met Allen , a student two years his senior who shared his fascination with computers .
“ Of course , in those days we were just goofing around , or so we thought , ” Gates recalled in “ The Road Ahead . ”
During his two years at Harvard , Gates devoted much of his time to programming marathons and all - night poker sessions before dropping out to work on software for the Altair , a clunky desktop computer that cost $ 400 in kit form .
Also at Harvard , Gates became friends with an ebullient Detroit native who shared his love of math and cynical humor .
Gates eventually talked that classmate , current CEO Steve Ballmer , into leaving business school to join Microsoft .
Gates dropped out of Harvard and relocated with Allen to Albuquerque , New Mexico , where they established Microsoft .
Their big break came in 1980 when Gates and his carelessly dressed young colleagues signed an agreement to build the operating system that became known as MS - DOS for International Business Machines Corp ’s new personal computer .
In a critical blunder by IBM , Microsoft was allowed to license the operating system to others , spawning an industry of “ IBM - compatible ” machines dependent on Microsoft software .
“ His legacy has to be as one of the shrewdest businessmen and technologist of the 20th century , ” said Michael Cusumano , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Sloan School of Management .
Microsoft went public in 1986 in one of the most celebrated offerings of its time .
By the next year , the soaring stock made Gates , at age 31 , the youngest self - made billionaire .
Overseeing Microsoft ’s steady growth , he became known as a bare - knuckles businessman and manager , sometimes dismissing a suggestion as “ the stupidest thing I have ever heard . ”
Microsoft grew to dominate its industry and became the target of a landmark antitrust case , which it fought every step of the way before eventually settling with U.S. prosecutors .
Rob Helm , director of research at independent research firm Directions of Microsoft , said Gates will go down as one of the great businessmen in history like John D. Rockefeller -- for better or for worse .
“ He ’s never going to be necessarily a widely admired figure , but someone who created an activity that came to represent a chunk of the American economy . ”

Some think it looks like a flip off .
There really is no excuse for anything posing as a news network to claim that ' the blogs are buzzing about this one " and promote it so when any cursory search on the internets would have found numerous examples of just how specious a charge it was -- like the video shot from the side here .

As Media Matters notes , this is a story that made the rounds on sites like RedState and FoxNews.com but had already been thoroughly debunked before Contessa gave new life to the ridiculous lie .

Get ready for another economic shock of major proportions — a virtual doubling of prices at the gas pump to as much as $ 10 a gallon .
That ’s the message from a couple of analytical energy industry trackers , both of whom , based on the surging oil prices , see considerably more pain at the pump than most drivers realize .
Gasoline nationally is in an accelerated upswing , having jumped to $ 3.58 a gallon from $ 3.50 in just the past week .
In some parts of the country , including New York City and the West Coast , gas is already sporting a price tag above $ 4 a gallon .
There was a pray - in at a Chevron station in San Francisco on Friday led by a minister asking God for cheaper gas , and an Arco gas station in San Mateo , Calif . , has already raised its price to a sky - high $ 4.62 .
In Manhattan , at a Mobil gas station at York Avenue and East 61st Street , premium gas is now $ 4.03 a gallon .
Two days ago , it was $ 3.96 .
Why such a high price ?
" Blame the people at STOPEC ( he meant OPEC ) and the oil companies , " an attendant there told me .
These increases are taking place before the all - important summer driving season , signaling even higher prices ahead .
That ’s also the outlook of the Automobile Association of America .
" As long as the price of crude oil stays above $ 100 a barrel , drivers will be forced to pay more and more at the gas pump , " a AAA spokesman , Troy Green , said .
Oil recently hit an all - time high of nearly $ 120 a barrel , more than double its early 2007 price of about $ 50 a barrel .
It closed Friday at $ 118.52 .

It ’s a tough time for Captain America .
Advances in military technology have made a jacked - up dude with discus skills all but obsolete on the battlefield , the current U.S. administration is one that ol ’
Steve Rogers might not be too stoked to shill for , and his rumored cameo in the Louis Leterrier / Ed Norton Incredible Hulk film was cut .
And he was also assassinated last year , which will put anyone out of sorts .
So until the upcoming Avengers movie gives Cap something worthwhile to do , we ’re just going to assume that he ’s sitting around his apartment in his robe and Al Gore post -2004 election beard , swigging the fire water and staring longingly at a picture of the Red Skull in front of the TV .
Paul Armstrong ‘s photos of a retired - but - still - hanging - on - to - it Captain America do a great job of depicting that sort of sadlarious ennui .
Maybe he ’s doing some freelance work here and there , protecting freedom from home part - time or something … ’ cause this is pretty much what my days looked like when I was freelancing last summer .
He just has cooler pajamas that he stays in until 2 pm when he realizes that he needs to go buy milk if he ’s gonna make macaroni and cheese .

Update :
A fully updated , " 2014 " version of this Hyperinflation Report has been published and is available here : Hyperinflaton Update 2014 : First Installment )
UPDATE — COMMENTARY
" How has the hyperinflation outlook changed since the Hyperinflation Special Report was published in April 2008 ? "
Such is the most frequently asked question I receive these days .
The answer is that the outlook is little changed , since the following report outlines the basic issues and limited options for the U.S. government that were in play well before the current crises broke .
The actions taken since by the federal government , U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve , in response to the still - deepening recession and ongoing systemic solvency woes , just exacerbated the long - range problems described in the report .
The official actions likely have advanced the timing of the hyperinflation to the much nearer future , perhaps within the next year or two .
Since September 2008 , the Federal Reserve has been attempting to debase the U.S. dollar at an extraordinary pace , and such now is recognized widely among the major U.S. trading partners .
The current issues are discussed regularly and those analyses are available to subscribers in the Shadow Government Newsletter and related Flash Updates and Alerts .
An updated Hyperinflation Special Report should be posted in the next several months .
Thank you for your interest .
Best wishes ,

HYPERINFLATION SPECIAL REPORT
Issue Number 41
April 8 , 2008
__________
Inflationary Recession Is in Place
Banking Solvency Crisis Has Opened First Phase of Monetary Inflation
Hyperinflationary Depression Remains Likely As Early As 2010
__________
Overview
The U.S. economy is in an intensifying inflationary recession that eventually will evolve into a hyperinflationary great depression .
Hyperinflation could be experienced as early as 2010 , if not before , and likely no more than a decade down the road .
The U.S. government and Federal Reserve already have committed the system to this course through the easy politics of a bottomless pocketbook , the servicing of big - moneyed special interests , and gross mismanagement .
The U.S. has no way of avoiding a financial Armageddon .
Bankrupt sovereign states most commonly use the currency printing press as a solution to not having enough money to cover their obligations .
The alternative would be for the U.S. to renege on its existing debt and obligations , a solution for modern sovereign states rarely seen outside of governments overthrown in revolution , and a solution with no happier ending than simply printing the needed money .
With the creation of massive amounts of new fiat ( not backed by gold ) dollars will come the eventual complete collapse of the value of the U.S. dollar and related dollar - denominated paper assets .
What lies ahead will be extremely difficult and unhappy times for many .
Ralph T. Foster , in his " Fiat Paper Money " ( see recommended further reading at the end of this issue ) , closes his book ’s preface with a particularly poignant quote from a 1993 interview of Friedrich Kessler , a law professor at Harvard and University of California Berkeley , who experienced the Weimar Republic hyperinflation :
" It was horrible .
Horrible !
Like lightning it struck .
No one was prepared .
You cannot imagine the rapidity with which the whole thing happened .
The shelves in the grocery stores were empty .
You could buy nothing with your paper money . "
This Special Report updates and expands upon the three - part Hyperinflation Series that began with the December 2006 SGS Newsletter , exploring : ( 1 ) the causes and background of the evolving hyperinflation and great depression ; ( 2 ) why circumstances will differ from the deflationary Great Depression of the 1930s ; ( 3 ) implications for politics and the financial markets ; ( 4 ) considerations for individuals and businesses .
The broad outlook has not changed during the last year .
More generally , though , developments in the economy and the financial markets have been in line with projections and have tended to confirm the unfolding disaster .
Specifically , the current inflationary recession has gained much broader recognition , while the still - unfolding banking solvency crisis has confirmed the Fed ’s and the U.S. government ’s willingness to spend whatever money they have to create in order to keep the financial system from imploding .
While the dollar has taken a heavy hit — down roughly 20 % against key currencies from last year — selling of the U.S. currency still has been far short of the outright dollar dumping that eventually will lead to flight to safety outside of the U.S. dollar .
That event is important to the shorter - term timing of the pending hyperinflation .
Regular readers may recognize text from last year ’s Series , as well as material from various SGS newsletters , but such is the nature of revisions to prior material .
Points that may be repeated from earlier newsletters are done so in sequence to help build the arguments explaining the unfolding crisis .
Great thanks are extended to the numerous subscribers who offered ideas , questions and materials that have been incorporated in this report .
Defining the Components of a Hyperinflationary Great Depression
Deflation , Inflation and Hyperinflation .
Inflation generally is defined in terms of a rise in general prices due to an increase in the amount of money in circulation .
The inflation / deflation issues defined and discussed here are as applied to goods and services , not to the pricing of financial assets .
In terms of hyperinflation , there have been a variety of definitions used over time .
The circumstance envisioned ahead is not one of double - or triple - digit annual inflation , but more along the lines of seven- to 10 - digit inflation seen in other circumstances during the last century .
Under such circumstances , the currency in question becomes worthless , as seen in Germany ( Weimar Republic ) in the early 1920s , in Hungary after World War II and in the dismembered Yugoslavia of the early 1990s .
The historical culprit generally has been the use of fiat currencies — currencies with no asset backing such as gold — and the resulting massive printing of currency that the issuing authority needed to support its system , when it did not have the ability , otherwise , to raise enough money for its perceived needs , through taxes or other means .
Foster ( see recommended further reading at the end of this issue ) details the history of fiat paper currencies from 11th century Szechwan , China , to date , and their consistent collapses , time - after - time , due to what appears to be the inevitable , irresistible urge of issuing authorities to print too much of a good thing .
The United States is no exception , already having obligated itself to liabilities well beyond its ability ever to pay off .
Here are the definitions :
Deflation .
A decrease in the prices of goods and services , usually tied to a contraction of money in circulation .
Inflation .
An increase in the prices of goods and services , usually tied to an increase of money in circulation .
Hyperinflation : Extreme inflation , minimally in excess of four - digit annual percent change , where the involved currency becomes worthless .
A fairly crude definition of hyperinflation is a circumstance , where , due to extremely rapid price increases , the largest pre-hyperinflation bank note ( $ 100 bill in the United States ) becomes worth more as functional toilet paper / tissue than as currency .
As discussed in the section Historical U.S. Inflation : Why Hyperinflation Instead of Deflation , the domestic economy has been through periods of both major inflation and deflation , usually tied to wars and their aftermaths .
Such , however , preceded the U.S. going off the gold standard in 1933 .
The era of the modern fiat dollar generally has been one of persistent and slowly debilitating inflation .
Recession , Depression and Great Depression .
A couple of decades back , I tried to tie down the definitional differences between a recession , depression and a great depression with the Bureau of Economic Analysis ( BEA ) , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) and a number of private economists .
I found that there was no consensus on the matter , so I set some definitions that the various parties ( neither formally nor officially ) thought were within reason .
If you look at the plot of the level of economic activity during a downturn , you will see something that looks like a bowl , with activity recessing on the downside and recovering on the upside .
The term used to describe this bowl - shaped circumstance before World War II was " depression , " while the downside portion of the cycle was called " recession . "
Before World War II , all downturns simply were referred to as depressions .
In the wake of the Great Depression of the 1930s , however , a euphemism was sought for future economic contractions so as to avoid evoking memories of that earlier , financially painful time .
Accordingly , a post - World War II downturn was called " recession . "
Officially , the worst post - World War II recession was from November 1973 through March 1975 , with a peak - to - trough contraction of 5 % .
Such followed the Vietnam War , Nixon ’s floating of the U.S. dollar and the Oil Embargo .
The double - dip recession in the early - 1980s may have seen a combined contraction of roughly 6 % .
I contend that the current double - dip recession that began in late - 2000 already is rivaling the 1980s double - dip as to depth .
( See the Reporting / Market Focus of the October 2006 SGS for further detail . )
Please note that the definition for " great depression " below has been revised to a contraction in excess of 25 % ( from 20 % stated in the March 16 , 2008 newsletter ) , in order to be consistent with the usage in last year ’s Series .
Here are the definitions :
Recession : Two or more consecutive quarters of contracting real ( inflation - adjusted ) GDP , where the downturn is not triggered by an exogenous factor such as a truckers ’ strike .
The NBER , which is the official arbiter of when the United States economy is in recession , attempts to refine its timing calls , on a monthly basis , through the use of economic series such as payroll employment and industrial production , and it no longer relies on the two quarters of contracting GDP rule .
Depression : A recession , where the peak - to - trough contraction in real growth exceeds 10 % .
Great Depression : A depression , where the peak - to - trough contraction in real growth exceeds 25 % .
On the basis of the preceding , there has been the one Great Depression , in the 1930s .
Most of the economic contractions before that would be classified as depressions .
All business downturns since World War II — as officially reported — have been recessions .
Using the somewhat broader " great depression " definition of a contraction in excess of 20 % ( instead of 25 % ) , the depression of 1837 to 1843 would be considered " great , " as technically would be the war - time production shut - down in 1945 .
The current economic contraction is about halfway towards being classified as a " depression , " based on my definitions and GDP accounting .
As the Great War became World War I with the advent of World War II , so too may the Great Depression become Great Depression I , as the current crisis reaches its full , terrible potential .
As with the two world wars , what may become known as Great Depression II had its roots in Great Depression I .
Current Environment
Before examining how the current circumstance can evolve from an inflationary recession to a hyperinflationary depression and then great depression , it is worth defining the nature of the current economic and inflation conditions in the United States , and likely near - term developments .
Based on the regular material discussed in the SGS Newsletter , the U.S. economy is in an inflationary recession as will be reported in official statistics .
Real ( inflation - adjusted ) fourth - quarter 2007 GDP , in July ’s benchmark revision , and / or first - quarter 2008 GDP should be in contraction , with most underlying economic series showing distressed levels of activity consistent with a recession .
Annual CPI inflation is at 4.0 % and headed higher .
Oil prices remain over $ 100 per barrel , weakness in the dollar is just beginning to impact the CPI , and the inflationary effects of soaring broad money growth should start to surface around mid-year .
Official CPI could be running in double - digits by year - end 2008 .
Net of gimmicked methodologies that have reduced CPI inflation reporting and inflated GDP reporting , the U.S. economy has been in a recession since late - 2006 , entering the second down - leg of a multiple - dip economic contraction , where the first downleg was the recession of 2001 that really began back in late - 1999 .
Annual CPI inflation currently is running around 11.6 % , again , facing further upside pressures .
The current outlook does not exclude further bounces and dips in economic activity .
As was seen during the Great Depression , in severe contractions the economy can hit bottom and then bounce briefly until it falls again , finding a new bottom .
As discussed in the Depression / Great Depression section , the current economic downturn reflects a structural shift , which increasingly has constrained consumer activity during the last several decades , and which can not be turned quickly .
The current downturn , by my numbers , already is halfway to qualifying as a depression .
The evolving depression quickly will move to great depression status , when the hyperinflation hits , as such will be extremely disruptive to the conduct of normal commerce .
The efforts by the federal government and the Federal Reserve to prevent a systemic collapse as a result of the banking solvency crisis has started to spike broad money growth , as measured by the SGS - Ongoing M3 measure , which currently shows a record annual growth rate of 17.3 % .
While the Fed has not been formally creating new money — yet — by adding to reserves , it has had the effect of creating new money by re-liquefying otherwise illiquid banks , by lending liquid assets versus illiquid assets .
As a result , a number of banks have been able to resume more normal functioning , lending money and creating new money supply .
As the systemic bailout proceeds , formal money creation will follow and already may be starting to show up in official accounting .
In response to the rapidly deteriorating fundamentals underlying the value of the U.S. dollar , selling of the greenback has been intense , but contained , with brief periods of stability as seen at the moment .
In the near future , dollar selling should build towards an extreme , with heavy foreign investment in the dollar fleeing the U.S. currency for safety elsewhere .
With the domestic financial markets and U.S. Treasuries so heavily dependent on foreign capital for liquidity , the Federal Reserve — now touted as the formal financial market stabilizer — will be forced increasingly to monetize federal debt .
That process will build over time , given the federal government ’s effective bankruptcy , as discussed in the section U.S. Government Cannot Cover Existing Obligations .
Therein lies the ultimate basis for the pending hyperinflation .
Again , the current circumstance will evolve into a hyperinflationary depression , then great depression .
Although such is not likely much before 2010 , or after 2018 , that financial end game for the current markets will tend to come sooner rather than later and will break with surprising speed when it hits .
As discussed later , this likely will not be a deflationary environment as seen during the Great Depression .
What lies ahead for the current year will be severe enough and financially painful enough to affect the outcome of the 2008 presidential election .
Historically , the concerns of the electorate have been dominated by pocketbook issues .
Prior to gimmicked methodologies making the reporting of disposable personal income largely meaningless , that measure was an excellent predictor of presidential elections .
In every presidential race since 1908 , in which consistent , real ( inflation - adjusted ) annual disposable income growth was above 3.3 % , the incumbent party holding the White House won every time .
When income growth was below 3.3 % , the incumbent party lost every time .
Again , with redefinitions to the national income accounts in the last two decades , a consistent measure of disposable income as reported by the government has disappeared .
Yet , even with official reporting , the current annual growth in real disposable income is at 2.2 % , well below the traditional 3.3 % limit .
Accordingly , odds are quite high that the numbers for 2008 will favor an incumbent party loss , i.e. a victory for the Democrats .
Where I always endeavor to keep my political persuasions separate from my analyses , for purposes of full disclosure , my background is as a conservative Republican with a libertarian bent .
What follows or coincides politically with a hyperinflationary depression offers a wide variety of possibilities , but the political status quo likely would not continue .
Times would be financially painful enough to encourage the development of a third party that could move the Republicans or Democrats to third - party status in the 2010 mid-term or 2012 presidential elections .
Historical U.S. Inflation : Why Hyperinflation Instead of Deflation
Fire and Ice
Some say the world will end in fire ,
Some say in ice .
From what I ’ve tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire .
But if it had to perish twice ,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice
Is also great
And would suffice .
– Robert Frost
As to the fate of the developing U.S. great depression , it will encompass the fire of a hyperinflation , instead of the ice of deflation seen in the major U.S. depressions prior to World War II .
What promises hyperinflation this time is the lack monetary discipline formerly imposed on the system by the gold standard , and a Federal Reserve dedicated to preventing a collapse in the money supply and the implosion of the still , extremely over - leveraged domestic financial system .
The accompanying two graphs measure the level of consumer prices since 1665 in the American Colonies and later the United States .
The first graph shows what appears to be a fairly stable level of prices up to the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1913 ( began activity in 1914 ) and Franklin Roosevelt ’s abandoning of the gold standard in 1933 .
Then , inflation takes off in a manner not seen in the prior 250 years , and at an exponential rate when viewed using the SGS - Alternate Measure of Consumer Prices in the last several decades .
The price levels shown prior to 1913 were constructed by Robert Sahr of Oregon State University .
Price levels since 1913 either are Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) or SGS based , as indicated .
The magnitude of the increase in price levels in the last 50 years or so , however , visually masks in the first graph the inflation volatility of the earlier years .
That volatility becomes evident in the second graph , with inflation history shown only through 1960 .
What is shown in the second graph is that up through the Great Depression , regular periods of inflation — usually seen around wars — have been offset by periods of deflation .
Particular inflation spikes can be seen at the time of the American Revolution , the War of 1812 , the Civil War , World War I and World War II .
The inflation peaks and the ensuing post - war depressions and deflationary periods tied to the War of 1812 , the Civil War and World War I show close to 60 - year cycles , which is part of the reason some economists and analysts have been expecting a deflationary depression in the current period .
There is some reason behind 30 - and 60 - year financial and business cycles , as the average difference in generations in the U.S. is 30 years , going back to the 1600s .
Accordingly , it seems to take two generations to forget and repeat the mistakes of one ’s grandparents .
Similar reasoning accounts for other cycles that tend to run in multiples of 30 years .
Aside from minor average annual price level declines in 1944 and 1955 , the United States has not seen a deflationary period in consumer prices since before World War II .
The reason for this is the same as to why there has not been a formal depression since before World War II : the abandonment of the gold standard and recognition by the Federal Reserve of the impact of monetary policy — free of gold - standard system restraints — on the economy .
The gold standard was a system that automatically imposed and maintained monetary discipline .
Excesses in one period would be followed by a flight of gold from the system and a resulting contraction in the money supply , economic activity and prices .
Faced with the Great Depression , and unable to stimulate the economy , partially due to the monetary discipline imposed by the gold standard , Franklin Roosevelt used those issues as an excuse to abandon gold and to adopt close to a fully fiat currency under the auspices of what I call the debt standard , where the government effectively could print and spend whatever money it wanted to .
Roosevelt ’s actions were against the backdrop of the banking system being in a state of collapse .
The Fed stood by twiddling its thumbs as banks failed and the money supply imploded .
A depression collapsed into the Great Depression , with intensified price deflation .
Importantly , a sharp decline in broad money supply is a prerequisite to goods and services price deflation .
Messrs Greenspan and Bernanke are students of the Great Depression period .
As did Mr. Greenspan before him , " Helicopter Ben " has vowed not to allow a repeat of the 1930s money supply collapse .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke picked up his various helicopter nicknames and references as the result of a November 21 , 2002 speech he gave as a Fed Governor to the National Economists Club entitled " Deflation : Making Sure ‘ It ’ Does n’t Happen Here . "
The phrase that the now - Fed Chairman Bernanke likely wishes he had not used was a reference to " Milton Friedman ’s famous ‘ helicopter drop ’ of money . "
Attempting to counter concerns of another Great Depression - style deflation , Bernanke explained in his remarks : " I am confident that the Fed would take whatever means necessary to prevent significant deflation in the United States … "
As a quick point of clarification , Mr. Bernanke ’s actions to address the current banking system ’s solvency issues are still in the preventative phase .
The money supply is not in collapse , and the Fed has not started dropping cash from helicopters , yet , but the choppers are in the air and remain at the ready .
As expounded upon by Mr. Bernanke , " Indeed , under a fiat ( that is , paper ) money system , a government ( in practice , the central bank in cooperation with other agencies ) should always be able to generate increased nominal spending and inflation , even when the short - term nominal interest rate is at zero . "
" Like gold , U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply .
But the U.S. government has a technology , called a printing press ( or , today , its electronic equivalent ) , that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost .
By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation , or even by credibly threatening to do so , the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services , which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services .
We conclude that , under a paper - money system , a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation . "
The full text of then - Fed Governor Bernanke ’s remarks can be found at : http://federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm.
Where Franklin Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard and its financial discipline for the debt standard , eleven successive administrations have pushed the debt standard to the limits of its viability , as seen now in the ongoing threat of possible systemic collapse .
The effect of these policies has been a slow - motion destruction of the U.S. dollar ’s purchasing power , as seen in the accompanying table , since the gold standard was abandoned in 1933 .
Loss of U.S. Dollar Purchasing Power through March 2008
—- Since January of —- Versus : 1914 1933 1970 Swiss franc - 80.4 % - 80.4 % - 76.5 % CPI - U -95.1 % - 94.0 % - 82.3 % Gold - 97.9 % - 97.9 % - 93.4 % SGS - Alternate CPI - 98.2 % - 97.8 % - 93.6 %
Note : Gold and Swiss franc values were held constant
by the gold standard versus coins in 1914 and 1933 .
Sources : Shadow Government Statistics , Federal Reserve
As discussed in the next section , the limits to the unlimited abuse of the debt standard are particularly evident in the GAAP - based financial statements of the U.S. government , which show the actual federal deficit at $ 4.0 - plus trillion for 2007 , alone , with total federal obligations standing at $ 62.6 trillion .
With no ability to honor these obligations , the government effectively is bankrupt .
At such debt levels , the markets soon will recoil from lending Uncle Sam whatever he needs .
Major buyers of U.S. Treasuries from outside the United States , including a number of central banks , already are balking .
These investors have funded nearly all net U.S. Treasury debt issuance of the last five years , putting to use the excess dollars flushed into the global markets by the United States ’ excessive and ever - expanding trade deficit .
This practice , however , generated liquidity for the U.S. markets that has helped to depress long - term Treasury yields as well as to boost equity prices , in general .
Although the U.S , government faces ultimate insolvency , it has the same way out taken by most countries faced with bankruptcy .
It can print whatever money it needs to create , in order to meet its obligations .
The effect of such action is a runaway inflation — a hyperinflation — with a resulting , effective full debasement of the U.S. dollar , the world ’s reserve currency .
The magnitude of the loss of the U.S. dollar ’s purchasing power in the last 75 years now has the potential of being replicated within a few days or weeks .
In the present environment , the chances for the collapse in money supply needed to generate a consumer price deflation are nil .
First , the discipline of the gold standard that helped trigger historical deflations is gone .
Second , both from the standpoint of the government ’s fiscal irresponsibility and from the Fed ’s standpoint of providing the financial system with whatever liquidity is needed to keep it afloat , the U.S. central bank already is pushing broad money growth to new extremes , not containing it .
Shown in the next four graphs are powerful fundamentals that either drive U.S. inflation or reflect market expectations of the longer - term domestic inflation outlook .
Oil prices are near historic highs , the dollar is near historic lows , and money growth is at an all - time .
The near - term outlook for all three series is for new record levels and for extremely strong upside pressure on U.S. inflation .
Accordingly , gold prices should continue moving higher , setting new historic highs .
U.S. Government Cannot Cover Existing Obligations
The U.S. Treasury publishes annual financial statements of the United States Government , prepared using generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) , audited by the General Accountability Office ( GAO ) and signed off on by Treasury Secretary Paulson .
The statements show that the federal government ’s annual fiscal deficit , far from being officially in the low hundreds of billions of dollar — although 2008 numbers rapidly are moving towards the $ 500 billion mark — is careening wildly out of control , averaging $ 4.6 trillion dollars per year for the six years through 2007 .
The difference is in accounting for the net present value , and year - to - year changes in same , for unfunded Social Security and Medicare liabilities .
The government ’s finances not only are out of control , but the actual deficit is not containable .
Put into perspective , if the government were to raise taxes so as to seize 100 % of all wages , salaries and corporate profits , it still would be showing an annual deficit using GAAP accounting on a consistent basis .
In like manner , given current revenues , if it stopped spending every penny ( including defense and homeland security ) other than for Social Security and Medicare obligations , the government still would be showing an annual deficit .
The results summarized in the following table show the various deficit / debt / obligation measures .
The official GAAP - based deficit , including the annual change in the net present value of unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare is estimated at more than $ 4.0 trillion in 2007 versus $ 4.6 trillion in 2006 .
The 2007 estimate is based on a consistent year - to - year accounting basis .
Further , contrary to the suggestion of Treasury Secretary Paulson — aside from a weakening economic outlook discussed in the next section — if the annual deficit is beyond containment through standard fiscal actions , then the United States has no way to grow out of this shortfall .

The GAAP - accounting is what a U.S. corporation would have to show .
The Administration ’s rationale as to why Social Security and Medicare should remain off balance sheet runs along the lines that the government always has the option of changing the Social Security and Medicare programs .
That said , there clearly is no one in political Washington willing to go public with the concept of eliminating or substantially cutting those programs .
Such includes the prospective presidential candidates .
Consider that given the current financial condition of the government , various politicians are pushing ever further for expensive cradle - to - grave programs for the electorate , ranging from national health insurance to bailouts of mortgaged homeowners at risk of foreclosure .
With no full funding available for any new programs , the government again is showing its willingness to spend whatever money it has to create .
The intent going forward is inflation — hyperinflation .
This circumstance has evolved with the full knowledge of political Washington and the Federal Reserve .
As shown in the above graph , U.S. federal obligations are so huge versus the national GDP that the country ’s finances look more like those of a banana republic than the world ’s premiere financial power and home to the world ’s primary reserve currency , the U.S. dollar .
If not for the special position the United States holds in the world , its debt — U.S. Treasuries — likely would be rated as below investment grade , instead of triple - A . Moody ’s has even hinted at a longer - term downgrade on Treasury securities .
While a three - month Treasury bill should be safe , I would not want to bet on receiving full value on a 10 - year Treasury note or 30 - year Treasury bond .
Yet , as shown in the following two graphs , most U.S. Treasury issuance has been purchased by investors outside the United States .
Not only have these investors been taking a hit in terms of the value of the U.S. dollar , but also they face meaningful default / devaluation risk in the future .
It is only a matter of time before this accommodation of foreign investors shifts to flight to safety outside the greenback , and therein will develop the early pressures for the Fed to start becoming the lender of last resort to the federal government .
Depression / Great Depression
The U.S. economy is in a deepening structural change that has resulted from U.S. trade policies that have driven the U.S. manufacturing base offshore .
As a result , a large number of related , high paying jobs have been lost to U.S. workers .
As shown in the accompanying graphs , as the U.S. trade deficit has risen to the highest level for any country in history , U.S. average weekly earnings , adjusted for inflation , have fallen .
Even using official CPI for deflation , current real earnings are below their peak back in the 1970s .
Adjusted for the SGS - Alternate CPI measure , real earnings have been falling since the early 1980s .
Also shown are real median incomes for U.S. males versus females , showing declines in recent years , per official government data .
The effect of this structural change has been that most consumers have been unable to sustain adequate income growth beyond the rate of inflation , unable to maintain their standard of living .
The only way that personal consumption — the dominant component of GDP — can grow in such a circumstance is for the consumer to take on new debt or to liquidate savings .
Both those factors are short - lived and have reached untenable extremes .
Debt expansion and savings liquidation both were encouraged by the investment bubbles created by Alan Greenspan ; he knew that economic growth could not be had otherwise .
Part of what is happening today is payback for those policies .
This circumstance places both the federal government and the Federal Reserve in untenable positions , where they cannot easily or rapidly address the underlying problems , even if standard economic stimuli were available .
From the standpoint of the federal government , traditional fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts or increased federal spending have reached their practical limits , with the actual annual budget deficit running out of control at $ 4.0 - plus trillion per year .
From the Fed ’s standpoint , it can neither stimulate the economy nor contain inflation .
Lowering rates has done little to stimulate the structurally - impaired economy , and raising rates may become necessary in defense of the dollar .
Similarly , raising rates will do little to contain a non-demand driven inflation , such as seen in the current circumstance that is so heavily affected by high oil prices .
By the time hyperinflation kicks in , the economy already should be in depression , and the hyperinflation quickly should pull the economy into a great depression .
Uncontained inflation is likely to bring normal commercial activity to a halt .
Such is consistent with the final graph in this group , which shows household income dispersion at historic highs .
The greater the variance in income , the more negative are the longer term economic implications .
A person earning $ 100,000,000 per year is not going to buy that many more automobiles that someone earning $ 100,000 per year .
The stronger the middle class is , generally the stronger the economy will be .
Extremes in income variance usually are followed by financial panics and economic depressions .
U.S. Income variance today is higher than it was coming into 1929 , and it is nearly double that of any other " advanced " economy .
Hyperinflationary Great Depression
In the United States , the printing presses have not been revved up heavily , yet , but the commitments are in place , as seen in the annual GAAP - based deficit running on average more $ 4.0 trillion per year .
That amount is far beyond the ability of the government to tax or the political willingness of the government to cut entitlement spending .
While the inevitable inflationary collapse , based solely on these funding needs , could be pushed well into the next decade , actions already taken likely have set the stage for a much earlier crisis .
The current systemic bailout being worked at all costs by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government , as well as earlier efforts by the Fed to buy time , have made the circumstance worse .
Pushing recent Treasury funding needs on foreign investors — stuck with excess dollars from the ever - expanding U.S. trade deficit — has created a huge dollar overhang in the markets that already has started to crumble .
The more the crisis has been pushed into the future , the greater the potential for pending calamity has become .
Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz noted in their classic A Monetary History of the United States that the early stages of the Weimar Republic hyperinflation were accompanied by a huge influx of foreign capital , much as had happened during the U.S. Civil War .
The speculative influx of capital into the U.S. at the time of the Civil War inflation helped to stabilize the system , as the recent foreign capital influx to the United States has helped stabilize the equity and credit markets of recent years .
Following the Civil War , however , the underlying economy had significant untapped potential and was able to generate strong , real economic activity that covered the spending excesses of the war .
Post - World War I Germany was a different matter , where the country was financially and economically depleted as a penalty for losing the war .
Here , after initial benefit , the influx of foreign capital helped to destabilize the system .
" As the mark depreciated , foreigners at first were persuaded that it would subsequently appreciate and so bought a large volume of mark assets … "
Such boosted the foreign exchange value of the German mark and the value of German assets .
" As the German inflation went on , expectations were reversed , the inflow of capital was replaced by an outflow , and the mark depreciated more rapidly … ( Friedman p. 76 ) . "
The Weimar circumstance is closer to the current U.S. circumstance , although , in certain aspects , the current situation is worse .
Unlike the untapped economic potential of the United States 140 years ago , today ’s U.S. economy is languishing in the structural problems of the loss of its manufacturing base and a shift of domestic wealth offshore .
In the early 1920s , foreign investors were not propping up the world ’s reserve currency in an effort to prevent a global financial collapse , knowing in advance that they were doomed to take a large hit on their investments in Germany .
In today ’s environment , both central bank and major private investors know that the dollar is going to be a losing proposition .
They either expect and / or hope that they can get out of the dollar in time to lock in their profits , or , primarily in the case of the central banks , that they can forestall the ultimate global economic crisis .
It is this environment that leaves the U.S. dollar open to potentially such a rapid and massive decline , and dumping of U.S. Treasuries , that the Federal Reserve would be forced to monetize significant sums of Treasury debt , triggering the early phases of a monetary inflation .
In this environment annual multi-trillion dollar deficits rapidly would feed into a vicious , self - feeding cycle of currency debasement and hyperinflation .
Lack of Physical Cash .
The United States in a hyperinflation would experience the quick disappearance of cash as we know it .
Shy of the rapid introduction of a new currency and / or the highly problematic adaptation of the current electronic commerce system to new pricing realities , a barter system is the most likely circumstance to evolve for regular commerce .
Such would make much of the current electronic commerce system useless and add to what would become an ongoing economic implosion .
Some years back , I happened to be in San Francisco , having dinner with a former regional Federal Reserve Bank president and the chief economist for a large Midwestern bank .
Market rumors that day had been that there was a run on a major bank in the City by the Bay .
So I queried the regional Fed president as to what would be happening if the rumors were true .
He had had some personal experience with a run on banks in his region and explained how the Fed had a special team designed to handle such a crisis .
The biggest problem he had had was getting adequate cash to the troubled banks to cover depositors , having to fly cash in by helicopters to meet the local cash flow needs .
The troubled bank in San Francisco , however , was much larger than the example cited , and the former Fed bank president speculated that there was not enough cash in the vaults of the regional Federal Reserve Bank , let alone the entire Federal Reserve System , to cover a true run on deposits at the major bank .
Therein lies an early problem for a system headed into hyperinflation : adequate currency .
Where the Fed may hold roughly $ 210 billion in currency ( sharply increased in the last year ) outside of $ 50 billion in commercial bank vault cash , the bulk of roughly $ 780 billion in currency outside the banks is not in the United States .
Back in 2000 , the Fed estimated that 50 % to 70 % of U.S. dollar cash was outside the system .
That number probably is higher today , with perhaps as little as $ 200 billion in physical cash in circulation in the United States , or roughly 1.5 % of M3 .
The rest of the dollars are used elsewhere in the world as a store of wealth , or as an alternate currency free of the woes of unstable domestic financial conditions .
In Zimbabwe , for example , where something akin to hyperinflation is underway , U.S. dollars are used to maintain some semblance of economic activity , where wages and salaries seriously lag inflation , and goods often are available only on the black market .
Given the extremely rapid debasement of the larger denomination notes , with limited physical cash in the system , existing currency would disappear quickly as a hyperinflation broke .
For the system to continuing functioning in anything close to a normal manner , the government would have to produce rapidly an extraordinary amount of new cash , and electronic commerce would have to be able to adjust to rapidly changing prices .
In terms of cash , new bills of much higher denominations would be needed , but production lead time is a problem .
Conspiracy theories of recent years have suggested the U.S. Government already has printed a new currency of red-colored bills , intended for some dual internal and external U.S. dollar system .
If such indeed were the case , then there might be a store of " new dollars " that could be released at a 1 - to - 1,000,000 ratio , or whatever ratio was needed to make the new currency meaningful , but such would not resolve any long - term problems , unless it were part of an overall restructuring of the domestic and global financial and currency systems .
From a practical standpoint , however , currency would disappear , at least for a period of time in the early period of a hyperinflation .
Where the vast bulk of today ’s money is not physical , but electronic , however , chances of the system adapting here are virtually nil .
Think of the time , work and effort that went into preparing computer systems for Y2 K , or even problems with the recent early shift to daylight savings time .
Systems would have to be adjusted for variable , rather than fixed pricing , credit card lines would need to be expanded daily , the number of digits used in tallying dollar - denominated transactions would need to be expanded sharply .
While I have been advised that a number of businesses have accounting software that can handle any number of digits , I also noted on a recent cross-country trip that a large number of gas stations have older pumps that cannot register more than two digits ’ worth of dollars in their totals or more than $ 9.99 per gallon of gas .
From a practical standpoint , the electronic quasi - cashless society of today also would shut down early in a hyperinflation .
Unfortunately , this circumstance rapidly would exacerbate an ongoing economic collapse .
Barter System .
With standard currency and electronic payment systems non-functional , commerce quickly would devolve into black markets for goods and services and a barter system .
Unlike Zimbabwe , the United States does not have widely available , for circulation , a back - up reserve currency for use in place of a highly - inflated domestic currency .
The alternative here is in the traditional monetary precious metals .
Gold and silver both are likely to retain real value and would be exchangeable for goods and services .
Silver would help provide smaller change for less costly transactions .
Other items that would be highly barterable would include bottles of a good scotch or wine , or canned goods , for example .
Similar items that have a long shelf life can be stocked in advance of the problem , and otherwise would be consumable if the terrible inflation never came .
Separately , individuals , such as doctors and carpenters , who provide broadly useable services , would have a service to barter .
A note of caution was raised once by one of my old economics professors , who had spent part of his childhood living in a barter economy .
He told a story of how his father had traded a shirt for a can of sardines .
The father decided to open the can and eat the sardines , but he found the sardines had gone bad .
Nonetheless , the canned sardines had taken on a monetary value .
Reserves of the Necessities of Life .
Howard J. Ruff , who has been writing about these problems and issues since Nixon closed the Gold window , rightly argues that it will take some time for a barter system to be established , and suggests that individuals should build up a six - month store of goods to cover themselves and their families in the difficult times .
Mr. Ruff covers this and many other excellent fundamentals in his new book How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years in the 21st Century ( see recommended further reading at the end of this report ) .
Financial Hedges .
During these times , safety and liquidity remain key concerns for investments , as investors look to preserve their assets and wealth through what are going to be close to the most difficult of times .
In such a circumstance , gold and silver would be primary hedging tools that would retain real value and also be portable in the event of possible civil turmoil .
Also , at some point , the failure of the world ’s primary reserve currency will lead to the structuring of a new global currency system .
I would not be surprised to find gold as part of the new system , structured in there in an effort to sell the system to the public .
Real estate also would provide a basic hedge , but it lacks the portability and liquidity of gold .
Having some funds invested offshore — outside of the U.S. dollar — would be a plus in circumstances where the government might impose currency or capital controls .
While equities do provide something of an inflation hedge — revenues and profits get expressed in current dollars — they also reflect underlying economic and political fundamentals .
I still look for U.S. stocks to take an ultimate 90 % hit , peak - to - trough , net of inflation , during this period .
Where all stocks are tied to a certain extent to the broad market — to the way investors are valuing equities — such a large hit on the broad market will tend to have a dampening effect on nearly all equity prices , irrespective of the quality of a given company or a given industry .
Other Issues .
A hyperinflationary depression would be extremely disruptive to the lives , businesses and economic welfare of most individuals .
Such severe economic pain could lead to extreme political change and / or civil unrest .
What has been discussed here still has not been a comprehensive overview of all possible issues , but rather at least has raised some questions and touched upon some likely consequences .
No one can figure out better than you the peculiarities of this circumstance and how you and / or your business might be affected .
Using common sense is about the best advice I can give .
These matters will continue to be expanded upon over time in future SGSs , as circumstances and subscriber reactions continue dictate .

Advertisement Plastic waste in the oceans poses a potentially devastating long - term toxic threat to the food chain , according to marine scientists .
Studies suggest billions of microscopic plastic fragments drifting underwater are concentrating pollutants like DDT .
Most attention has focused on dangers that visible items of plastic waste pose to seabirds and other wildlife .
But researchers are warning that the risk of hidden contamination could be more serious .
The thing that 's most worrisome about the plastic is its tenaciousness , its durability
Matt Brown , US Fish and Wildlife Service
Albatross chicks
Dr Richard Thompson of the University of Plymouth has investigated how plastic degrades in the water and how tiny marine organisms , such as barnacles and sand - hoppers , respond .
He told the BBC : " We know that plastics in the marine environment will accumulate and concentrate toxic chemicals from the surrounding seawater and you can get concentrations several thousand times greater than in the surrounding water on the surface of the plastic .
" Now there 's the potential for those chemicals to be released to those marine organisms if they then eat the plastic . "
Shoreline mess
Once inside an organism , the risk is that the toxins may then be transferred into the creature itself .
At the microscopic level , plastic pollution is far worse than feared " There are different conditions in the gut environment compared to surrounding sea water and so the conditions that cause those chemicals to accumulate on the surface of the plastic may well be reversed - leading to a release of those chemicals when the plastic is eaten . "
It is as if the plastic particles act as magnets for poisons in the ocean .
In an experiment involving plastic carrier bags immersed off a jetty in Plymouth harbour , he is assessing the time taken for them to fragment .
In related projects , he and colleagues have also added plastic powder to aquarium sediment to establish how much is ingested by marine life .
Research on stretches of shoreline has shown that , at the microscopic level , plastic pollution is far worse than feared .
Dr Thompson worries toxins may be released to marine organisms
In a typical sample of the sandy material gathered at the high tide mark on shorelines , one - quarter of the total weight may be composed of plastic particles .
Studies have found that plastic traces have been identified on all seven continents .
Here on Midway , Matt Brown of the US Fish and Wildlife Service echoes the warnings of a long - term threat from plastic waste .
" The thing that 's most worrisome about the plastic is its tenaciousness , its durability .
It 's not going to go away in my lifetime or my children 's lifetimes .
" The plastic washing up on the beach today - if people do n't take it away it 'll still be here when my grandchildren walk these beaches . "

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Federal regulators have formally approved the merger of the nation ’s only two satellite radio operators in a deal closely watched by Washington and Wall Street .
Approval of Sirius Satellite Radio ’s buyout of rival XM Satellite Radio Holdings means that more than 18 million subscribers will be able to receive programming from both services .
The buyout ’s cost was about $ 3.5 billion .
Executives say it will mean huge cost savings that will lead to the first profits for the relatively nascent industry .
The Federal Communications Commission voted 3 to 2 to approve the buyout .
The tie - breaking vote , from a Republican commissioner , Deborah Taylor Tate , came when the companies agreed to pay $ 19.7 million to the federal Treasury to settle F.C.C. rule violations .
The commission ’s chairman , Kevin J. Martin , confirmed the final vote on Friday night .
The long - running regulatory review was closely watched by exasperated investors eager for a resolution as well as satellite radio customers with questions about what effect the merger would have on their service .

While I have blogged before about the ridiculous sexism of American Apparel CEO and founder Dov Charney , I was hoping not to have to repeat myself .
Unfortunately , aging hipster Charney has been sued — yet again — by a female employee .
Former product placement executive Jeneleen Floyd has sued 38 - year - old Charney for screaming at her and demanding she “ pretend to masturbate ” in front of coworkers .
Floyd declined , but a different employee simulated masturbation while Charney pretended to engage in an oral sex act with him .
According to the lawsuit filed last week , Charney verbally castigated Floyd during off - work hours and demanded she work until midnight as retribution for her actions .
Floyd is just the newest member of a rapidly growing sorority , having filed the fifth suit against American Apparel for sexually explicit offenses .
Though so far no one has had a jury trial against American Apparel , Charney has freely admitted he uses words like “ slut ” and “ c*nt ” around the office , saying that they ’re not necessarily meant pejoratively : “ some of us love sluts , ” he said in a recent deposition .
He ’s also open about conducting meetings in his underwear and posting pornographic magazine images in his stores .
Sad to say , I will not be able to buy any candy - colored , American Apparel socks or t- shirts .
I ’d love to , since they ’re made in the US and are sweat - shop free .
But I just ca n’t understand why Charney can respect the women who work in his factories , but not the ones in his offices .
VHeadline editor & publisher Roy S. Carson writes : Recently , Venezuela 's National Assembly ( Congress ) president ( speaker ) Cilia Flores got into a fret over reporting in the ( admittedly anti-government )
Venezuelan newspapers that the august body of legislators , rather than fighting corruption was actually a hotbed of nepotism .
The very word " nepotism " sent her into a tizzy demanding that the media make immediate retractions of the calumny ... despite the fact that she , herself , is the wife of Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro ( and ultimately third in line to the presidency of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the event that the ' gringoes ' succeed in wiping out both Chavez and his Veep.
Ramon Carrizales ) .
Besides that , in reports published widely and defiantly on July 9 , Flores had managed to place relatives in as many as nine of sixty permanent positions at the National Assembly ... three brothers / sisters , two nephews , a cousin , the mother of that cousin , her mother - in - law and an aunt !
Of course , she denies that any of her relatives have special benefits from their paid employment at the Legislature and , according to her , that means there is NO nepotism .
While a Venezuela Country Profile published on the Internet also advises that " nepotism an accepted practice and is considered a good thing , since it implies that employing people one knows and trusts is of primary importance " , the new climate of dog -eats - dog in Venezuela 's black versus white political madness does n't let established custom get in the way of blatant butchery .
Questions are being asked if it is a general design to put a stranglehold on career diplomacy or if value is to be seen and accorded to diplomatic professionals who put store by representing the whole 25 + million in Venezuela 's population and their desires for a very much better future .
Seen from a perspective of Washington DC 's jaundiced view of all things Venezuelan , it is looking a gift horse in the mouth .
While the majority of civil servants in North America and Europe et.al .
know and are guarded by a line in the sand separating administrational duties from political machinations , the problem for Venezuela lies in the fact that , in the event of an alternative presidency at some time in the future , looking inevitably beyond Chavez ' tenure at Miraflores , it will be not just the Ministerial line - up that 'll change overnight but there 'll be wholesale slaughter among the civil service rank and file ... and that 'll be far from being " civil " as we might know it !

The threat of antibiotic resistance is nothing to scoff at : The World Health Organization predicts ( pdf ) that some diseases , including malaria , tuberculosis , and pneumonia , could have “ no effective therapies within the next 10 years . ”
Indeed , 70 percent of hospital - acquired bacterial infections in the United States — which kill 90,000 Americans a year — are resistant to at least one drug , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
But scientists are working hard to find more potent antibiotics , and they are uncovering them in the strangest of places , from alligators ’ veins to cholesterol drugs .
1 Gator Blood Alligators fight off infections far better than humans do , perhaps due to an adaptation that promotes rapid wound healing .
Recent lab tests show that tiny amounts of alligator blood extract — some scientists call it alligacin — kill many microbes , including Methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) , and help fight HIV .
2 Frog Skin Last year Italian scientists isolated short proteins called antimicrobial peptides from frog skin and tested them on strains of multidrug - resistant bacteria .
The peptides not only killed bacteria directly , but also ramped up the host immune system to help clear infections more quickly .
The peptides are so fragile that they rapidly break down in blood ; the researchers nevertheless found one that killed five bacterial species in the presence of blood .
Among the affected microorganisms were three that commonly cause deadly hospital - acquired infections , including Staphylococcus aureus and two emerging bacterial pathogens , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii , that are a growing cause of infections in hospital intensive - care units .
3 Synthetic Molecules Researchers at Northwestern University recently engineered versions of antimicrobial peptides to make them more resilient .
Called peptoids , these synthetic molecules are stronger than natural peptides , last longer in the body , and are cheaper to produce .
When the scientists added them to cultures of six bacteria known to cause food poisoning , pneumonia , hospital - acquired infections , and ear and heart infections , the peptoids wiped them all out .
4 Focused phages
If bacteria evolve to become drug resistant , why not subject them to bacteria - fighting microbes , called phages , that evolve along with them ?
When ingested or topically applied , phages cure infections but leave the rest of the body and “ good ” bacteria alone .
So - called phage therapy is widely used in Eastern Europe and is currently undergoing one U.S. clinical trial .
Since phages have evolved with their bacterial targets for billions of years , they could solve the problem of antibiotic resistance for good ; the downside is that each bacterial strain requires its own tailored phage cocktail , so it could be many years before doctors have a suitably broad range of phages at their disposal .
5 Cholesterol Drugs MRSA bacteria produce an antioxidant that helps destroy toxic free radicals generated in the infection - fighting process .
The antioxidant , scientists found , is produced through a process similar to one used by humans to manufacture cholesterol .
Thus , researchers wonder whether cholesterol - lowering compounds might act as a new sort of antibiotic .
Mice given the drug and then infected with MRSA had 98 percent less bacteria than mice not given the drug .
You might not expect it from one of the loudest , scariest and most stubborn bands in rock , but today Metallica said " sorry " .
Sort of .
After being criticised for ordering journalists to take down reviews of tracks from their as - yet - untitled new album , the heavy metallers posted a statement on their website blaming the whole farrago on their management .
Their statement reads : " We were informed that someone at Q Prime ( our managers ) had made the error of asking a few publications to take down reviews of the rough mixes from the new record that were posted on their sites .
Our response was ' WHY ?!!!
Why take down mostly positive reviews of the new material and prevent people from getting psyched about the next record ... that makes no sense to us ! ' "
The furore began when a bunch of journalists were invited to an album playback last week .
Weirdly - and we really do n't know what the hell they were thinking about here - some of these journalists then went and wrote about it .
Crazy , is n't it ?
Anyway , someone did n't like it up above , and word was sent out demanding all reviews be taken down on sites such as Kerrang and Metal Hammer .
They even went after blogs such as The Quietus .
" Q Prime were obviously only doing what they thought was best for the band , but sometimes you just have to step away from the espresso machine , take a deep breath and realise that you can't stage manage the entire worldwide media , " said Quietus editor John Doran .
It would seem that the band agree .
Their statement goes on to claim that they have since treated Q Prime to a " managerial ear spank " which sounds rather scary , although not as scary as " managerial ear spunk " which is how the Guardian Music team read it the first time around .
Anyhow , the band have now resolved the problem by linking to the sites cheeky enough to , er , praise the band 's new record .
The UK Ministry of Defence has told parliament that it has lost or had stolen some 87 USB sticks holding " protectively marked " - ie classified - material since 2003 .
However , almost all the devices were marked at the lowest grade of classification , and even the remaining few are unlikely to have contained information of any significance .
According to a written parliamentary answer by Defence minister Bob Ainsworth on Wednesday , which can be viewed here , 81 of the devices held " Restricted " data .
Restricted is a blanket classification which the MoD tends to use for almost any document it generates ; marking something " Unclassified " - free for anyone to look at - runs against the Ministry 's institutional culture .
" Restricted " is so overused that it is meaningless , effectively the same as Unclassified ( unless perhaps accompanied by an additional handling caveat indicating that there might be privacy issues , as in the case of individuals ' promotion reports ) .
One further USB stick , lost in 2006 , held " Confidential " data , the next level up .
This is n't really much different from Restricted , though such documents are supposed to be more securely held and handled .
You 're supposed to shred Confidential hard copies rather than just chuck them in the bin , for instance .
Even so , this kind of info can be freely discussed with families and even friends in many cases .
Five further sticks were marked " Secret " , which is theoretically the penultimate level of UK classification .
In fact , so profligate is the use of the Restricted and Confidential labels that Secret information is generally more like what you would expect Restricted to be - things you 'd like to keep mainly in - house but you are n't going to make a big deal about it .
Actual important secret stuff starts to appear at the Top Secret level , but the MoD is n't admitting to having lost any of that .
TS is the highest grade of protective marking , but in fact it has many subdivisions and add - ons which typically require special , extra vetting and clearances .
Then there are national caveats : any TS info which is n't also marked at the very least " UK / US / AUS / CAN / NZ Eyes Only " is probably not all that exciting .
You would n't normally let le tout NATO see anything very hot .
So , if we 're to believe the MoD , they have n't really lost anything of significance on USB sticks in the last few years .
However , one does note that Mr Ainsworth says " the figures ... continue to be adjusted as a result of additional thefts and losses along with subsequent clarification of historic incidents " ; and that most of the missing sticks were apparently stolen in just one year , 2006 .
This suggests that actually this information is more than a little bit incomplete .
All in all , though , the MoD has created a problem for itself here where none needed to exist .
If it were n't so institutionally prone to unnecessarily marking things as secrets , it could have stood up in Parliament and said " we have n't lost any protectively marked thumb drives at all " . ®
Industry Minister Jim Prentice and Canadian Heritage Minister Josee Verner introduced Bill C-61 % u2013 the Canadian DMCA %u2013 earlier this morning .
It is apparent that the worst fears of thousands of Canadians - over 42,000 as of this date on this group alone - have been realized .
If enacted , the Canadian DMCA will leave Canada with one of the most restrictive copyright laws for the digital environment in the world .
Far from providing assistance to the digital marketplace , this law will have a stifling effect on creativity , innovation , consumer rights , and free speech in Canada .
We , the undersigned residents of Canada draw attention of the House to the following :
THAT the Copyright Act is properly recognised as being a careful balance between the rights of creators and the rights of the public ( including viewers , readers and listeners ) ;
THAT the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously affirmed this view in CCH Canadian Ltd v Law Society of Upper Canada ;
THAT digital technologies have recently given copyright holders the ability to upset the balance in the Copyright Act by preventing Canadians from accessing works for purposes that have been legally granted to them ;
THAT the creation of original works is nourished by wide accessibility of earlier works , including a vibrant public domain ;
THAT dissemination of cultural ideas requires that they be preserved in a form that is accessible to future generations ; and
THAT historically consultations regarding changes to the Copyright Act have mostly taken place with creators , intermediaries and only some special users ( such as educators and librarians )
THEREFORE , your petitioners call upon Parliament to ensure generally that users are recognised as interested parties and are meaningfully consulted about proposed changes to the Copyright Act and to ensure in particular that any changes at least preserve all existing users ' rights , including the right to use copyrighted materials under Fair Dealing and the right to make private copies of audio recordings .
We further call upon Parliament not to extend the term of copyright ; and to recognise the right of citizens to personally control their own communication devices .

Escape rooms are rising in their popularity .
Basically , they are a physical adventure game where players are required to solve different puzzles by making use of hints , clues as well as strategy so as to be able to complete set out objectives .
Usually , the player has a time limit set in which he needs to have unveiled the ploy hidden within the rooms .
There are different locations where the game can be set and it includes space stations , dungeons and even prison cells and so on .escape room Boise
This kind of game set is quite popular in different parts of the globe .
There are areas that have got permanent escape rooms .
Escape room enthusiasts follow the games all over so as to enjoy the thrill that comes with it .
This kind of game usually has teams of around six to twelve players .
They are required to manipulate and use the surroundings so as to achieve the set goals .
The spaces are themed in a certain way so as to challenge and thrill participants to endeavor to work together .
In escape rooms , the players are needed to utilize all their senses .
They need to use their ears , eyes , brains and the entire body so as to be able to decide all the clues left .
There is no need to know anything in particular .
Even very young children can participate .
What they entail
Escape rooms are usually based on a theme where one needs to escape .
Most times , the time is set at one hour .
This kind of setup has become a phenomenon worldwide and they have captured corporate marketers as well as researchers at universities .
This game allows people to interact .
People leave the screens so as to engage in a face to face kind of adventure .
There are so many challenges that you can encounter at such rooms and every member of the team can try their best to be the hero .
All the participants in the game are expected to bring something to the table that will aid the whole team to finish the game in time and escape .
The games are usually designed so well and it is up to the team to actually find ways in which they can circumvent the puzzles as a set .
Different teams handle the challenges in a different way .
Some choose to make it look chaotic as the rooms are turned upside down .
Those who use this tactic claim that it is done as a way of finding the clues after all the puzzles have been gathered .
Sometimes making mistakes is common with such games .
The clues can be anywhere within the room so the team needs to stay alert and keen with all the items around .
Stories and themes are greatly emphasized in this kind of game .
You need to really get into it so as to enjoy the game and be able to find all the clues .
The clues are all connected and that is how you should treat all of them .
There are people who have created games that have got world famous due to their creativity and challenge level .
Players feel rather fulfilled when they are able to solve the game .
Today at lunch , I had a conversation with Kevin Hurwitz about developer tendencies .
Kevin related a project he consulted on .
He came in after over a million dollars had already been spent by the client , and he found the following :
Not a single feature had been delivered ( save a few half - finished screens )
The team had spent all the time creating an application framework that , when finished , would make the application practically create itself .
The development manager was the one who instigated the framework frenzy , and was eventually fired .
Clients typically engage us for actual software .
A client is n’t interested in software that can be used to create software ( frameworks ) .
They have a problem , and a software system can help them solve the problem .
I , along with Kevin , have encountered the common mindset of falling from application mode into framework mode .
I find it ’s common with really smart programmers who take pride in their technical ability .
Creating frameworks is fun because the programmer is the customer of the framework .
Writing software for yourself can be more fun than writing software for someone else .
Writing a framework is writing software for yourself .
On a client ’s dime , this is typically not acceptable .
The customer needs to see the software come to life before his eyes .
Every week , the customer need to see new features working .
Playing devil ’s advocate : _If_ it were possible to create the magic framework that would make the application practically write itself , communication is key , and it ’s a bet , a strategy , an approach .
If this were possible , and you ’d successfully done it time and time again for many clients , then it should be discussed with the client beforehand .
Ultimately , the framework becomes property of the paying client , so the client ought to know what is happening , and the client needs to be ok with it .
Back to reality : Frameworks are better harvested from several applications that ended up using similar patterns .
Writing a framework before an application is BDUF ( big design up front ) .
There are so many assumptions that go into the framework that some of them are bound to be wrong .
The real , repeatable satisfaction .
With many programmers preferring framework development , a client - centered process can bring joy in working on the client ’s application .
Delivering new builds of the software frequently will please the client , and that level of customer service brings satisfaction back the other way .
There is nothing better than an elated client who loves what he sees unfolding before him .
What about all the common junk that the application needs ?
Chances are that there are already libraries that satisfy your needs .
Data access .
logging , authentication , caching , indexing , builds , UI controls , etc .
There are both commercial and open - source offerings that make great buy vs. build decisions .
For the needs that do n’t have offerings yet , do it first , then when the exact same need comes up again , it will be easy to create a library that satisfies this common need now that you know _exactly_ what the need is .

In this post I 'll have a look at how much gas Australia has and how long it will last under a variety of scenarios - from an indefinite continuation of the current rate of production to a pell - mell conversion to use gas for all our energy needs combined with a rapid expansion of LNG exports .
The view of the Australian government and gas industry seems to be that our gas supplies are essentially unlimited , with the phrase " more than a century of supplies left " bandied about at every opportunity .
Ex -Prime Minister John Howard used to dream of Australia becoming an " energy superpower " , with a vastly expanded gas ( LNG ) export industry being a cornerstone of this vision , based on Western Australian LNG exports from offshore gas fields .
Last year I took a look at the question " Should Natural Gas Be Used To Power New Zealand ? " , after reading an article from NZ PEPA executive John Pfahlert arguing that New Zealand should be building new gas fired power stations instead of trying to become carbon neutral , and concluded that this seemed a rather risky strategy - depending on continuing offshore exploration success .
In the lead up to the Australian election last year , the APPEA ( Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association ) was also arguing that gas should be our fuel of choice for power generation as we transition away from coal to a clean energy future , an idea which received a limited amount of support from Labor during the campaign .
Since the election , the APPEA has continued to promote the vision of a gas fuelled power industry , recommending that at least 70 per cent of new electricity generating stations constructed in Australia to be fuelled by natural gas by 2017 and maintaining that " Australia 's vast reserves of clean , natural gas are the key to meeting the nation 's energy needs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining economic wellbeing " .
New Energy Minister Martin Ferguson also views natural gas as the key to Australia 's energy security for liquid fuels , in the form of gas to liquids ( GTL - as well as its more environmentally unfriendly cousin , coal to liquids , or CTL ) and compressed natural gas ( CNG ) .
The view that CNG is a way to reduce our consumption of foreign oil is quite a common one , judging by some of the comments made on TOD ANZ - and elsewhere - from time to time .
The thing that strikes me as being rather quaint , to put it mildly , is that we pay anywhere from about $ 8 billion to $ 25 billion to import the oil and we get a paltry $ 4 billion for the gas that we sell to overseas countries .
It seems odd to me , especially given gas is a superior fuel for many , many purposes including the use in motor vehicles - Ollie Clark , Natural Gas Vehicle Association
Recently Western Australia has announced that it will build a new coal fired power station to meet growing energy demand , ruling out a natural gas fueled plant because of supply shortages .
This situation which seems to be at odds with both the APPEA 's recommendation and with the notion that we have so much natural gas that we can not only be a large LNG exporter but also use it to fuel both our power plants and our transportation system , along with more traditional domestic and industrial uses .
Australian Natural Gas Reserves
Most of the data in this section was sourced from a paper published earlier this year by Mike Roarty of the Parliamentary Library research section on " Australia ’s natural gas : issues and trends " , and Brian Fleay 's paper " Natural Gas , " Magic Pudding " or Depleting Resource " ( pdf ) , which in turn used data from the Geoscience Australia " Oil & Gas Resources of Australia 2004 " ( pdf ) report .
Where newer information has been available I 've linked to the source ( more often than not either The Australian 's Nigel Wilson or Bloomberg 's Angela McDonald - Smith , who do the most comprehensive coverage of local energy news ) .
Cooper Basin -
The largest onshore conventional gas reserves occur in the Cooper / Eromanga Basins in north - east South Australia and south - west Queensland .
This source currently supplies much of the domestic eastern Australian gas market ( South Australia , the Australian Capital Territory , New South Wales , and Queensland ) , but is mature and now depleting rapidly .
Bass Strait - Victoria and Tasmania are primarily supplied by the Gippsland Basin offshore from south east Victoria , with a newer development in the area , the Kipper field , expected to come online in 2011 .
There have also been new developments in the Bass and Otway Basins offshore south western Victoria - including the Yolla , Minerva , Casino , Geographe and Thylacine fields .
In recent years , BHP have upgraded their estimated of Bass Strait gas reserves , with the Gippsland Basin thought to still contain around 7 tcf of gas .
The older fields in the south east are expected to have run down by 2020 , but the newer developments in Bass Strait should extend that date out by another decade .
North West WA - Carnarvon and Browse Basins -
Over 90 per cent of the reserves are located offshore from northwest Western Australia ( Carnarvon and Browse Basins ) and in the Timor Sea to the north of Australia ( Bonaparte Basin ) - far away from the primary domestic gas markets in the south east .
The Carnarvon Basin is home to the existing North West Shelf gas fields - with the Gorgon / Jansz fields being the largest in the country .
The area includes a number of fields supplying gas into the domestic gas network , particularly for use by the mining industry .
Besides the existing North West Shelf gas project , other planned new LNG projects in the area include the Pluto ( at the early stages of construction ) , Gorgon , Wheatstone and Scarborough fields .
The Browse Basin is the most active new frontier , with the area seeing successful exploration in recent years - reserves figure for Inpex 's Ichthys field recently being upgraded by 3.3 tcf to 12.8 tcf of gas , for example .
Woodside 's planned Browse LNG development is also in this basin .
Northern Territory - Bonaparte Basin / Timor Sea -
The area between the Northern Territory and East Timor is the other region currently producing significant amounts of gas ( and oil ) with an LNG plant recently starting operation in Darwin and other fields being considered for development .
The division of gas revenues from the region between East Timor and Australia has been the subject of a lot of controversy over the years , which has contributed to continuing delays in developing the Greater Sunrise field .
Papua New Guinea -
For many years it appeared that a gas pipeline would be built between Papua New Guinea and Australia , enabling east coast gas markets to access the gas reserves held by PNG ( estimates range from 14 tcf to 40 tcf ) .
Hopes of this occurring were still flickering as recently as the beginning of the year , however Oil Search and ExxonMobil have now decided to develop an LNG plant instead , making any future pipeline project very unlikely .
How Much Gas Do We Have ?
As at 1 January 2005 , Australia ’s Category 1 and 2 reserves totalled around 144 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , according to the Geoscience Australia report , a slight decline on the previous year .
According to the Financial Times ( quoting PFC Energy ) , Australia has so far produced only about 15 per cent of its gas resources , compared with 25 per cent for Norway and more than 80 per cent for the US ’s lower 48 onshore reserves .
Whereas US production has peaked ( and Norway ’s is expected to peak within a matter of years ) Australian production is expected to expand until 2030 .
Basin Reserves ( 2005 ) Carnarvon 80.6 tcf Browse 33 tcf Bonaparte 22.9 tcf Gippsland 7 tcf Otway 2.4 tcf Cooper / Eromanga 1.9 tcf Others 2.5 tcf Total 150 tcf
The table above has been adjusted to include the reserves revisions I 've noticed since 2005 - Gippsland Basin from 3.1 to 7 tcf and Browse Basin from 30 tcf to 33 tcf ( if you know of any others , please leave a comment ) .
Since then , based on an annual consumption rate of around 1.8 tcf , we have consumed around 5.4 tcf of gas , which would bring the current reserves number back down to around 144 tcf .
To put the Australian figure in context , proven world gas reserves are estimated to be over 6200 tcf - Australia has around 1.4 % of the total .
How do we use the gas ?
In the domestic market , gas is primarily used for :
1. Manufacturing ( 36 % of the total ) - smelting , fertilisers , plastics and glass / brick / cement production
2. Power generation ( 32 % )
3. Mining ( 13 % )
4. Residential use ( 12 % ) - water heating , space heating and cooking
Obviously these will be joined by transportation if Mr Ferguson 's plans for GTL / CNG are put into practice , and power generation will increase in importance if the APPEA 's suggestions are implemented .
The fertiliser industry is an interesting one - globally the industry seems to be migrating towards natural gas supplies , particularly in the middle east , but also to Western Australia , where the Burrup plant now produces around 6 % of the world 's tradeable ammonia .
The rest of our gas goes to the export market , in the form of LNG ( plus some condensate ) .
At present , there are 2 LNG plants in operation - the North West Shelf gas project ( operated by Woodside Energy ) near Karratha in WA , and the ConocoPhillips Darwin LNG plant in the Northern Territory .
The North West Shelf project is the third largest LNG exporter in the world , with its fifth LNG train due to commence operation this year , bringing the capacity of the plant to 16.3 million tonnes ( 0.85 tcf ) .
A number of other projects are underway , in planning or actively under consideration - the table below lists all Australian LNG projects ( using conventional gas ) .
Project Operator Location Yearly Capacity Fields Start Date ( Est ) North West Shelf Woodside Karratha , WA 0.85 tcf 22 tcf Existing Bayu Undan ConocoPhillips Darwin , NT 0.17 tcf 4 tcf Existing Pluto Woodside Karratha , WA 0.22 tcf 5 tcf 2010 Browse Woodside TBD 0.5 tcf 18 tcf 2015 Gorgon Chevron Barrow Island 0.8 tcf 40 tcf 2012 Ichthys Inpex Kimberly ( TBD ) 0.3 tcf 12.8 tcf 2013 Sunrise Woodside Floating 0.26 tcf 9 tcf 2015 Scarborough BHP Billiton Floating 0.3 tcf 11 tcf 2015 Wheatstone Chevron Karratha 0.24 tcf 4.5 tcf TBD Evans Shoal MEO Australia Tassie Shoal 0.13 tcf 6.6 tcf TBD Total 3.7 tcf 132 tcf
Australian LNG exports currently rank in the top 3 globally , however looking at new projects around the world , you can see that Australia 's LNG exports will shrink in importance as projects in Qatar , Iran and Russia , in particular , start to deliver large volumes of LNG .
Political Factors
As I noted in the preamble , Western Australia recently opted to build a new coal fired power station instead of using gas as originally planned , due to the shortage of gas in the south of the state .
The WA domestic gas shortage has resulted in a local pressure group called the " DomGas Alliance " being formed to try and force the oil and gas companies holding offshore leases to either develop the fields or relinquish the leases - a move the APPEA oddly claims would " discourage exploration " .
Martin Ferguson has also backed the " use it or lose it " idea , though he has apparently already been called in for a " quiet chiding " over this issue by the APPEA .
The APPEA is also unhappy about the state passing a law to force developers of LNG plants to set aside 15 % of their reserves for domestic consumption , which is the only sign of the Export Land Model making any form of appearance for Australian energy production - and a pretty feeble one at that .
A planned expansion of the pipeline from Dampier to Bunbury should partly alleviate the gas supply issue by 2010 , though in the short term an explosion at Apache Energy 's Varanus Island plant has left the state gasping for gas , particularly the mining industry .
This outage is expected to take months to repair .
One interesting side effect of the WA law is that BHP is considering building a floating LNG plant for the Scarborough and Thebe fields , partly to avoid these sorts of regulations .
Woodside have also been considering a floating platform for the greater Sunrise project , again in part to avoid any political risks associated with a plant in East Timor .
The only other form of notable state government intervention in the sector is the Queensland government 's " smart energy policy " which mandates that 18 % of power consumed in the state come from gas by 2020 ( up from the earlier 13 % target ) .
The recent federal budget eliminated a tax break for condensate production by the North West Shelf venture , prompting an expression of annoyance from Woodside CEO Don Voelte .
At the time it was rumoured the industry would probably see the money returned via incentives for GTL production or faster development of LNG projects .
This has duly happened , with Ferguson kicking off a review of the tax system by Treasury secretary Ken Henry that will " include an assessment of the barriers to investment in large - scale downstream gas processing projects in Australia , the particular hurdles faced by remote gas developers , and consideration of the future policy framework for new sunrise industry development in the gas sector , including new LNG , gas - to - liquids and domestic gas projects " .
The point of tax breaks is n't clear to me , given that the primary constraints on development of LNG projects in Australia are firstly finding a customer who will sign up for a long term supply deal and secondly availability of skilled labour and service companies - neither of which will be altered in the slightest .
It may perhaps encourage the development of a GTL project which might otherwise be unviable as a standalone LNG project though , such as Wheatstone .
The most obvious impact of the LNG export industry on the local gas market has been to push gas prices up , as the market is exposed to international supply and demand forces rather than purely local ones .
Western Australia has already seen this ( Santos CEO David Knox saying prices are headed for " LNG parity " ) and the same thing seems likely to occur on the east coast .
Another impact of the LNG export industry is that it will further increase the nation 's dependence on income from fossil fuel exports .
Coal is currently our major export earner , which has prompted concern about Australia suffering from what is known as " The Dutch Disease " - the theory that an increase in revenues from natural resources will deindustrialise a nation ’s economy by raising the exchange rate , which makes the manufacturing sector less competitive .
The term was coined in 1977 by The Economist to describe the decline of the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands after the discovery of natural gas in the 1960s .
With the value of gas exports likely to rise to a similar level to that of coal if all the planned LNG projects go ahead , we could see more than a quarter of national GNP coming from these 2 industries .
How long will the gas last ?
According to the Parliamentary Library report , our resources are " capable of sustaining our future production and exports well into and probably throughout the 21st Century " .
While the paper was published on April 1 , it appears to be serious .
Australia ’s natural gas consumption for 2005 – 2006 amounted to 1,184 PJ .
Additionally , exports in that year were 12.5 million tonnes ( Mt ) of LNG equivalent to 685 PJ - a total of 1,869 PJ ( equivalent to around 1.77 tcf ) .
Given the reserves and resources figure quoted of 144 tcf , this would mean our gas supplies would last for 81 years at the current rate of consumption .
One complicating factor is the use of biogas .
According to the ESAA renewable sources of gas ( primarily landfill gas ) comprise about 16 per cent of Australia ’s domestic gas use - which would equate to around 189 PJ ( or 0.18 tcf ) .
Taking this into account , supplies under this simplistic scenario would last around 90 years - roughly the " end of the century " timeframe mentioned in the Parliamentary Library report .
Of course , neither domestic consumption nor exports are expected to remain static , so let 's consider a few additional scenarios .
Note - as these scenarios are just examples , I have n't been particularly rigorous in running the numbers - they should be accurate to within 5 % or so .
Please bear this in mind if you feel the urge to nitpick - however if you can see any gross errors in the calculations please feel free to derive some alternate figures and explain them in the comments - its entirely possible the conversion factors have gone badly awry in the more complicated scenarios .
Scenario 1 - Increasing domestic demand and exports until 2020 , remaining stable thereafter
The figure above shows the forecast growth in production from ABARE and the ESAA - continuing growth in domestic gas use and a sizeable expansion of LNG export capacity .
By 2020 , production is expected to reach 4500 PJ per year ( or 4.3 tcf ) .
Allowing for biogas production at the same rate as today , this would mean natural gas supplies would last until 2046 - approximately 38 years .
Scenario 2 - Increasing domestic demand to 2030 , static LNG exports from 2020
If domestic gas use continues to expand at the rate shown above , we 'd expect to be using 2000 PJ per year for domestic purposes .
Assuming no new LNG plants are built after 2020 , we would be producing almost 5000 PJ per year ( or 4.75 tcf ) .
Again , allowing for biogas production at the same rate as today , this would mean natural gas supplies would last until 2044 - approximately 36 years .
Scenario 3 - Increasing domestic demand and exports until 2020 ( then stable ) , GTL / CNG for all transportation from 2020
As our energy minister is a strong advocate of using gas for transportation , it is worthwhile considering what would happen if the vehicle fleet was switched over to use CNG and GTL products , combined with scenario 1 for domestic use and exports .
Kiashu was kind enough to try and work out how much gas it would take to replace our current consumption of petrol and diesel , and came up with this set of calculations :
Petrol usually has about 34.6 MJ per litre .
Natural gas here in Australia is 38.87 MJ per cubic metre at atmospheric pressure .
Both vary a bit , obviously , but we can use this for some guesstimates .
So we see that 1lt petrol is equivalent in energy to 34.6/38.87 = 0.89m3 natural gas .
An ABS survey [ pdf - http://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/0/12594B5543CA578CCA2571E2001C705D/$File/9208055005_2006.pdf] tells us that petrol use is a bit uncertain , figures are within about 10 % only , but nowadays it 's about 20 Glt annually [ numbered pp78 , pdf p13 - 14 ] .
20
Glt petrol is equivalent in energy to 17.8 Gm3 of natural gas .
However , the natural gas must be compressed to 200 - 220 atmospheres - call it 210 .
As with the air car , this takes energy .
The energy E required to compress air at 25C is , E = 110,000 x ln ( P1/P2 ) /m3/mol
There are 44.74 moles of methane in 1m3 of natural gas - natural gas is usually about 95 % methane , and 5 % carbon dioxide , propane , butane , sulphides and so on .
Let 's assume it 's all methane to save ourselves the headaches .
We 're compressing it to 210 times atmospheric pressure , so P1=210 and P2=1 , so the energy required to compress 1m3 of natural gas into CNG will be , E = 110,000 x ln ( 210 ) = 588,181J = 0.59 MJ 0.59 MJ is 0.59/38.87 = 1.5 % of the energy of the natural gas .
So turning NG into CNG uses 1.5 % of the energy content .
Put the other way , you only get 98.5 % of the energy from CNG you would from burning NG directly .
Thus , 20 Glt petrol is equivalent , after compression of NG into CNG , to 18.07Gm3 of NG ( not a typo - we do n't care about the volume of the CNG , only the NG feedstock ) I do n't know about CNG efficiency compared to petrol and diesel .
If that 's lower or higher it'll obviously affect how much natural gas we need .
But we can say that a figure somewhere on the cricket pitch is 18 billion cubic metres of natural gas to replace the 20 Glt of petrol we use these days .
...
Hmmm , actually the ABS here says that in 2006 total fuel use was 16.3 Glt petrol + 5.74 Glt diesel = 22 Glt .
Must be more than 22 Glt by now ... but you can take the conversion factor of lt petrol ---> m3 natural gas of 100 % --> 90 % as being about right .
For every 1
Glt fuel you replace you want 900 M m3 of natural gas .
By my calculations , 900 million m3 of gas equates to 32 billion cubic feet of gas ( or 0.032 tcf ) .
So for 22 Glt of fuel , we are looking at 0.7 tcf of gas per year for the present day vehicle fleet .
If we assume the fuel consumption of the national vehicle fleet remains static , and it suddenly switches from petrol and diesel to CNG / GTL in 2020 , we'd be consuming 5 tcf per year minus biogas .
This means natural gas supplies would last until 2042 - approximately 34 years ( ie . the new gas powered vehicle fleet could be used for just over 20 years before we had to junk it and replace it with electric transportation ) .
Scenario 4 - Increasing domestic demand and exports until 2020 ( then stable ) , domestic gas use for all new power generation
As noted in the preamble , the APPEA is keen for us to transition to cleaner energy source by using gas for power generation until we get finally around to replacing coal ( the dominant source at present ) with renewable energy sources .
Doing the numbers ( with some input from kiashu again ) , natural gas contains around 38.8 MJ / m3 , or 10.78 Kwh .
Our natural gas reserves of 144 tcf ( 4077 billion cubic metres ) could therefore generate 43,950 billion Kwh ( or 3.26 tcf per trillion Kwh ) - at 100 % efficiency .
Modern natural gas plants manage around 55 % efficiency in the turbines , so if we allow for another 5 % loss in the system we 'll end up with about 23,000 billion Kwh ( or 6.26 tcf per trillion Kwh ) .
National electricity generation in 2006 was 255 billion Kwh .
Historically , electricity generation has been increasing at around 3 % pa .
Assuming that we generate all new power from gas , natural gas supplies would last until 2043 - approximately 35 years ( ie . the new - and old - gas fired generation capacity could be used for just over 30 years before we had to junk it and replace it with renewables as well ) .
Conclusion
There are a myriad of scenarios that could be applied ( try working out one where the export land model applies to our gas exports for example , which would increase the timeframes somewhat , or one where exports keep increasing after 2020 , which would significantly decrease the timeframes ) , but I think its safe to assume that if we start treating natural gas as a silver bullet we will run out in less than 40 years - with gas fired power for new generation being much less intensive in its use of gas than using GTL / CNG for transport .
One factor which may slow the rate of extraction is the inability of the industry to develop projects as quickly as it might like - Woodside has pointed out that the supply of skilled labour simply is n't sufficient to develop the pipeline of projects as fast as the industry would like .
The X Factors - What Other Sources Of Gas Do We Have ?
In the scenarios outlined above I 've used our current known gas reserves as the total supply available .
There are a number of ways of further increasing ( or extending the use of ) our gas supplies :
1. " Just find more "
Martin Ferguson 's preferred approach to oil and gas depletion is apparently to " just find more " .
This is n't totally out of the question of course - the recent expansion of " Australia " to include all of the continental shelf ( see pdf map here ) will no doubt include more oil and gas - but how many more years worth is an open question .
The APPEA argues that Australia has 50 sedimentary basins , of which just 12 are producing oil and gas ( 4 basins have been deemed non-commercial ) and that there is still potential for drilling in little explored areas .
Acsording to a recent report , only 17 per cent of Australia 's offshore sedimentary basins and 26 per cent of potentially prospective onshore basins are covered by petroleum permits " .
How much potential there is depends on your view of exploration programs .
If you think that exploration is now a well understood science , and that companies target the most likely areas when exploring , then you 'd assume that there is n't a great deal of gas left to be found .
If , on the other hand , you think that exploration is similar to roulette ( the cynical view ) , or that governments and oil companies wish to restrain discovery and production ( the conspiratorial view ) then there may be much more - maybe twice as much as has currently been discovered .
The safest assumption to make is the first one .
2. Efficiency improvements
There are some obvious areas of improvement that could be made to reduce gas usage on the power generation and domestic use front .
A number concentrated solar thermal plants under construction are combined with gas fired power to reduce total gas consumption ( though obviously the long term direction for these plants is to burn no fossil fuels at all ) .
Another mechanism for improving the efficiency of gas usage in power generation is cogeneration ( capturing energy from waste heat , which is already done by some large scale industrial users , is another useful technique ) .
Usage of gas in plastic production could be reduced in some cases by producing bioplastic instead .
Finally , usage of gas for water heating could be reduced or even eliminated using solar hot water heaters .
3. Biogas
As noted earlier , biogas is already providing a proportion of our gas production .
Getting a handle on just how much gas could be produced from biomass is quite difficult , but if you consider that methane from waste bananas alone could power a town of around 25,000 people , there is obviously quite a lot of potential .
If you read the preceding link you 'll see that the German Greens have proposed some incredibly ambitious targets for biogas production in Europe , so it is conceivable that biogas could provide a significant proportion of our energy needs .
Of course , if we produce enough , someone may decide to start turning it into LNG and shipping it offshore , so this would n't necessarily be a panacea .
3. " Unconventional " gas sources , Coal Seam Methane and Shale Gas
The real X - factor for gas production in Australia is unconventional gas sources , in particular coal seam methane and gas from shale .
As both coal and shale are plentiful ( and likely to remain so for some time ) , these are likely to provide significant quantities of gas .
No one seems to be attempting to extract gas from shale in Australia at this point in time , so I wo n't attempt to quantify how much gas we could possibly obtain from this source ( see this post for a discussion of unconventional gas , including from shale , in the US ) .
Coal seam methane , on the other hand , is now the focus of a boom in Queensland .
As there has been so much activity in the area lately ( and reserves numbers are so vague ) I 'll make this the subject of a separate post - and re-run the scenarios based on various estimates of CSM potential .

See full disclosure below
Last night , I was pondering the subject of cash flow ( essentially how money flow through our hands ) and about financial well being .
I played around with various visualizations that consist of income , expenses , debt , and assets .
What I came up with was the 5 stages of financial health below .
I believe that all of us go through these stages at one point in time , although some may never fall into “ the debt spiral ” or achieve “ financial freedom ” .
Below are the description of each stage and some suggestions on how to improve your finances if you fall into that particular category .
Stage 1 – The Debt Spiral
Description
You are earning less than you spend , forcing you to rely on payday loans and credit cards to make ends meet .
To make it worse , these debts are causing to pay fees and interest expenses that add to your already overwhelming expenses .
What Can You Do
This is a dangerous stage to be in , and there are basically two things you can do :
Fight it by reducing your expenses to the bare bone and increasing your income .
You ’ll have to reevaluate your priorities and look at every single expense .
If it does n’t play a role in your survival , you have to cut it out .
The best kind of expenses to look at first is the recurring ones that you pay monthly — i.e. , subscriptions , utility , housing , food , entertainment , transportation , etc .
Give up by declaring bankruptcy and starting over .
If you are going down this route , be sure you are ready for the consequences of filing for bankruptcy .
More importantly , will you be able to adjust your habits so that you do n’t fall into yet another debt spiral ?
Personally , I hope that you ’ll pursue option # 1 and work yourself toward Stage 2 .
Stage 2 – Living Paycheck to Paycheck
Description
You are spending everything you earn , and you are not saving a dime .
Occasionally , you ’ll go hungry for a few days before your next paycheck .
On the bright side , you are able to keep your debt in check … for the most part .
What Can You Do
Certainly , this is not a great place to be in , but the good thing is that you have options .
There are several things you can do at this stage :
If you could do these three things , you ’ll soon be moving to Stage 3 .
Stage 3 – Spending Less Than You Earn and Building Wealth
Description
This is your basic middle of the road stage .
Your income is greater than your expenses , you have some debt such as mortgage , car loan (s ) , and student loan (s ) that you pay monthly , and you have a little left to save and invest .
Your savings and investment may even add a little bit to your income by ways of interest payment , dividend , distribution , or even rental income .
What Can You Do
This is not a bad place to be in .
At the very least , you have a positive cash flow and are accumulating wealth .
However , there are certainly things that you could do to improve your finances further :
Now on to Stage 4 .
Stage 4 – Power Wealth Building
Description
This is a build on Stage 3 .
You are continuing to keep your debt and expenses under control , while growing your alternative income and building up your assets by savings and investing .
What Can You Do
You are doing well financially — however you should continue to tweak and improve various aspects of your finances wherever you can .
Complacency is the enemy here … never stop looking .
Key things that you could do at this point :
Keep growing your investment income .
Start shifting your primary and alternative income toward passive income sources .
If you have n’t done so in the past , it ’s time to take care of your health .
As you age , health care expenses will be the most significant expense category .
At this point , financial freedom is within reach .
All you have to do to reach Stage 5 is stop trading your time for money — that is shift your income from active to passive sources .
Stage 5 – Financial Freedom
Description
You no longer have to work for money , or at least in a sense that you no longer have to work regularly for it .
You do n’t have to work for someone else … you work for you .
At this point income from your investments and alternative sources could pay for all of your expenses and debt ( if you still have any left by that time ) .
What Can You Do
You worked hard to get to this point … enjoy it !
However , please do consider these things :
Since you ’re no longer working for your income , you have to make sure you do not outlive your assets .
There are several things you could do :
Adjust your investment risk through asset allocation with bias toward fixed income investments .
Know your safe withdrawal rate .
Consider an annuity to guarantee a life - time income stream ( please consider this very carefully ) .
Protect your assets with long - term care insurance ( again , may not be right for everyone ) .
Learn how you can retire with less .
Make sure you stay on top of your health .
Regularly evaluate your estate plan ( or legacy planning ) .
I hope you enjoy these diagrams and the accompanying descriptions .
Which financial stage best describe your finances ?
Do you agree or disagree with the suggestions ?
Pelosi calls Bush a ' total failure ' who has ' no ideas ' Agence France - Presse

Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called President George W. Bush " a total failure " who " has no ideas , " in an interview with CNN .
Responding to stinging criticism from Bush on the Democratic leadership in both houses of Congress and the slow pace of the legislative agenda , as Congress prepares for its one - month summer recess in August , Pelosi let loose : " You know , God bless him , bless his heart , the president of the United States , a total failure , losing all credibility with the American people on the economy , on the war , on energy , you name the subject . "
Pelosi , 68 , said the House and Senate were busy " trying to sweep up after ( Bush 's ) mess over and over and over again ...
The president knows it .
He needs something to talk about .
Because he has no ideas . "
The speaker was especially critical of Bush 's proposal to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling as a means to ease the current fuel price crisis , calling it a ploy to draw attention away from his failures .
" We have seven and a half years of failed energy policy by the Bush administration .
We have a faltering , downturning economy .
The president needs a decoy .
" So he 's going out there , he even has the nerve to say the economy would be better off if we could drill in protected areas offshore , " she said , adding the Democrats ' proposal to free up the US strategic petroleum reserve , which she said is 91.5 percent full .
" And we 're saying let 's take 10 percent of that ... and use that to put on the market so that we increase supply , reduce prices , and when the price comes down , we can buy back the oil at a lower price . "

THE Earth is pockmarked with the evidence of ancient collisions  huge craters blasted into its surface by asteroids or comets .
One such object , striking 65 million years ago in the Yucatán in Mexico , is believed by some experts to be linked to the demise of the dinosaurs .
For a decade , NASA has been busy trying to identify what else is headed this way , particularly those potential “ civilization killers ” of 1 kilometer ( .62 miles ) or more in diameter that have orbits coming within 30 million miles of the Earth ’s  too close for comfort by space standards .
But the big ones are , in many ways , the easy part .
Smaller rocks matter , too .
Perhaps nowhere is that so evident as in central Siberia , where 100 years ago last week , something  presumably a meteoroid , most experts say  streaked across the sky and exploded at an estimated height of 28,000 feet with a force equivalent to 185 Hiroshima bombs , leveling some 800 square miles of forest .
Simulations by the Sandia National Laboratories showed that object could have been just 90 feet across .

The explosion that lit up the Siberian sky in a fireball shortly after 7 a.m. on June 30 , 1908 , is known as the Tunguska event , after the river the flows through the damage zone , and is widely considered the modern - day warning about the dangers slinging through space .
Idiots Fiddle While Rome Burns
The collection of ne'er do wells , clueless dolts , political hacks , and oh , let 's just be blunt and call them what they are -- total Idiots -- expands into an ever larger circle .
While the Republic burns due to the unsavory combination of incompetence , ideological rigidity , and crony capitalism , the fools and assclowns seem ever more determined to avoid any personal responsibility for the damages they have wrought .
Instead , they flail about blindly , blaming everything and everyone -- except their own horrific negligence .
This is financial incompetence writ on a scale far grander than anything seen for centuries .
As a nation , our institutions have failed us : Under Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve slept through the most reckless and irresponsible expansion of bank lending in history for reasons of ideological purity .
His opposition to the Fed ’s regulatory role reached the point of malfeasance long ago .
History is unlikely to be kind to the Maestro .
There is a choice to be made : Either we regulate the Banks , or leave it to the vagaries of the free markets to punish those who trade with , or place their assets in the wrong institutions .
But for God 's sake , do not give us the worst of both worlds -- do not allow banks the freedom to make horrific but preventable mistakes ( i.e. , only lending money to those who can pay it back ) , but then expect the taxpayers to foot the trillion dollar bill .
That 's not capitalism , its not socialism , its not regulation , and its sure as hell is n't what free markets are .
Our language is insufficient to describe this hodge - podge system , other than to call it a random patchwork of quasi- capitalism , quadrennial - socialism , and politics as usual .
Ideological idiocy is the only phrase I can muster that has any resonance with the daily insanity .
We have entered into a fit of Orwellian madness : The American Capitalists , long the globe 's leading advocates for free markets , have become near Socialists .
Halfway around the world , the Chinese Communists have picked up the baton , and are moving rapidly towards a form of Capitalism .
Ironically , it is the once largest communist nations -- the Chinese and the Russians -- who holds much of Fannie and Freddie 's paper .
Hey comrades , who 's selling the rope to whom ?
Perhaps the rescue of " Phony and Fraudy " are not so much a bail out of American homeowners as it is a desperate attempt to stay in the good graces of our friendly global bankers .
We are the world 's largest debtor nation , and as such , we depend upon the kindness of strangers -- be they Japanese or Europeans or Abu Dhabians -- or even former communists .
Back in the States , something beyond cognitive dissonance is occurring -- this is full blown case of dementia unfolding in the public sphere .
When this era of excess and absurdity is treated by historians in the future , the question I expect to be asked most is not why many of these people were n't jailed for their financial felonies .
Rather , I expect them to wonder why so many of these folk were n't placed in protective custody , and heavily medicated , for the only rational explanation for their statements and behaviors is that they have gone so far beyond the bend as to be completely and totally insane .
Massively over - leveraged companies ?
Blame short sellers .
Wildly under - capitalized financial firms ?
Blame rumors .
Heinously poor corporate management ?
Blame a Senator .
It is as if someone is running around Washington D.C. with a ball - peen hammer , smacking senior government officials on their skulls .
If you find the standard finger pointing hard to fathom , perhaps blunt head trauma is a better explanations for the absurdities proferred .
Books will be written about this period of time , and our descendants will wonder in awe as to how this was allowed to happen .
Tulips got nothing on us !
Its not just the total dollar value of the losses that have exceeded all other global fits of financial madness combined , but rather , how so many warning signs were so blithely ignored by so many and for so long .
What was wrong with these people , the authors and historians will wonder .
Did the antibiotics in the food supply drive them mad ?
Did the High Fructose Corn Syrup compromise their ability to think ?
Some form of viral plague ?
Roid rage ?
What else could have created such a mass delusion amongst not just the populace , but their leadership and institutions ?
Indy Mac goes belly up , having lost $ 900 million this year alone .
Its shares fell 87 % in 2007 and then its value dropped ( on top of last year 's collapse ) another 95 % this year - to - date .
The stock fell to 28 cents yesterday .
Some estimates of the total bad loans made by this somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 30 billion dollars -- and the Office of Thrift Supervision blames a senator who is investigating how much of the FDIC's $ 53 Billion this is going to eat up , with Wall Street estimates ranging from 15 % to 30 % .
The towering incompetence of OTS is incomprehendable , but it is their colossal gall that is truly stupefying .
From beyond the grave , Adam Smith does not know whether to weep or retch .

John McCain has said many a stupid thing during this general election campaign .
But when he told Matt Lauer on The Today Show that bringing our troops home was just not that important , he crossed a line from stupidity to being unforgivable :
You have attested to : a fairly easy success ; an overwhelming victory in a very short period of time ; in which we would be welcomed as liberators ; which you assured us would not require our troops stay for decades but merely for years ; from which we could bring them all home , since you noted many Iraqis resent American military presence ; in which all those troops coming home will also stay there , not being injured , for a hundred years ; but most will be back by 2013 ; and the timing of their return , is … not … that … important .
That , Senator McCain , is context .
And that , Senator McCain , is madness .
Full transcripts below the fold
Finally tonight , as promised , a Special Comment on Senator John McCain 's conclusion that it's " not too important " when American forces come home from Iraq .
Thoughts , offered more in sorrow , than in anger .
For two full days now , the Senator and his supporters have been outraged at what they see as the subtraction of context from this extraordinary remark .
This is , sadly , the excuse of our time , for everything .
Still .
If the Senator claims truncation , we will correct that , first .
" A lot of people , " Matt Lauer began , " now say the surge is working . "
" Anybody who knows the facts on the ground say that , " the Senator interjected .
" If it 's now working , Senator , " Matt continued , " do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq ? "
" No , " answered McCain .
" But that 's not too important .
What 's important is the casualties in Iraq .
Americans are in South Korea .
Americans are in Japan .
American troops are in Germany .
" That 's all fine .
American casualties and the ability to withdraw .
We will be able to withdraw .
General Petraeus is going to tell us in July when he thinks we are .
But the key to it is we do n't want any more Americans in harm 's way .
" And that way they will be safe , and serve our country , and come home with honor and victory - not in defeat , which is what Senator Obama 's proposal would have done .
And I 'm proud of them , and they 're doing a great job .
And we are succeeding .
And it 's fascinating that Senator Obama still does n't realize it . "
And there is the context of what Senator McCain said .
Well ... not quite , Senator .
The full context is that the Iraq you see is a figment of your imagination .
This is not a war about " honor and victory , " sir .
This is a war you , and the President you support and seek to succeed , conned this nation into .
Yes , sir .
You .
Of the prospect of war in Iraq , you said , quote ,
" I believe that success will be fairly easy . "
John McCain ... September 24th , 2002 .
" I believe that we can win an overwhelming victory in a very short period of time . "
John McCain ... September 29th , 2002 .
Of the ouster of Saddam and the Baathists :
" There 's no doubt in my mind that once these people are gone , that we will be welcomed as liberators . "
John McCain ... March 24th , 2003 .
Asked , about a long - term commitment in Iraq , quote , " are you talking about something in terms of South Korea , for instance , where you would expect U.S. troops to be in Iraq for decades ? "
" No , " you answered .
" I do n't think decades , but I think years .
A little straight talk , I think years .
And I hope that we can gradually reduce that presence . "
John McCain ... March 18th , 2004 .
You were asked about the troops , and the future .
" I would hope that we could bring them all home .
I would hope that we would probably , leave , some military advisers , as we have in other countries , to help them with their training and equipment and that kind of stuff .
" ... I think one of our big problems has been the fact that many Iraqis resent American military presence .
And I do n't pretend to know exactly Iraqi public opinion .
But as soon as we can reduce our visibility as much as possible , the better I think it is going to be . "
John McCain ... January 31st . 2005
When a speaker at your town hall , five months ago , referenced the President 's forecast that we might stay in Iraq for 50 years , you cut him off .
" Make it a hundred !
We 've been in Japan for 60 years .
We 've been in South Korea 50 years or so .
That would be fine with me .
As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed .
That 's fine by me ... "
John McCain ... January 3rd , 2008 .
And your forecast of your hypothetical first term .
" By January , 2013 , America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom .
The Iraq war has been won . "
John McCain ... May 15th , 2008 .
That , Senator McCain , is context .
You have attested to : a fairly easy success ; an overwhelming victory in a very short period of time ; in which we would be welcomed as liberators ; which you assured us would not require our troops stay for decades but merely for years ; from which we could bring them all home , since you noted many Iraqis resent American military presence ; in which all those troops coming home will also stay there , not being injured , for a hundred years ; but most will be back by 2013 ; and the timing of their return , is ... not ... that ... important .
That , Senator McCain , is context .
And that , Senator McCain , is madness .
The Government Accountability Office just released a study Tuesday that concludes that one out of every ten soldiers sent to Iraq , takes with them medical problems " severe enough to significantly limit their ability to fight . "
In five years , we have now sent 43,000 of them to war even though they were already wounded .
And when they come home , Is. Not .
That .
Important .
Jalal al Din al Sagir , a member of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq , and Ali al Adeeb , of the rival Dawa Political Party , gave a series of interviews last week about the particulars of this country 's demand for a " Status of Forces " agreement with Iraq -- a treaty which Mr. Bush does not intend to show Congress before he signs it .
The Iraqi politicians say the treaty demands Iraq 's consent to the establishment of nearly double the number of U - S military bases in Iraq -- from about 30 , to 58 , and from temporary , to permanent .
Those will be American men and women who must , of necessity , staff these bases - staff them , in Mr. McCain 's MC Escher dream world in which our people can all come home while they stay there for a hundred years but they 'll be back by 2013 .
And when they come home , Is. Not .
That .
Important .
Last year , a 20 - year old soldier from the Bronx , on the day of his re-deployment to a second tour in Iraq , said he just could n't face the smell of burning flesh again .
So , Jonathan Aponte paid a hit man 500 dollars ... to shoot him in the knee .
Mount Sinai Hospital in New York reported treating a patient identifying himself as another Iraq - bound soldier , who claimed he had accidentally swallowed a pen at the bus station .
No one doubted his story until examinations proved there was a second pen in his stomach bearing the logo of Greyhound Bus Lines .
In 2006 , says his sister , a 24 - year old Army Specialist from Washington State , on the eve of his second deployment , strapped a pack full of tools to his back , and then jumped off the roof of his house , injuring his spine .
And when they come home -- or more correctly , all those like them who did not risk death or disability to avoid going back -- when they come home , Is. Not .
That .
Important .
You 've sold them all out , Senator .
You .
You , whose sacrifice for this country was as all - encompassing and as horrible as the rest of us can only imagine in our darkest moments .
You , who survived , so that you could make America a better place where young men did not have to go and die in pointless wars or be maimed or be held prisoner or have to hire hit - men to shoot them in the knee because that could n't be worse .
You , who should know better .
Where , Senator , is the man who once said " veterans hate war more than anyone else , because veterans know , because veterans know these brave Americans , and others , know , that there is nothing more painful than the loss of a comrade .
Where is he , sir ?
Where is the man who described that ineffable truth ?
Oh , so long ago you touched the essence of the reality of Iraq .
Your comments about your lost comrades , yesterday .
The men and women in Iraq , today , Senator -- they are your comrades , too .
And you are condemning them to die .
To die , for your misdirections , for Mr. Bush 's lies -- for whoever makes the money off building 58 permanent American bases and all the weapons and all the bullets and all the wiring so costly and so slip - shod that it electrocutes our comrades as they step , not to fight freedom 's enemies , but into the shower at the base .
That , Senator , that is context .
It is an easy thing to dismiss Senator McCain as a sad and befuddled figure , already challenging for some kind of campaign record for malaprops .
Just yesterday in Philadelphia he answered Senator Obama , not by defending or explaining his own " not that important " remark , but by seizing upon Obama 's " bitter " remark - or trying to .
Obama had foolishly said that some , in despair , in small towns , cling to their religion and their guns .
Senator McCain vowed he'd go to those towns and tell them , " I do n't agree with Senator Obama that they cling to their religion and the Constitution because they 're bitter . "
It was hard not to dismiss with a laugh , Senator McCain , or any Republican , for even accidentally implying that he 's clung to the Constitution -- not after the last seven years .
It was hard , the day before , not to become almost bemused when the Senator tried to say he would veto every single bill with earmarks , but wound up , instead , vowing " I will veto every single beer . "
It was hard , this week , not to laugh at how Senator McCain could offer any serious defense against the accusation that he is running for President Bush 's third term , when a 2006 interview suddenly surfaced in which McCain said he would consider Dick Cheney for a position in a McCain administration .
" I do n't know if I would want him as Vice President .
He and I have the same strengths .
But to serve in other capacities ?
Hell , yeah . "
These are all very funny , in a macabre yet unthreatening way .
And then one remembers Senator McCain 's inability to separate Sunni and Shia , or his insistence that Iran is training Al - Qaeda for service in Iraq , and then being corrected about it , and then saying the same thing again anyway .
And then one is , inevitably , drawn back again to the overlooked substance of yesterday 's remark ...
" If ( the surge ) is now working , Senator , do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq ? "
" No . "
No ?
The surge is working and even that still tells Senator McCain nothing about when we can ransom our soldiers ?
Was n't that the ultimate purpose of the surge ?
To get them out ?
If we cannot tell -- if McCain cannot even guess -- does n't that , by definition , mean ... the surge is n't working ?
And ultimately we are drawn back to the " not ... too ... important " remark , in its full context :
The context of the kaleidoscope of confused rhetoric , and endless non sequiturs , and mutually exclusive conclusions -- and what they add up to : a veritable tragedy , a microcosm of the American tragedy that is Iraq , a tragedy of a man who himself will never understand " the context . "
Your tragedy , Senator McCain ?
No .
I 'm sorry .
This tragedy is of Justin Mixon of Bogalusa , Louisiana .
And it's of Christopher McCarthy of Virginia Beach .
It 's of Quincy Green of El Paso , and Joshua Waltenbaugh of Ford City , PA .
The tragedy is of Shane Duffy of Taunton , Mass , and Jonathan Emard of Mesquite , Texas .
It 's of Cody Legg of Escondido in California , and David Hurst of Fort Sill in Oklahoma .
The tragedy is of Thomas Duncan , III , of Rowlett , Texas , and Tyler Pickett of Saratoga , Wyoming .
And who are they , Senator ?
They are ten Americans who have died in Iraq since the first of this month .
There are four more .
The Defense Department has not yet identified the others .
And while you , Senator , may ask for all the context you can get , those ten men will never know any of it .
Because the true context here , is that if you could ask those American war heroes , or the family and the friends that loved them , if they have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq ...
They could rightly say , " No .
But that 's .
Not .
That .
Important . "
Good night , and good luck .
“ Over the course of the next year , we felt we were living on eggshells , ” she said .
“ It became almost a mantra , saying to the kids , ‘ The neighbors , the neighbors . ’ ”
A frosty détente set in when the couple downstairs had their first child two years ago .
“ I think you become a more sensitive person when you have a kid  you have to become more tolerant and understanding , ” the Upper West Side mother said .
“ You kind of realize that life is not as tidy as you ’d like it to be . ”
Indeed , the vast majority of child - noise complaints are said by those called to intervene to be lodged by neighbors with no children or grown children .
Trouble also tends to flare when a family replaces an especially quiet resident , when renovations render layouts incongruent ( so that a hallway now runs over a bedroom , for example ) , and when neighbors have different sleeping schedules .
Deborah
Orr ’s former downstairs neighbor , a lawyer in her 30s with no children , waited six months after moving in to complain about the noise produced by Ms. Orr ’s son and daughter , who were 4 and 1 at the time .
“ I think she tried a little too hard to tolerate it , then I think basically she kind of snapped , ” said Ms. Orr , 40 , a music publicist who lived in a Park Slope brownstone co-op .
“ When she complained , we bought thick rugs and pads , but I think it was just too late . ”
Still , Ms. Orr and her husband tried .
“ There was a point , ” she said , “ where every time the kids would go into the hall we would get this kind of twitchy ‘ do n’t run  walk , walk . ’
We probably tried a little too hard to eliminate the noise because we wanted to have good relationships with the neighbors and to have good kids that other people enjoy being around and not like this focus of resentment .
They were not doing anything outrageous .
They were just doing normal kid things .
But small children , especially toddlers , have this clumsy flatfooted walk .
It ’s impossible to control . ”
The Orrs eventually moved , because they wanted more space .
Parents who hope to avoid having angry neighbors are not presented with many good choices in New York unless they can afford a house .
Many of the prewar buildings and brownstones that seem especially solid are worse when it comes to noise .

Welcome to Americus , Georgia .
Located 10 miles east of the peanut farm where Jimmy Carter was raised , the town has a charming city center with broad streets , a diner that still sells hot dogs for 95 cents , a Confederate flag that flies conspicuously on the outskirts of town , railroad tracks that divide white and black neighborhoods , chain gangs that labor along the roadways , and , on South Lee Street , right across from the courthouse , its very own private probation office .
Middle Georgia Community Probation Services is one of 37 companies to whom local governments have outsourced the supervision of misdemeanor and traffic offenders .
It ’s been billed as a way to save millions of dollars for Georgia and at least nine other states where private probation is used .
But to its critics , the system looks more like a way to milk scarce dollars from the poorest of the poor .
Here ’s how it works :
If you have enough money to pay your fine the day you go to court for , say , a speeding ticket , you can usually avoid probation .
But those who ca n’t scrape up a few hundred dollars — and nearly 28 percent of Americus residents live below the poverty line — must pay their fine , as well as at least $ 35 in monthly supervision fees to a private company , in weekly or biweekly installments over a period of three months to a year .
By the time their term is over , they may have paid more than twice what the judge ordered .
In his courtroom , which doubles as the Americus City Council ’s chambers , Judge J. Michael Greene issues a rehearsed warning about these additional charges , though he does n’t point out that they go to a private company ; instead , he compares them to “ taxes we all pay at the grocery store . ”
When I was there in April , he admonished the African American defendants before him , “ Do n’t fuss at the court clerks .
If you do , you are going to jail .
They have no more power over it than the nice lady at the checkout counter . ”
Carla , a 25 - year - old single mother who lives in public housing , has been on probation for more than three years .
“ I never see myself getting off of it , ” she told me .
“ I could get off of it this year if they let the fines stay what they is and do n’t increase them .
But every week and every month , they go up . ”
Carla ’s current case is a traffic violation , issued after she rolled through two stop signs .
Judge Greene placed her on probation and ordered her to pay a $ 200 fine plus Middle Georgia ’s supervision fees .
In January , she prematurely gave birth to her second child .
The staples from her cesarean ripped , and she was placed on bed rest .
“ I could n’t even take my baby to the doctor , ” she says .
Carla called her probation officer every Tuesday trying to report .
“ After a while I received a letter saying I ai n’t reporting or calling or doing nothing I was supposed to do .
And she issued a warrant . ”
One letter she got from Middle Georgia read , “ Probation is a priviledge [ sic ] not a right .
Probation did not levy a fine — the courts did . ”
She was , the letter said , $ 245 behind .
Two months later , thanks to various penalties , that amount had shot up to $ 525 , and her total remaining balance was $ 690 , more than three times the original fine .
By the time I met Carla , her sister had helped her get a minimum - wage job at the local dollar store .
But she ’d stopped contacting Middle Georgia because she feared going to jail ( and losing her kids ) if she showed her face .
Her friend Erica , who also has a warrant out because of probation fees , told me she worries every time she goes outside .
“ You be scared to walk to your mailbox , because that ’s what the law do — they ride around and try to find you .
You ’re scared to look for a job .
But unless you get a job you ca n’t pay your fine .
So either way , you ’re just stuck . ”
No one at Middle Georgia returned my calls , so I stopped by the company ’s Americus office ; there , I watched a female probation officer instruct a toothless man about the additional fees he needed to pay for improperly storing scrap tires at his auto shop .
“ Y’all know this ai n’t right , ” he shouted .
“ You railroading me ! ” Eventually , another Middle Georgia employee noticed me .
I told her I was a reporter .
“ We do n’t talk to reporters , ” she said coolly .
Middle Georgia , along with the rest of the state ’s private probation industry , owes much of its business to Bobby Whitworth , who was Georgia ’s commissioner of corrections until 1993 , when a sex - abuse scandal involving female inmates forced him out .
Gov. Zell Miller promptly reassigned him to the Board of Pardons and Paroles , which positioned him nicely for a side job consulting with a private probation company called Detention Management Services .
Three years later , in December 2003 , a jury found Whitworth guilty of public corruption for accepting $ 75,000 from the company to draft and lobby for legislation that dramatically expanded the role of private probation companies .
Whitworth was sent to prison for six months , but the law remains on the books , and the private probation industry — led by Georgia ’s two most powerful Republican lobbyists — has lobbied to be given felony cases as well .
That plan has run into opposition from law enforcement :
One sheriff told lawmakers last year that among his peers , private probation was seen mostly “ as a moneymaking fee - collection service . ”
Another said there is generally “ not a lot of emphasis on supervision as much as there is on collection . ”
Lawrence Holt , a thin , 24 - year - old African American man , is a supervisor at a mattress factory in Americus .
He ’s held the job for three years , but lives in the projects and , like every member of his family before him , hits the bottle hard .
He ’s been on probation since November , because of an arrest for driving under the influence a few days after his brother died of diabetes .
By April , he had paid his original $ 600 fine , but had $ 645 to go to cover Middle Georgia ’s fees .
He told me he would n’t mind paying if his probation officer would only help him get treatment .
“ I throw up blood , ” he said .
“ I just ca n’t stop drinking because I got so many problems in my head .
I have asked , ‘ Can y’all find somebody to help me with my alcohol problem ? ’
‘ Sir , we ca n’t do that .

Arc -shaped troughs ( black and white arrows ) extend 100s of kilometers on the surface of Jupiter 's moon Europa .
These enigmatic features are likely fractures resulting from a shift in Europa 's spin axis .
Vertical scale bar ( right ) is 100 km .
The meanderingpoles of Jupiter ?s moon Europa etched tell - tale scars across the satellite ? sicy surface , a new study finds .
Europa ? sice - heavy poles shifted almost 90 degrees , from near the current equator totheir current north - south alignment , which caused the moon 's spin axis tochange as well .
? A spinningbody is most stable with its mass farthest from its spin axis , ? said Isamu Matsuyama , planetary scientist at the Carnegie Institution who participated in the study .?
On Europa , variations in the thickness of its outer shell caused a massimbalance , so the rotation axis reoriented to a new stable state .?
Stressesfrom the changing spin axis caused fractures that stretch more than a third ofthe way across Europa 's surface .
Matsuyamaand other researchers mapped arc - shaped scars extending more than 310 miles ( 500 km ) across the Europa , using images from NASA ?s Voyager , Galileo , and — more recently — the Pluto - bound New Horizons spacecraft that zipped pastJupiter last year .
The Jovian moonhas a radius of just over 930 miles ( 1,500 km ) , making it slightly smaller thanEarth 's moon .
Theresearch is detailed in the May 15 issue of the journal Nature .
Europajoins Earth , Mars , and Saturn 's icy moon Enceladus as planetary bodies thathave experienced " true polar wander " where their spin axis shifted , Matsuyama said .
The newfinding adds more weight to the notion that Europa 's icy crust slides over aliquid , subsurface ocean which could harbor conditions for life .
A similarpossibility exists on Saturn ' smoon Titan , leading NASA and Europe to consider futuredeep space missions to one or both places .
" Thelarge reorientation on Europa required to explain the circular depressionsimplies that its outer ice shell is decoupled from the core by a liquid layer , ?Matsuyama said .
?
Therefore , our studyprovides an independent test for the presence of an interior liquid layer .?
Another political show trial in Baghdad : Tariq Aziz charged with genocide
By James Cogan
3 May 2008
The trial that began this week of Tariq Aziz on the charge of genocide is a particularly vindictive act on the part of the Bush administration and its puppet government in Iraq .
The court is trying him and seven other former Iraqi government leaders for the 1992 execution of 42 businessmen accused of price - fixing .
If found guilty , Aziz faces the death penalty .
After Hussein himself , Aziz was arguably the regime ’s best known face around the world .
Highly educated and fluent in English , he was a key public spokesman and diplomat for the Baathist regime .
He served as Iraq ’s foreign minister from 1983 until 1991 and as deputy prime minister from 1991 until the 2003 US invasion .
In the lead - up to the war , he frequently appeared in the international media , articulately denying the US lies that the Iraqi government possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links with Al Qaeda .
He accused the Bush administration of wanting war for “ oil and Israel ” .
He surrendered to US forces on April 24 , 2003 .
The Iraqi Special Tribunal — a kangaroo court established by the US occupation to judicially murder Saddam Hussein and other leading Baathists — only announced that Aziz was being prosecuted on April 24 .
For the past five years , he has been imprisoned without charges by the American military .
He is currently being held at Camp Cropper near Baghdad airport .
His only public appearance since 2003 has been the testimony he gave during the trial of Saddam Hussein on behalf of several of the defendants .
Appeals for his release by his children and by the head of the Iraqi Christian Church , to which Aziz belongs , have been ignored .
During the trial of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi officials , the WSWS commented that the US occupation of Iraq and its local collaborators have no credibility to try anyone for crimes against the Iraqi people .
The Bush administration is responsible for a scale of killing and criminality that far exceeds those of Hussein ’s Baathist regime .
The 2003 invasion was an illegal war of aggression that has so far cost an estimated 1.2 million Iraqis lives , turned four million into refugees and devastated the country ’s economic and social infrastructure .
In the past few weeks , American bombs and bullets have slaughtered or maimed well over 3,000 people in the streets of Baghdad ’s Sadr City .
Amid this ongoing carnage , the charge of “ genocide ” levelled against Aziz is an outrage .
By all accounts , the 1992 killing of the merchants was ordered solely by Hussein .
The only basis on which Aziz is being prosecuted is that he was a member of the Revolutionary Command Council in whose name the executions were carried out .
His son Ziad , who lives in exile in Jordan , told the BBC : “ Everybody knows that he was not involved in this thing , but the Iraqi government has accused him because of his name , because he is Tariq Aziz .
Even though he was part of the regime , everybody knows my father was responsible for foreign relations ... he was not involved in this thing about the merchants . ”
The state of Aziz ’s health makes his prosecution on trumped - up charges even more outrageous .
The 72 - year - old man is dying of lung cancer and has reportedly suffered several strokes in recent years .
He hobbled into court on Tuesday on a walking stick , looking sick , gaunt and tired .
He had no legal representation as his lawyer has fled the country out of fear of being murdered by death squads linked to the Shiite parties that dominate the Iraqi government .
The proceedings will resume on May 20 .
Six of the men who face trial alongside Aziz include : former interior minister Watban Ibrahim al - Hassan ; former director of public security Sabaawi Ibrahim al - Hassan ; former finance minister Ahmad Hussein Khudier ; former presidential secretary Abdul Hamid Mahmoud ; former Baghdad governor Issam Rashid Houweish ; and Mezban Khedr Hadi , who , like Aziz , was a member of Revolutionary Command Council .
To undermine any public sympathy for the accused , the Iraqi Special Tribunal is also cynically prosecuting Ali Hassan al - Majid for the execution of the merchants as well .
Ali Hassan al - Majid is better known as “ Chemical Ali ” and was one of the most hated figures in the Baath regime after Hussein and his sons .
He was sentenced to death last year for his role in the gassing of thousands of Iraqi Kurds during the 1980s .
Under Iraqi law , the death penalty must be carried out within 30 days .
In Majid ’s case , however , the execution has been repeatedly delayed .
The May 1 editorial of the English language Arab News observed : “ Chemical Ali has been kept alive , purely to answer these serious but albeit lesser charges , perhaps because the Americans believe that Aziz ’s name will be blackened by association with one of the undoubted ogres of Saddam ’s regime ” .
The prosecution of Tariq Aziz has nothing to do with justice for the victims of Baathism .
At one level , the decision to try a dying man is a case of sadistic revenge .
Aziz was very much the public face of the Baathist regime who challenged the lies by the US used to justify its invasions of Iraq in 1991 and 2003 .
Moreover , despite intense pressure to do so , he refused in 2006 to testify against the former dictator .
Instead , Aziz appeared on behalf of several of Hussein ’s co-accused , giving evidence that they had no role in the 1982 execution of 130 Shiite men and boys — the crime for which Hussein was hung .
However , the primary motive for the Bush administration to charge Aziz is to ensure that his intimate knowledge of US crimes in the region goes with him to his grave .
Aziz was central in the diplomatic relations between the US government and the Iraqi regime during the Iran - Iraq war from 1980 to 1988 — a conflict that claimed over one million lives and saw the use by Iraq of chemical and biological weapons on the battlefield and against civilian populations .
Hussein ordered his military to invade Iran in September 1980 following the ousting of Shah in 1979 .
From the outset , Iraq was given financial and military assistance by US allies in the Middle East such as Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Kuwait , who were terrified that revolutionary upheaval in Iran would produce social unrest in their own countries , particularly among Shiites .
By 1982 , with Iraqi forces forced into retreat , the US was providing its own extensive assistance to Hussein in order to try to ensure that Iraq was not defeated .
Until the end of the conflict , the US funnelled billions of dollars and considerable military equipment to Iraq .
In the latter stages , the US military also supplied intelligence to the Iraqi military .
Tariq
Aziz could shed light on all of Iraq ’s dealings with the Reagan and first Bush administrations .
In particular , he would be able to detail the extent of American government involvement in the assistance given by some 150 US , European and other foreign companies to Iraq ’s chemical and biological warfare programs .
American firms , for example , are alleged to have supplied Iraq with material that could be used in the manufacture of anthrax and other agents , as well as the missile technology to unleash them .
Pat Lang , a Defense Intelligence Agency official in the 1980s , told the New York Times in 2002 that “ the use of gas on the battlefield by the Iraqis was not a matter of deep strategic concern ” to the US .
Donald Rumsfeld , then special envoy to the Middle East for the Reagan administration , in fact met with Tariq Aziz in Baghdad on the same day in 1984 that the United Nations first indicted Iraq for its use of chemical weapons .
Rumsfeld ’s main interest was in ultimately failed negotiations for the construction of an oil pipeline from Iraq to Jordan by US transnational Bechtel .
( See : “ Bechtel awarded Iraq contract : War profits and the US ‘ military - industrial complex ’ ” )
US aid to Iraq continued to flow after evidence emerged of the 1988 gassing of Kurdish civilians .
The backing of the Reagan White House for Hussein saw it overrule a Senate motion imposing sanctions .
After the conclusion of the Iran - Iraq war , the US turned on its former proxy , using the 1990 invasion of Kuwait as the pretext , as a means of establishing a permanent US military presence in the Middle East .
Aziz would have been privy to the discussions with US ambassador to Iraq , April Glaspie , in which she effectively gave Hussein the green light to invade Kuwait .
He would have detailed knowledge of the circumstances in which , at the end of the war , the first Bush administration encouraged Shiite and Kurdish rebellions , then turned a blind eye as the Baathist regime savagely crushed the opposition .
A report in the British Times on March 21 that Tariq Aziz has been writing his memoirs may have a great deal to do with why he has been charged .
After the virtually inevitable guilty verdict , he will remain in prison until his death — either by hanging or cancer .
Either way , his conviction will ensure that he is never questioned in a court or able to speak publicly about Washington ’s crimes in the Middle East .

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own .
Lyn Toomey , a veteran virtual assistant and founder of Virtual Market Support , leverages her 27 - year career in marketing , operations and virtual assistance to support small and midsize businesses .
In the past few years , the Virtual Assistant ( VA ) industry has increasingly been in the headlines : Good Morning America 's Tory Johnson wrote on the flexibility of being a self - employed VA last September .
The Today Show also featured the profession as a new way to work from home .
The Wall Street Journal , US News & World Report and numerous other publications have made it clear that the virtual assistant business is trendy and growing .
More and more virtual assistants are starting their businesses by ditching their corporate cubicle - wall environments and setting up home based offices .
Successful VAs lead with their strengths to build a successful and growing client base .
Some offer executive secretarial services ; others are marketing managers , freelance writers , real estate assistants , web designers , author assistants -- you name it , someone is doing it , and doing it virtually .
Getting Started
It 's possible to start up with zero dollars if you already have a phone , an updated computer , a printer with scanner and internet access .
But if you want to be taken seriously , you 'll need a well - designed website .
You can hire a web designer for about $ 600 to $ 1,200 for a small site , or you can use an inexpensive yet professional template design from a web host for as little as $ 6 per month .
Many
VAs start with what they have and buy what they need as they acquire clients .
Business cards and brochures are must - haves .
Expect to pay $ 40 to $ 60 for 500 business cards .
Brochures can be self - designed , traded out with other VAs or professionally made for around $ 350 .
Professional networking is essential as well .
Budget at least $ 100 to $ 300 to join associations and groups .
You will generate most of your leads this way .
Some virtual assistants incur extra costs upfront to increase efficiency and professional appeal .
Depending on your budget , you might opt to upgrade your equipment or software .
The latest version of Microsoft or Mac software will ensure more efficiency , or at the very least establish a planned replacement schedule as you generate revenue .
Common Rates
There are no industry standards for pricing .
VA rates vary widely depending on the individual and the services offered .
Typical VA rates start around $ 35 per hour and range to $ 75 per hour or higher , depending on the service or skill level .
As a general rule , common administrative tasks are on the lower end of the scale , and graphic or website design are at the higher end .
To establish an effective rate for your business , remember to factor in the following :
self - employment taxes
sick days , vacation days
slow business periods
business expenses such as printer ink , website hosting , business cards , telephone costs , internet costs , etc .
All of these are expenses against your earnings .
The most fearsome to be aware of : self - employment taxes .
As in any startup , always set aside a percentage of your earnings for self - employment taxes in a separate tax account so that you have the cash to pay the IRS at tax time .
Making Your Hours
One of the perks of being a VA is the ability to make your own hours and see the time spent directly impact your bottom line .
Calculate your hourly rate multiplied by the number of hours per week you 'd like to work .
So , if you 'd like to work 30 hours , your projected revenue would be your hourly rate times 30 hours , times 4 to get a monthly figure .
Keep in mind that you will not start with 30 hours ; it will take a while to build a client base .
Many VAs take a part - time job while they establish their businesses .
Sometimes this part - time job comes in the form of working for a well - established VA as a sub-contractor .
This is done by joining a VA group , introducing yourself and offering your sub - contracting services .
Be prepared to sign a terms of agreement , which often includes a " non-compete " clause that prevents you from marketing to their clients .
This protects experienced VAs from losing their hard - won clients to their sub- contractors and at the same time gives you , the aspiring VA , a chance to learn how to be great .
Getting Help
Your best bet for getting off the ground fast is to join the International Virtual Assistant Association ( IVAA ) .
This registered nonprofit 's website includes a searchable member directory ( for potential clients to find VAs ) , a request for proposal system ( for clients to announce their project and get VAs to respond to them ) , a forms library from which to draw example materials and an " Expert of the Month " chat series for education .
For more support , here are some other VA groups you may want to research :
What to Expect
Remember , since the industry is new and growing , there are some prospective clients who do n't know what a VA is or how one works .
There will be occasions when you 'll need to explain what you do .
Note that many choose to use the term " Virtual Professional " because there are some who feel " Virtual Assistant " gives a subordinate image .
Nonetheless , " Virtual Assistant " has taken hold and proliferated on the internet .
One way to deal with this is to incorporate both terms interchangeably throughout your marketing materials .
As the industry grows , expect competition .
Make sure you are providing exceptional services at your highest professional level .
For example , your office is in your home , so ensure privacy and quiet while you 're working .
It 's unprofessional to hear barking dogs or family members in the background .
Create a voicemail message to sound like the professional that you are .
Also review your website to make certain that it 's easy to use , understand and navigate .
And be available for quick response to inquiries .
Expect also to have to go out and " find business . "
You will not be inundated with business from the internet .
You 'll need to " reach out " and make it happen by networking and marketing ( both in person and via the internet ) , and perhaps even by making phone calls to get your business off the ground swiftly .
To network , find a niche and join one or more associations or internet groups .
Your niche should be a target market that makes sense for your unique background .
An example :
If you have paralegal skills , join a paralegal association and network within the group .
You'd have something in common with your prospects right away , smoothing the way to an ongoing relationship .
Research professional associations along with internet groups , such as Yahoo Groups and LinkedIn .
Join , participate and make connections to get going .
As a member of the virtual assistant community , expect to find friendly support , mentoring , educational opportunities and conferences .
VAs are , by definition , helpers .
We do it professionally , and we do it compassionately .
So when you become part of the VA industry , you may find something you really were n't expecting .
You 'll find friends .

In attempting to persuade voters that Obama is not American enough to be president , the right has renewed charges that he is a socialist in sheep ’s clothing .
Their newest claim that an Obama presidency would usher in an era of “ wealth redistribution ” seems a thinly veiled attempt to associate Obama with history ’s socialist revolutionaries and communist dictators .
But before you start worrying that Obama will take your money and impose socialist redistribution mandates , it ’s worth taking a moment to scrutinize the basis for the right ’s hackneyed accusations .
According to an analysis by the technically non-partisan Tax Foundation , which has been called out in the past for propagating misleading information , Obama ’s income - tax plan would “ redistribute more than $ 131 billion per year from the top 1 % of taxpayers to all other taxpayers . ”
They conclude by asking if such policies were enacted , what would be the “ consequences for our democratic system ” ?— a not - so - subtle insinuation that an Obama presidency could be ruinous for America ’s cherished democracy .
Similarly , an op - ed in this week ’s Wall Street Journal asserts that IRS data due out in a few weeks will likely show that “ the richest 1 % of tax filers will have paid more than 40 % of the income tax burden . ”
The WSJ argues that unfair tax increases on the wealthy will dampen economic growth as it leads to “ reduced work and investment , ” and the “ redeployment of money into tax shelters ” ( something McCain adviser Phil Gramm may know something about ) .
Yet , upon closer inspection , these analyses prove deceptive .
“ Focusing on income taxes alone is cheating , ” explains UT economics professor James K. Galbraith , a featured writer in our current issue and author of the upcoming book The Predator State .
“ The very rich shoulder a very small proportion of the payroll tax , ” Galbraith told me , “ and their share of sales taxes and property taxes is much smaller , as a share of income , than it is for poorer people . ”
“ Why are the very rich shouldering such a large part of the income tax burden ? ” Galbraith rhetorically asks .
“ Easy — they are very much richer than they ever were before .
The income tax merely evens things out a bit . ”
Galbraith also refutes the WSJ ‘s argument that increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans will hinder economic growth , insisting that “ there is absolutely no serious evidence that higher tax rates on the wealthy has adverse effects on investment or work effort . ”
As we face skyrocketing fuel costs , plunging housing prices , and a stuttering job market , it ’s not the ordinary American ’s who deserve to be called “ whiners . ”
But , quips Galbraith as he considers those complaining about Obama ’s so - called “ wealth redistribution ” plans , “ the word certainly describes the McCain chorus at the Wall Street Journal . ”

“ Are you supposed to be some kind of message ? ” she seethes at the past , scrubbing the carpet again .
“ Or lesson ?
I ’ve learned enough goddamn NOT THE URN ”
Somebody once told Meredith that poltergeists are manifest repression , buried thoughts , the psychic bleeding into the physical .
She just wo n’t remember who .
From the “ People This Lacking in Self - Awareness Really Should n’t Be Allowed to Speak in Public Ever Again ” Files
The following heart - stoppingly clueless comment , from this CNN article on Barack Obama :
With Clinton ’s debt yet to be paid off , some of her supporters are balking at the idea of donating to Obama — especially if he does not choose her to be his running mate .
“ I certainly know there are lots of people who are withholding their money , ” said Lynn Forester de Rothschild , one of Clinton ’s “ Hill - raisers ” who raised over $ 100,000 for the former first lady .
“ This is a hard decision for me personally because frankly I do n’t like him .
I feel like he is an elitist . ”
Folks , meet Lynn Forester de Rothschild , otherwise known as Lady de Rothschild :
Lady de Rothschild is Founder and Chief Executive of E L Rothschild LLC , a private company , since June 2002 .
From 1990 to 2002 , Lady de Rothschild was President and Chief Executive Officer of FirstMark Holdings , Inc. , which owned and managed various telecommunications companies .
She was Executive Vice President for Development at Metromedia Telecommunications , Inc. from 1984 to 1989 .
She began her career in 1980 as an associate at the law firm of Simpson , Thacher and Bartlett LLP , where she practiced corporate law .
Lady de Rothschild is a director of The Economist Newspaper Limited ( member of the Audit Committee ) .
She is also a member of the U.N. Advisory Committee on Inclusive Financial Services and a trustee of the American Fund for the Tate Gallery , the Outward Bound Trust ( UK ) , and the Alfred Herrhausen Society for International Dialogue ( Deutsche Bank ) .
Lady de Rothschild is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Foreign Policy Association , and she served as a member of the National Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee and as the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board under President Clinton .
This article notes that Lady de Rothschild was worth $ 100 million in 1998 … which was before she married Sir Evelyn Rothschild , of the British branch of the Rothschild financial dynasty , which is worth , well , lots .
So , on one hand , I suppose Lady de Rothschild might know what an elitist looks like .
On the other hand , her saying she does n’t like Obama because she thinks he is elitist is so full of rich and creamy clueless irony that I feel like every person in the country who makes less than a quarter million dollars a year ought to drop trou , face away from Lady de Rothschild , and tell her to kiss our base and common puckerguards .
Anyone who lives on a 3,200 acre estate that features an entrance hall “ notable for its large paintings by Thomas Gainsborough , George Romney , and Joshua Reynolds ” loses the ability to criticize anyone else in the entire goddamn universe for being “ elitist , ” particularly a dude who while growing up got to experience the joys of a food stamp dinner .
Yes , Barack Obama is part of the elite , and may even be an elitist .
Fine .
But , you know what , there ’s “ graduate from good schools and work hard in public service ” elite , and then there ’s “ make millions in corporate America and marry into the family that owned the mortgage on Europe ” elite .
Those are two entirely different sorts of elite .
Guess which one does n’t get to call the other “ elitist ” like it ’s a smear .
Forget crop circles , this incredible sand drawing spans THREE MILES of desert
Spiralling off across the Nevada desert , these huge geometric shapes are an amazing three miles in diameter .
Created using only common garden implements and wooden sticks , the stunning creation is the most ambitious of many sand sculptures made by 47 - year - old Jim Denevan .
True grit : US artist Jim Denevan walked in circles for more than 100 miles to make the massive piece of sand art in the Nevada Desert
Making three trips to Nevada 's scorching Black Rock salt plain and taking a total of nine days , the Californian artist walked more than 100 miles scraping his designs onto the desert floor .
Denevan discovered his talent for sand art more than ten years ago when he idly picked up a stick and drew a 12ft long fish .
Since then he has created more than 600 sand drawings and walked at least 1,800 miles .
Optical illusion : Another sand picture appears to stand directly upright from the California beach where he drew it
' I just picked up a stick and started to make shapes , ' he said .
' Before long I had covered the beach in animals , cars , volcanoes ... you name it !'
A stranger later pointed out similarities between Denevan 's work and Zen Buddhist gardens , suggesting the artist use a rake as his primary tool .
Denevan , who has exhibited his work in galleries , also compares Britain 's complex crop circle shapes .
' They seem to be a bit more geometric than my designs and I guess they are planned in advance .
I just turn up on the sand and start to create an image off the top of my head , ' he said .
Art 's a beach : Strollers are dwarfed by another Denevan piece
On beaches his work gets such a positive reaction that he has even found himself being told to leave it alone by strangers who do n't realise he 's the artist .
' I once finished a picture and was on my way home and realised that I had forgotten my jacket .
When I went back , people on a cliff above the picture shouted at me to get off it .
I had to shout back that it was me who had drawn it , ' Denevan said .
But the temporary nature of the pieces is one of the attractions for him .
' I love to complete a piece just as the tide comes in so that in that moment it is finished and destroyed , ' he added .

A number of folks have asked me how to " implement the ASP.
NET File Upload Control " except using ASP .
NET MVC .
This is a really interesting question for a number of reasons and a great opportunity to explore some fundamentals .
First , ASP.NET MVC is different since we do n't get to use ASP .
NET Server Controls as we 're used to them .
There 's no " server controls " in the way that we 're used to them .
Second , it'd be important to write Unit Tests for something like File Upload , and since ASP .
NET MVC tries to be Unit Test friendly , it 's an interesting problem to do tests .
Why is it interesting ?
Well , ASP.NET MVC sits on top of ASP .
NET .
That means ASP .
NET MVC did n't do any special work for File Upload support .
It uses whatever stuff is built into ASP .
NET itself .
This may or not be helpful or interesting or even easy to test .
It seems then , that this is a good exercise in understanding a number of things :
HTTP and How File Upload works via HTTP
What ASP.NET offers for to catch File Uploads
How to Mock things that are n't really Mock Friendly
And ultimately , How to do File Upload with ASP.
NET MVC
Here we go .
HTTP and How File Upload works via HTTP
It 's always better , for me , to understand WHY and HOW something is happening .
If you say " just because " or " whatever , you just add that , and it works " then I think that 's sad .
For some reason while many folks understand FORM POSTs and generally how form data is passed up to the server , when a file is transferred many just conclude it 's magic .
Why do we have to add enctype=" multipart / form=data " on our forms that include file uploads ?
Because the form will now be POSTed in multiple parts .
If you have a form like this :
< form action= " /home/uploadfiles " method= " post " enctype=" multipart/form-data " >
< label for = " file " >
Filename :</ label >
< input type =" file " name = " file " id = " file " />< br />
< input type =" submit " name = " submit " value = " Submit " />
</ form >
The resulting Form POST will look like this ( slightly simplified ) :
POST /home / uploadfiles HTTP/1.1
Content - Type : multipart / form- data ; boundary=---------------------------7d81b516112482
Accept -Encoding : gzip , deflate
User -Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 7.0 ; Windows NT 6.0 ; WOW64 )
Content - Length : 324
-----------------------------7d81b516112482
Content - Disposition : form - data ; name = " file " ; filename= " \\ SERVER\Users\Scott\Documents\test.txt "
Content - Type : text / plain
foo
-----------------------------7d81b516112482
Content - Disposition : form - data ; name = " submit "
Submit
-----------------------------7d81b516112482--
Notice a few things about this POST .
First , notice the content - type and boundary= " " and how the boundary is used later , as exactly that , a boundary between the multiple parts .
See how the first part shows that I uploaded a single file , of type text / plain .
You can interpolate from this how you 'd expect multiple files to show up if they were all POSTed at once .
And of course , look at how different this would look if it were just a basic form POST without the enctype=" multipart / form=data " included :
POST /home / uploadfiles HTTP/1.1
Content - Type : application/x-www-form-urlencoded
UA - CPU : x86
Accept -Encoding : gzip , deflate
User -Agent : Mozilla / 4.0 ( compatible ; MSIE 7.0 ; Windows NT 6.0 ; WOW64 )
Content - Length : 13
submit=Submit
See how the content type is different ?
This is a regular , typical form POST .
Perhaps atypical in that it includes only a Submit button !
The point is , when folks add a ASP .
NET FileUpload Control to their designer , it 's useful to remember that you 're buying into an abstraction over something .
In this case , you 're using a control that promises to hide the whole multipart MIME way of looking at things , and that 's totally cool .
Back To Basics Tip
Know what your library is hiding from you and why you chose it .
As an aside , if you looked at an email of yours with multiple attached files , it would look VERY similar to the body of the first HTTP message as multipart MIME encoding is found everywhere , as is common with most good ideas .
What ASP.NET offers for to catch File Uploads
The FileUpload control is just a control that sits on top of a bunch of support for FileUploads in ASP .
NET , starting with the classes Request .
Files and HttpPosted File .
Those are the things that actually do the hold on to the parsed Files from an HTTP Request .
You can use them to get a hold of a stream ( a bunch of bytes in memory that are the file ) or just save the file .
Since we can't use ASP .
NET Server Controls in ASP.
NET MVC , we 'll use these classes instead .
Here 's how you usually grab all the files from an upload and save them :
foreach ( string file in Request .
Files )
{
HttpPostedFile hpf = Request . Files [ file ] as HttpPosted File ;
if ( hpf.ContentLength == 0 )
continue ;
string savedFileName = Path. Combine (
AppDomain.CurrentDomain .BaseDirectory ,
Path.GetFileName( hpf.FileName ) ) ;
hpf.SaveAs(savedFileName ) ;
}
Of course , you might want to change the directory and filename , maybe check the mimeType to allow only certain kinds of files , or check the length to limit your uploads , but this is the general idea .
Note that Request .
Files has been around since 1.x and is n't a strongly typed collection of anything , so the GetEnumerator ( ) of .
Files that we 're using in the foreach returns strings that are then used as keys into the Files [ ] indexer .
It 's a little wonky as it's old .
However , do n't let me get ahead of myself , let 's write the tests first !
How to Mock things that are n't really Mock Friendly
After creating a new ASP .
NET MVC Project and making sure to select a test framework , I 'll drop into a Controller Test and make a new TestMethod that kind of looks like I expect my method to be used .
[ TestMethod ]
public void FakeUploadFiles ( )

This is incomplete , though , as I 'm writing the tests before I the implementation exists .
I need to think about how this should be implemented , and as I learn what should be mocked , I need to go back and forth between the tests and the implementation .
If we tried to compile this test , it wo n't , until I add a few types and methods .
Once it actually compiles , but before I write the method itself , I 'll want to see it FAIL .
If you get a test to PASS on the first try , you do n't really know yet if it CAN fail .
Making it fail first proves that it 's broken .
Then you get to fix it .
Back To Basics Tip
Remember , in TDD , if it ai n't broke , you do n't get to fix it .
There 's a bit of a chicken and the egg because it 's unclear what will need to be mocked out until I start the implementation .
However , this draft method above generally says what I want to do .
I want to my controller to have a method called UploadFiles ( ) that will grab the uploaded files from Request .
Files , save them , then put a type in the ViewData saying which files were saved and how large they were .
Ok , take a breath .
The following code may look freaky , but it 's really cool actually .
You can use any Mock Framework you like , but I like Moq for it 's fluency .
We 're having to " mock " things because we need to lie to our controller , who 's expecting an HTTP Post , remember ?
It 's going to go and spin through Request .
Files and try to save each file .
Since we want to test this without the web server or web browser , we 'll want to tell the Moq framework about our expectations .
Back To Basics Tip
Be careful to mock context and assert outputs but do n't mock away the whole test !
I 've commented the code to explain ...

public void FakeUploadFiles ( )
{
// We 'll need mocks ( fake ) of Context , Request and a fake PostedFile

How to do File Upload with ASP.
NET MVC
Now , what is the least amount of code in our Controller do we need to write to make this test pass ?
Here we get to use the Request .
Files method that ASP.
NET ( not ASP. NET MVC ) has had for years , and use it as advertised .
It works in the tests and it works in production .
Important Note :
We have to use the HttpPostedFileBase class , rather than the HttpPosted File because every Request , Response , HttpContext and all related ASP.
NET intrinsic abstractions are one layer farther way in ASP .
NET MVC .
If you get an HttpRequest in ASP .
NET , then in ASP .
NET MVC at runtime ... you 'll get an HttpRequestWrapper while running under a Webserver
you 'll get a dynamically generated derived Mock of an HttpRequestBase while running outside a Webserver ( like inside a test ) when you 've made your own ControllerContext .
In each case , the instances you 'll get are both ( ultimately ) of type HttpRequestBase , but it's this extra layer of abstraction that makes ASP .
NET MVC easy to test and ASP .
NET WebForms less so .
I hope these Wrappers will be included in a future release of WebForms .
The fact that they live in the System .
Web.Abstractions.dll and not System .Web.Mvc.Abstractions.dll tells me someone has their eye on that particular ball .
At any rate , here 's the Controller that takes File Upload requests :
public class ViewDataUploadFilesResult
{
public string Name { get ; set ; }
public int Length { get ; set ; }
}
public class HomeController : Controller
{
public ActionResult UploadFiles ( )
{
var r = new List< ViewDataUploadFilesResult >( ) ;
foreach ( string file in Request .
Files )
{
HttpPostedFileBase hpf = Request . Files [ file ] as HttpPostedFileBase ;
if ( hpf.ContentLength == 0 )
continue ;
string savedFileName = Path. Combine (
AppDomain.CurrentDomain .BaseDirectory ,
Path.GetFileName( hpf.FileName ) ) ;
hpf.SaveAs(savedFileName ) ;
r.Add(new ViewDataUploadFilesResult ( )
{ Name = savedFileName ,
Length = hpf.ContentLength } ) ;
}
return View ( " Uploaded Files " , r ) ;
}
}
At the bottom where I ask for the " Uploaded Files " view , and I pass in my list of ViewDataUploadFilesResults .
This will appea in the ViewData .
Model property .
The View then displays them , and that 's ALL the View does .
< ul >
< % foreach ( ViewDataUploadFilesResult v in this .
ViewData.Model ) { %>
<%=String .Format( " < li>Uploaded : {0} totalling { 1} bytes .</li > " , v.Name, v.Length ) %>
<% } %>
</ul >
Conclusion
I always encourage people to take the little bit of time to use Fiddler or SysInternals or look at your call stack or just to take a breath and remind oneself , " so how is this supposed to work ? "
Otherwise , one is just cargo - cult programming .
This post was a long answer to the question " How do I do FileUpload with ASP.
NET MVC ? " but I feel better having written in this way .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Bombs killed nearly 40 people in Iraq on Thursday , including 20 at a tribal council meeting in Anbar province just days before the U.S. military transfers control of security for the vast western region to Iraqi forces .

The U.S. military said there were American troop casualties in the attack in Anbar but gave no details .
In the northern city of Mosul , a car bomb on a crowded street killed 18 people and wounded 80 near the office of the governor of surrounding Nineveh province , U.S. forces said .
Nineveh Governor Duraid Kashmula had just left his office to investigate damage caused by two rocket - propelled grenades when the car bomb went off .
The governor was unhurt .
Officials said the bomb may have been an assassination attempt .
Dramatic television pictures showed the bomb exploding near an old woman on the side of a street .
A hail of gunfire burst out as security guards opened fire .
Violence in Iraq fell to a four - year low last month , but there has been a spate of attacks in the past week , especially in and around Mosul , which the U.S. military has called Sunni Islamist al Qaeda ’s last major urban stronghold in Iraq .
The attacks suggest al Qaeda , significantly weakened after a wave of U.S. offensives in the past year , is not a spent force .
A U.S. military spokesman said the Mosul attack fitted a pattern of al Qaeda attacking Iraqis and Iraqi security forces .
The American military said al Qaeda was likely behind the suicide bombing against U.S. - backed Sunni Arab tribal leaders in the Anbar town of Garma , 30 km ( 20 miles ) northwest of Baghdad .
A police spokesman in the nearby city of Falluja said 20 people had been killed and 12 wounded .
A tribal leader , Mizher Mshawih , and the head of the district council , Kamal Abdul - Salam , were among those killed , he said , as well as three policemen .
Anbar was once the heartland of the Sunni Arab insurgency against U.S. forces and an al Qaeda haven .
In late 2006 , Sunni Arab tribal leaders , sick of al Qaeda ’s indiscriminate killing of civilians and harsh interpretation of Islam , joined with the U.S. military to expel the group .
Many al Qaeda fighters fled north , to provinces such as Nineveh .
Violence in Anbar has fallen so sharply that the province is scheduled to become the first Sunni Arab province to be transferred to Iraqi security control on Saturday .
It will be the 10th of Iraq ’s 18 provinces to revert to Iraqi control .
The previous nine have been Kurdish or Shi’ite .
ANBAR HANDOVER CEREMONY STILL ON
A U.S. military source in Anbar who declined to be identified said there were no immediate plans to postpone the handover date in response to the bombing .
“ We still have people planning for the event .
Obviously our senior commanders are always assessing , but as of right now , there is no change , ” he said .
The suicide bomber managed to get into a meeting between tribal leaders and Abdul - Salam , the district council chief .
The meeting was being held in the local council building .
Defence Ministry spokesman Major - General Mohammed al - Askari blamed al Qaeda for the surge of attacks in Mosul .
“ These are sleeper cells that seize any opportunity ...
There will be quick measures to end these attacks , ” Askari said , without elaborating .
Iraqi security forces stepped up a crackdown against al Qaeda last month in Mosul , Iraq ’s third largest city .
Militants have increasingly targeted Iraqi councils .
On Tuesday , a bomb killed 10 people , including two U.S. government employees and two U.S. soldiers , at a council meeting in the Baghdad stronghold of Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
On Monday , a gunman killed two U.S. soldiers and wounded three as they left a council meeting southeast of Baghdad .
U.S. forces said an American soldier was killed in eastern Baghdad on Wednesday by an armour - piercing roadside bomb .
It brought to eight the number of American troops killed in Iraq this week and the number killed in June to 26 .
That is up from 19 American soldiers killed in May , the lowest monthly total since the 2003 invasion .
More than 4,100 U.S. troops have been killed in Iraq .
Israeli paper publishes Obama 's wall note
The Israeli paper Maariv obtains the note Obama left at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and puts a photograph of it on its front page .
The handwriting , beneath the letterhead of the King David Hotel , does appear to be Obama's .
Visitors traditionally stick notes of prayer into the wall .
The note says :
Lord , Protect my family and me .
Forgive me my sins and help me guard against pride and despair .
Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just .
And make me an instrument of your will .
The paper reports that the note was taken by a yeshiva student who was at the wall at the time — a mark of how virtually nothing remains private .
The rabbi of the Western Wall , also known as the Wailing Wall , condemned its publication .
Scientists confirm that parts of earliest genetic material may have come from the stars
Scientists have confirmed for the first time that an important component of early genetic material which has been found in meteorite fragments is extraterrestrial in origin , in a paper published on 15 June 2008 .
The finding suggests that parts of the raw materials to make the first molecules of DNA and RNA may have come from the stars .
The scientists , from Europe and the USA , say that their research , published in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters , provides evidence that life 's raw materials came from sources beyond the Earth .
The materials they have found include the molecules uracil and xanthine , which are precursors to the molecules that make up DNA and RNA , and are known as nucleobases .
The team discovered the molecules in rock fragments of the Murchison meteorite , which crashed in Australia in 1969 .
They tested the meteorite material to determine whether the molecules came from the solar system or were a result of contamination when the meteorite landed on Earth .
The analysis shows that the nucleobases contain a heavy form of carbon which could only have been formed in space .
Materials formed on Earth consist of a lighter variety of carbon .
Lead author Dr Zita Martins , of the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London , says that the research may provide another piece of evidence explaining the evolution of early life .
She says :
" We believe early life may have adopted nucleobases from meteoritic fragments for use in genetic coding which enabled them to pass on their successful features to subsequent generations . "
Between 3.8 to 4.5 billion years ago large numbers of rocks similar to the Murchison meteorite rained down on Earth at the time when primitive life was forming .
The heavy bombardment would have dropped large amounts of meteorite material to the surface on planets like Earth and Mars .
Co-author Professor Mark Sephton , also of Imperial 's Department of Earth Science and Engineering , believes this research is an important step in understanding how early life might have evolved .
He added :
" Because meteorites represent left over materials from the formation of the solar system , the key components for life -- including nucleobases -- could be widespread in the cosmos .
As more and more of life 's raw materials are discovered in objects from space , the possibility of life springing forth wherever the right chemistry is present becomes more likely . "
Mr. Buffett is correct in his assertion that , on average , active management in a narrowly defined universe like the S&P ; 500 is destined to underperform market indexes .
That is a well - established fact in the context of traditional long - only investment management .
But applying the same argument to hedge funds is a bit of an apples - to - oranges comparison .
Having the flexibility to invest both long and short , hedge funds do not set out to beat the market .
Rather , they seek to generate positive returns over time regardless of the market environment .
They think very differently than do traditional “ relative - return ” investors , whose primary goal is to beat the market , even when that only means losing less than the market when it falls .
For hedge funds , success can mean outperforming the market in lean times , while underperforming in the best of times .
Through a cycle , nevertheless , top hedge fund managers have surpassed market returns net of all fees , while assuming less risk as well .
We believe such results will continue .
There is a wide gap between the returns of the best hedge funds and the average ones .
This differential affords sophisticated institutional investors , among them funds of funds , an opportunity to pick strategies and managers that these investors think will outperform the averages .
Funds of funds with the ability to sort the wheat from the chaff will earn returns that amply compensate for the extra layer of fees their clients pay .
As part of the discovery process in its $ 1 billion lawsuit against YouTube , Viacom asked for an astonishing array of information : the source code for the search functions that power Google and YouTube , the source code for YouTube 's new " Video ID " program , a complete set of every video ever removed from the site , databases containing information on every video ever hosted at YouTube , and a copy of every private video .
The judge has now ruled , saying no , no , yes , yes , and no .
Even with the limited discovery , some poor drone at YouTube can now look forward to weeks of copying information onto Viacom - provided hard drives .
Search source code
Source code disclosure for search functionality was an easy call to make .
Google insists that its algorithms are the product of more than " a thousand person - years of work " and remain a vital trade secret , and the judge agreed .
Viacom is trolling for evidence that Google / YouTube purposefully modified their algorithms to give preference to infringing work on YouTube , work that would apparently be more attractive to site visitors than videos of a two - year old snorting peas up his nose .
The judge notes , though , that Viacom has no evidence for the belief and says that " YouTube and Google should not be made to place this vital asset in hazard merely to allay speculation . "
Google 1 , Viacom 0 .
Video ID source code
YouTube 's recent Video ID system receives similar analysis .
The code ( the product of a mere 50,000 worker hours of engineering time ) scans incoming videos against a database of video fingerprints ; matches are flagged for human follow - up .
Viacom wants the code so that it can show YouTube what it " could be doing " to stop infringement ; in other words , Viacom will offer engineering advice to YouTube on how to design its systems .
Ruling ?
" The notion that examination of the source code might suggest how to make a better method of infringement is speculative . "
Google 2 , Viacom 0 .
Removed video clips
But Viacom did better when it came to accessing YouTube 's massive databases .
The first database requested contains all videos ever removed for any reason , which Viacom hopes will show just how many infringing videos YouTube has hosted over the years .
The massive database will " require a total of about five person - weeks of labor without unexpected glitches , as well as the dedication of expensive computer equipment and network bandwidth . "
The total number of videos here is " intimidating , " wrote the judge , but he granted Viacom 's request anyway .
Logging database
Next up is a 12TB database containing logging information on every video ever watched at YouTube .
Viacom wants to see just how often infringing clips were viewed , then compare this against noninfringing ones to prove its contention that YouTube , in the early days , was an engine powered mostly by the gasoline of illegal content .
The database will also show which username and IP address watched every video , a move with potential privacy implications .
The data set is large , but the judge noted that it could be slapped on three " over - the - shelf " 4TB drives .
Request granted , score tied at 2 - 2 .
Private account videos
Finally , Viacom wanted a copy of every video ever put up in a private account , hoping to show that these were a hotbed of piratical activity .
The judge said no , finding that disclosure of these non-public files would fall afoul of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.
Companies like YouTube cannot reveal such data stored on behalf of their users , even in a civil suit .
Viacom certainly swung for the fences with its discovery requests , but it appears to have hit a double off the back wall instead .
The logging database and the complete set of removed videos should serve as a steroid injection that Viacom can use next time it steps up to the plate .
YouTube continues to insist that it is protected by the DMCA 's " safe harbor " provisions .
Judging by the rate of progress in the case so far , we may know whether that 's accurate at some point in 2010 .
The melting of Briksdal Glacier in photos shot over the years .
Briksdal Glacier used to be the largest glacier on the European mainland , in Norway .
But due to global warming it has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former self .
Once a great tourist attraction of the Scandinavian peninsula , Briksdal Glacier is now no longer available for glacier tours .
As you can see from the photos the effects of global warming are undeniable and they say you can here the ice melting because of the caverns formed between the glacier and the rocks .
It ’s a tragedy , but , as always , nobody gives a damn and no one with some real power does anything about it .

New Technology Can Turn Heat Waste Into Electricity
July 25th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Great news on the power efficiency front : Scientists have invented a new material that can efficiently convert heat waste in cars , power generators , and heat pumps into electricity .
The new material is thermoelectric , and can turn heat into energy without any pollution .
The invention , thallium - doped lead telluride , is twice as efficient as the second most efficient material used in thermoelectric power .
The lead telluride creates electric power like a conventional heat engine coupled to an electric generator , but uses electrons as the working fluid instead of water or gas .
Additionally , it creates electricity directly .
Most importantly , the material is most effective between 450 and 950° Fahrenheit .
This is a typical temperature range for many power systems , including car engines .
Many experts argue that up to 60 percent of a gasoline engine ’s energy is lost through waste heat , so a thermoelectric device using lead telluride would be a welcome addition to any car .
Such devices have no moving parts ; this means that wear and tear is virtually non-existent .
Research project leader Joseph Heremans of Ohio State University is optimistic about the future of thermoelectric nanotechnology — he hopes to boost the efficiency rating of the new material by a factor of two .
For now , though , we can be content with the incredible new technology created by Heremans and team .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode

Just listening to CNN , one of the talking heads listed speculation in the oil markets as one of the reasons for high oil prices , the implication being that the situation would be better without speculation .
Let ’s be clear about what speculation is , it ’s people buying oil today , betting that its price will increase in the future , and in doing so they make the price increase today .
I would argue that speculation is generally a good thing , because it tends to make the future happen sooner than it otherwise would .
In other words , speculation is capitalism ’s foresight , it makes the markets try to predict the future , and adapt accordingly .
Of course , sometimes it can get out of control , where people start to speculate based on predictions that are themselves the result of speculation – as with various bubbles over the years , causing behavior that may be rational at the individual level be irrational at the group level .
In this case though , I think the high oil prices are likely to do what no amount of regulation would ever do in the US – which is to force people to find ways to use less oil , to force them to change their behavior .
Most people do n’t like to be forced to do anything .
A change of career can mean retraining , and sometimes a pay - cut .
A change of location means a lot of effort and money to move your stuff , not to mention waving goodbye to your social circle ( something I ’m painfully familiar with ) .
A change in your company ’s expenses can mean lower revenues until you figure out a way to compensate , and that may cost money .
Nonetheless , change is often necessary .
The alternative , which often involves protectionism or other forms of government manipulation of the market , tends to delay rather than prevent change and exaggerate the eventual trauma when it happens .
Look at the British miner ’s strikes in the 80s for an example of this .
Speculation , on the other hand , will tend to force change earlier than it might otherwise occur , and often make it occur more gently .
In the US , the high oil prices already have the automobile manufacturers scramling to catch up with their Japanese and European counterparts in - terms of fuel efficiency , something that can only be a good thing for our long - term future .
The End of Paid Links is Near
Author Note :
This is speculation and is not currently a tool Google offer ’s via Webmaster Tools .
It is merely the expected next - step in Google ’s fight against Paid Links .
It was my intent to help prepare SEO ’s for what I believe to be a huge blow to the Paid Links industry
To be honest , I am shocked that Google has not yet implemented such a technique , but after a few conversations , it appears that a Paid - Links killing system is in the works .
The solution is simple , elegant , and will silently poison all multi-site paid - link networks ( whether or not those networks are open or closed ) .
The method is quite simple : using Google Webmaster Tools , Google can easily allow webmasters to type in CSS classes or HTML elements within which all links are nofollowed .
Such as a system could deal a death blow to most paid - linking systems as neither the advertiser nor the advertising network would be able to efficiently determine whether the links being sold are nofollowed .
While Google can continue to use its traditional methods of targeting Paid Links , this system would cause an internal rift of trust within major link networks .
Advertisers may have to buy hundreds if not thousands of links to get the same impact and , subsequently , Google could use buyers whose links appear within nofollowed CSS classes to backtrack in finding other non-nofollowed link sellers .
While I have not been able to get true confirmation of such plans ( yeah , like Matt would let us know in advance ) , it seems like this is the inevitable next step in the fight against paid links .

TICKING BOMB TICKING BOMB Tim Russert 's heart disease erupted in a fatal chain reaction .
Here 's what his doctor says happened : 1 . Russert had been diagnosed with asymptomatic coronary artery disease , meaning the narrowing in the blood vessels that fed his heart did not cause significant pain or discomfort .
His relatively common form of heart disease was being controlled with medication and exercise .
2 . When a piece of cholesterol plaque ruptured inside the left anterior descending artery , it lodged in the vessel that is often called " the widowmaker " and blocked blood flow to much of the left ventricle , the heart 's main pumping chamber .
3 . The sudden coronary thrombosis , as the blockage is called , caused the heart 's electrical system to shortcircuit , creating a chaotic electrical storm known as ventricular fibrillation .
In V - fib , the heart quivers and does not pump blood to the rest of the body and , most important , the brain .
4 . Fire and emergency crews arrived on the scene three minutes after 911 was called and delivered shocks with a defibrillator .
But Russert was not revived .
Sources : Michael Newman , Russert 's personal physician , on CNN ; American Heart Association ; USA TODAY research by Bob Davis RISK FACTORS AND GUIDELINES RISK FACTORS AND GUIDELINES
The risk of a heart attack rises for men after the age of 45 and women over 55 , says cardiologist Sidney Smith , of the University of North Carolina , chairman of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology committee on guidelines for treating cardiovascular disease .
" Men in their late 50's and early 60's are at an age where a heart attack is a problem they need to be concerned with , " Smith says .
" If they have risk factors -- high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , history of smoking , excess weight -- the risk goes higher . "
Unfortunately , Smith says , for all of medicine 's success at identifying heart attack and cardiac arrest risk factors , the science still falls short at predicting when trouble 's " just around the corner . "
He says it 's impossible to figure out what happened in Russert 's case without knowing more about Russert 's medical history and risk factors for heart disease .
Smith says that current CPR guidelines say that rescuers who are not trained in rescue breathing should concentrate on chest compressions , which help circulate blood to the brain and thus keep the victim alive until paramedics arrive .
Trained rescuers should apply both to oxygenate the blood and keep it flowing .

For all their differences , NBC newsman Tim Russert and famed marathoner Jim Fixx , author of the 1977 best - seller The Complete Book of Running , have two things in common : Each died of a massive heart attack while still in his 50s .
Neither one saw it coming .
Russert , 58 , died Friday while recording voice - overs for Meet the Press , anchored , as usual , to a desk .
Fixx , 52 , died on July 20 , 1984 after a daily run in rural Hardwick , Vt . Such cases provide tragic proof that though you can lower your risk of sudden death , you can't always prevent it , says Robert Califf , vice chancellor of clinical research at Duke University in Durham , N.C.

Russert 's death is a wake - up call to thousands of men who never thought they might be courting a coronary , says Cam Patterson , chief of cardiology at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill .
" You would n't believe the calls we 've been getting , " Patterson says .
" Here 's an example of a high - profile person who everyone thought was healthy .
When someone like that has a medical catastrophe , it causes everyone to focus . "
Warning signs
Both men had ample warning they were prime candidates for heart attacks .
Russert had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease , his doctor told MSNBC .
Fixx had a terrifying family history , including a father who had a fatal heart attack in his early 40s .
And both took steps to reduce their odds of the same fate .
Russert 's doctor , Michael Newman , prescribed medication and exercise .
He told MSNBC that Russert performed well on a stress test in April .
Fixx , who reached the height of his fame before cholesterol - lowering drugs were widely available , changed his diet , laced up his running shoes and ate up the miles .
Russert 's death seemed all the more shocking for the era in which it occurred , one of rising optimism about potent cholesterol - lowering drugs and decreasing death rates from heart disease .
Just over a year ago , a team led by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the death rate from heart disease in the USA has dropped by 50 % from 1980 to 2000 , thanks to improvements in medical treatment and a reduction in risk factors .
The researchers credited those advances — including intensive cholesterol - lowering and blood pressure control for heart attack patients and a drop in smoking rates — with saving an estimated 341,000 lives that would have been lost to heart disease if conditions in 1980 had persisted .
For all those advances , however , medical science still has no definitive way to tell in a given individual when " something 's just around the corner , " says cardiologist Sidney Smith at UNC .
The different tests at doctors ' fingertips provide varying amounts of information but not , typically , what doctors and patients most want to know .
For instance , a routine stress test , performed using a combination of a treadmill and electrocardiogram , can disclose heart rhythm abnormalities that occur during exercise when blockages prevent the heart 's blood supply from meeting its growing demand .
Nuclear and ultrasound stress tests produce cloudy images and information on heart function .
CT heart scans , a series of rapid - fire X - rays , reveal calcified blockages in the coronary arteries .
None reveals an imminent heart attack .
The best indicators , Califf says , are standard risk factors for heart disease : blood pressure , cholesterol , smoking , diabetes , stress , diet , exercise and abdominal obesity .
Reliable , not perfect , data Plugged into a formula called the Framingham Risk Score , the risk factors provide reliable odds of a person 's heart attack risk .
The odds are derived from real world experience — an ongoing , 60 - year - old heart study among thousands of residents of Framingham , Mass .
But the Framingham score is imperfect , too .
Half of all heart attacks occur in people who have no risk factors and 20 % in people with no major risk factors .
The reason lies in the biology of the coronary artery .
In landmark research , Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic has shown that when cholesterol begins collecting in artery walls , it pushes them outward , not into the channel where blood flows .
So many patients — Russert included — experience no symptoms of heart disease .
Heart attacks occur when a plaque becomes inflamed and bursts , sending blood clots and debris downstream to lodge in arteries supplying the heart .
Standard diagnostic tests do n't reveal these inflamed cholesterol deposits or plaques .
Over the past few years , researchers led by Paul Ridker of Harvard have shown that testing for a chemical signal of inflammation , called C- reactive protein , or CRP , can add predictive power .
But many heart attacks are still unpredictable .
Russert 's is a textbook example .
Making positive changes UNC's Patterson says allowing fatalism to grow out of the uncertainty is the wrong thing to do , because you can dramatically reduce the odds that you 'll be next by reducing the risk factors .
" I try to eat well , avoid fatty foods , eat seafood a couple of times a week , " he says .
" I do n't smoke .
I have a regular exercise regimen .
I run three or four times a week .
I try to build it into my lifestyle . "
Not making such practices a permanent change is " a big mistake people make , " he says .
" It needs to be the thing you do on a daily basis .
" If there 's one key message I try to get home to people , it 's this , " Patterson says .
" There 's great news .
Over the last 30 years , we 've substantially reduced deaths from heart disease in the U.S.
" But it 's still the leading cause of deaths and disability .
Half the people who are walking around are going to die at some point of heart disease . "
Enlarge By Charles Dharapak , AP Tim Russert speaks in November 2007 at the 60th anniversary celebration of Meet the Press at the Newseum in Washington .
Russert took steps to decrease his risk of heart attack , but he collapsed and died at work on June 13 .

A very common C technique for reinterpreting data types has the potential to cause nasty bugs .
Apple knows this , which is why the implementation of NSRectToCGRect ( correctly ) does n't do what the documention claims .
I show you a technique to perform reinterpret casts safely in your own code .
Apple 's documentation for the function NSRectToCGRect claim that it is implemented as follows :
CGRect NSRectToCGRect ( NSRect nsrect ) { return ( * ( CGRect * ) & ( nsrect ) ) ; }
If you have seen a lot of C code , chances are that you 've seen this approach before .
You can't cast one struct to another to reinterpret — even if they have the same fields — so it is common to see reinterpreting by making a pointer and casting the pointer .
The implication is that NSRectToCGRect reinterprets an NSRect as a CGRect without altering the contained data .
While the implied functionality is accurate , the displayed implementation is not .
In actuality , the function looks like this :
NS_INLINE CGRect NSRectToCGRect ( NSRect nsrect ) { union _ { NSRect ns ; CGRect cg ; } ; return ( ( union _ * ) & nsrect ) -> cg ; }
Why the difference ?
Why bother creating a union ?
Why should n't you simply cast through a pointer ?
Type punning
As common as casting through a pointer is , it is actually bad practice and potentially risky code .
Casting through a pointer has the potential to create bugs because of type punning .
Type punning
A form of pointer aliasing where two pointers and refer to the same location in memory but represent that location as different types .
The compiler will treat both " puns " as unrelated pointers .
Type punning has the potential to cause dependency problems for any data accessed through both pointers .
Most of the time , type punning wo n't cause any problems .
It is considered undefined behavior by the C standard but will usually do the work you expect .
That is unless you 're trying to squeeze more performance out of your code through optimizations .
Specifically , if you ever turn on " Enforce Strict Aliasing " in XCode ( a.k.a - fstrict_aliasing in GCC ) you run the risk of unpredictable and errant behavior .
With strict aliasing , the compiler may start doing things in the wrong order or leaving instructions out entirely .
To be clear , these bugs can only occur if you dereference both pointers ( or otherwise access their shared data ) within a single scope or function .
Just creating a pointer should be safe .
An example of a punning bug
Before the NSRectToCGRect function existed , I had some code which did the following :
NSRect ellipseBounds ; ellipseBounds . origin . x = 0 ; ellipseBounds . origin . y = 0 ; ellipseBounds . size .
width = WIDGET_SIZE - 1.0 ; ellipseBounds . size .
height = WIDGET_SIZE - 1.0 ; ellipseBounds = NSInsetRect ( ellipseBounds , 4 , 4 ) ; CGContextAddEllipseInRect ( context , * ( CGRect * ) & ellipseBounds ) ; CGContextFillPath ( context ) ;
This code creates and sets up an NSRect and then reinterprets it as a CGRect before using it .
In this case , with - fstrict_aliasing enabled , GCC chose to order the NSInsetRect after the call to CGContextAddEllipseInRect because the dependency between the two was broken by type punning when the pointer to ellipseBounds was dereferenced as a different type .
Union solves the problem
The traditional solution to this problem , to allow the code to be correct with - fstrict_aliasing enabled , is to use a union .
As shown in the NSRectToCGRect code , the union should contain the source and destination types and you simply set or cast to the source type before reading from the destination type .
According to the C standard , anything involving type punning is implementation specific .
So in a " standard " sense , using a union does n't necessarily solve the problem .
According to the standard , if you set data in a union on one field , you are required to read back from the same field .
Fortunately , GCC explicitly gives permission to do different .
From the GCC documentation :
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most recently written to ( called “ type- punning ” ) is common .
Even with - fstrict - aliasing , type - punning is allowed , provided the memory is accessed through the union type .
Excellent .
A macro to reinterpret your own data safely
Really simple :
# define UNION_CAST(x , destType ) \ ( ( ( union {__typeof__ ( x ) a ; destType b;} ) x ) . b )
This example now incorporates the " __typeof__ " suggestion made by Daniel Néri in the comments .
So you could cast a float variable named my Float to an int as follows :
int my Int = UNION_CAST ( my Float , int ) ;
You might notice that I do n't bother with an inline function , I do n't give the union a name , and I do n't make a pointer to the value before casting .
The Apple NSRectToCGRect function did these things but they are unnecessary .
Although , since the compiler should optimize away the extra work , the function , the extra pointer and the dereference in Apple 's code should n't matter .
Conclusion
Creating a pointer to a value and recasting the pointer to a new type is the most common way to reinterpret data in C that I 've seen .
Despite its prevalence , you should n't do it .
Always do your reinterpret casts through a union .
It could save you a lot of trouble if you 're ever trying to squeeze performance through compiler options .
When unveiling new performance models , car companies usually boast about horsepower , engine size and expected zero - to - 60 times .
But when General Motors unveiled the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro Monday afternoon , it was the car 's fuel economy numbers that were front and center .
It 's the return of a once - popular model that has been out of production since the 2002 model year .
V6 versions , which GM expects will be the biggest sellers , are expected to get 26 miles per gallon on the highway .
That 's about the same as a V6 Ford Mustang , while boasting the same horsepower output as a V8 Mustang .
The Camaro SS , powered by a 6.2 - liter V8 engine , will get about 23 mpg on the highway , according to GM .
Again , that matches the V8 Mustang GT with up to 40 % more power .
( The Camaro will be a heavier car than the Mustang , however . )
Of course , since this is a Camaro , GM also touted the car 's performance credentials while also offering a first glimpse of its retro-styled interior .
I have seen hell , and it is indisputably on Rinca Island in Indonesia .
This Komodo dragon - infested spot is where three British divers who got caught in a rip tide washed up last week .
Far from being " misunderstood " reptiles who only " occasionally " attack humans , as my G2 colleague Jon Henley described them afterwards , the Rinca dragons engage in what must be the vilest animal practices ever witnessed by man .
I met three particularly nasty ones last year .
We had walked past a few harmless - looking dragons sunning themselves in the bush or lurking under the stilts of houses , and were not beyond thinking we could be friends when we reached a water hole .
A large buffalo was lying on its side , clearly having been brought down by two 6ft dragons and one that was even larger .
The three reptiles were crawling over it , and during the next 24 hours they proceeded to eat it alive .
The first dragon had grabbed it by its testicles and was starting to chew its way into the body from below .
The second dragon was slowly forcing the buffalo's head open and was going down its throat .
The third was , as they say , going in the back door .
To make an already grisly scene far worse , the whole slow - motion kill was being conducted in deep mud .
After a few hours all was black - apart from the blood that occasionally bubbled up from the muddy depths , the white saliva that sometimes oozed from the buffalo's mouth and the bright , flickering forked tongues of the three dragons , which were forever darting around .
Slippery things slithered slowly over other slippery things until it was hard to tell whose tail was whose , where one body started and another stopped and who was doing what to whom .
The smell was fetid , the heat intense .
Every so often the buffalo shuddered and tried to rise .
Was it really still alive ?
We watched from a few feet away , our guide armed only with a stick , transfixed and disgusted like us .
Our stomachs heaved .
The buffalo continued to twitch .
We left and returned several times ; each time the horror was more complete .
The next day , two Americans told us that the three dragons had got deep inside the buffalo , which was still twitching .

NOTE :
This article was originally written as an official paper of the Autonomous Confederation - American Indian Movement .
It was passed along to me by AIM Colorado ... a member of the Autonomous Confederation .
A substantial number of American Indians have protested that use of native names , images and symbols as sports team mascots and the like is , by definition , a virulently racist practice .
Given the historical relationship between Indians and non-Indians during what has been called the " Conquest of America , " American Indian Movement leader ( and American Indian Anti-Defamation Council founder ) Russell Means has compared the practice to contemporary Germans naming their soccer teams the " Jews , " Hebrews , " and " Yids , " while adorning their uniforms with grotesque caricatures of Jewish faces taken from the Nazis ' anti-Semetic propoganda of the 1930's .
Numerous demonstrations have occurred in conjunction with games - most notably during the November 15 , 1992 match - up between the Chiefs and Redskins in Kansas City - by angry Indians and their supporters .
In response , a number of players - especially African Americans and other minority athletes - have been trotted out by professional team owners like Ted Turner , as well as university and public school officials , to announce that they mean not to insult but to honor native people .
They have been joined by the television networks and most major newspapers , all of which have editorialized that Indian discomfort with the situation is " no big deal , " insisting that the whole things is just " good , clean fun . "
The country needs more such fun , they 've argued , and a " few disgruntled Native Americans " have no right to undermine the nation 's enjoyment of it 's leisure time by complaining .
This is especially the case , some have argued , " in hard times like these . "
It has even been contended that Indian outrage at being systematically degraded - rather than the degradation itself - creates " a serious barrier to the sort of intergroup communication so necessary in a multicultural society such as ours . "
Okay .
let 's communicate .
We are frankly dubious that those advancing such positions really believe their own rhetoric but , just for the sake of argument , let 's accept the premise that they are sincere .
If what they say is true , then is n't it time we spread such " inoffensiveness " and " good cheer " around among all the groups so that everybody can participate equally in fostering the national round of laughs they call for ?
Sure it is - the country can't have too much fun or " intergroup " involvement - so the more , the merrier .
Simple consistency demands that anyone who thinks the Tomahawk Chop is a swell pastime must be just as hearty in their endorsement of the following ideas - by the logic used to defend the defamation of American Indians - should help us all really start yukking it up .
First , as a counterpart to the Redskins , we need an NFL team called " Niggers " to honor Afro-Americans .
Half - time festivities for fans might include a simulated stewing of the opposing coach in a large pot while players and cheerleaders dance around it , garbed in leopard skins and wearing fake bones in their noses .
This concept obviously goes along with the kind of gaiety attending the Chop , but also with the actions of the Kansas Chiefs , whose team members - prominently including black members - lately appeared on a poster , looking " fierce " and " savage " by way of wearing Indian regalia .
Just a bit of harmless " morale boosting , " says the Chief 's front office .
You bet .
So that the newly - formed Niggers sports club wo n't end up too out of sync while expressing the " spirit " and " identity " of Afro-Americans in the above fashion , a baseball franchise - let 's call this one the " Sambos " - should be formed .
How about a basketball team called the " spearchuckers / "
A hockey team called the " Jungle Bunnies / "
Maybe the " essence of these teams could be depicted by images of tiny black faces adorned with huge pairs of lips .
The players could appear on TV every week or so gnawing on chicken legs and spitting watermelon seeds at one another .
Catchy , eh ?
Well , there 's " nothing to be upset about , " according to those who love wearing " war bonnets " to the Super Bowl or having " Chief Illiniwik " dance around the sports arenas of Urbana , Illinois .
And why stop there ?
There are plenty of other groups to include .
" Hispanics ? "
They can be " represented " by the Galveston " Greasers " and the San Diego " Spics , " at least until the Wisconsin " Wetbacks " and Baltimore " Beaners " get off the ground .
Asian Americans ?
How about the " slopes , " " Dinks , " " Gooks , " and " Zipperheads ? "
Owners of the latter teams might get their logo ideas from editorial page cartoons printed in the nation 's newspapers during World War II : slanteyes , buck teeth , big glasses , but nothing racially insulting or derogatory , according to the editors and artists involved at the time .
Indeed , this Second World War - vintage stuff can be seen as just another barrel of laughs at least by what current editors say are their " local standards " concerning American Indians .
Let 's see .
Who 's been left out Teams like the Kansas City " Kikes , " Hanover " Honkies , " San Leandro " Shylock , " Daytona " Dagos , " and Pittsburg " Polacks " will fill a certain social void among white folk .
Have a religious belief ?
Let 's all go for the gusto and gear up the Milwaukee " Mackeral Snappers " and Hollywood " Holy Rollers . "
The Fighting Irish of Notre Dame can be rechristened the " Drunken Irish " or " Papist Pigs . "
Issues of gender and sexual preference can be addressed through creation of teams like the St. Louis " Sluts , " Boston " Bimbos , " Detroit " Dykes , " and the Fresno " Fags . "
How about the Gainsville " Gimps " and the richmond " Retards , " so the physically and mentally impaired wo n't be excluded from our fun and games ?
Now , do n't go getting " overly sensitive " out there .
None of this is dreaming or insulting , at least not when it 's being done to Indians .
Just ask the folks who are doing it , or their apologists like Andy Rooney in the national media .
They 'll tell you - as in fact they have been telling you - that there 's no been no harm done , regardless of what their victims think , feel , or say .
The situation is exactly the same as when those with precisely the same mentality used to insist that Step ' n ' Fetchit was okay , or Rochester on the Jack Benny show , or Amos and Andy , Charlie Chan , the Frito Bandito , or any other cutesy symbols making up the lexicon of American racism .
Have we communicated yet ?
Let 's get just a little bit real here .
The notion of " fun " embodied in rituals like the Tomahawk Chop must be understood for what it is .
There 's not a single non-Indian example used above which can be considered socially acceptable in even the most marginal sense .
The reasons are obvious enough .
So why is it different where American Indians are concerned ?
One can only conclude that , in contrast to the other groups at issue , Indians are ( falsely ) perceived as being too few , and therefore too weak , to defend themselves effectively against racist and otherwise offensive behavior .
Fortunately , there are some glimmers of hope .
A few teams and their fans have gotten the message and have responded appropriately .
Stanford University , which opted to drop the name " Indians " from , has experienced no resulting drop in attendance .
Meanwhile , the local newspaper in Portland , Oregon recently decided its long - standing editorial policy prohibiting use of racial epithets should include derogatory teams names .
The Redskins , for instance , are now referred to as " the Washington team , " and will continued to be described in this way until the franchise adopts an inoffensive moniker ( newspaper sales in Portland have suffered no decline as a result ) .
Such examples are to be applauded and encouraged .
They stand as figurative beacons in the night , proving beyond all doubt that it is quite possible to indulge in the pleasure of athletics without accepting blatant racism into the bargain .
Nuremburg Precedents
On October 16 , 1946 , a man named Julius Stricher mounted the steps of a gallows .
Moments later he was dead , the sentence of an international tribunal composed of representatives of the United States , France , Great Britain , and the Soviet Union having been imposed .
Streicher 's body was then cremated , and - so horrendous were his crimes thought to have been - his ashes dumped into an unspecified German river so that " no one should ever know a particular place to go for reasons of mourning his memory . "
Julius Streicher had been convicted at Nuremberg , Germany of what were termed " Crimes Against Humanity . "
The lead prosecutor in his case ­ Justice Robert Jackson of the United States Supreme Court ­ had not argued that the defendant had killed anyone , nor that he had personally committed any especially violent act .
Nor was it contended that Streicher had held any particularly important position in the German government during the period in which the so called Third Reich had exterminated some 6,000,000 Jews , as well as several million Gypsies , Poles , Slavs , homosexuals , and other untermenschen ( subhumans ) .
The sole offense for which the accused was ordered put to death was in having served as publisher / editor of a Bavarian tabloid entitled Der Sturmer during the early - to - mid 1930s , years before the Nazi genocide actually began .
In this capacity , he had penned a long series of virulently anti-Semetic editorials and ' ' news . "
Stories , usually accompanied by cartoons and other images graphically depicting Jews in extraordinarily derogatory fashion .
This , the prosecution asserted , had done much to " dehumanize " the targets of his distortion in the mind of the German public .
In turn , such dehumanization had made it possible ­ or at least easier ­ for average Germans to later indulge in the outright liquidation of Jewish " vermin . "
The tribunal agreed , holding that Streicher was therefore complicit in genocide and deserving of death by hanging .
During his remarks to the Nuremburg tribunal , Justice Jackson observed that , in implementing its sentences , the participating powers were morally and legally binding themselves to adhere forever after to the same standards of conduct that were being applied to Streicher and the other Nazi leaders .
In the alternative , he said , the victorious allies would have committed " pure murder ' at Nuremberg ­ no different in substance from that carried out by those they presumed to judge ­ rather than establishing the " permanent benchmark for justice " which was intended .
Yet in the United States of Robert Jackson , the indigenous American Indian population had already been reduced , in a process which is ongoing to this day , from perhaps 12.5 million in the year 1500 to fewer than 250,000 by the beginning of the 20th century .
This was accomplished , according to official sources , " largely through the cruelty of Euro American settlers , " and an informal but clear governmental policy which had made it an articulated goal to " exterminate these red vermin " or at least whole segments of them .
Bounties had been placed on the scalps of Indians ­ any Indians ­ in places as diverse as Georgia , Kentucky , Texas , the Dakotas , Oregon , and California and had been maintained until resident Indian populations were decimated or disappeared altogether .
Entire peoples such as the Cherokee had been reduced to half their size through a policy of forced removal from their homelands east of the Mississippi River to what were then considered less preferable areas in the West .
Others , such as the Navajo , suffered the same fate while under military guard for years on end .
The United States Army had also perpetrated a long series of wholesale massacres of Indians at places like Horseshoe Bend , Bear River , Sand Creek , the Washita River , the Marias River , Camp Robinson and Wounded Knee .
Through it all , hundreds of popular novels - each competing with the next to make Indians appear more grotesque , menacing , and inhuman - were sold in the tens of millions of copies in the U.S. Plainly , the Euro American public was being conditioned to see Indians in such a way so as to allow their eradication to continue .
And continue it did until the Manifest Destiny of the U.S ­ a direct precursor to what Hitler would subsequently call Lebensraumpolitik ( the politics of living space ) was consummated .
By 1900 , the national project of " clearing " Native Americans from their land and replacing them with " superior " Anglo American settlers was complete ; the indigenous population had been reduced by as much as 98 percent while approximately 97.5 percent of their original territory had '' passed ' ' to the invaders .
The survivors had been concentrated , out of sight and mind of the public , on scattered " reservations , " all of them under the self - assigned " plenary " ( full ) power of the federal government .
There was , of course , no Nuremberg - style tribunal passing judgment on those who had fostered such circumstances in North America .
No U.S. official or private citizen was ever imprisoned ­ never mind hanged ­ for implementing or propagandizing what had been done .
Nor had the process of genocide afflicting Indians been completed .
Instead , it merely changed form .
Between the 1880s and the 1980s , nearly half of all Native American children were coercively transferred from their own families , communities , and cultures to those of the conquering society .
This was done through compulsory attendance at remote boarding schools , often hundreds of miles from their homes , where native children were kept for years on end while being systematically ' " deculturated " ( indoctrinated to think and act in the manner of Euro Americans rather than as Indians ) .
It was also accomplished through a pervasive foster home and adoption program ­ including - blind adoptions , where children would be permanently denied information as to who they were / are and where they 'd come from - placing native youths in non-Indian homes .
The express purpose of all this was to facilitate a U.S. governmental policy to bring about the " assimilation " ( dissolution ) of indigenous societies .
In other words , Indian cultures as such were to be caused to disappear .
Such policy objectives are directly contrary to the United Nations 1948 Convention on Punishment and Prevention of the Crime of Genocide , an element of international law arising from the Nuremburg proceedings .
The forced " transfer of the children " of a targeted " racial , ethnical , or religious group " is explicitly prohibited as a genocidal activity under the Convention 's second article .
Article II of the Genocide Convention also expressly prohibits involuntary sterilization as a means of '' preventing births among " a targeted population .
Yet , in 1975 , it was conceded by the U.S. government that its Indian Health Service ( IHS ) then a subpart of the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) , was even then conducting a secret program of involuntary sterilization that had affected approximately 40 percent of all Indian women .
The program was allegedly discontinued , and the IHS was transferred to the Public Health Service , but no one was punished .
In 1990 , it came out that the IHS was inoculating , Inuit children in Alaska with Hepatitis - B vaccine .
The vaccine had already been banned by the World Health Organization as having demonstrated a correlation with the HIV - Syndrome which is itself correlated to AIDS .
As this is written [ March , 1993 ] , a " field test " of Hepatitis - A vaccine , also HIV - correlated , is being conducted on Indian reservations in the northern plains region .
The Genocide Convention makes it a crime against " humanity " to create conditions leading to the destruction of an identifiable human group , as such .
Yet the BIA has utilized the government 's plenary prerogatives to negotiate mineral leases " on behalf of " Indian peoples paying a fraction of standard royalty rates .
The result has been " super profits " for a number of preferred U.S. corporations .
Meanwhile , Indians , whose reservations ironically turned out to be in some of the most mineral - rich areas of North America , which makes us , the nominally wealthiest segment of the continent 's population , live in dire poverty .
By the government 's own data in the mid-1980s , Indians received the lowest annual and lifetime per capita incomes of any aggregate population group in the United States .
Concomitantly , we suffer the highest rate of infant mortality , death by exposure and malnutrition , disease , and the like .
Under such circumstances , alcoholism and other escapist forms of substance abuse are endemic in the Indian community , a situation which leads both to a general physical debilitation of the population and a catastrophic accident rate .
Teen suicide among Indians is several times the national average
The average life expectancy of a reservation - based Native American man is barely 45 years ; women can expect to live less than three years longer .
Such itemizations could be continued at great length , including matters like the radioactive contamination of large portions of contemporary Indian Country , the forced relocation of traditional Navajos , and so on .
But the point should be made : Genocide , as defined in international law , is a continuing fact of day - to - day life ( and death ) for North America 's native peoples .
Yet there has been ­ and is ­ only the barest flicker of public concern about or even consciousness of , this reality .
Absent any serious expression of public outrage , no one is punished and the process continues .
A salient reason for public acquiescence before the ongoing holocaust in Native North America has been a continuation of the popular legacy , often through more effective media .
Since 1925 , Hollywood has released more than 2,000 films , many of them rerun frequently on television , portraying Indians as strange , perverted , ridiculous , and often dangerous things of the past .
Moreover , we are habitually presented to mass audiences one - dimensionally , devoid of recognizable human motivations and emotions : Indians thus serve as props , little more .
We have thus been thoroughly and systematically dehumanized .
Nor is this the extent of it .
Everywhere we are used as logos , as mascots , as jokes : " Big Chief " writing tablets , " Red Man " chewing tobacco , " Winnebago , " campers . , " Navajo " and " Cherokee " and " Pontiac " and " Cadillac " pickups and automobiles .
There are the Cleveland " Indians , " the Kansas City " Chiefs , " the Atlanta " Braves " and the Washington " Redskins " professional sports teams ­ not to mention those in thousands of colleges , high schools , and elementary schools across the country each with their own degrading caricatures and parodies of Indians and or things Indian .
Pop fiction continues in the same vein including an unending stream of New Age manuals purporting to expose the inner works of indigenous spirituality in everything from pseudo - philosophical to do - it - yourself styles .

In effect , a concerted , sustained , and in some ways accelerating effort has gone into making Indians unreal .
It is thus of obvious importance that the American public begin to think about the implications of such things the next time they witness a gaggle of face - painted and war - bonneted buffoons doing the " Tomahawk Chop " at a baseball or football game .
It is necessary that they think about the implications of the grade - school teacher adorning their child in turkey feathers to commemorate Thanksgiving .

Think about why Land - o - Lakes finds it appropriate to market its butter with the stereotyped image of an " Indian princess " on the wrapper .
Think about what it means when non-lndian academics profess ­ as they often do ­ to " know more about Indians than Indians do themselves . "
Think about the significance of charlatans like Carlos Castaneda and Jamake Highwater and Mary Summer Rain and Lynn Andrews churning out " Indian " bestsellers one after the other , while Indians typically can't get into print .
Think about the real situation of American Indians .
Think about Julius Streicher .
Remember Justice Jackson 's admonition .
Understand that the treatment of Indians in American popular culture is not " cute ' ' or " amusing , " or just " good , clean fun . "
Know that it causes real pain and real suffering to real people .
Know that it threatens our very survival .
And know that this is just as much a crime against humanity as anything the Nazis ever did .
It is likely the indigenous people of the United States will never demand that those guilty of such criminal activity be punished for their deeds .
But the least we have to expect - indeed to demand­is that such practices finally be brought to a halt .
Yet there he was playing doctor on " 60 Minutes " to explain why it was " reasonable " to infer that Paey was a drug dealer .
There was no evidence that Paey had sold any of his painkillers ( and agents had conducted surveillance of him and his wife for two months ) .
But Andringa inferred that Paey must have been selling them because the prescriptions he received worked out to about 25 pills per day .
" One pill every hour , every day , for two years , " Andringa told Morley Safer , as if this feat of math proved his case .
It 's the same mystic numerology you hear over and over from drug warriors like Karen Tandy , the head of the D.E.A. , who prefers to focus on the number of pills prescribed without bothering with details like the patient 's needs or the dosage .
Paey had no trouble explaining to me why he was taking 25 pills per day : his doctor cautiously gave him a variety of low - strength pills in order to avoid prescribing the kind of painkillers that tempt drug abusers and invite investigation from the D.E.A .
Instead of taking a few high - strength oxycodone pills , Paey took a cocktail of pills containing low doses of oxycodone and other less effective pain killers like Tylenol .
As a result , the total daily dose of oxycodone in all those pills
Paey took was less than what he could have gotten in a single high - strength OxyContin pill .
And there are some chronic - pain patients who need 10 of those high - strength OxyContins every day because they , like Paey , have developed a tolerance to the drug over the years .
So there was no good medical reason to assume that Paey was n't taking all those pills .
In fact , he says he was n't getting enough pain relief because of his doctor 's fear of the D.E.A .
Yet Andringa simply made his own medical diagnosis -- too many pills -- and proceeded to exploit the extraordinary leverage that prosecutors have been given over doctors and patients .
Metamaterials prove to be an absorbing project .
This material can absorb pretty much every light particle it encounters .

Researchers working with metamaterials say that they are near to achieving a surface that can absorb every photon that hits it .
Physicist Willie Padilla ’s group at Boston College in Massachusetts and the team ’s colleagues at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina , have created structures that provide a proof of principle of these perfectly absorbing surfaces , although they have yet to stop all photons from escaping1 .
The researchers predict that the material will have initial applications in ultra-sensitive imaging technologies that use terahertz radiation , with wavelengths intermediate between infrared and microwaves .
Terahertz imaging is a hotly tipped technology for use in medicine — fully absorbing materials at these wavelengths could help to reveal even the dimmest of features .
“ Terahertz frequencies are notoriously difficult to work with — difficult to generate , and difficult to detect , ” says Marin Soljačić of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge , who is also working on controlling absorption in tailor - made metamaterials2 .
“ But there are many exciting applications that could be enabled if we mastered this technology .
This work is a nice step in that direction . ”
Metamaterials are structures made from arrays of ‘ designer atoms ’ , each of which is itself a device or structure with specially tail­ored properties .
So far , the building blocks of most metamaterials have been designed to interact with electromagnetic radiation in unusual ways , giving the assembled metamaterial an optical behaviour that ordinary materials could never display .
For example , it might have a negative refractive index , bending refracted light the ‘ wrong way ’ .
Meta­materials have already provided prototypes of ‘ superlenses ’ that are more powerful than conventional ones , and ‘ invisibility shields ’ that bend electromagnetic waves smoothly around objects hidden inside .
The basic ‘ atoms ’ of these structures are C - shaped split rings made from patterned metal films on circuit boards .
Radiation with a wavelength comparable to the size of the rings will stir up resonant electric currents in the metal , causing the radiation to be absorbed .
For metamaterials operating at microwave frequencies , the components are relatively easy to make and are large enough to be visible .
Padilla ’s team has developed a new design for their perfect absorber , consisting of two back - to - back split rings .
They calculated that an array of these elements should absorb about 99 % of incident radiation at the resonant microwave frequency of about 11.5 gigahertz .
Their experimental version managed to soak up only about 96 % .
But there are plenty of ways to improve this , Padilla says .
One of the likely reasons for the imperfect absorbance is small errors in the shapes of the split - rings or in the accuracy of putting them together — so , more careful fabrication should produce better performance .
And the researchers have now come up with an improved design that , in theory , offers 99.99 % absorbance .
If more than one layer of the meta­material is used , the absorbance should be more or less perfect , they say .
Near - perfect light absorbers are needed for detectors called bolometers , which sense photons by converting their energy to heat .
Bolometers made from silicon are standard items in infrared sensing , but they need to be cryogenically cooled and only work in a limited range of wavelengths .
The new metamaterial absorbers work at room temperature , and the wavelength response can be tuned simply by varying the size and shape of the components .
Such an absorber would still be perfect only within a certain range of wavelengths .
But this range could be broadened , to make the equivalent of a ‘ perfectly black ’ surface that absorbs fully over the entire visible spectrum by mixing different - sized split -ring components in the array .
Alternatively , a perfect absorber could pick out specific ‘ colours ’ , which would be useful for combining imaging and spectroscopy .
“ At terahertz frequencies , you could image airport luggage directly through the bag , just as with X - rays , ” says Padilla .
“ But being able to image at different wavelengths means you might obtain spectroscopic information about what you are imaging , so that you can determine if it is harmful . ”
Padilla and his colleagues have already managed to scale down their design to work at terahertz and far - infrared frequencies3 .
But he says that making a perfect black in the visible range will be hard , because the components would have to be so small .
A super - black material made from carbon nanotubes was reported recently4 , in which the high absorbance comes from the roughness of the surface rather than the antenna action of metamaterials .

The debate over telecom immunity has now spanned almost two years .
When the first proposal to grant immunity to the telecoms was introduced in Congress , in September of 2006 , no one thought the fight would last this long .
As we ponder the bizarre spectacle of a Congress that has willingly and repeatedly rolled over on the Bush administration 's expansive claims of executive power , it is worth remembering that at one time it appeared that there would be hardly any resistance at all to the question of whether to grant immunity to the telecoms that participated in Bush 's illegal warrantless wiretapping program .
Telecom immunity had the same air of inevitability that plenty of bad laws have as they sail through Congress to ultimate passage .
For one thing , it was backed by powerful corporations that bankroll both parties and have armies of lobbyists patrolling Capitol Hill .
The President vehemently insisted on immunity , repeatedly threatening to make use of his veto power against any FISA reform bill that did n't let his telecom friends off the hook .
Republicans in Congress vowed to vote in virtual lockstep on the issue ( and they were joined by key Democrats ) .
The entire intelligence community thought it was a grand idea .
And , while a

href = " http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/25/nation/na-spy25 ">important articles appeared in major papers , the wiretapping scandal did n't generate the level of coverage it deserved .
Many assumed the public to be acquiescent on the issue .
Read more after the jump ...
But the proponents of immunity got more than they bargained for .
Despite the long odds , they were forced to regroup and retrench repeatedly , as public opposition to granting immunity to lawbreakers began to grow — slowly at first , later building into a seemingly unstoppable movement .
Time after time , Congress was set to vote on this crucial issue , but was forced to set it aside after being deluged by phone calls and letters from angry constituents and excoriated by editorial boards of papers large and small across the nation .
It was pushed back a week , then another week , then until after the winter recess , then the spring recess , and on and on ...
At EFF , the process was trying , to say the least .
Month after month we rallied our membership to step up and take action to defend the Constitution and the 4th Amendment .
We even tried some novel techniques in an attempt to rouse the masses .
At times , we worried that we were in danger of sounding like the Boy Who Cried Wolf .
After a while , the action alerts seemed to write themselves : " Urgent ! Last Stand on Telecom Immunity !
Take Action Now ! "
( We apologize to our regular readers for the repetition , but in truth we cannot say it wo n't happen again . )
But the public was interested — and remained interested — in the complex and often arcane details of FISA reform .
Blogs big and small kept the story alive , even when the major news sources were content to let the story languish on the back pages .
Glenn Greenwald 's blog at Salon.com led the pack , but there were many , many others .
Blogs like Firedoglake , Ars Technica , Wired 's Threat Level and DailyKos 's McJoan all jumped on the story and stayed on it , month after month .
Editorial pages from around the country — ranging from giants like the New York Times to the tiniest small town papers — spoke out as well .
All of which ensured that action alerts from EFF , the ACLU , Move - On , People for the American Way , Blue America and others were put to good use in record numbers .
To everyone who took action in any way on this issue , a big , delirious thank you from all of us at EFF !
When the President launches a full frontal assault on the Constitution , you would think a few Senators would stand up and fight .
On this count , we were not disappointed .
Senators Dodd and Feingold rose to the occasion , pounded the podium , and in language that borrowed from the great debates of the American Revolution , warned in stentorian voice of the danger of allowing an out - of - control Executive to violate the privacy rights of millions of innocent Americans .
Dodd in particular deserves high praise for insisting on discussing the evidence brought forward by whistleblower Mark Klein that forms the backbone of EFF 's case — evidence that the President so desperately hopes to prevent a judge from reviewing .
But the movement that rose to oppose telecom immunity did more than demonstrate the increasing power of the global public square known as the Internet .
It showed that there is a constituency — a loud , organized , and active constituency — that will passionately defend the Constitution , privacy rights , and the rule of law .
Lawmakers from both parties — presidential candidates included — ignore this movement at their peril .
Americans of the future may one day look back at this moment in history and wonder at how a free society could allow the government , working in tandem with a few corporations , to install a surveillance network directly into the nation 's telecommunications backbone .
They may marvel at first at how easily we surrendered our treasured freedoms .
But when historians dig a little deeper , they will find that these changes did not happen without a fight .
They will see that , in the face of impossible odds , a diverse coalition of civil libertarians , scrappy non-profits , and citizens from all walks of life rose to meet the challenge , and fought valiantly to defend the values this country was founded upon .
They may even find that , eventually , we won .
The legislative battle against telecom immunity has been lost , for now .
But as long as the architecture for dragnet surveillance remains installed in the communications hubs around the country , EFF will continue the fight .
We 'll be challenging the immunity provisions passed by Congress as unconstitutional ; we will seek repeal of immunity in the next session of Congress ; and we will bring a new suit against the government , challenging the nationwide snooping network that Mark Klein helped uncover .
If you are a member of EFF , thank you .
If you have not yet joined our fight , now is the time , because we are only just getting started .
President Bush 's decision to send William Burns , his third - ranking diplomat , to observe nuclear negotiations in Geneva with Iran , represents a long - overdue shift in American policy - underlined by plans revealed in yesterday 's Guardian to re-establish a diplomatic presence in Tehran .
Hitherto , the US had demanded that Iran must concede the main point of negotiations , namely suspension of its uranium enrichment programme , before talks begin .
Iran has responded positively to negotiations , but ruled out the US precondition of suspension .
The US still states that it will only enter into dialogue with Iran if it halts its enrichment programme .
Iran 's nuclear plants are all under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which has stressed consistently that there has not been any illicit diversion of declared nuclear material .
Despite no evidence of a nuclear weaponisation programme , the US pressured the member states of the governor 's board of the IAEA to report Iran 's file to the UN security council in February 2006 .
Three rounds of resolutions and sanctions followed .
The Bush administration 's policy towards Iran was inspired initially by its quick success in regime change in Iraq .
It has pursued the dual strategy of demonising , isolating and pressuring Iran while trying to destabilise the country by covert operations in order to prepare the ground for a military attack .
However the hawks , led by Dick Cheney , have failed to make any headway .
In December 2007 , the National Intelligence Estimate reported with high confidence that Iran does not have a military nuclear programme , disarming the principal allegation against it .
For a time , a concerted attempt was made to create a casus belli by accusing Iran of arming the militants who are " killing our soldiers " in Iraq .
But no real evidence for this charge was ever produced , the Iraqi government refuted it and the allegations have not been trumpeted by the US in recent months .
In Iran itself , the US pressures have backfired and radicalised large sections of the population - including those opposed to the government - in defence of Iran 's rights under the non-proliferation treaty .
According to public opinion surveys , the overwhelming majority has supported the government in resisting pressure to halt enrichment .
These failures of US policy coincide with the high sensitivity of the price of oil , the background to a recent report by the Rand Corporation for the American air force warning against any military attack or inflaming ethnic tensions and proposing reconciliation with Tehran .
While the positive shift in policy is a setback for them , the hawks are by no means defeated .
We have been in this position before .
The US and Iran had three rounds of negotiations about stability in Iraq last year , which only led to a new hype in US accusations against Iran .
On Monday , Israeli military adviser Amos Gilad said that Israel is preparing to attack Iran if diplomacy fails , and that the US would not veto it .
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh has warned of an October surprise - a massive US bombing campaign in Iran - triggered by a " Gulf of Tonkin " incident to boost McCain 's electoral chances if Obama maintains his lead in the opinion polls .
In this volatile state , the international peace movement should multiply its efforts to avert war in the remaining six months of Bush 's term .
The resolution in Congress for what amounts to a naval blockade of Iran is , in effect , an act of war .
The EU and the international community should call for the military option to be ruled out , and for the US to drop its precondition and enter into direct , comprehensive negotiations with Iran .

The following is a guest post by Brad Lancaster on rainwater harvesting .
Energy scarcity and water scarcity are closely related phenomena , especially in certain parts of the world .
While rainwater harvesting is no panacea for our water or energy problems , it may be a critical component in many regions for dealing with issues of scarcity .
It is also an excellent example of a scale - free tool : it can be implemented by individuals , communities , or nations .
My interest in water - harvesting arose from a desire both to reduce my cost of living and to be part of the solution rather than the problem in my desert city of Tucson , Arizona .
One of Tucson ’s biggest problems is its mismanagement of water resources , pulling more each year from the water table than nature can replace .
This is a practice that has dried out the Santa Cruz river , killed countless springs and wells , and severely depleted available groundwater resources .
Living in the desert has put a special emphasis on water - harvesting for me , but it ’s a valuable strategy for non-desert environments , too .
Rainwater harvesting is effective for reducing or preventing erosion and downstream flooding while improving stormwater quality .
Thus , Portland and Seattle have embraced water - harvesting to protect salmon populations , and Maryland is doing the same to protect the Chesapeake Bay .
And anywhere in the world , water - harvesting is a smart strategy for helping to recharge groundwater tables , springs , wells , and rivers .
Back in 1994 , my brother Rodd was also interested in water - harvesting , but as long as we were both renting , all we could do was read up on the subject .
At the time , we were both self - employed , making what the government considers poverty wages .
No bank would touch us .
On our own , neither of us could afford to purchase a home , but together , it was feasible .
( It helped that the house we wound up purchasing was about to be condemned . )
We did 95 % of the renovation work ourselves and used mainly salvaged materials .
Twelve years later , our property value has shot through the roof .
The integrated water - harvesting techniques Rodd and I learned and implemented on this once - barren urban lot have transformed it into an oasis in the desert , with temperatures ranging an average ten degrees lower than our neighbors ’ .
Our land produces 15 - 25 % of our food , which includes organic , homegrown fruits , nuts , vegetables , eggs , honey , and mesquite flour grown solely with rainwater and greywater ( reclaimed household wash - water . )
Our utility bills have been dropping steadily since we moved in and now run an average $ 20 per month .
The Lancaster residence before renovation in 1994
2006 , after renovation : rainwater and greywater utilized for food production , climate control , privacy .
In the course of creating our sustainable oasis here in Tucson , Rodd and I arrived at eight basic principles that anyone can use to implement a successful rainwater - harvesting strategy of their own .
Principle # 1 : Begin with long and thoughtful observation .
Right after we bought the house , monsoon rains poured from the sky .
Rodd and I got acquainted with where where runoff pooled against the house and how the bulk of the rain ran off our site into the street .
We mapped these observations , and others , including noise , head ¬lights , and pollution from the street ; where we wanted privacy ; where we needed shade ; and where we needed to enhance winter solar exposure .
Wherever you direct rainwater in your landscape , you will be nurturing plant life , so take the time to make ensure this vegetation is part of your overall plan .
Next , calculate the rainwater resources available within your site 's “ watershed . ”
For us , that area included not only the 12 inches of annual rainfall on our roof and 1/8th of an acre property , but the 20 foot wide public right - of - way adjoining our property , the section of street draining past the right - of - way , and the runoff from our neighbor ’s roof .
( See Table , below )
This totaled about 104,600 gallons ( 397,000 liters ) of rainwater in an average year !
Principle # 2 : Start harvesting rain at the top of your watershed , then work your way down .
In most cases , the top of your watershed means the roof of your house .
Our leaky asphalt roof was a mess , so we removed it and installed 26 - gauge galvanized steel metal roofing instead , which harvests rainwater in a potable form .
However , as long as you ’re only harvesting rainwater for use in landscape irrigation , this is n’t a necessary step .
( Rainwater harvested off a conventional asphalt roof can also be made safe for consumption with the installation of an appropriate water filtration system . )
Take a look at your roof .
Where do the gutters drain ?
Where is rainfall currently being directed ?
This is where you should begin with mulched water - harvesting basins and plantings ( at least 10 feet from the building 's foundation . )
On our property , just under half of the roof runoff is directed to earthworks and fruit trees north of the house .
The rest is directed to an above - ground cistern west of the garden along our property boundary on top of a 2 - foot ( 60 cm ) high earthen platform .
Our cistern is a custom - modified new ferro - cement septic tank , but a number of good alternatives exist .
( See , Choosing a Tank . )
We selected the location of our cistern to provide multiple functions .
By placing it on the western boundary of our yard to shadeing out the hot afternoon sun , it creates a beneficial microclimate for our garden .
By acting as part of the property line , it provides a privacy screen from a peering neighbor .
And by placing the cistern on an elevated platform , the system utilizes gravity in circulating water from the roof ’s gutter to the tank , and from the tank to the garden .
Whatever type of cistern you choose , having your garden located nearby will keep hose length to a minimum ( 25 ft. ideal )
This will reduce water - pressure loss to surface - friction inside the hose and make watering with rainwater a convenience .
( Your plants will love it too ! )
Principle # 3 : Always plan an overflow route , and manage overflow as a resource .
Eventually , all water - harvesting systems will meet a storm that exceeds their capacity , so do n’t get taken by surprise .
All rainwater harvesting structures should be managed in such a way that the system can overflow in a beneficial , rather than destructive way .
In that spirit , overflow from our backyard cistern is directed via a 4 - inch diameter overflow pipe gutters to a series of adjoining mulched basins that passively irrigate a citrus tree and our garden .
In addition , all of our sunken earthworks have an overflow “ spillway . ”
Typically , one earthwork overflows to another and another , until all are full and then , if needed , the lowest earthwork can overflow to a natural drainage– - or , in a typical urban context , the street .
Your goal should be to harvest the rain , but never get flooded by it .
This is key .
4 . Start with small and simple strategies that harvest the rain as close as possible to where it falls .
When people think of rainwater harvesting , usually it ’s cisterns and tanks that spring to mind .
But the water collected off your roof is typically much less than what ’s actually falling on your property .
Simple water - harvesting earthworks , such as basins , terraces , contour berms , and check dams will harvest the rain where it falls , on the land .
The water - harvesting earthworks Rodd and I created collect the vast majority of our rain .
We dug level - bottomed basins and deeply mulched them ( about 4 inches ) in order to infiltrate rainfall and runoff throughout our watershed — once again starting at the highest points of the yard and working down .
Overflow water was directed from the upper basins to the lower basins , which brings us to principle number five .
5. Spread , slow and infiltrate the flow of water into the soil .
Cisterns along with mulched and vegetated earthworks basins with overflow routes will effectively transform your erosive runoff during heavy rainfall into a calm , productive resource while reducing water loss to evaporation and downstream flooding .
Raised pathways and gathering areas are also a great strategy for spreading water through the landscape .
This pattern of “ high and dry ” regions that drain to adjoining basins kept “ sunken and moist ” will help to define those areas through vegetation while spreading and sinking the flow of water .
( This also helps keep ice off walkways and driveways in colder regions . )
At our place , we also used earthworks to redirect the runoff that used to pool against our house to planting areas 10 feet or more away from the building 's foundation .
6. Maximize living and organic groundcover .
All your basins and other water - harvesting earthworks should be well mulched and planted .
This creates a “ living sponge ” effect that will utilize the harvested water to create food and beauty in your surrounding landscape while steadily improving the soil ’s ability to infiltrate and hold water due to the vast network of growing roots and beneficial micro-organisms .
Groundcover is equally important in helping to ensure that , in your enthusiasm for harvesting rainwater , you do n’t wind up creating a haven for mosquitoes .
Mosquitoes need three days of standing water to transform from eggs to adults .
Water - harvesting earthworks allowing water to infiltrate below the surface of the soil ( typically within one hour ) where it wo n’t be lost to evaporation .
Take a hike in the natural unmanaged areas near your home to determine what native vegetation would be best to plant within or beside your earthworks .
Out in the wild , you 'll notice which plants grow naturally in depressions – they can be planted within your basins .
Wild plants preferring better drainage can be planted beside , but not within earthworks .
Blue palo verdes , velvet mesquite , chuparosa , oreganillo , and desert lavender are a few of the native plants found along the ephemeral washes in our area of Tucson that we plant within our earthworks .
7. Maximize beneficial relationships and efficiency by “ stacking functions . ”
As mentioned previously , water - harvesting strategies offer maximum benefits when they ’re integrated into a comprehensive overall siteplan .
We focused on locating the earthworks where we wanted to stack functions with multi-use vegetation .
Through rainwater harvesting earthworks , we ’ve nurtured a solar arc of deciduous trees on the east , north , and west sides of our home that cool us in the summer , but let in the free light and warmth of the sun in winter .
A living fence of native plants along the property line ( along with an existing citrus tree ) form part of a sun trap .
This suntrap shades our garden from the afternoon sun , creates on - site stormwater control , and enhances habitat for native songbirds and butterflies .
The Big Picture
Within our generative landscape , rainwater has become our primary water source , greywater our secondary water source , and municipal groundwater a strictly and infrequently used supplemental source ( meeting no more than 5 % of our exterior water needs ) .
Most of our established landscape has even become regenerative by thriving on rainwater alone .
Our household consumes less than 20,000 gallons of municipal water annually , with over 90 % of that being recycled in the landscape as greywater .
Additionally , we harvest and infiltrate over 100,000 gallons of rain and runoff into the soil of our site ( and , by extension , the community 's watershed ) over the course of our annual average rainfall .
As a household , we ’re shifting more and more to living within our rainwater “ budget ” : the natural limits of our local environment .
As a result , we ’re enriching the land , growing up to 25 % of our food on site , creating a beautiful home and neighborhood environment – and giving back more than we take !
The further we go , the easier and more fun it gets , which brings us to the eighth and last principle :
8. Continually reassess your system and improve it .
Three years ago , Rodd and I set up an outdoor shower so the bather could either use pressurized municipal water at the showerhead or cistern water distributed from a shower bucket on a hook .
Other strategies have included a solar - powered greywater “ laundromat ” in our backyard ( utilized by seven neighboring households ) along with a reduction in impermeable hardscape by replacing our asphalt driveway with lush plantings and earthworks .
One of our most rewarding recent improvements has been the process of working with our neighbors and the city to replace 26 % of the pavement from the corner intersection with a water - harvesting traffic circle planted with native vegetation .
We also succeeded in implementing a system that harvests street runoff within curbside mulched basins to grow a greenbelt of trees along the street and sidewalk , so the street now passively irrigates the trees .
As a result , our neighborhood — once the victim of urban blight — is now one of the greenest and most livable areas of the city .
My advice to anyone who wants to get started living more sustainably is to start with rainwater - harvesting .
Start at the top .
Start small .
But above all — start !

Sidebar : Choosing a Rainwater Cistern
Our cistern has a 1,200 - gallon ( 4,560 liter ) capacity .
We selected this size after calculating the average annual roof runoff , assessing our water needs , and determining the resources we wanted to commit to the system .
We opted for a precast concrete septic tank for a number of reasons , but primarily because it was affordable as well as a workable size and shape for our space ( 5 foot wide , 6 feet tall , 10 feet long ) .
Our septic tank was custom - made for use as a cistern , and further reinforced for above - ground installation .
The cost back in 1996 was $ 600 , which included delivery and placement .
It 's been working great ever since .
Other options for pre-manufactured cisterns include light - free dark green or black polyurethane plastic , corrugated metal , and fiberglass .
See www.watertanks.com for options and look in the yellow pages under tanks for local suppliers .
Calculating Your Rainwater Resources
To calculate the volume of rain falling in an average year on a specific surface such as your roof , yard , or neighborhood , use the following calculation : CATCHMENT AREA ( in square feet ) multiplied by the AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL ( in feet ) multiplied by 7.48 ( to convert cubic feet to gallons ) equals the TOTAL RAINWATER FALLING ON THAT CATCHMENT IN AN AVERAGE YEAR : CATCHMENT AREA ( ft2 ) x RAINFALL ( ft ) x 7.48 gal /ft3 = TOTAL AVAILABLE RAINWATER ( gal / year )
Taleban militants attacked the prison with a truck bomb and rockets
Afghan security forces are searching for hundreds of prisoners who escaped a jail in Kandahar , Afghanistan , after Taleban fighters blew up the main gate .
An official in the southern city told the BBC about 350 Taleban militants had got away and 15 guards were killed in the truck bomb and rocket attack .
More than 1,000 people are thought to have escaped , Kandahar provincial council head Wali Karzai said .
Nato troops are helping Afghan forces hunt for the prisoners .
The BBC's Martin Patience , in Kabul , says the Afghan police and army are conducting house to house searches in Kandahar , while Nato forces are using helicopters to secure the city and the outlying districts .
A state of emergency was declared in the city , the second biggest in the country , after the attack on Friday night .
All residents were ordered to stay in their homes .
A Taleban spokesman , Qari Yousef Ahmadi , said that 30 fighters on motorbikes and two suicide bombers had attacked the prison , freeing about 400 Taleban members .
' Major breach ' A number of high - ranking Taleban field commanders are believed to be among those who escaped .

Advertisement Prison chief Abdul Qabir said some of the inmates had chosen to stay behind during the break - out .
They were said to be mostly women , children and political prisoners .
Wali Karzai , head of the Kandahar provincial council and also the brother of the Afghan President Hamid Karzai , suggested that the search for the escapees might prove futile .
" Honestly I do n't know because this area you can walk to the other districts .
They might recapture some people but I do n't know . "
An eyewitness told the BBC that the force of the initial blast had been enough to blow out windows up to 3 km ( 1.7 miles ) from the prison .
People living nearby also reported hearing blasts from rockets and machine gun fire .
Key battleground
The Afghan authorities have begun an investigation to find out whether any government officials might have been involved in the attack .
The break - out is a major security breach which will be of concern to both the Afghan government and security forces , our correspondent says .
Kandahar is one of the key battlegrounds in the Taleban 's insurgency against President Hamid Karzai and Nato and US troops .
A Nato spokesman General Carlos Branco admitted the attack was a success for the Taleban , but said it was an isolated incident and did not mean the militants were gaining strength generally .
" I understand it was a very successful move for the Taleban , I 'm not denying that , but we should not over react and exaggerate in the results ...
It 's very soon to make an assessment and say that it was a strategic blow , " he told the BBC .
Last month inmates at Kandahar jail ended a week - long hunger strike after a parliamentary delegation promised to address their demands .
Almost 400 prisoners said they had been denied access to fair trials and some also complained of torture .

Dragon Skin
Unlike liquid armor , “ Dragon Skin ” is a bulletproof vest that ’s made from circular discs — in a textile pattern , composed of silicon carbide ceramic matrices and laminates .
It ’s so strong that even an M67 grenade could n’t penetrate the material — though heavily damaged the vest .
HydroFlex
Unlike conventional body armor , Hydroflex remains flexible under normal motion , but can become rigid and absorb energy despite being paper - thin .
According to the inventor : “ liquid is in the fabric by impregnation , hardens on impact , and melts back within time . ”

Scott McClellan got the Judge Judy treatment from Bill O'Reilly over his new book which rips the Bush administration on a host of issues .
In this extended clip , BillO took exception because Scott had the audacity to indict the press over their horrid coverage of the run up to the Iraq war .
And poor Bill tries to spin him into the ground over his admissions that the Iraq war was sold to American people using --- propaganda .
( rough transcript )
O'Reilly :
You said they used propaganda and that is a loaded word
McClellan : The White House Iraq group , the White House Iraq group was set up , it 's a marketing arm for selling the a war .
That was a specific purpose that I talked about in the book
O'Reilly : Because they fervently believed that the guy was a danger and could hand his weapons off .
McClellan :
No because the President had a bigger driving motivation which was to transform the middle east .
O'Reilly :
You telling me that President Bush did n't believe they had the ,
McClellan : No , he did too .
He believed that too .
O'Reilly : That 's not propaganda then , that 's not propaganda .
McClellan :
It is when you package it all together --- over sell it and over state it to the American people .
That is propaganda .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil ’s meteoric rise since the start of the year to nearly $ 150 has distressed consumers and policy makers the world over , but the stark reality is prices are likely to rise higher still .

For two decades , prices were relatively stable , but then they rose seven - fold from a trough below $ 20 in 2001 .
Since breaching the $ 100 mark on the first trading day of this year they have risen around 45 percent .
Given such momentum , politicians ’ efforts to bring the price down could well be a waste of energy .
“ It rose so fast it ’s got a bubble feel , but bubbles can go on for very sustained periods , and underlying that is an extremely tight fundamental position , ” said Stephen Thornber , head of global energy research at Threadneedle Asset Management .
Global demand of some 86 million barrels per day is almost level with supply , and production growth is not keeping pace with soaring demand from emerging economies such as India and China .
Citing the strength of Asian demand , investment bank Morgan Stanley last month predicted oil would reach $ 150 a barrel by the Fourth of July holiday in the United States , usually one of the busiest U.S. travel days .
Their target proved just out of reach , with U.S. crude stopping short at a record of $ 145.85 .
But the bulls have not gone away .
Goldman Sachs , the biggest investment bank in the commodities sector , has tipped prices to hit $ 200 a barrel within two years .
Already prices are undoubtedly causing pain as protests at rising costs have broken out across the world .
Consumers , particularly in the world ’s biggest energy burner the United States , have begun to cut back on fuel use , but there is no ready substitute when it comes to transportation .
“ You have to go to work , no matter what the price is , ” said Thornber .
“ Fundamental demand for transport and energy is difficult to turn off in the short term , but disposable income will be hit . ”
THREAT TO GROWTH
A sustained period of growth across the world was largely reliant on cheap energy and policy makers are fearful the unprecedented rally on the oil market will undo that .
“ The longer it stays at this level or the higher it goes , the more pain it is going to cause in lots of different industries , ” said Colin Morton at Rensburg Fund Management .
Even oil companies say their gains have been muted .
“ People think that at $ 140 we make fortunes , ” Repsol CEO Antonio Brufau told Reuters this week .
“ We pay fortunes in taxes , that ’s true , but the countries that benefit the most are the ones that own the reserves , ” he said .
For their part , the Gulf exporters -- which provide almost a quarter of the world ’s oil -- are suffering rampant inflation , as their dollar - pegged currencies import higher prices .
The dollar ’s weakness relative to other currencies has been partly responsible for the rise in oil and other dollar - denominated commodities as investors try to hedge against inflation and take shelter from battered stock markets .
For central bankers , oil is a vexed problem .
It has exacerbated a slowdown in economic growth and stoked inflation .
The natural remedy for inflation should be higher interest rates , but the fear is that could add to the problem of slower growth .
“ It ( record oil ) is constraining what policy makers can do , said Richard Batty , global strategist at Standard Life Investments .
While there are no easy policy answers , expensive oil and weaker economic performance could eventually dent fuel demand enough to lower prices .
“ The oil price is not necessarily reflecting the fundamental backdrop at the moment and eventually it will have to as the fundamental backdrop continues to weaken , ” Batty said .
The more bullish analysts argue that even if developed countries change their habits , emerging economies will continue to drive up demand and oil prices , which are arguably still too cheap .
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has conceded prices at current levels are expensive in relative terms , but the group ’s secretary general has also pointed out that per liter crude is cheaper than bottled mineral water .

People , places , events ; our browsers ( and other machines ) should be able to recognize these things as easily as you and I can .
That ’s the promise of the semantic web .
But users are not the ones who will make the semantic web work .
Microformats extend existing XHTML tags to put human - readable information into machine - parsable form ( @Argent Hotel , San Francisco , CA@ ) .
But as simple of a solution as that is , it will never have mainstream appeal .
Unlike text - formatting XHTML tags & classes like < strong > or < blockquote > , data - formatting XHTML tags have no immediate visible effect on their contents .
Can you tell the difference between :
and :
Jay Neely
Boston , MA
?
Because of this , users have no reason to ever remember to format their information with machine - readable tags .
Even a rich - text - editing - like interface is n’t that helpful , because users lack a reason to * want * to make their data machine - readable .
Only techies and smart business people care about that ; for everyone else , human - readable is good enough .
* People write for people , not machines . *
So services will have to write for services .
Semantic Sources
We already have our information put into semantic form on a regular basis .
Every time we type our name into a textfield created for that purpose , the machines of at least one service ( Facebook , Yahoo !
Mail , Wachovia ) store that not just as a bit of text , but text identified specifically as our name .
Not just our names , but often our addresses , our interests , our friends , our job titles , and many other kinds of information .
Data silos have existed for ages , of course ; but * giving the semantic web at large access to data silos is a key step forward in making semantic tools useful * — just as key , if not more so , than collecting data from the distributed web .
Not only is that data all in a central location for easy access , it ’s often the kind of data we do n’t explicitly state in our natural usage of the rest of the web .
How often do you write on your blog or in an IM , “ I live in Boston , MA .
My interests are coffee , technology , startups , and communications .
My relationship status is single , my height is 5 ′8 ″ , and my eye color varies between blue and green ” ?
( Which reminds me , I really need to increase the female demographic of my readership . )
Finally , access to data silos is as important as access to distribute data because data silos are where the majority of people are ( and will be for the foreseeable future ) .
There are “ only 165,700,000 sites in existence ” : http://news.netcraft.com/archives/web_server_survey.html, whereas Facebook alone has over 70 million active users ( and Facebook gets 1/4th the traffic Yahoo! does ) .
The majority of people ’s online presences will be through a centralized service , rather than their own site .
Semantic Creators
But , that does n’t mean that there is n’t any value in all of the data available on the distributed web .
After all , even just a few sites can put out a lot of content .
But for the reasons outlined above , most of these sites wo n’t be putting their own content into a semantic format .
That ’s where semantic creators come in .
Data scraping is as simple as understanding the common format a specific type of data usually is put in ( myname@mydomain.com or 555-555-5555 ) , and having a web - crawler find that information , extract it , and put it into the desired markup or database entry fields .
As natural language processing advances , we ’ll start seeing more services that recognize the kind of information I expressed explicitly above ( interests , relationship status , etc. ) , even when it ’s only expressed implicitly .
Those kind of services will operate either constantly , or on - demand .
They will be the middlemen between semantic tools and the rest of the web , collecting all of the information we put out , and putting it into a machine - readable format services can use ( and changing it from the format one service uses to the format another service prefers , until semantic markup becomes more standardized ) .
Semantic Tools
So we have all that information in machine - readable format ; great !
Now what can we do with it ?
We can :
* * Find it .*
Search , bookmarking , related - items , context , area - specific …
* * Combine it .*
“ Mashups – filter , visualize , correlate , advertise ” : http://jayneely.com/2007/06/02/more-signal-less-noise-the-power-of-rss-mashups, etc .
* * Integrate it .*
One - click additions of events , contact info , preferences , licensing information , etc. into the applications you use every day .
* * Aggregate it .*
See all of the events for a certain category happening within your city .
Discover the most - talked - about TV show amongst your friends .
Find all Creative Commons licensed podcasts available for remixing .
The possibilities for users to enhance their web experience with semantic data are endless .
But it ’s up to developers to create the services that give them that chance .

THE LAST NAIL IN THE COFFIN OF THE 911 MYTH
MOHAMED ATTA IN OKLAHOMA CITY SEPTEMBER 2001 By Jack Blood
www.jackblood.com
July 20th 2008
For almost a year and a half I have been in the loop on a most fantastic story involving the Herculean investigative reporting of Chris Emery , Holland Van den Nieuwenhof and crew from www.okcbombing.net
As hard as it was , I kept quiet and off the record , as the team investigated an angle of the 911 terrorist attack of 2001 which had Mohamed Atta ( pictured right ) and five of his alleged hijackers in Oklahoma City just days before 911 , drunk , boisterous and brawling Not a Koran , or prayer rug in site .
Last week - July 2008 , they had reached the end of their investigation , and impenetrable walls of resistance prohibited them from going any further .
Last Friday July 19th 2008 the Emery team decided to go public on my syndicated radio show , DEADLINE LIVE w/ Jack Blood .
The result of which has sent shockwaves throughout the 911 truth community .
For the safety of all involved , the witnesses wish to remain anonymous until such time they can be guaranteed protection .
All of the witnesses have given signed affidavits to Chris Emery .
Documentation of the facts and evidence has been tucked away in safe houses in the USA and Canada .
The evidence will later be released to Network Media , and the proper authorities .
The story started as the team was continuing their exhaustive research into the OKC Bombings of 1995 .
Almost accidentally they ran into witness after witness wanting to report that they had seen Atta and five 911 hijackers in Oklahoma City September 6th - 8th 2001 .
On September 6th 2001 at 10 AM - 12 Noon - Mohamed Atta and four 911 hijackers were spotted at , of all places , the OKC National Memorial Museum by an employee who later told Emery that the five were speaking in a Middle Eastern dialect , and they had become " boisterous " inside the museum .
The employee had to tell them to " Shut Up " and behave themselves or leave the premises .
The five left the building immediately after calling attention to themselves .
The employee remembers the five lucidly , as in the entire history of the museum , no one had ever had to be asked to contain themselves .
It was burned in the brain of the employee , and was recalled again a few days later when Atta 's cold stare was shown back on National TV after the 911 attacks .
The employee allegedly tired to report the incident to authorities but was ignored .
The 911 hijackers seen by witnesses with Atta have been revealed as : Abdulaziz Alomari , Saeed Algamdi , Ahmed Alnami , and Hamza Algamdi .
( pictured in order below )
On Friday , September 7th 2001 ( evening ) Atta and crew turn up again at an OKC bar .
( To be named at a later date , but known to be frequented by police and spooks )
The group returned to the same bar the next night .
The five were drinking beer and hard liquor , dancing , and eventually picking a fight with two local patrons .
( Again very high profile / anti fundamentalist behavior , not easy to forget )
Atta , according to witnesses was the ring - leader and the one picking the fight , while his four cohorts stood at the ready to jump into the fray if necessary .
Chris Emery and team were able to obtain the Credit Card receipts from that night , and have spent most of the last 18 months attempting to trace the card numbers , and the authorization of the cards themselves .
This was not an easy task as you could imagine .
When fellow investigators found out what information Emery was trying to obtain , most decidedly bailed on any involvement .
What was discovered in the end , was that the sequence of numbers on Atta 's credit card revealed a unique application only found on U.S. Government Credit cards .
( Arranged such as to simplify accounting structures )
Unfortunately , at this time Any further search for information about the card was halted , mainly through a lack of resources to continue the investigation .
One card number used by Atta and crew had been EXPIRED a full six months before the September 7th and 8th dates the card was used and approved at this local Oklahoma City establishment .
( Now you try to use a credit card that is six months expired and see what happens )
This transaction was approved without delay .
But
That is not all .
There 's more A lot more !
What can only be deemed as Totally Damning to the case presented by the U.S Government , and the 911 Commission A fifth hijacker , was back in this bar FOUR DAYS AFTER 911 .
He ordered the very same brand of hard liquor ( never before sold in this bar ) as had Atta .
It was a unique brand of Dewers .
This was also paid with another U.S. Government credit card , also 6 months expired .
On Saturday - 9/15/01 ( FOUR DAYS AFTER 911 ! ) a mutual friend of Atta ( who shook Atta 's hand and said something very briefly in Atta 's ear about an hour after Atta picks the fight with two club patron 's on Friday 9/7/01 ) comes back to the club with yet ANOTHER alleged hijacker identified in the photo line up as being Marwan Al Shehhi .
( pictured left )
One witness notices this mutual friend of Atta and this new ' guy ' are sad and somewhat depressed .
This mutual friend was a regular patron of the club for years and known by the witness as a trouble maker whom he 's kicked out of the club several times .
Saturday 9/15/01 this mutual friend brings in Mr. Al - Shehhi and says " they had friends that were killed ... " and within seconds of answering this witness , Mr. Al Shehhi jumps over the bar and grabs this witness by the shirt collar and wants to fight with him .
The witness pushes Al Shehhi away and yells at the mutual friend " What the Hell is his problem ... " or something to that effect ...
The witness repeatedly said he will NEVER forget the face of Al Shehhi as it was only 12 to 18 inches away from his for a full 10 seconds before he could push him away and off the bar .
There is much more to this amazing story which we will reveal in the coming days and weeks on DEADLINE LIVE and at www.jackblood.com
The purpose of this article is to lay a foundation to add evidence on top of .
The Emery team , including blogger and radio host Andrew Griffin at www.reddirtreport.com will be doing everything they can , along with myself , to see this story through and to hopefully find some sympathetic reporters in the Main Stream Media .
We are also seeking honest persons in law enforcement to follow up on leads we currently have .
At some point , like in every story
The search for truth itself becomes the headline .
We are asking you , the people of the USA , citizens of the world , and truth seekers everywhere to help get this story out as is , and to help circulate every new addition to the story as they come out .

Also of note :
On the DEADLINE LIVE interview originally broadcast on July 19th 2008 - Chris Emery and team presented the date of the incident with Al Shehhi as Sept 21 2001 .
This date has been corrected after re confirming with eyewitnesses to the date mentioned in the above article to Sept. 15th 2001 .
The Full Original Interview Can Be Heard In The Video Below * Ahmed Alghamdi [ one of the alleged hijackers ] had a namesake attend O.U. - School Year 1999 - 2000 [ Ahmed D. Alghamdi ] @ 2037 W. Lindsey / Norman , OK And School Year 2000 - 2001 [ Mohammed A. Alghamdi ] @ 3809 Quail Run Circle / Norman , OK - This M. Alghamdi had a cryptic email address printed in the student directory of [ abuali911@ou.edu ] .
* Atta , Alomari , Al Shehhi , Algami , and Alnami were also named by the BBC as still being alive .
* Although a Brooklyn apartment lease from 1995 - 1996 bears Ziad Jarrah 's name - and landlords there have identified his photograph - his family insists he was in Beirut at the time .
* According to the Washington Post : ( Link has been removed ) Two of 19 suspects named by the FBI , Saeed Alghamdi and Ahmed Alghamdi , have the same names as men listed at a housing facility for foreign military trainees at Pensacola .
Two others , Hamza Alghamdi and Ahmed Alnami , have names similar to individuals listed in public records as using the same address inside the base .
In addition , a man named Saeed Alghamdi graduated from the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , while men with the same names as two other hijackers , Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz Alomari , appear as graduates of the U.S. International Officers School at Maxwell Air Force Base , Ala. , and the Aerospace Medical School at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio , respectively .

One of the roads to 9/11 starts in Oklahoma in 1993 when , according to the 9/11 Congressional report , Osama bin Laden 's personal pilot came to Norman to train at Airman Flight School .
Five years later this had become a trend , as the local office of the FBI warned of the large number of Middle Eastern men training in Oklahoma Fight schools in a memo titled , " Weapons of Mass Destruction " issued on May 15 , 1998 .
The next year 9/11 hijackers Mohammed Atta and Marwan al - Shehhi , or men using those names , visited Airman Flight School once again to inquire about lessons .
[ Boston Globe ]
In September of 1999 , the FBI finally got around to visiting Airman to ask about bin Laden 's pilot training there six years previously .
[ 9/11 Congressional Report ]
In February of 2001 the supposed 20th hijacker , Zacharias Mossaoui , trained at Airman in Norman and lived in a University of Oklahoma Dormitory .
[ Oklahoma Gazette ]
He later moved off campus into a house he shared with Melvin Lattimore , a man with links to the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 and the OKC bombing .
In April of that year , the FBI documents that hijacker Salem al - Hamzi was seen visiting this house .
That same month another hijacker , Nawaf al - Hamzi , was issued a speeding ticket in Oklahoma so he very well may have visited this 0 ff - campus terrorist party pad also .
And although al - Hamzi was seen at an al - Qaeda conference in Malaysia the previous year and afterward followed to the United States by the CIA , his name did not trigger any red flags when he was pulled over .
[ Daily Oklahoman ]
Mossaoui later went on in August to be arrested in Minnesota by the local FBI despite much interference from their superiors .
His roommate Melvin Lattimore wrote letters to the editors of local papers defending Mossaoui , but neglected to mention that he himself abandoned his lease on September 10 , 2001 .
Melvin Lattimore is an African - American , a prison convert to radical Islam , and was going by the name of Majahid Abdulquaadir Menepta at the time .
Following 9/11 , he was arrested for being a felon in possession of a weapon and imprisoned for fifteen months .
According to last reports , he has returned to his hometown of St. Louis a free man , despite being linked to three terrorist attacks since 1993 .
Before leaving for Minnesota , Mossaoui is documented as having a meeting at the Sands Motel in Oklahoma City with lead hijacker Mohammed Atta and Marwan al - Shehhi .
This motel has proven popular among terrorists , for this same motel had been used the night prior to the OKC bombing by Tim McVeigh six years previously and had been a hang - out for Lattimore .
[ LA Weekly ] According to Jayna Davis '
The Third Terrorist , a motel employee says that McVeigh left the motel that morning with another man in the Ryder truck , the mysterious John Doe # 2 , which reeked of diesel fuel .
Witnesses also report that McVeigh left with what appeared to be a convoy of vehicles , including another Ryder truck .
[ OKBIC Interviews ]
In August of 2001 , following Atta 's and Mossaoui 's meeting in OKC , a plane ticket that was used in the 9/11 attacks was purchased at an OU library computer .
According to the research of Michael P. Wright , the library assistant who witnessed this transaction said a white American male purchased the ticket .

原标题：重庆这个不出名的小众景区，却有让人震撼的千手观音造像
说道重庆这个3D魔都，我想大家不由自主地会想到洪崖洞、解放碑、高铁穿楼等诸多代名词。可是今天我要给大家推荐的是重庆十大文化符号代表之一的世界文化遗产-----大足石刻。
我推荐它的理由十分简单，因为它是我国唯一的有儒、佛、道同在一龛窟中的三教造像的石窟群，从不同侧面展示了唐、宋时期中国石窟艺术风格的重大发展和变化，代表了公元9—13世纪世界石窟艺术的最高水平，无论从历史、艺术、科学价值都值得我们一看。
大足石刻是县内共有102处摩崖造像。国家级有宝顶山、北山、南山、石门山、石篆山。由于大家对地理位置的不熟悉，推荐购买大足石刻的一日游，这样子就不会出现找不到路的尴尬，而且观看石刻只是自己看看，可能并没有多少理解，有导游在一旁讲解，可以对石刻故事有更深刻的体会。
大足石刻现在主要对外开放的是北山石刻和宝顶山石刻。单独二处门票网络价在140元，跟团一日游在270左右。持学生证现场购票有优惠。
北山石刻位于大足区城北2千米的北山上，以大佛湾为中心，遍及其四周的观音坡、营盘坡、佛耳岩、北塔寺。北山摩崖造像近万尊，造像题材51种，以佛教密宗为主，这些造像雕刻细腻、艺精技绝、精美典雅。造像始刻于唐末，至南宋结束，展示了中国民间佛教信仰及石窟艺术风格的发展、变化。
而宝顶山石刻最值得一看的是千手观音像。一般说来，观音造像只要有十只手，便可称“ 千手观音 ” 。而这里的这一尊千手观音实有830只手，“ 画人难画手 ” ，要画出一百只不同形状的手都很不容易，更何况在坚硬的岩壁上打刻一千多只，而且手的姿势无一雷同，没有一只手在当时被打坏，这真可谓是鬼斧神工，让人叹为观止。
可惜经过时代的风风雨雨，千手观音400多只手缺失或残损。值得高兴的是2015年6月13日，经过最彻底一次8年修复后，大足石刻千手观音造像披着100多万张金箔“ 重现金身” 再现辉煌！
大足石刻有太多有特色的石刻了，在这里我就不一一介绍，对石刻有兴趣的朋友可以去看看历经千年的文化瑰宝有何种别样魅力。
HyperSpace Polytope Slicer ( HyperSlice )
HyperSlice Applet ( below ) does n't work even though you installed Java ?
Run the HyperSlice Web - Start Application instead .
This downloads a jnlp ( Java Web Start ) file that tells Java how to run the HyperSlice outside of your browser .
See my Java Web Start notes .
This applet requires Sun's Java Plugin , i.e. the J2SE Runtime Environment , ( JRE ) .
My Other HyperSlice Applet Pages :
HyperStar :
Please try my Hyperspace Star Polytope Slicer
It does just about everything HyperSlice does , and more .
More Java applets here .
Short Description of the " HyperSlice " Applet :
The User Interface
What is a Polytope ?
A 2 - dimensional polytope is a " polygon " -- an area of a 2 - dimensional space that is bounded by 1 - dimensional line segments .
Example : a square .
A 3 - dimensional polytope is a " polyhedron " -- a volume of 3 - dimensional space that is bounded by 2 - dimensional polygons .
Example : a cube .
A 4 - dimensional polytope is a volume of 4 - dimensional space that is bounded by 3 - dimensional polyhedra ( called " cells " ) .
Example : a Hypercube ( Tesseract ) , which is bounded by eight 3 - dimensional cubes .
The most complex of the 4 - dimensional regular convex polytopes is the 600 - cell , in which 600 regular tetrahedra enclose a volume of 4 - dimensional space .
The " 600 - cell " has 14,400 symmetry operations !
The applet provides a way of visualizing and manipulating the 6 regular convex polytopes and several non-regular convex polytopes that exist in 4 - dimensional space .
You can use it to create some strikingly beautiful continuously - morphing 3 - dimensional kaleidoscopic effects .
Go to : HyperSpace Applet Controls
A Couple of other Definitions :
Regular :
All the vertices , edges , faces and cells are the same .
Convex :
The polytope does n't have any feature that protrudes far enough to cast a shadow on some other part of the polytope .
What Does the HyperSlice Applet Do ?
The regular convex polytopes in 3 dimensions are the 5 " Platonic Solids " -- the tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , dodecahedron and icosahedron .
In 4 dimensions , there are 6 regular convex polytopes .
In each space of more than 4 dimensions , there are only 3 .
Mathematically , we can imagine our 3 - dimensional space to be embedded in a 4 - dimensional space ( but it is n't really ) .
In this imaginary universe , our 3 - space forms a " hyperplane " that divides the 4 - dimensional space into two halves , just as any infinite 2 - dimensional plane divides 3 - dimensional space into 2 infinite half - spaces .
If the 4 - space contains a 4 - dimensional polytope , we can drag that polytope across the our 3 - space hyperplane .
As we do this , we can view the part of the polytope that intersects our 3 - space .
Since the 4 - dimensional polytope is a bounded volume of 4 - space , its intersection with our 3 - space forms a bounded volume of 3 - space .
What we see is a polyhedron in 3 - space .
We can watch the 3 - dimensional polyhedron continuously change shape as the 4 - dimensional polytope moves across our 3 - space .
I have some diagrams of the analogous process in 3 dimensions .
With the HyperSlice applet , you can select any one of the six 4 - dimensional regular convex polytopes .
You can manually drag the polytope across our 3 - dimensional space ( using the W - Slider control ) .
You can view the resulting polyhedron in 3D stereo .
You can inspect it from all angles by dragging it with the mouse .
The most spectacular results are seen with the " 600 - cell " object .
This polytope is bounded by 600 3 - dimensional regular tetrahedra .
The resulting 3 - dimensional polyhedra are very complex yet highly symmetrical .
With the 600 - cell , each animation frame requires an enormous amount of computation , so if you do n't have a super - fast computer , the animation may be rather slow ( it is slow on my 200 Mhz Pentium , but it runs well on a 450 Mhz Pentium ) .
The initial viewing mode is Stereo , solid , which shows 2 images .
You can view these images in stereo 3D using the " look crossed " method .
If you do n't like to cross your eyes , click the View button once to get a single image .
Things to Try
Drag the W - slider with the mouse .
The W - slider is the vertically - aligned slider control to the left of the graphics window ( see the screen shots ) .
It stops the animation and allows you to manually move the polytope back and forth across our 3 - dimensional space .
I have named the direction of motion " w " because it is perpendicular to our 3 - space ( x , y , z ) .
A 4 - space point is represented by 4 coordinates : ( x , y , z , w ) .

Play with the different controls .
Rotate the image by dragging with the mouse .
It is nice to orient the polyhedron so that you are viewing along an axis of symmetry .
There are many different axes of symmetry to try .
When the applet starts , automatic random 3 - rotation is " switched on " .
If you want the polyhedron to " stay put " , you will have to disable this 3 - rotation using the checkbox on the Controls dialog , Motion tab .
When dragging , keep in mind that the rotation arm is an imaginary line from the center of the graphics window to the mouse cursor .
It is best to begin your mouse - drag in the center of the graphics window and drag outward .
If you are viewing a single image , this is very intuitive .
If you are viewing 2 images cross-eyed , you will see 3 polyhedra and 2 apparent mouse cursors .
In that case , you should begin your mouse - drag with the apparent mouse cursors placed symmetrically to the right and left of the middle polyhedron .
Pick another Color Scheme from the Graphics tab .
I like the W - Random scheme .
I keep clicking the Re-randomize button until I get some colors that I particularly like .
( The Color Scheme control is disabled if your Viewing Mode is one of the wireframe modes . )

You can generate interesting animated 2 - dimensional line drawings .

Manually rotate ( mouse - drag ) so that you are looking along an axis of symmetry .
Start the animation .
You can manually produce a rotation in the 4th dimension if you hold down the shift key when you begin your mouse - drag .
With care , you can produce various interesting configurations that have symmetry about a single axis .
I use the following procedure : Stop the animation .
Put the figure into its initial orientation by checking the Reorient on Apply checkbox ( on the Motion tab ) and clicking the Apply button .
Set the W - slider close to 1.0 so that the symmetry is very apparent .
On the Graphics tab , set the View mode to Wireframe - mono and check the Show Hidden Wires checkbox .
Use manual 3 - rotation to align the figure so that an axis of symmetry runs precisely left - to - right .
Perform a manual 4 - rotation ( shift - drag ) , carefully dragging from the center of the window to the left or right .
This preserves the symmetry about the left - right axis .
Use manual 3 - rotation to bring that axis of symmetry around so it is along your line of site .
Restart the animation .
If you are performing arbitrary 4 - rotations , you should probably set the W - range choice ( on the Object tab ) to R0 ( vertex ) , which produces the largest range .
Note that the W - range choice is automatically reset every time you select a new object or orientation .
Polyhedra You Can Make
By tinkering with the , theand the , you can make a variety of polyhedra .
Here are some examples :
Object choice Orientation W- setting Tetrahedron Simplex Cell - first 0.0 Cube Hypercube Cell - first any Octahedron Cross polytope Vertex - first any Dodecahedron 120 - cell Cell - first 0.9 Icosahedron 600 - cell Vertex - first 0.85 Cuboctahedron 24 - cell Cell - first 0.0 Icosidodecahedron 120 - cell Cell - first approx 0.764 Rhombic Dodecahedron 24 - cell Vertex - first 0.0 Rhombic Triacontahedron FC 600 - cell Vertex - first 0.9 Triangular Prism Simplex Edge - first any Square Prism Hypercube Face - first any Pentagonal Prism 120 - cell Face - first 0.93 Hexagonal Prism Hypercube Edge- first 0.0 Truncated Tetrahedron ** 120 - Cell Vertex - first approx 0.918 Truncated Octahedron ** 24 - Cell Cell - first approx 0.478 Truncated Icosahedron ( Soccer Ball ) ** 120 - cell Cell - first approx 0.5 & 0.66 Truncated Dodecahedron ** 120 - cell Cell - first approx 0.806 Small Rhombicosidodecahedron ** 120 - cell Cell - first approx 0.236 Trapezoidal Icositetrahedron ** FC Cross - Polytope Cell- first 0.0 Pentakisdodecahedron ** 600 - cell Vertex - first approx 0.5 ???
Related to Small Rhombicosidodecahedron ** 600 - cell Vertex - first approx 0.656 ???
Should have a name 600 - cell Vertex - first 0.0 ???
Should have a name FC 120 - cell Edge - first approx 0.964 ???
Should have a name FC 120 - cell Cell - first approx 0.864 ???
Should have a name FC 24 - cell Cell - first 0.0 ???
Should have a name FC 24 - cell Vertex - first 0.5
** Entries were identified by visual comparison with George Hart 's Virtual ( VRML ) Polyhedra .
This table assumes that you are using the default W - range choice ( on the Object tab ) .
( As mentioned above , the W - range choice resets to the appropriate default whenever you change the Object and Orientation choices . )
I am sure that many of the more complex figures also have names .
If you know some , email me and I will add them to the list .
Background and Acknowledgements
I have wanted to write ( or at least play with ) a polytope slicing program since 1996 when I first saw Gordon Kindlmann 's web pages
When the Java 3D API ( J3D ) became available , I started thinking seriously about doing it in Java ( my favorite computer language ) .
A prototype version of the applet used J3D .
I found J3D to be cumbersome and wasteful of resources so I dumped it and wrote my own rendering code .
( This is not quite as cool as it sounds , because it is pretty easy to render a single convex polyhedron . )
This project could not have happened without H.S.M.
Coxeter 's book " Regular Polytopes " ( Coxeter01 ) .
The constructions and metrical properties of most of the polytopes come from Coxeter 's book .
Looking over Gordon Kindlmann 's older pages years later ( August 2005 ) , I see that that 's where I got some of the key concepts that I used in my algorithms .
I spent most of my spare time working on this applet over a 3 - month period starting in mid-November 1998 .
I have enjoyed this project immensely .
If I could find a way ( financially ) to do stuff like this full - time , I would be a happy guy .

Today , more than 23,000 representatives of private industry are working quietly with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security .
The members of this rapidly growing group , called InfraGard , receive secret warnings of terrorist threats before the public does - and , at least on one occasion , before elected officials .
In return , they provide information to the government , which alarms the ACLU .
But there may be more to it than that .
One business executive , who showed me his InfraGard card , told me they have permission to " shoot to kill " in the event of martial law .
InfraGard is " a child of the FBI , " says Michael Hershman , the chairman of the advisory board of the InfraGard National Members Alliance and CEO of the Fairfax Group , an international consulting firm .
InfraGard started in Cleveland back in 1996 , when the private sector there cooperated with the FBI to investigate cyber threats .
" Then the FBI cloned it , " says Phyllis Schneck , chairman of the board of directors of the InfraGard National Members Alliance , and the prime mover behind the growth of InfraGard over the last several years .
InfraGard itself is still an FBI operation , with FBI agents in each state overseeing the local InfraGard chapters .
( There are now eighty - six of them . )
The alliance is a nonprofit organization of private sector InfraGard members .
" We are the owners , operators , and experts of our critical infrastructure , from the CEO of a large company in agriculture or high finance to the guy who turns the valve at the water utility , " says Schneck , who by day is the vice president of research integration at Secure Computing .
" At its most basic level , InfraGard is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the private sector , " the InfraGard website states .
" InfraGard chapters are geographically linked with FBI Field Office territories . "
In November 2001 , InfraGard had around 1,700 members .
As of late January , InfraGard had 23,682 members , according to its website , www.infragard.net, which adds that " 350 of our nation 's Fortune 500 have a representative in InfraGard . "
To join , each person must be sponsored by " an existing InfraGard member , chapter , or partner organization . "
The FBI then vets the applicant .
On the application form , prospective members are asked which aspect of the critical infrastructure their organization deals with .
These include : agriculture , banking and finance , the chemical industry , defense , energy , food , information and telecommunications , law enforcement , public health , and transportation .
FBI Director Robert Mueller addressed an InfraGard convention on August 9 , 2005 .
At that time , the group had less than half as many members as it does today .
" To date , there are more than 11,000 members of InfraGard , " he said .
" From our perspective that amounts to 11,000 contacts . . . and 11,000 partners in our mission to protect America . "
He added a little later , " Those of you in the private sector are the first line of defense . "
He urged InfraGard members to contact the FBI if they " note suspicious activity or an unusual event . "
And he said they could sic the FBI on " disgruntled employees who will use knowledge gained on the job against their employers . "
In an interview with InfraGard after the conference , which is featured prominently on the InfraGard members ' website , Mueller says : " It 's a great program . "
The ACLU is not so sanguine .
" There is evidence that InfraGard may be closer to a corporate TIPS program , turning private - sector corporations - some of which may be in a position to observe the activities of millions of individual customers - into surrogate eyes and ears for the FBI , " the ACLU warned in its August 2004 report The Surveillance - Industrial Complex : How the American Government Is Conscripting Businesses and Individuals in the Construction of a Surveillance Society .
InfraGard is not readily accessible to the general public .
Its communications with the FBI and Homeland Security are beyond the reach of the Freedom of Information Act under the " trade secrets " exemption , its website says .
And any conversation with the public or the media is supposed to be carefully rehearsed .
" The interests of InfraGard must be protected whenever presented to non-InfraGard members , " the website states .
" During interviews with members of the press , controlling the image of InfraGard being presented can be difficult .
Proper preparation for the interview will minimize the risk of embarrassment .
. . .
The InfraGard leadership and the local FBI representative should review the submitted questions , agree on the predilection of the answers , and identify the appropriate interviewee .
. . .
Tailor answers to the expected audience .
. . .
Questions concerning sensitive information should be avoided . "
One of the advantages of InfraGard , according to its leading members , is that the FBI gives them a heads - up on a secure portal about any threatening information related to infrastructure disruption or terrorism .
The InfraGard website advertises this .
In its list of benefits of joining InfraGard , it states : " Gain access to an FBI secure communication network complete with VPN encrypted website , webmail , listservs , message boards , and much more . "
InfraGard members receive " almost daily updates " on threats " emanating from both domestic sources and overseas , " Hershman says .
" We get very easy access to secure information that only goes to InfraGard members , " Schneck says .
" People are happy to be in the know . "
On November 1 , 2001 , the FBI had information about a potential threat to the bridges of California .
The alert went out to the InfraGard membership .
Enron was notified , and so , too , was Barry Davis , who worked for Morgan Stanley .
He notified his brother Gray , the governor of California .
" He said his brother talked to him before the FBI , " recalls Steve Maviglio , who was Davis 's press secretary at the time .
" And the governor got a lot of grief for releasing the information .
In his defense , he said , ' I was on the phone with my brother , who is an investment banker .
And if he knows , why should n't the public know ? ' "
Maviglio still sounds perturbed about this : " You 'd think an elected official would be the first to know , not the last . "
In return for being in the know , InfraGard members cooperate with the FBI and Homeland Security .
" InfraGard members have contributed to about 100 FBI cases , " Schneck says .
" What InfraGard brings you is reach into the regional and local communities .
We are a 22,000 - member vetted body of subject - matter experts that reaches across seventeen matrixes .
All the different stovepipes can connect with InfraGard . "

Schneck is proud of the relationships the InfraGard Members Alliance has built with the FBI .
" If you had to call 1 - 800 - FBI , you probably would n't bother , " she says .
" But if you knew Joe from a local meeting you had with him over a donut , you might call them .
Either to give or to get .
We want everyone to have a little black book . "
This black book may come in handy in times of an emergency .
" On the back of each membership card , " Schneck says , " we have all the numbers you 'd need : for Homeland Security , for the FBI , for the cyber center .
And by calling up as an InfraGard member , you will be listened to . "
She also says that members would have an easier time obtaining a " special telecommunications card that will enable your call to go through when others will not . "
This special status concerns the ACLU .
" The FBI should not be creating a privileged class of Americans who get special treatment , " says Jay Stanley , public education director of the ACLU 's technology and liberty program .
" There 's no ' business class ' in law enforcement .
If there 's information the FBI can share with 22,000 corporate bigwigs , why do n't they just share it with the public ?
That 's who their real ' special relationship ' is supposed to be with .
Secrecy is not a party favor to be given out to friends .
. . .
This bears a disturbing resemblance to the FBI 's handing out ' goodies ' to corporations in return for folding them into its domestic surveillance machinery . "
When the government raises its alert levels , InfraGard is in the loop .
For instance , in a press release on February 7 , 2003 , the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General announced that the national alert level was being raised from yellow to orange .
They then listed " additional steps " that agencies were taking to " increase their protective measures . "
One of those steps was to " provide alert information to InfraGard program . "
" They 're very much looped into our readiness capability , " says Amy Kudwa , spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security .
" We provide speakers , as well as do joint presentations [ with the FBI ] .
We also train alongside them , and they have participated in readiness exercises . "
On May 9 , 2007 , George Bush issued National Security Presidential Directive 51 entitled " National Continuity Policy . "
In it , he instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate with " private sector owners and operators of critical infrastructure , as appropriate , in order to provide for the delivery of essential services during an emergency . "
Asked if the InfraGard National Members Alliance was involved with these plans , Schneck said it was " not directly participating at this point . "
Hershman , chairman of the group 's advisory board , however , said that it was .
InfraGard members , sometimes hundreds at a time , have been used in " national emergency preparation drills , " Schneck acknowledges .
" In case something happens , everybody is ready , " says Norm Arendt , the head of the Madison , Wisconsin , chapter of InfraGard , and the safety director for the consulting firm Short Elliott Hendrickson , Inc .
" There 's been lots of discussions about what happens under an emergency . "
One business owner in the United States tells me that InfraGard members are being advised on how to prepare for a martial law situation - and what their role might be .
He showed me his InfraGard card , with his name and e-mail address on the front , along with the InfraGard logo and its slogan , " Partnership for Protection . "
On the back of the card were the emergency numbers that Schneck mentioned .
This business owner says he attended a small InfraGard meeting where agents of the FBI and Homeland Security discussed in astonishing detail what InfraGard members may be called upon to do .
" The meeting started off innocuously enough , with the speakers talking about corporate espionage , " he says .
" From there , it just progressed .
All of a sudden we were knee deep in what was expected of us when martial law is declared .
We were expected to share all our resources , but in return we'd be given specific benefits . "
These included , he says , the ability to travel in restricted areas and to get people out .
But that 's not all .
" Then they said when - not if - martial law is declared , it was our responsibility to protect our portion of the infrastructure , and if we had to use deadly force to protect it , we could n't be prosecuted , " he says .
I was able to confirm that the meeting took place where he said it had , and that the FBI and Homeland Security did make presentations there .
One InfraGard member who attended that meeting denies that the subject of lethal force came up .
But the whistleblower is 100 percent certain of it .
" I have nothing to gain by telling you this , and everything to lose , " he adds .
" I 'm so nervous about this , and I 'm not someone who gets nervous . "
Though Schneck says that FBI and Homeland Security agents do make presentations to InfraGard , she denies that InfraGard members would have any civil patrol or law enforcement functions .
" I have never heard of InfraGard members being told to use lethal force anywhere , " Schneck says .
The FBI adamantly denies it , also .
" That 's ridiculous , " says Catherine Milhoan , an FBI spokesperson .
" If you want to quote a businessperson saying that , knock yourself out .
If that 's what you want to print , fine . "
But one other InfraGard member corroborated the whistleblower 's account , and another would not deny it .
Christine Moerke is a business continuity consultant for Alliant Energy in Madison , Wisconsin .
She says she 's an InfraGard member , and she confirms that she has attended InfraGard meetings that went into the details about what kind of civil patrol function - including engaging in lethal force - that InfraGard members may be called upon to perform .
" There have been discussions like that , that I 've heard of and participated in , " she says .
Curt Haugen is CEO of S'Curo Group , a company that does " strategic planning , business continuity planning and disaster recovery , physical and IT security , policy development , internal control , personnel selection , and travel safety , " according to its website .
Haugen tells me he is a former FBI agent and that he has been an InfraGard member for many years .
He is a huge booster .
" It 's the only true organization where there is the public - private partnership , " he says .
" It 's all who knows who .
You know a face , you trust a face .
That 's what makes it work . "
He says InfraGard " absolutely " does emergency preparedness exercises .
When I ask about discussions the FBI and Homeland Security have had with InfraGard members about their use of lethal force , he says : " That much I can not comment on .
But as a private citizen , you have the right to use force if you feel threatened . "
" We were assured that if we were forced to kill someone to protect our infrastructure , there would be no repercussions , " the whistleblower says .
" It gave me goose bumps .
It chilled me to the bone . "

In an effort to crack down on fraudulent remedies being sold over the Internet , the government has warned 25 companies to stop selling purported cancer cures that federal health officials say could disrupt legitimate treatment and even harm unsuspecting patients .
Food and Drug Administration officials , who announced Tuesday that they were investigating fake cancer remedies , said that warning letters had been sent to Internet sellers of 125 tablets , lotions and tonics that purported to cure cancer .
The firms could have their products seized or face prosecution if they do n’t stop marketing them within 15 days , the FDA said .
“ Some products may present a direct safety hazard , while others could potentially interfere with medicines that a patient is already taking , ” said David Elder , director of the FDA ’s office of enforcement .
He called the fraudulent sales “ a cruel form of greed . ”
Officials could n’t point to any particular examples of harm to patients but said that one product , Black Salve , can burn away healthy skin .
Officials also expressed concern that patients taking the unapproved products might avoid getting legitimate treatment .

The moves underscore the power of the Internet as a marketplace for fraudulent remedies .
Similar problems in the pre-computer age led Congress to pass a 1938 law giving the FDA the power to bar sales of unproven products that could cause injury or death .
This year , authorities in Canada and Mexico and at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sent warning letters to representatives of 112 websites that were being used to hawk unproven cancer treatments .
The government is ready to introduce controversial new copyright legislation that experts believe will introduce harsh new restrictions on downloading , copying songs to CDs and music players , unlocking cellphones and time - shifting of television shows .
Minister of Industry Jim Prentice and the Minister of Canadian Heritage Josée Verner will unveil the bill to amend the Copyright Act on Thursday at 10:45 a.m. ET with brief statements , followed by a question - and - answer session with the media .
Critics fear the bill will mirror the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , which similarly brought in restrictive measures and opened the door for copyright owners to enact huge lawsuits against violators .
Prentice has said on several occasions that Canada 's Copyright
Act must be amended in order to bring the country into compliance with the World Intellectual Property Organization treaty it signed in 1996 .
The minister was forced to retreat on introducing the bill in December after being hit with major public opposition .
More than 20,000 people joined a protest group started on social networking site Facebook by University of Ottawa internet and e-commerce professor Michael Geist , an outspoken critic of the bill .
The opposition to the legislation has only grown since then , with the Facebook group counting more than 40,000 members now .

' What deterrent effect will this law have on anyone buying a CD , or renting a DVD , bringing it round to several friends houses and letting them rip it before returning it ? '
-- Gavin362436 < a href=http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/06/11/tech-copyright.html#postc>Add your comment</a>[/ CUSTOM ]
Canadian artists , librarians and students , as well as a business coalition made up of some of Canada 's biggest companies — including Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp. , as well as Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc. — have expressed their opposition to any legislation that imposes harsh copyright restrictions .
The chorus of opposition was joined last week by a coalition of consumers groups — including Option consommateurs , Consumers Council of Canada , Public Interest Advocacy Centre ( PIAC ) , the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic ( CIPPIC ) and Online Rights Canada ( OnlineRights.ca ) — who wrote a letter to the two ministers .
The consumer groups expressed dismay that they had not been consulted on the pending legislation .
Prentice responded to questioning in the House of Commons last week by saying he would not introduce the bill until he and Verner were satisfied that it struck the right balance between consumers and copyright holders .
Geist has repeatedly attacked the government on his blog for its lack of consultation with the Canadian public on the issue .
However , Prentice has met with U.S. trade representatives and entertainment industry lobbyists to discuss the legislation .
" Prentice should be honest about the core anti-circumvention rules that are likely to mirror the DMCA and run counter to the concerns of business , education and consumer groups , " Geist wrote on his blog .
" Those rules are quite clearly ' Born in the USA . ' "

It ’s one of Washington ’s open secrets : Neither political party has much love for the Federal Election Commission .
The commission currently lacks the quorum that allows it to decide even the most mundane electoral issues , and Congress does n’t seem in a hurry to end its seven - month long deadlock over the appointment of four FEC nominees .
If Congress does n’t act soon to end the stalemate , the 2008 elections , which are bound to get ugly in their final months , could go virtually unregulated for the first time since the FEC was founded more than 30 years ago .
When operating at capacity , the FEC has six commissioners , three from each party , who serve six - year terms .
For the commission to take action on most matters , four commissioners must agree .
Currently , the FEC has only two commissioners , Republican chairman David Mason and Democratic vice chairman Ellen Weintraub , so no significant action can be taken .
Democrats and Republicans have not been able to agree on how to fill the four open slots .
At the heart of the Senate impasse is one of the two Republican nominees , a former Justice Department lawyer named Hans von Spakovsky .
The Democrats consider him a deal breaker and view him as one of the leading forces in the Republican Party ’s efforts to use the seemingly nonexistent specter of voter fraud as a means to disenfranchise minority — and largely Democratic — voters .
The Democrats have been unwilling to vote for a group of nominees that includes von Spakovsky — and the Republicans have refused to withdraw his nomination .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has offered the Republicans a simple majority vote on each nominee , a move minority leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) has rejected because it will almost certainly result in the rejection of von Spakovsky .
“ That ’s an unacceptable outcome , ” says Don Stewart , McConnell ’s communications director .
Stewart says that the Republican leadership has also been offered a deal in which one Democrat and one Republican ( sitting FEC chairman Mason ) would move forward , leaving von Spakovsky behind .
“ Then you ’ve got a two - to - one ratio and you still do n’t have [ the four votes needed for ] a quorum , ” says Stewart .
The delay in holding a confirmation vote has already caused one nominee , Democrat Robert Lenhard , to drop out of the nomination process .
Even so , McConnell ’s position , as stated by Stewart , remains a simple one : “ All three move , or they do n’t move at all .
In fact , that ’s more important now because that ’s the only way to get a quorum . ”
According to Jim Manley , Reid ’s spokesman , that ’s not going to happen .
“ The next step is for the White House to withdraw his nomination , ” he says of von Spakovsky .
Stewart ’s response : “ Why should the Republicans have to choose a different nominee just because the Democrats do n’t like him ? ”
Both Stewart and Manley insist that their bosses desire a fully functioning FEC , and that the other party is the impediment .
Both also acknowledge there is little room for progress on the horizon .
Good government groups working for campaign - finance reform believe the delay is n’t an accident .
“ You ’re basically expecting the regulated to have an affection for the agency responsible for the regulating , ” says Paul Ryan , FEC program director at the Campaign Legal Center .
“ They would n’t say this publicly , ” adds Ryan ’s colleague Meredith McGehee , policy director at the CLC , “ but I do n’t think a lot of members [ of Congress ] are losing a lot of sleep ” over the FEC ’s situation .
“ One of the big roles of the FEC is to police congressional races , so many incumbents are not big fans of the FEC .
[ They ’re saying , ] ‘ Hey , if I do n’t have anybody looking over my back , what do I care ? ' ”
McGehee puts a larger share of the blame for the deadlock on McConnell ’s shoulders , pointing out that he has long opposed campaign - finance regulations .
She does n’t let the backbenchers of both parties off the hook , either .
“ If you look at the rank and file of Congress , they do n’t feel a sense of urgency about the FEC because to them the FEC is just a pain . ”
The downside , McGehee says , is that “ there ’s not really anyone standing up for the public ’s interests . ”
Robert Lenhard , who served as the FEC ’s chairman until December , when his two - year recess appointment ran out , withdrew his name from contention last week citing a need to move on .
He says the FEC is “ an agency that regulates politics in a political town , ” a fact that naturally makes it unpopular .
“ This is an agency that suffers two enormous disabilities , ” he says .
“ The first is that this is an agency without a constituency group .
There is no one other than the American people in some sort of broad and abstract sense whose self - interest is advanced by the existence of the FEC .
There is no group that comes forward and says , ‘ No , no , no .
This agency ’s work is essential and must continue . ' ”
“ The second is that it regulates politicians , ” he continues .
“ Everyone on the Hill has some interest in how things run over there .
And so the mixture of everyone being somewhat interested in it and no one really defending it make it a very tough road for this agency to hoe . ”
Even when the FEC functions at full strength , good government groups are n’t terribly impressed with its performance .
The fact that nominees are often party loyalists means that the commission rarely makes a move that upsets party headquarters , these groups say .
And when an issue comes before the commission that could greatly help one party at the expense of the other , gridlock kicks in .
Ed Davis , the research director of Common Cause , a lobbying group that advocates for government accountability , does n’t think that ’s going to change .
“ [ Congress does n’t ] want it to be a strong enforcement agency , so typically they send up nominees who are going to protect them and protect the parties ’ interests . ”
He adds , “ It ’s been a weak enforcement agency for a very long time . ”
Lenhard defends the commission .
“ This sense that the agency is at the beck and call of politicians — it really was n’t borne out by the experiences I had there , ” he says .
“ I think that there is no doubt that the good government groups want a more aggressive , prosecutorial agency .
But what [ they ’re ] missing often is that there is a very deep philosophical divide on how active a role the federal government should play in policing elections . ”
And that divide is n’t just among politicians , he argues .
“ My sense is that if the agency were to be dramatically more effective and were to intervene in elections , and get court orders to get candidates to take ads off the air , to raid offices and conduct audits in the midst of elections , and were to play a prosecutorial role that is more similar to traditional law enforcement , that people would be very uncomfortable with the federal government being that aggressive . ”
Lenhard also points out that the commission operates with relatively scarce resources .
“ The thing people need to understand about this agency is that this is among the smallest federal agencies .
It has 375 employees and about a $ 60 million a year budget to regulate a $ 4 billion industry , for lack of a better term , ” he says .
“ The federal government spends more money at the Department of Labor regulating union elections than is spent at the FEC regulating all federal elections . ”
So what happens going forward ?
“ We do n’t know , to be honest , ” says Davis of Common Cause .
“ We and the other groups continue to hold the position that Hans von Spakovsky is an exceptionally bad nominee for the agency .
At the same time , campaign finance is a key issue for us , and we ’re concerned that the FEC is not functioning .
It does n’t function at a level we ’d like it to anyway , but to be out of commission in a presidential election year is outrageous . ”
In essence , he says , the nation could be headed into an election year with effectively no oversight of campaign fundraising or spending .
As it stands , there are a number of pressing matters currently on hold , pending an FEC quorum .
First , candidates who applied for matching funds in the primary election are unable to get the money they were promised , which they would traditionally use to pay off debts .
Those funds are usually distributed around the end of March , when the tax funds that supply the public financing program begin rolling in .
For money to be distributed , it requires the votes of four commissioners .
There is also the outstanding question of lobbyist bundling rules .
“ When lobbyists bundle contributions to candidates or [ political action committees ] , the recipients have to disclose who the lobbyist was that bundled them , over a certain amount of money , ” says FEC spokesman Bob Biersack .
“ The technical rules for the mechanics of that process — who is defined as a lobbyist , how the disclosure works — are pending before the commission and ca n’t be approved finally until there are at least four members . ”
So lobbyists who double as major fundraisers can continue to work in the shadows .
Nor can the FEC deal with a variety of election - year complaints .
Last week , for example , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint with the commission alleging that Freedom ’s Watch , the conservative political advocacy group backed by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson , broke the law by coordinating with the National Republican Congressional Committee in planning an ad campaign .
Traditionally , FEC staff would do a little fact - finding and present what they discovered to the commissioners , who would then vote on whether or not to begin a full - scale investigation ( which customarily takes over a year , much to the chagrin of reform groups ) .
At the end of the investigation , the commissioners would review all the evidence and vote on whether to fine the violator .
Without a quorum , no new investigations can even begin , nor can ongoing ones be resolved .
Two pending issues could affect the candidacy of John McCain .
The first is a complaint by the Democratic National Committee that alleges that McCain , in taking out a much - needed campaign loan in late 2007 , gamed the matching - funds system for the primaries .
McCain applied for matching funds in August 2007 .
Had he gone on to participate in the program , the federal government would have matched every donation from an individual donor up to $ 250 .
In exchange , McCain would have had to accept spending limits in each state and an overall spending cap of around $ 50 million during the primary season .
Running low on money last November , before the matching funds became available , the McCain campaign took out a loan using a life - insurance policy as collateral .
In December , McCain looked to take out a second loan .
Hoping to avoid the spending limits but in need of collateral to justify the loan , McCain and his lawyers did some fancy legal footwork .
They promised the bank that if he were to win in New Hampshire and beyond , he would repay the loan using the fundraising that would inevitably be received by a winning candidate .
If he were to lose , he would drop out of the public spending system and then promptly opt back in .
With this agreement , McCain was n’t technically promising the bank the matching funds he was currently lined up for .
Doing so would have tied him to the spending limits .
Instead , he was backing the loan — supposedly — with future funds that he had yet to apply for .
By February 2008 McCain had locked up the nomination , and he dropped out of the matching - funds program .
The DNC complaint alleges that McCain could not drop out without getting the affirmative votes of four FEC commissioners , and that McCain would have prohibited from bailing because he effectively used matching funds as collateral for his loan .
If the FEC were to rule for the Democrats , McCain would already be in excess of nationwide spending limits , and would likely have to pay a fine as well as curb his campaign ’s spending until the convention .
The DNC has filed a lawsuit against the FEC in federal court , asking a judge to force the commission to act despite the lack of a quorum .
The second major McCain - related issue could hit later in the campaign , should McCain decide to accept public financing in the general election .
Under that program the Arizona senator would receive a public grant of $ 84 million to cover the entire cost of his campaign from the convention until Election Day .
McCain will likely opt in for a couple of reasons :
He ’s a supporter of the program because it limits the influence of special interests in politics and because he does n’t expect to raise more than what the federal government can promise him .
Every presidential nominee since the public funding system was established in 1974 has opted into public financing .
But disbursing the funds requires an FEC vote , meaning that McCain ’s campaign funds could be tied up until there ’s a quorum .
( Obama likely wo n’t run into the same problem , since , due to his historic fundraising numbers , it does not appear that he will accept federal money .
Clinton has n’t said one way or the other whether she will participate in the public financing system . )
What would happen then is anyone ’s guess , says Lenhard .
“ A candidate who wanted public financing could sue in federal court and get a federal judge to authorize the treasury to release those funds , or order the FEC to authorize the release despite an insufficient number of commissioners , ” he says .
“ But I think if you read the statute as written , it requires the affirmative vote of four commissioners to do it . ”
Biersack , the FEC spokesman , notes that some functions of the FEC are not hampered by the lack of a quorum .
“ All the disclosure activity that the Commission routinely does continues , ” he says .
“ Candidates file reports , we make them available , we ask questions if there are things on the reports that we think are unclear or problematic — all of that carries on . ”
But without Senate action on the FEC nominees , the commission will be unable to act on any significant issue that arises during this election cycle .
Senate Democrat and Republican leaders could reach a deal on the nominees “ if they wanted to , ” says a Democratic Senate staffer , “ but they ’re too dug in .
If we go into this next recess [ in late May ] without an FEC , we probably wo n’t have one until the next administration . ”
But Reid ’s office notes it wall take “ several moths ” just to replace Lenhard as one of the two Democratic nominees .
Lenhard agrees that no quick solution is likely .
“ My sense is that there is a window that will close when this Congress goes into recess for folks to come together and reach an accord .
And if they do n’t get the deal done then , my guess is that it will be early in the next administration until some sort of deal is struck . ”
And that will mean an election with no referees .
RawStory — Bill O’Reilly introduced Dennis Kucinich on The O’Reilly Factor by referring dismissively to Kucinich ’s current attempt to impeach George W. Bush .
“ A House vote to impeach President Bush was tabled this afternoon , ” O’Reilly remarked snidely .
“ This sent it to committee , which means a majority of Congresspeople do n’t want to deal with it . ”
“ It was referred to committee .
It was n’t tabled , ” Kucinich immediately objected .
The normal first step whenever impeachment charges are brought is to refer them to committee for review .
However , O’Reilly was not to be swayed .
“ It ’s not going anywhere , ” he insisted .
“ People on my radio program are saying , ‘ Why is a smart guy like Dennis Kucinich wasting everybody ’s time , taxpayers ’ money , on this nonsense … when we ’ve got out of control gas prices ? ' ”
In response , Kucinich pointed to his attempts to pass a windfall oil profits tax .
He then attempted to change the subject to the Iraq War and the recent Senate Intelligence Committee report , leading O’Reilly to grumble , “ Can I get on to really what I want to talk about here ? ”
“ It ’s your show , ” Kucinich grinned .
O’Reilly complained that a windfall profits tax would be useless because the oil companies would either pass it on to consumers or just refuse to drill for oil , to which Kucinich replied that “ it would be a tax not at the pump , but on profits , ” with the money going into a fund to support more fuel - efficient vehicles .
However , when Kucinich mentioned his investigation of “ the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , ” O’Reilly immediately caught fire .
“ Oh , I ’m with you on that ! ” he exclaimed .
“ Go get ’em ! ”
“ They ’re actually standing back while all the speculation is going , ” Kucinich explained . ”
“ Has nothing to do with supply and demand , driving the price of oil … ”
“ Look , Congressman , I ’m your best friend on that issue , ” O’Reilly chimed in .
“ You ought to take all of your time , knock off the dopey partisan impeachment stuff … get those bad guys . ”
“ You want me to tell you how they ’re connected ? ” Kucinich asked .
“ This administration is tied very closely to the oil industry , which is why nothing ’s been done . ”
He suggested that impeachment hearings might pry loose documents like those on Cheney ’s secret energy task force which the administration has refused to reveal .
The two men concluded by reaffirming a willingness to work together on the Commodity Futures Trading matter .
“ I want those SOB ’s taken down , ” O’Reilly stressed .
“ Let ’s work together to save the American consumer at the pump , ” Kucinich smiled . ”
“ Bill O’Reilly and Kucinich , together at last , ”

The humble earthworm , famously acknowledged by Charles Darwin when he wrote " It may be doubted whether there are many other animals ... which have played so important a part in the history of the world " , provides a new sensitive and detailed picture of what is going on in our contaminated soil ecosystems .
New research shows that copper contamination has a detrimental effect by interfering with the energy metabolism of the exposed invertebrates and that different pollutants have unique molecular effects , with implications for both monitoring and remediation of toxins .
The earthworm Lumbricus rubellus has long been known as an ' ecosystem engineer ' for the role it plays in water , nutrient and carbon cycling in a range of tropical and temperate soils , and is widely used as a model organism for soil testing .
However , standard lab assays do not reveal the molecular mechanisms by which L. rubellus adapts to exposure to soil contaminants .
Although the L. rubellus genome has not yet been sequenced , a comprehensive expressed sequence tag dataset is now available ( http://www.earthworm.org) that enables the development of tools that bring the earthworm into the genomics arena .
Two teams , funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and led by Peter Kille of Cardiff University , have jointly published their research on the use of a systems toxicology approach to understanding the impact of four soil contaminants on L. rubellus in the open access journals , BMC Biology and BMC Genomics .
Using a new 8,000 - element microarray , they describe the transcriptome profile of L. rubellus exposed to copper , cadmium , the polyaromatic hydrocarbon fluoroanthene , and the agrochemical atrazine .
In both studies this approach revealed subtle changes induced by the toxic chemicals in earthworm gene expression patterns .
The second study , which specifically focused on copper exposure , extended the approach by identifying the consequences of the genetic changes in terms of altered metabolism ( impact to their metabolomic profile ) in conjunction with large - scale physical changes in worm health .
The molecular approach to monitor ecosystem effects of toxins described in these two papers allows us to understand not only the uniqueness of earthworms , given that many of the genes they express do not yet have equivalents in ' model ' organisms , but is also an important step towards the better understanding of how the earthworm has evolved adaptive mechanisms to deal with soil pollution .
This multidisciplinary research shows that a systems approach to ecotoxicology , combining technologies usually used in isolation , can be a powerful tool for understanding the response of an ecologically important organism to contaminants , and opens up the possibility of new and more effective soil monitoring and bioremediation strategies .
Dr Kille concluded " The ubiquitous nature of the earthworm makes it an accepted part of our everyday world .
People do n't ask themselves how worms survive in soil where the pH naturally ranges from acidic pet bogs at pH 4 to chalk downs at pH 8 or where intensively farming requires significant use of agrochemicals / pesticides or within highly contaminated ex-industrial sites .
Our research illustrates how exploiting genomics and metabolomics reveals the mechanics that allow this organism to be omnipresent in our terrestrial environment . "

Homosexual behavior is largely shaped by genetics and random environmental factors , according to findings from the world 's largest study of twins .
Researchers from Queen Mary's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences and Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm report in the Archives of Sexual Behavior that genetics and environmental factors ( which are specific to an individual , and may include biological processes such as different hormone exposure in the womb ) , are important determinants of homosexual behavior .
The team led by Dr Niklas Långström at Karolinska Institutet conducted the first truly population - based survey of all adult ( 20 - 47 years old ) twins in Sweden .
Studies of identical twins and non-identical , or fraternal , twins are often used to untangle the genetic and environmental factors responsible for a trait .
While identical twins share all of their genes and their entire environment , fraternal twins share only half of their genes and their entire environment .
Therefore , greater similarity in a trait between identical twins compared to fraternal twins shows that genetic factors are partly responsible for the trait .
Dr Qazi Rahman , study co-author and a leading scientist on human sexual orientation , explains : " This study puts cold water on any concerns that we are looking for a single ' gay gene ' or a single environmental variable which could be used to ' select out ' homosexuality - the factors which influence sexual orientation are complex .
And we are not simply talking about homosexuality here - heterosexual behaviour is also influenced by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors .
The study looked at 3,826 same - gender twin pairs ( 7,652 individuals ) , who were asked about the total numbers of opposite sex and same sex partners they had ever had .
The findings showed that 35 per cent of the differences between men in same - sex behavior ( that is , that some men have no same sex partners , and some have one or more ) is accounted for by genetics .
Rahman explains :
" Overall , genetics accounted for around 35 per cent of the differences between men in homosexual behaviour and other individual - specific environmental factors ( that is , not societal attitudes , family or parenting which are shared by twins ) accounted for around 64 per cent .
In other words , men become gay or straight because of different developmental pathways , not just one pathway . "
For women , genetics explained roughly 18 per cent of the variation in same - sex behavior , non-shared environment roughly 64 per cent and shared factors , or the family environment , explained 16 per cent .
The study shows that genetic influences are important but modest , and that non-shared environmental factors , which may include factors operating during foetal development , dominate .
Importantly , heredity had roughly the same influence as shared environmental factors in women , whereas the latter had no impact on sexual behavior in men .
Dr Rahman adds : " The study is not without its limitations - we used a behavioural measure of sexual orientation which might be ok to use for men ( men 's psychological orientation , sexual behaviour , and sexual responses are highly related ) but less so for women ( who show a clearer separation between these elements of sexuality ) .
Despite this , our study provides the most unbiased estimates presented so far of genetic and non-genetic contributions to sexual orientation . "
On 4 October 2007 the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly passed Resolution 1580 , which issued a stark warning : creationism , the denial of Darwinian evolution , is on the rise in Europe .
The resolution focused on the way that creationists across the continent , using the model pioneered in America , have been targeting education , and warned of “ a real risk of serious confusion being introduced into our children ’s minds between what has to do with convictions , beliefs , ideals of all sorts and what has to do with science ” .
“ An ‘ all things are equal ’ attitude , ” it concludes , “ may seem appealing and tolerant , but is in fact dangerous . ”
The resolution urged member states to “ defend and promote scientific knowledge ” and “ firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution . ”
But what provoked this European body to issue such an uncharacteristically clear and forthright statement ?
The resolution was based on a comprehensive report prepared by the Committee on Culture , Science and Education and delivered to the Assembly by the special rapporteur Guy Lengage on 5 June 2007 .
This report synthesised research from across the EU citing examples of the rise of creationism in 14 member states , as well as significant non-members Russia , Serbia and Turkey .
Examples cited of a growing creationist influence ranged from subtle downgrading of evolution in science education to outright attacks on the validity of Darwinism and the personality of Darwin himself .
In Greece , the report found , evolution education was relegated to the very bottom of the science curriculum , which often meant in effect that secondary students learnt nothing about it because of a lack of time .
In Switzerland organisations like The European Biblical Centre and the ProGenesis group were devoting considerable resources to promoting creationist education .
In Russia a 16 - year - old girl launched a court case against the Ministry of Education , backed by the Russian Orthodox Church , challenging the teaching of just one “ theory ” of biology in school textbooks as a breach of her human rights .
In the UK in 2006 the Intelligent Design propagandists Truth in Science sent out a “ teaching pack ” to every secondary school and sixth - form college in the country .
One of the more bizarre cases cited by the report comes from Poland , where in October 2006 deputy minister of education Miroslaw Orzechowski told the Gazetta Wyborccza that “ The theory of evolution is a lie , an error that we have legalised as a common truth . ”
He further argued that evolution is the “ feeble idea of an aged non-believer ” and put this error down to the fact that Darwin was “ a vegetarian and lacked fire inside him ” .
Each of these cases confirms the existence of a strong Christian creationist lobby in Europe , but the report also focused its attention on a new phenomenon – the rise of Muslim creationism .
The central figure here is the Turkish Muslim creationist Adnan Oktar , who , writing under the pen name Harun Yahya , has made a career out of attacking Darwinian evolution .
Oktar is a figure fairly well known to Darwinists and despite his claims to scientific competence is clearly little more than a crank .
However what had changed , according to the report , was the scale and ambition of Oktar ’s pseudo - scientific message .
Since 2006 copies of a substantial , glossy and smartly packaged book called Atlas of Creation , credited to Harun Yahya , had been arriving at schools and universities across Europe .
In Spain , France , Switzerland and Denmark clear evidence of the growing resources and confidence of European Muslim creationism was thudding on to the mat .
The book is the first of a projected seven - part series , and parts two and three have already begun arriving at educational institutes Europe - wide .
Clearly , for the assembly , the report amounted to strong evidence that creationists were working strategically across Europe , with the aim of influencing the science curriculum as well as public opinion .
Though it does not say so explicitly the implication of the report is that creationists of different denominations and faiths are , or might soon be , working together in a concerted assault on science teaching , in the same way that American creationists have been for the past decade .
In response to the call for action from the Assembly , only the Swedish government acted promptly , swiftly issuing a general ban on the teaching of creationism and Intelligent Design in their schools .
My own copy of Atlas of Creation , all six kilos , arrived in 2006 , just after my research group at the University of Aarhus had launched our Darwin in Denmark project , with online editions of Danish translations of Charles Darwin ’s writings .
In fact 20 copies arrived , unrequested and completely free .
Hardbound and expensively produced with almost 800 pages of text and images printed on glossy paper , this book presents one of the most remarkable attacks not only on the theory of evolution but on science itself .
The book is full of scientific jargon , diagrams and tables , and appears to discuss Darwinian evolution in detail and refute it through careful consideration of the evidence of the fossil record , animal biology and the history of science .
Most of this is the same old tired creationism , emphasising the gaps in the fossil record and making much of the various scientific hoaxes like “ Piltdown Man ” which , it argues , were attempts by Darwinians to fabricate proof for their hypothesis .
One of the most astonishing claims in the book is that Charles Darwin – the quiet Victorian gentleman naturalist – was responsible for the worst evils of the 20th century : racism , communism , fascism , Nazism , terrorism and , ultimately , 9/11 .
In a piece of overt symbolic theatre the book ’s creators marked the anniversary of 9/11 last year by sending the Atlas to a large number of Protestant priests across Europe .
The message was clear : in the fight against the theory of evolution Christians and Muslims stand united .
But despite the hyperbolic claims the shock caused by Atlas of Creation is largely unrelated to its contents , which do not stand up to even the most cursory scrutiny .
The real point is that before the book arrived many had no idea there was a resurgent Muslim creationism in Europe , and certainly did n’t know it was so well funded and organised .
Who , people began to ask , is bankrolling Oktar ’s Science Research Foundation or Global Publishing of Istanbul , which published and distributed the book ?
So far no one has been able to find out , and all Oktar says is that he is funded by donations .
One thing is clear : creationism has indeed come to Europe and unfortunately , therefore , we have to take it seriously .
We ca n’t afford to be complacent , or imagine that creationism is just a bizarre and distant American phenomenon .
Just as manipulative as the worst of American creationists , European creationists are hard at work and some of them have a lot of money ( Oktar also sent his book to many universities in the US ) .
What we have seen so far is just the beginning .
As the bicentenary of Darwin ’s birth and 150th anniversary of the publication of The Origin of Species coincide in 2009 , those of us who support science have an excellent opportunity to reclaim the agenda .
To be successful we need interdisciplinary collaboration , across all branches of science and the humanities .
The issue at stake is not just a question of ideologically motivated attacks on the theory of evolution .
At the very heart of the debate lies the question of the standing of academic knowledge in society .
We need to take this seriously , both in the humanities and in the sciences .
Now more than ever it is time to bridge the gap and together stop the nonsense .

Officers found 528 knives after conducting nearly 27,000 searches during Operation Blunt 2 , launched after Boris Johnson was elected London Mayor in May pledging to tackle knife crime in the capital .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair announced the figures alongside Johnson at a briefing at the Mayor ’s offices in City Hall .
The figures were released as police continued to search for the killers of 16 - year - old Ben Kinsella , stabbed to death in Islington , north London , on Sunday .
Kinsella was the 17th teenager murdered in the capital this year .
Six teenagers have been arrested over his death and three remain in custody .
On Tuesday night , a woman in her late 20s became London ’s latest stabbing victim , following the knife murder of a 34 - year - old man on Monday .
Both incidents took place in Southwark , south London .
“ The dreadful murder of Ben Kinsella shows that the problem of knife crime is still with us , ” said Blair .
“ I know the communities of London understand that this is something they and the police have to solve together and I promise that the Met is in this for the long haul and will do everything in its power to stop these murders continuing . ”
On Tuesday , hundreds of people , many wearing T - shirts emblazoned with pictures of Kinsella and holding placards , took part in a protest led by the victim ’s family and friends through north London to the place where he was stabbed .
“ Everybody is shocked by the level of violence we are seeing , particularly towards young people in London and we must all work as hard as we can together to reverse this dreadful trend , ” said Johnson .
The Conservatives later released figures showing admissions to hospitals for people suffering stab wounds had risen every year since at least 2002/3 .
The figures , compiled by Hospital Episodes Statistics , found that the number had risen by 88 percent from 95 in 2002 / 3 to 179 in 2006 / 7 , the most recent data available .
Among 16 to 18 - year - olds , there had been a 75 percent increase .
“ These alarming figures betray just how vulnerable our youngsters are to violent and knife crime , ” said Tory Home Affairs spokesman Dominic Grieve .

HTML is intended to be written by humans ( by hand ) .
HTML is intended to be displayed to humans .
Machines that want to interpret HTML need to act like humans , and not the other way around .
Short post here ... The thread started by Elliotte Rusty Harold ( super smart guy ) called Why XHTML is provoking a number of intelligent and articulate responses .
Here 's my take : I used to be firmly in the XHTML camp , but now I 'm not .
I 'm not against people outputting valid XHTML instead of HTML , probably they should .
Unless it is too hard .
I just do n't think that it matters all that much in practice .
My rationalization for this is pretty straightforward , and goes like this :
The web in made up of a nearly infinite variety of html - ish documents , some valid xhtml , some valid html , but mostly just almost - valid almost - html .
So if you are writing a client for the web as it is , you will need to accept the most liberal input possible because a client that throws errors when it sees a missingsymbol is n't a very useful client at all .
So take the best possible case : A client sees a document , and the server declares that document 's mime type to beor the document declares one of the xhtml doctypes , so the client fires up a validating XML parser , finds the document to be valid XML , outputs a XML tree ( nothing html specific here ) , then walks that tree according to the most state - of - the art html heuristics ( e.g. , the html5 grammar ) , and renders the document accordingly ( the hard and time - consuming part ) .
That 's the best case .
The worse case is : A client sees a document , and the server does n't bother to set a mime - type at all ( or sets the wrong one ) and / or does n't declare an xhtml doctype , and the client starts walking the characters in the document according to the most state - of - the art html heuristics ( e.g. , the html5 grammar ) , and renders the document accordingly ( the hard and time - consuming part ) .
The difference between the best and the worst case is slight enough , and I 'm not particularly convinced that the cost of running the first pass through a validating XML parser and creating a XML parse tree buys you much benefit when starting to parse the interesting stuff , the html itself .
But the real clincher is that the best case scenario is fleetingly unlikely .
There are three possible outcomes here : 1 ) either the document is n't declared to be xhtml at all so you fall through to the worse case , 2 ) the document is declared to be valid xml so you start parsing it only to find out it was invalid , so you start over again with the worst case , or 3 ) the document is valid xml and you have the best case scenario .
In practice on the real web , cases 1 and 2 are so much more likely that if you 're a pragmatic client you may as well start with the worst case and never bother parsing the document for the best case in the first place .
Now if you 're a document author , and you know that pragmatic clients are going to interpret your document according to the worst case rules no matter what you do , your only real incentive for writing xhtml over html is one of personal preference .
I can see some cases with machine - generated documents that emitting xhtml is actually just as easy as emitting html ( say , if you are building up a DOM tree to represent your content anyway ) , or if you need to round - trip within a closed ecosystem of clients .
But as soon as humans are involved in the production of the document , given the axiom that no human should ever have to write xml by hand , you are almost certainly going to be producing html , not valid xhtml .
Ultimately it comes down to the human element .
People write the content and people will always write it using non-validating formats , if for no other reason that writing compliant documents is hard , and people have better things to do with their time than check for missingsymbols .
( And moreover , people also write the software that generates xhtml , and that software is often buggy and produces invalid documents anyway . )
My conclusion is that if you can produce valid xhtml , go for it .
But in the end it does n't make much of a difference .
In fact , I 'm pretty certain that the web itself would n't have succeeded if xhtml was required from the beginning , because a web that renders and displays documents is a much better web than one that throws validation errors all over the place .
( And all this , coming from a former xhtml guy ...) a few of the other axioms that inform my thinking on this :

LazyEvaluationOfFunctionArguments
by Walter Bright , http://www.digitalmars.com/d
Lazy evaluation is the technique of not evaluating an expression unless and until the result of the expression is required .
The && , || and ? : operators are the conventional way to do lazy evaluation :
void test ( int * p ) { if ( p && p [ 0 ] ) ... }
The second expression p [ 0 ] is not evaluated unless p is not null .
If the second expression was not lazily evaluated , it would generate a runtime fault if p was null .
While invaluable , the lazy evaluation operators have significant limitations .
Consider a logging function , which logs a message , and can be turned on and off at runtime based on a global value :
void log ( char [ ] message ) { if ( logging ) fwritefln ( logfile , message ) ; }
Often , the message string will be constructed at runtime :
void foo( int i ) { log( " Entering foo ( ) with i set to " ~ toString ( i ) ) ; }
While this works , the problem is that the building of the message string happens regardless of whether logging is enabled or not .
With applications that make heavy use of logging , this can become a terrible drain on performance .
One way to fix it is by using lazy evaluation :
void foo( int i ) { if ( logging ) log( " Entering foo ( ) with i set to " ~ toString ( i ) ) ; }
but this violates encapsulation principles by exposing the details of logging to the user .
In C , this problem is often worked around by using a macro :
# define LOG ( string ) ( logging && log( string ) )
but that just papers over the problem .
Preprocessor macros have well known shortcomings :
The logging variable is exposed in the user 's namespace .
variable is exposed in the user 's namespace .
Macros are invisible to symbolic debuggers .
Macros are global only , and can not be scoped .
Macros can not be class members .
Macros cannot have their address taken , so cannot be passed indirectly like functions can .
A robust solution would be a way to do lazy evaluation of function parameters .
Such a way is possible in the D programming language using a delegate parameter :
void log ( char [ ] delegate ( ) dg ) { if ( logging ) fwritefln ( logfile , dg( ) ) ; } void foo( int i ) { log ( { return " Entering foo ( ) with i set to " ~ toString ( i ) ; } ) ; }
Now , the string building expression only gets evaluated if logging is true , and encapsulation is maintained .
The only trouble is that few are going to want to wrap expressions with { return exp ; } .
So D takes it one small , but crucial , step further ( suggested by Andrei Alexandrescu ) .
Any expression can be implicitly converted to a delegate that returns either void or the type of the expression .
The delegate declaration is replaced by the lazy storage class ( suggested by Tomasz Stachowiak ) .
The functions then become :
void log ( lazy char [ ] dg ) { if ( logging ) fwritefln ( logfile , dg( ) ) ; } void foo( int i ) { log( " Entering foo ( ) with i set to " ~ toString ( i ) ) ; }
which is our original version , except that now the string is not constructed unless logging is turned on .
Any time there is a repeating pattern seen in code , being able to abstract out that pattern and encapsulate it means we can reduce the complexity of the code , and hence bugs .
The most common example of this is the function itself .
Lazy evaluation enables encapsulation of a host of other patterns .
For a simple example , suppose an expression is to be evaluated count times .
The pattern is :
for ( int i = 0 ; i < count ; i++) exp ;
This pattern can be encapsulated in a function using lazy evaluation :
void dotimes ( int count , lazy void exp ) { for ( int i = 0 ; i < count ; i++) exp ( ) ; }
It can be used like :
void foo( ) { int x = 0 ; dotimes ( 10 , writef ( x++ ) ) ; }
which will print :
0123456789
More complex user defined control structures are possible .
Here 's a method to create a switch like structure :
bool scase ( bool b , lazy void dg ) { if ( b ) dg ( ) ; return b ; } void cond ( bool delegate ( ) [ ] cases ... ) { foreach ( c ; cases ) { if ( c ( ) ) break ; } }
which can be used like :
void foo( ) { int v = 2 ; cond ( scase ( v == 1 , writefln ( " it is 1 " ) ) , scase ( v == 2 , writefln ( " it is 2 " ) ) , scase ( v == 3 , writefln ( " it is 3 " ) ) , scase ( true , writefln ( " it is the default " ) ) ) ; }
which will print :
it is 2
Those familiar with the Lisp programming language will notice some intriguing parallels with Lisp macros .
For a last example , there is the common pattern :
Abc p ; p = foo( ) ; if ( ! p ) throw new Exception ( " foo ( ) failed " ) ; p.bar ( ) ;
Because throw is a statement , not an expression , expressions that need to do this need to be broken up into multiple statements , and extra variables are introduced .
( For a thorough treatment of this issue , see Andrei Alexandrescu and Petru Marginean 's paper Enforcements ) .
With lazy evaluation , this can all be encapsulated into a single function :
Abc Enforce ( Abc p , lazy char [ ] msg ) { if ( ! p ) throw new Exception ( msg ( ) ) ; return p ; }
and the opening example above becomes simply :
Enforce ( foo ( ) , " foo ( ) failed " ) .bar ( ) ;
and 5 lines of code become one .
Enforce can be improved by making it a template function :
T Enforce ( T ) ( T p , lazy char [ ] msg ) { if ( ! p ) throw new Exception ( msg ( ) ) ; return p ; }
Conclusion
Lazy evaluation of function arguments dramatically extends the expressive power of functions .
It enables the encapsulation into functions of many common coding patterns and idioms that previously were too clumsy or impractical to do .
