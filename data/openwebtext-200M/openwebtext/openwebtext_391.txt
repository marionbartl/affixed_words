A network model created with data from the study : blue nodes are males , pink nodes are females , and gray nodes are unknown gender .
The node size is proportional to the age of the phone user , and the color and width of the links grows with persistence .

Some friendships are short and fleeting , while others may last years .
Although a wide variety of factors go into determining the strength of our relationships , the long - lasting ones seem to share a number of the same characteristics , according to a recent study .
Using data from nearly 2 million people and 8 million phone calls over the course of a year , physicist Cesar Hidalgo from the University of Notre Dame and sociologist Carlos Rodriguez - Sickert from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile have investigated the persistence of relationships within the cell phone network .
Somewhat intuitively , they found that the leading cause of persistent relationships is reciprocity - returning a friend´s call .
Further , they could use these characteristics to predict the nature of relationships in the future .
As the researchers explain in their study , the persistence of the connection between two individuals is a measurement of how often they call each other .
The scientists analyzed 15 - day intervals , and determined if the two callers made contact within each interval .
The greater number of these chunks of time in which contact occurred , the higher the pair´s persistence value was .
The scientists found that the majority ( 60 % ) of ties between two callers lasted for just one 15 - day interval .
The next 20 % of ties disappeared slowly throughout the course of the year , and the remaining 20 % persisted for the entire one - year period .
The results showed that the strongest factor determining persistence values was when individuals returned calls to each other .
When links were reciprocated , those links had a greater chance of persisting for longer time periods .
Also , when an individual´s connections had connections among themselves ( when a person´s friends knew each other ) , his or her own connections lasted longer .
The results also revealed insight into " social butterflies " - individuals with a high number of links .
" One result that I thought was somehow not so intuitive was the trade - off between the degree ( number of links ) of a person and the persistence of its ties , " Hidalgo told PhysOrg.com .
" It has been known for a long time that some people are much more connected than others , yet it was not known whether these highly connected individuals also had a larger number of strong connections .
While time constraints may force people with more ties to be less persistent on average , the data also showed that , in absolute terms , people with more ties also have a greater number of persistent ties than those less connected .
Highly connected individuals are not trading quality for quantity ; rather , they appear to be more socially expressed in both the numbers of links and the persistence or strength of them . "
By knowing the characteristics of persistence , the researchers could look at the features of the network for the first 15 days , and predict what the network would look like in the future .
Since social connections play a role in areas such as collective decision making and consumption , predicting these connections might help researchers predict some of society´s actions .
For example , measuring the persistence of a person´s social ties might open a new dimension for marketing segmentation strategies .
" One area which is interested in new ways of characterizing individuals is marketing , " Hidalgo said .
" To more effectively market their products , companies have traditionally segmented the targeted population by age , gender , ethnicities and socioeconomic status .
As data on the social structure becomes increasingly available , it becomes possible for companies to categorize people based on their local structure on the social network .
" This opens a new layer of information that can not be accessed otherwise .
The social structure surrounding an individual is likely the result of its behavior and personality , hence is likely to carry more relevant information than its age and gender .
The persistence of a person´s social relationships is a dynamical measure that can be used to tell us how strongly a person is connected to its peers .
It could indicate a level of respect or authority that cannot be captured by purely structural measures , such as the number of links or the density of its social structure . "

Apple may have a hard time shutting down the new maverick Mac - clonemaker Psystar , say legal experts .
Psystar , a Miami - based IT services company , started advertising the $ 400 OpenComputer this week .
It 's a generic PC that comes with Leopard , Apple 's latest operating system , pre-installed .
And while Psystar may be violating Apple 's end user license agreement , or EULA , by doing this , legally there 's not much Apple can do about it , says Raj Abhyanker , a patent lawyer who used to write patents for Apple .
" Basically , when people go to a store or download software , they have a license with Apple to use this patented software on their computer .
But breach of contract is one of the weakest forms of legal disputes , " Abhyanker says , referring to EULA violations .
The emergence of an unlicensed Mac clonemaker is a sign of Apple 's growing market power .
The Cupertino company sold more than 2.3 million Macs during the first quarter of 2008 – a growth rate that 's more than 2.5 times that of the overall PC market , according to research firm IDC .
Apple had an official clone - licensing program in the mid-1990s , but Steve Jobs killed it in 1997 after returning to lead Apple .
Based on the company 's website claims , engineers at Psystar appear to be emulating parts of the Mac firmware on a Windows PC – fooling Leopard into thinking it 's running on top of genuine Apple hardware .
Psystar claims it can successfully install Leopard 's kernel straight from the OS X disc using an EFI ( Extensible Firmware Interface ) emulator and a few drivers to ensure everything runs smoothly .
What 's more , Psystar is offering the pre-installation of Leopard for free if you order its budget Mac clone , the $ 400 OpenComputer , and purchase a copy of Leopard .
Abhyanker , an attorney who used to write patents for the Cupertino company and now runs his own patent firm , says Apple will have trouble preventing companies like Psystar from selling Leopard systems , especially now that Apple uses the same hardware as 99 percent of the rest of the PC industry .
In terms of a deterrent , Abhyanker says suing another company for violating a contract does n't even come close to a tort or patent infringement case .
" Those types of litigation ultimately have a lot more remedies for a plaintiff , " he says .
" But if you look at breach of contract , it 's usually limited ( depending on the state ) to the amount of services or the amount of goods as subject to the contract .
The maximum damage Apple would be able to claim is the price of Leopard – actually , the OEM ( original equipment manufacturer ) price of Leopard , which might be a few dollars . "
Even then , Apple may not be able to sue Psystar directly because the company may be buying legitimate copies of Leopard from a distributor .
In that case , the distributor would be liable for a breach - of - contract suit .
The problem , say lawyers contacted by Wired.com , is that breaking a EULA technically is n't illegal ( it 's not a signed or executable contract ) and penalties tend to vary from state to state , making it very hard to stop .
" Generally speaking , these user agreements are much weaker than other forms of litigation , " says Ted Man , a lawyer specializing in intellectual property and patents .
" They 're way more problematic , too .
It 's like going into an ER – those incredibly broad license agreements they make you sign where you 're basically signing away your life .
Companies make them as broad as possible but there 's no way to basically enforce them .
It 's a scare tactic , a way to say , hey , we 're reserving all these rights , " says Man .
If Apple sued Psystar , a private company , it would likely need to come up with a much better legal basis – something like patent or copyright infringement , or misappropriation of trade secrets .
Even then , says Abhyanker , it 's not clear that Psystar is violating Apple 's patents or trade secrets .
For a patent infringement lawsuit , Apple would have to clearly show it had claims to patents on the particular simulator methodology Psystar is using – which it may or may not have .
" Based on the fact that there 's more than 20 years of emulator software out there , I do n't see how they could claim infringement narrowly enough for what this particular company is doing , " Abhyanker says .
In a famous 1983 case , Apple Computer , Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. , Apple successfully convinced a California court that computer software in electronic form could be protected by copyright .
Engineers at Franklin Computer copied parts of Apple 's operating system for the Apple II computer so it could also run on the Franklin Ace computer .
Apple filed suit claiming copyright infringement and , while a judged initially sided with Franklin , in 1983 an appeals court overturned the ruling , saying that operating systems coded in computer hardware are subject to copyright .
While Apple could likely tie Psystar up in litigation by filing patent or copyright lawsuits , the better choice may be technical – issuing OS X firmware updates .
" Apple issues regular updates to Leopard , " Abhyanker says .
" Future revisions might require massive changes to the way [ Psystar ] sells software in this virtual environment and usually these things do n't last long unless there 's some sort of agreement . "
In the end , the clonemaker is always playing catch - up and it ends up being caught in a compatibility nightmare .
Psystar did not respond to multiple requests for comment , nor did Apple .
NEW YORK ( Reuters )  Verizon Communications ( VZ ) wants the Federal Communications Commission to make it easier for consumers to switch video service providers , as competition with cable companies heats up .
Both Verizon and phone industry leader AT&T ( T ) offer high - speed Internet and video services that compete with cable , while cable providers sell phone services .
Verizon said Wednesday that consumers should be able to switch from cable as easily as they can change phone companies .
Phone companies accept cancellations from rival providers , but many cable companies require consumers to submit disconnection orders themselves .
" The process to switch video providers is more cumbersome for consumers , " Verizon said in a petition to the FCC .
" This significantly complicates the process of switching video providers , thereby entrenching the cable incumbents ' dominant market position . "
The announcement from Verizon comes as the two largest U.S. cable operators , Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Time Warner Cable , reportedly discuss a joint wireless venture with Sprint Nextel ( S ) and Clearwire ( CLWR ) .
Verizon is spending billions of dollars on an all - fiber network to deliver FiOS , a high - speed Internet and high - definition video service .
The expansion of FiOS , however , has been limited by the slow pace of regulatory approval as well as construction and installation .
Verizon also offers satellite video services through a partnership with DirecTV to consumers without access to FiOS .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Recent claims that low - fat dairy products or calcium can help people lose weight are untrue , according to a review of the published scientific literature , which shows that neither dairy products in general nor calcium intake promote weight loss .
“ Do n’t believe the hype , ” Dr. Amy Joy Lanou told Reuters Health .
“ The ads that promote milk as helping to achieve a healthy weight are misleading ; the science does not support these ads . ”
Lanou , an assistant professor in the department of health and wellness at the University of North Carolina in Asheville and Neal D. Barnard with the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington , DC , evaluated evidence from 49 clinical trials that assessed whether dairy products or calcium can help people lose weight .
Of the 49 trials , 41 showed no effects of diary or calcium on weight , two showed an increase in body weight with a dairy regimen , one showed a lower rate of weight gain and only five showed weight loss .
However , it ’s quite likely that an association between calcium or dairy intake and weight loss seen in some “ observational ” studies may be due to other factors , such as increased exercise , cutting out high - calorie foods with little nutritional value , lifestyle habits , or increasing fiber , fruit , and vegetables in the diet , the researchers say .
“ Our findings demonstrate that increasing dairy product intake does not consistently result in weight or fat loss and may actually have the opposite effect , ” Lanou and Barnard conclude in the latest issue of Nutrition Reviews .
Lanou said she was not at all surprised by the findings because milk is designed for growth .
“ Milk is a food that is designed for helping small mammals grow into rather large ones in a relatively short period of time , ” she explained .
“ It is counterintuitive to think that a food that has lots of calories , fats , and protein would be helpful for weight loss . ”
She suggests switching to water .
“ We drink way too many of our daily allotted calories in milk , milkshakes , lattes , sodas and other sweetened beverages .
Water is healthy and naturally calorie - free , ” Lanou said .
“ Choosing water instead of milk means you can enjoy more nutrient - dense foods such as fruits vegetables , grains , and legumes and stay within your energy needs . ”

Thirty - five deaths in the infamous Lynmouth flood disaster came only days after RAF rain - making experiments over southern England , it has emerged .
Ninety million tonnes of water swept down the narrow valley into Lynmouth on 15 August , 1952 , destroying whole buildings .
Now , a BBC investigation has confirmed that secret experiments were causing heavy rainfall .
Classified documents on the trials have gone missing , but people involved have told their story for the BBC Radio Four 's Document programme .

I could never find anything of any consequence , except the fact that papers were clearly missing for the significant years
Tony Speller , former North Devon MP
North Devon experienced 250 times the normal August rainfall in 1952 .
Survivors tell how the air smelled of sulphur on the afternoon of the floods , and the rain fell so hard it hurt people 's faces .
The East and West Lyn rivers , which drop rapidly down from Exmoor , were swollen even before the fatal storm .
Trees were uprooted and formed dams behind bridges , creating walls of water that carried huge boulders into the village , destroying shops , hotels and homes .
Bodies washed out to sea were never found .
Dilys Singleton lost six members of her family , including her grandmother .
She recalls : " Mum identified her by this huge wart on her back because she had n't got no head , or arms , or legs when they found her " .
Survivors called for an investigation into the causes , and rumours of planes circling prior to the deluge .
The seedsman had said he'd make it rain , and he did .
It was not until the BBC news bulletin was read later on that a stony silence fell
Alan Yates , Operation Cumulus pilot
The Ministry of Defence has denied knowledge of so called " cloud - seeding " experiments during early August 1952 .
Tony Speller asked to see Ministry of Defence files when he was MP for North Devon under Margaret Thatcher .
He said : " I could never find anything of any consequence , except the fact that papers were clearly missing for the significant years " .
But the Document team have tracked down fresh evidence , including RAF logbooks and personal testimony .
" Operation Cumulus " was jokingly referred to by those involved as " Operation Witch Doctor " .
The team found a broadcast from the time that refers to the experiments - and the disaster .
Alan Yates , a glider pilot , tells how he flew over Bedfordshire as part of Operation Cumulus , spraying quantities of salt into the air .
Scientists told him it caused a heavy downpour in Staines , 50 miles ( 80 kilometres ) away in Middlesex .
He said : " I was told that the rain had been the heaviest for several years , and all out of a sky which looked summery .
" The seedsman had said he'd make it rain , and he did .
" Toasts were drunk to meteorology .
" It was not until the BBC news bulletin was read later on that a stony silence fell on the company . "
The team is still hoping for evidence that would clinch their case beyond all reasonable doubt .
Other flights may have taken place - possibly using silver iodide .
Poignant memories
The British Geological Survey has done preliminary searches for remaining traces , with more planned next year .
" They have not found silver and iodide in the same place , " a Document team spokeswoman said .
" But if they did , we would have a massive story . "
They hope for an answer in time for 15 August next year - when the people of Lynmouth will be marking the 50th anniversary of the great deluge .
The State Education Department , after seeing a copy of “ independent study ” guidelines in use at Wadleigh and a number of other schools , said it was examining whether the practice met its standards .
State law requires students to earn credits by completing set hours of “ seat time ”  essentially , showing up for class  and demonstrating subject mastery .
To graduate , they must also pass Regents exams .
“ We are looking into this situation very carefully , ” said Johanna Duncan - Poitier , the senior deputy state education commissioner .
“ We want to make sure that the student is getting what they deserve . ”
Critics say the practice is poised to become more prevalent as principals enjoy greater freedom from supervision at the same time as they are held more accountable for student performance , two hallmarks of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ’s plan to overhaul city schools .
Last fall , schools received letter grades based on student performance , with principals at D or F schools in danger of losing their jobs .
Diane Ravitch , a historian of the city ’s public schools who has been a frequent critic of the mayor ’s efforts , says the practice of credit recovery could raise questions about the validity of gains in the city ’s graduation rate .
According to the state , the city had a 50 percent four - year graduation rate in 2006 , the most recent year for which data was available , up from 44 percent in 2004 .
“ I think when it ’s used correctly , it might be a good thing , ” Ms. Ravitch said of credit recovery , “ but when used incorrectly it ’s a way of gaming the system . ”
But Mr. Klein said there was “ no basis to suggest that improper credit recovery has affected graduation rates . ”
Saying that 39,000 students received Regents or local diplomas last year , 8,000 more than in 2002 , when the mayor took control of the schools , he added , “ A few anecdotes do n’t materially affect this rise . ”
Randi Weingarten , president of the United Federation of Teachers , said that the union had received “ enough complaints about it that we are really concerned , ” but that without hard numbers on the prevalence of credit recovery , she could not say whether the graduation rate was suspect .
Over the past few years , we have watched Apple climb the music sales chart courtesy of the iTunes .
Last month we learned that Apple passed Best Buy to become the number two retailer in the the US in December .
Now , Apple has ascended to the top of the charts , surpassing Wal - Mart for the first time ever , according to an NPD MusicWatch Survey for the month January contained in an internal Apple e-mail which was leaked to Ars Technica but has not been officially published .
The news was announced in an e-mail sent this afternoon to some Apple employees , a copy of which was seen by Ars Technica .
It includes a screenshot of an Excel file showing the top ten music retailers in the US for January 2008 , and Apple is at the top of the list .
The iTunes Store leads the pack with 19 percent , Wal - Mart ( which includes the brick - and - mortar stores as well as its online properties ) is second with 15 percent , and Best Buy is third with 13 percent .
Amazon is a distant fourth at 6 percent , trailed by the likes of Borders , Circuit City , and Barnes & Noble .
Rhapsody is in the tenth slot with 1 percent .
The fact that a digital - only retailer has ascended to the top of the sales charts is not unexpected , but it does demonstrate just how much the music landscape has changed since the beginning of the decade .
The NPD Group has been tracking a " sharp increase " in digital downloads over the past several months as physical sales dry up .
According to NPD 's research , 48 percent of US teens did n't buy a single CD in 2007 , compared to 38 percent in 2006 .
Apple sits atop the NPD Group 's list .
At the request of the NPD we
have removed screenshots of the documents in question
It has been a dizzying climb for Apple , which only managed to pass Amazon to become the number three music retailer in June 2007 .
The biggest surprise is Amazon 's drop to the number four slot , which might be explained by consumers using iTunes , Wal - Mart , and Best Buy gift cards to buy music after the holiday season — and those gift cards certainly helped propel Apple to the number - one position .
For the music industry , there is a dark side to Apple 's ascension to the top of the charts .
Buying patterns for digital downloads are different , as customers are far more likely to cherry pick a favorite track or two from an album than purchase the whole thing .
In contrast , brick - and - mortar sales are predominantly high - margin CDs .
For 2007 , that translated into a 10 percent decline in overall music spending according to the NPD Group , and it's a trend that 's expected to continue for the foreseeable future .
Overall , paid downloads accounted for almost 30 percent of all music sold in January , a number that would have been unthinkable just a few short years ago .
With the Big Four labels throwing off the DRM shackles and experimenting with new delivery models like Last . fm 's free streaming service , the future looks bright for digital music distribution .
Update : note on " debunking "
We have seen some stories this morning claiming to have debunked this report based on conjecture ( no factual detail or analysis ) .
We repeat : the document says what we said it says , and you can see it for yourself .
The documents were also distributed to Apple employees , and show Apple as the number - one music retailer during the period in question .
That can't be debunked , sorry .
( Sure , you can claim that the data is bad , or sampled incorrectly , but there 's no proof of that yet . )
Also , I already noted that the results are influenced by gift card usage , and I noted that other retailers on the list have gift cards , too — do n't forget that fact .
A sale is a sale , as well .
We could also argue forever over whether or not gift cards sales matter , but note that no one was bothered by Apple 's December results which included a great deal of gift card purchases as well ( but did n't inspire any debunking that time around ) .
This is a monumental event for Apple , because while the company may not be guaranteed the top spot for eternity — or even the following month — it is something many thought would never happen .
But in closing , rest assured that this report is accurate .

MOSUL , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Gunmen shot dead an Iraqi reporter on Sunday after hauling her out of a taxi in Mosul , a notoriously violent city in northern Iraq where journalists are often targeted and live in fear of their lives .
U.S. soldiers take up positions on the roof top of a house in reaction to sniper fire in Mosul , 390 km ( 240 miles ) northwest of Baghdad , April 29 , 2007 .

Police said Serwa Abdul - Wahab , in her mid-30s , was on her way to work when gunmen forced her out of a taxi in east Mosul , 390 km ( 240 miles ) north of Baghdad , and shot her in the head .
A colleague who declined to be named for fear of being attacked said she had received a text message on her phone three weeks earlier warning her to stop reporting or she ’d be killed .
Yassir al - Hamadani , a friend of Abdul - Wahab ’s and the head of the Mosul branch of the Iraqi Association for Journalists ’
Rights , confirmed the police version of events .
“ Abdul - Wahab worked with us and was an active defender of Iraqi journalists ’ rights .
We ’re very sad to lose her , ” he said .
Police were not immediately able to say why anyone would want to target her .
Fellow journalists said she was a contributor to www.muraslon.org, an Iraqi news website .
She also worked as a secretary for the electoral council , charged with preparing for October 1 provincial elections .
Iraq , which witnessed significant growth in the media after the 2003 U.S. - led invasion , is the most dangerous place in the world for journalists to work , according to New York - based journalism watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) .
Iraqi journalists have been targeted because of their work or caught up in the cross - fire of Iraq ’s many - sided conflict .
The CPJ estimates that 127 journalists , both Iraqi and foreign , have been killed since 2003 , not including Abdul - Wahab .
Gunmen killed the head of Iraq ’s biggest journalist organisation , Shihab al - Tamimi , 74 , in Baghdad in February .
In all , three journalists have been killed this year , the CPJ said .
A count by Reuters , however , puts the toll at five .
The CPJ said in a report last week that Iraq had the world ’s worst record of solving murders of journalists , with 79 unsolved .
Journalists in Mosul keep a low profile , fearful of attracting the attention of al Qaeda , which has threatened many media workers there with death .
The U.S. military says Mosul is the last urban stronghold of the Sunni Islamist group .
linux kernel monkey log
This is a status report for the Linux Driver Project as of April 2008 , describing what has happened in the past year of work .
It was originally posted on the developer mailing list .
Executive Summary The Linux Driver Project ( LDP ) is alive and well , with over 300 developers wanting to participate , many drivers already written and accepted into the Linux kernel tree , and many more being currently developed .
The main problem is a lack of projects .
It turns out that there really is n't much hardware that Linux does n't already support .
Almost all new hardware produced is coming with a Linux driver already written by the company , or by the community with help from the company .
There are two main classes of hardware , video input devices and wireless network cards , that is not well supported by Linux , but large efforts are already underway to resolve this issue , with the wireless driver issue pretty much taken care of already , however there are a few notable exceptions .
Because of this , our main effort has turned into one of education .
Educating vendors of how to become members of the Linux kernel community , proper coding standards and procedures , and how to get their code into the kernel tree .
Much of our recent effort has been in code cleanup and shepherding into the kernel.org releases .
In the future , we are open to any new devices that need drivers to be written for them , and our procedure for handling projects is going to be changing to reflect the lessons learned in the past year to make things easier for vendors to participate , and for the community to easily detect what is going on and be able to help out in easier ways .
The Past Year The Beginning The Linux Driver Project ( LDP ) was born a little over a year ago with an announcement on the linux - kernel mailing list and a few blog postings .
It sprang up out of the complaints from some users and companies that there was a real " Linux driver problem " .
The perception was that Linux did not have good driver support , and that closed source drivers were potentially taking over some device types .
I figured that if we reduced the barrier for any company to have a Linux driver written for them to nothing except a few emails , a document or two , and hopefully a sample device , these problems would go away and we would be able to create a raft of opensource drivers for these problem devices that everyone seemed to be complaining about .
So the LDP was born .
It started out as a single place for hardware manufacturers to contact in order to get drivers written for their devices for free .
We allowed the ability for companies to sign an NDA if needed to help get over the hurdle that some companies have in releasing their specifications .
The NDA process was put into place through the Linux Foundation , and is a 3 - way NDA with all of the proper legal documents needed .
A funny thing happened though , what I figured would be a project flooded with requests for companies to get hardware working turned into anything but that .
Two major things then happened , both of which I could have never expected :
The number of developers who said they would be willing to help out in creating these drivers was amazing .
As of today , we have over 300 different people who have signed up to be a developer of a Linux driver , volunteering their talents and time to help Linux out .
This large developer base is a shining example of how strong and large the Linux community is .
Very few companies signed up for drivers .
It 's this last point that made me worry .
Yes , a number of companies did ask for drivers to be written , and we have done so , but not as many as I originally imagined .
The drivers we were writing were in the narrow vertical markets , all interesting devices and companies , but nothing really " mainstream " .
So where was this mass of hardware that Linux was n't supporting ?
The Linux Driver Myth Back in 2006 I gave a talk at the Ottawa Linux Symposium about a number of myths that are around the Linux kernel .
One of them was device and driver support .
I stated then , and still do that : Linux supports more different types of devices than any other operating system ever has in the history of computing .
Later on , a representative from Microsoft validated this statement saying that their research agreed with it , so this is not an unproven statement .
Yet still the " Linux has a driver problem " myth persisted .
The OSDL and then later the Linux Foundation 's Vendor Advisory board had " Linux drivers " as the second most pressing issue that they faced .
Surely these large vendors , all of which shipped Linux on their hardware and dealt with user issues every day were on to something .
So the LDP was created .
And no companies showed up .
So I spread the word some more .
And still no major companies showed up .
So what to do .
I tried my best with a general announcement of , " Tell me all of the hardware that you know of that is not supported by Linux ! "
The response by users was overwhelming .
My inbox was flooded with hundreds of messages , and the wiki page : http://www.linuxdriverproject.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/DriversNeeded was created .
This is the community 's best list of devices that are not currently supported on Linux as of today .
I then went and asked all of the individual companies that made up the Linux Foundation 's Vendor Advisory board what they needed for Linux drivers .
The conversation almost always went like this : ME
" What hardware do you ship that is not currently supported by Linux ? " VENDOR
" It all is . "
ME
" But wait , why are you claiming that ' Linux drivers ' is your second most pressing issue today with Linux ? "
VENDOR
" I do n't know . "
After much cajoling and harassment on my part , I 'm happy to say that the Linux Foundation 's Vendor Advisory board 's top 10 list of things that need to be worked on with Linux does n't mention drivers at all .
So let 's put this myth to rest once and for all please .
User Complaints
But wait , what about all of those email responses that I received .
It turns out that they can be categorized into four different groups : 1 ) Printer and Scanner support .
2 ) Older devices no longer manufactured that people really want to see working on their Linux machines someday .
3 ) Wireless device support 4 ) Video input device support .
Category 1 is already being handled very well by the Linux Printing project and the SANE project .
Printer and scanner drivers in Linux are userspace programs and libraries and have nothing to do with the kernel at all .
If you have any issues with these types of devices , please go ask the developers of those projects about it .
They are very knowledgeable , skilled , have vendor contacts , and can do a lot to help resolve your issues .
This area is already aptly covered by these people .
Category 2 is hard .
It would be great for Linux to support all of these older devices , but without the specs for the device , or in many cases , a company that is still in business , Linux support is going to be very difficult to achieve .
Reverse engineering is a great skill , one that I personally am no good at anymore .
This type of effort is not something that the LDP was set up to address , and luckily , for almost all modern hardware devices , it is not necessary .
So that leave wireless and video input devices .
Luckily both classes of these devices have a very active and productive developer community surrounding them .
The Linux - Wireless group of developers have done an amazing amount of work in the past year , adding a whole new wireless protocol stack to the Linux kernel , as well as numerous different hardware drivers , some initially created by vendors and others created by reverse engineering the hardware with no vendor help or approval .
The latest kernel.org releases contain a raft of new hardware support for wireless drivers , and the number of active drivers in their queue to be added in the near future is quite large .
There are still some wireless vendors that do not provide Linux support directly .
Two of these , Atheros and Broadcom have drivers created by the community through reverse engineering efforts .
These drivers usually lag the introduction of the hardware by a number of months due to the lack of vendor support .
Both of these companies have internal versions of drivers for their new hardware , but efforts on getting them to release them so far has been resisted .
Hopefully this will change in the future .
As for video input devices , there is an active Linux developer community in this area , but they seem to be hampered by a different development model ( Mecurial trees outside of the main kernel source ) , and a lack of full - time developers , not to mention a high degree of inter-personal conflicts that seem quite strange to outsiders .
Support for a large majority of these devices is slowly trickling into the main kernel tree , the most important being the USB Video class driver , which will support almost all new USB video devices in the future , thereby removing the major problem most users will face when purchasing a new video device .
The LDP group is also actively working on drivers for a number of different video devices today , with the code being available today for testing by users in the linux - next kernel releases .
These drivers should go into a kernel.org release in the near future when development is complete .
Education During the past year , I have had many different inquiries from different companies wishing to either have a driver written for their hardware , or to help get an existing driver into the Linux kernel source tree .
Almost all of these contacts has resulted in a process of helping to educate the vendor as to how the kernel community works , if a driver is even needed for their hardware ( in many cases it was not ) , and how to clean up their code for acceptance .
Despite my personal feeling that Linux has a very well documented procedure of how kernel development works , along with free books explaining how to do kernel development , it seems we still have a lot of work to go .
We need some way to help spread the message further to companies that are just starting out with Linux development .
Maybe we need to sign up a marketing department from some major Linux vendor to help out with this kind of effort .
In the past year I have given talks at many different companies all around the world on how the Linux kernel development process works , and I see this travel and speaking effort not ending any time soon .
I have started to recruit more developers to help out with this education process , but can always use more help .
If anyone wants to participate , and is comfortable in explaining our kernel development procedures , please let me know .
It is this kind of education that has helped out the most so far .
Lots of drivers have been cleaned up through the education process and eventually accepted into the kernel tree .
This effort will continue on , and has already started to move a lot of out - of - tree drivers into the main kernel.org tree Method of Development
When the LDP project was started , the structure of having a project manager for the individual project , and a number of developers working on each one was established .
Over the past year , this has worked for some projects , while for others , it has failed badly .
Some project teams have disappeared , including both project managers and developers .
This is quite common for opensource projects , so we need a way to route around the problem of this , allowing everyone to participate in a more open model .
To try to work toward this , I 've started to keep all code related to the LDP project in a quilt patch series .
It can be seen at : http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches/ldp/ and is now automatically included in the linux - next daily kernel releases .
This quilt series is contained within a git tree at that can be accessed at : http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/gregkh/patches.git
This tree provides a place where developers can provide changes , updates , and see where they can help out if they wish to do so in a much easier manner .
It also provides a way for companies participating to observe the status of their code in a much more open manner .
The Future So , what next ?
I have the following goals for the LDP in the next year : Continue to write new drivers for any company that wishes to have them developed .
These drivers are all to be released under the GPLv2 and included in the main Linux kernel source tree hosted at kernel.org .
Future maintenance of these drivers will be done either by members of the original company , or by the community members , depending on the wishes of the company .
Continue to be a focal point for companies to learn about the Linux development process and become part of the kernel community if they wish to .
I hope to enlist more people to help out with this process , but if not , my airline miles logged will continue to increase .
Work more in an open development manner , hosting all experimental and development code in a public git tree , getting daily testing in the linux - next tree on all architectures .
Thanks I 'd first like to thank my employer , Novell , for giving me the opportunity to work on this project full time .
Their acceptance and support for the LDP is amazing and has been what has allowed it to survive and produce such great results already in a short amount of time .
I 'd also like to thank all of the developers who have offered to help out with this project .
Your volunteering to participate is amazing and shows the strength of the Linux developer community .
I 'd also like to thank Tomasz Grzegurzko for maintaining and keeping the linuxdriverproject.org domain and server up and running so well , despite my best attempts to do stupid things with it at times .
Also thanks to the OSU Open Source Labs for your domain and bandwidth support of the project .

Once among the most frightening epithets in American political culture , “ socialized medicine ” seems to have lost its juju .
Today that phrase sounds awfully dated , like a song on a gramophone or a mother - in - law joke or a John Birch Society rant against fluoridated water .
Yet despite that antique quality , the old buzzwords appear regularly in columns , press releases and speeches .
Rudolph Giuliani , Mitt Romney and the rest of the Republican presidential pack run around squawking about socialism whenever anyone proposes health care reform .
Syndicated columnist Robert Novak warns that the federally financed , state - run Children ’s Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP ) is essentially a socialist conspiracy .
So does President Bush , who has vetoed a modest increase in that program ’s funding because he does n’t want to “ federalize health care . ”
Although the Red threat still triggers an autonomic reaction among GOP true believers , the rest of the country no longer twitches to that high - pitched , far - right whistle .
Most polls not only show enormous majorities favoring extension of coverage to every child , but substantial support for a radical change in how we pay and administer health insurance — including the possibility of a single - payer system .
Why does n’t the traditional propaganda work anymore ?
Perhaps the demise of the Soviet Union and the withering of communism in China have had a delayed effect on public attitudes here .
Both the Russians and the Chinese have turned more capitalist than the West , abandoning their former systems without substituting modern protections .
The ex-communists are more of a threat to the health of their own societies than to us .
Most Americans may also have noticed that corporate bureaucracy and corruption , which figure largely in the present health care system , are not preferable to government bureaucracy .
Doctors who used to wail about the dangers of Medicare have learned how unpleasant it is to deal with dozens of insurance companies , each creating different rules to cut costs and deny care .
So have their patients .
This corporate model is more expensive and less efficient than the government plans that provide care in every other industrialized nation .
And most Americans may have learned by now that such systems prevail in Western countries that are n’t normally categorized as “ socialist , ” including the United Kingdom , Japan , Spain , Canada , Germany , France , Denmark , Norway and Sweden .
All these nations manage to provide their citizens with high living standards , industrial and technological innovation , and broad political and economic freedom , even after 50 years of national health insurance .
Meanwhile , the credibility of conservatives has diminished steadily .
These days they cannot even achieve clarity on the meaning of their favorite cliches .
For instance , the president hates “ federalized health care , ” but sponsors a Medicare prescription drug program that wastes hundreds of billions on drug companies and private insurers .
Right - wing definitions no longer seem so clear , either .
When the government awards a billion dollars in sweetheart mercenary contracts to a wealthy Republican family in Michigan , that ’s “ private enterprise . ”
But when the government helps a struggling middle - class family in Maryland send its children to the doctor , that ’s creeping socialism .
Conservative ideology ’s declining relevance is again encouraging the politics of personal destruction .
That must be why right - wing voices on the Internet , talk radio and the Fox News Channel have launched a nasty attack on the family of Graeme Frost , a 12 - year - old Maryland boy who appeared in a Democratic radio commercial endorsing the SCHIP program .
He and his younger sister , both victims of a terrible car accident that left the little girl with permanent brain damage , have both needed federal assistance because their parents were unable to afford private insurance .
Certain conservative bloggers and pundits , seeking to prove that the Frost family is too affluent to qualify for SCHIP assistance , have harassed them , their neighbors and their co-workers .
They have spread myths and lies about the family , their house and the schools that their children attend .
And they have made repeated telephone calls to the Frost home , demanding answers to questions about their personal finances .
It does n’t seem to occur to any of these strict Christian moralists that the Frosts have enough trouble trying to care for their disabled daughter , or that the state of Maryland , under the SCHIP regulations , has determined that the Frost children are fully eligible for the help they obviously need .
Let us not hear again from these mean - spirited people about “ family values ” or “ compassionate conservatism . ”
Such is the devolution of conservatism in our time — from a philosophy concerned with overweening state authority to a movement that bullies children in the name of freedom .

Larry Ellison , ranked 12th on the Forbes 500 list with a net worth of $ 25 billion , has bagged a $ 3 million tax break after arguing that his flamboyant Japanese - style estate in Woodside is functionally obsolete .
The chief executive officer of software giant Oracle Corp. will be paid from San Mateo County property taxes collected this year , which otherwise would have gone to schools , the county general fund and cities , among other things , Deputy Controller Kanchan Charan said .
The hit to schools alone will be nearly $ 1.4 million .
Ellison 's Octopus Holdings LP acquired the 23 - acre site in May 1995 for $ 12 million and spent nine years constructing the lavish property , modeled on a Japanese emperor 's 16th century country residence , according to the San Mateo assessment appeals board .
It consists of a nearly 8,000 - square - foot main house with two wings , a guest home , three cottages and a gymnasium as well as a 5 - acre man -made lake , two waterfalls and two bridges .
Hundreds of mature cherry , maple and other trees were planted among nearly 1,000 redwoods , pines and oaks .
The assessor 's office based its January 2005 valuation on so - called reproduction costs , the $ 166.3 million it should have cost to build , said Terry Flinn , deputy assessor - county clerk - recorder .
Ultimately , after multiple delays and construction change orders , it ran more than $ 200 million .
Octopus Holdings , represented by San Francisco attorney William Bennett , asserted that it was worth only $ 64.7 million at that time , and in the two tax years since .
Why ?
How did Larry Ellison 's palatial estate decline by more than 60 percent in value in a market where luxury homes are actually appreciating and single - family homes values in the county only decreased 6.3 percent in the last year , according to DataQuick Information Systems ?
Oracle spokeswoman Deborah Lilienthal declined comment , and Bennett , of San Francisco law firm Bennett & Yee , did n't return a call from The Chronicle .
But Ellison 's appeal claimed the property suffered from " significant functional obsolescence " because there is a finite market for high - end luxury homes , limited appeal for 16th - century Japanese architecture and the " over improvements " and " excessive " landscaping are costly to maintain .
The board ultimately agreed , slicing the valuation by around $ 100 million for each of the last three years , for a tax savings of more than $ 3 million , Flinn said .
The largest proportion of San Mateo County property taxes , 45.1 percent , goes to school districts , followed by 21.5 percent for the county general fund , 16.7 percent to cities and 7.5 percent to redevelopment agencies .
Woodside will lose about $ 78,000 from the $ 130,000 in property taxes it collected on the Mountain Home Road property during the past few years , Town Manager Susan George said .
Nevertheless , she does n't begrudge Ellison .
" He went through a process that was laid out by the law , " she said .
" It should n't make any difference how much money he has if the process was fair . "
That said , she added : " We 'll miss the money ; we always have good things we can do with it . "
Ellison 's refund is likely to come on top of falling property taxes tied to the declining housing market , said Lenny Goldberg , executive director of the California Tax Reform Association of Sacramento , which advocates equitable taxation and is supported by labor and education groups .
" We have such an irrational property tax system , we rely on the growing housing market , and then when it levels off , there 's an awful lot of schools and services hanging out there , " he said .
Doug Heller , executive director of Santa Monica advocacy group Consumer Watchdog , said that Ellison 's success in this case underscores an important issue in the current housing market : many lower - and middle - income people whose homes genuinely lost value do n't know they can or do n't know how to get their property values reassessed .
" Three million dollars to Larry Ellison is the equivalent of $ 300 to your average home owner , who 's probably being over - assessed in the wake of this market , but does n't know the ins and outs and have the advisers getting them the tax break , " he said .

Get ready for McCain and another four years of the neocons .
According to Jason Leopold , “ Timothy Griffin , a central figure in the U.S. Attorney scandal and a protégé of Republican political guru Karl Rove , reportedly has been hired to dig up dirt on likely Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama . ”
Griffin is a seasoned dirty trickster .
Only time will tell what kind of dirt he will excavate on Obama .
But a few minutes with Google provides more than a clue , that is if the corporate media is in the mood to listen .
And what in particular will the filthy tricksters dredge up ?
Larry Sinclair .
“ The electrifying presidential campaign of Barack Obama faces a new challenge – a Minnesota man who claims he took cocaine in 1999 with the then - Illinois legislator and participated in homosexual acts with him , ”
WorldNetDaily reported back in February .
The corporate media has ignored Sinclair ’s allegations , but that did n’t stop Sinclair from making a YouTube video and filing a suit in Minnesota District Court , alleging threats and intimidation by Obama ’s staff .
No doubt Griffin and Evil Karl are salivating as they wait out the absurd Democrat primary process as it turgidly as a soap opera crawls toward completion .
It looks like the Dem superdel process will anoint Obama at Clinton ’s expense , not that she needs much help losing out as she keeps making boneheaded comments , most recently insinuating Obama might end up like RFK .
Or maybe that should be Vince Foster .
For Griffin , the sky ’s the limit in sleaze , deception , and outright fascism .
For instance , as Leopold notes , in addition to making sure voters were purged from the rolls , Griffin “ got the U.S. Attorney job via a little known provision slipped into the reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2005 , authorizing the Attorney General to appoint emergency U.S. Attorneys without Senate confirmation . ”
So much for the Constitution .
But then neocons prefer the concept of a “ Supreme Leader , ” as elucidated by Bill Kristol some time ago on Faux News .
Obviously , Kristol and gang stayed up too late reading On Dictatorship , the tome written by Nazi crown jurist Carl Schmitt .
Leopold does not venture a guess at the sort of Rove dirty tricks the neocons will pull out of a hat after the Dem nomination .
In addition to the scorching allegations made by Sinclair , there is a regular potpourri of stuff they can utilize , including Obama ’s relationship with Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers , both having served on the “ anti- poverty ” group , the Woods Fund of Chicago , between 1999 and 2002 , an operation funded in part by the Ford Foundation , the sort of organization favored by the CIA as a “ plausible kind of funding cover , ” according to Frances Stonor Saunders .
Call it the CIA ’s “ left - wing ” side of its legendary ( and wholly bloody ) covert activities
At any rate , the Bill Ayers angle may not fly , as millions of people are willing to write off the Weather Underground as ancient and irrelevant , that is if they even remember such , public amnesia and political ignorance what it is in the Land of the Plasma Screen Watchers these days .
On the other hand , millions more will be turned off by allegations of coke snorting and homosexuality and may either run to McCain or sit out the election disillusioned .
If you think Rove and crew will not make a big deal out of Obama ’s possible indiscretion , think again — we are talking about neocons here , the folks who tricked the nation into two illegal and immoral invasions and subsequent occupations , resulting in over a million dead people and misery for untold millions more , including thousands of U.S. soldiers .
Outing and slamming Obama will be a piece of cake for Dirty Karl and his operatives .
It does n’t even matter if the allegation is true or not .
As Karl and crew know , all that matters is mention on the Borg Hive tube .
So get ready for four more years of neocon mass murder and putting the final touches on the destruction of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
“ Bill Kristol [ see above , prefers a dictator ] thinks the anti-McCain sentiment among conservatives is exaggerated , and a simple account from the campaign trail reveals a obvious truth : lots of conservatives have supported McCain all along , ” writes Jennifer Rubin .
Of course , they are not “ conservatives , ” they are neocons , and there is no shortage of them crawling like cockroaches all over the McCain campaign : Robert Kagan , spook James Woolsey , neocon wunderkind Bill Kristol , Max Boot , pit bull John Bolton , AEI “ fellow ” and PNAC signatory Gary Schmitt , the Middle East map cut and paste artist Ralph Peters , and the senator from Tel Aviv , Joe Lieberman .
Come November , you may hear the neocons sing Leo Reisman ’s “ Happy Days Are Here Again . ”
It may be followed by McCain ’s “ Bomb , Bomb , Bomb Iran ” anthem .

Corey mentioned that he , personally , would like to see waiters ’ tips rise to 18 percent .
Huckabee laughed agreeably but said nothing .
No Republican candidate wants to get caught by a reporter advocating a price hike for anything .
Nowadays Huckabee has more policy positions , but his campaign is really all about his Christian character .
His slogan is ‘‘ Faith , Family , Freedom , ’’ which Huckabee , who was once a public - relations man for the Texas televangelist James Robison , wrote himself .
Huckabee is no theocrat .
He simply believes in the power of the Christian message , and in his ability to embody and deliver it .
‘‘ It ’s not that we want to impose our religion on somebody , ’’ he wrote in ‘‘ Character Makes a Difference , ’’ a book first published in 1997 ( as ‘‘ Character Is the Issue ’ ’ ) and reissued earlier this year .
‘‘ It ’s that we want to shape the culture and laws by using a worldview we believe has value . ’’
During his years in politics , Huckabee has become a master at disarming secular audiences .
Throughout the campaign he has impressed the national press corps with his ability to dodge questions aimed at portraying him as a fundamentalist .
Asked in a CNN debate , for example , what Jesus would do about capital punishment , Huckabee responded that Jesus was too smart to run for public office .
On another occasion , queried if only Baptists go to heaven , he remarked that not even all the Baptists he knows will get past the pearly gates .
Such jokes are designed to give outsiders the impression that Huckabee could n’t be all that religious .
But they are really just witty formulations of standard evangelical doctrine , things not even the most ardent country Baptist preacher could disagree with .
The Rev. Wallace Edgar is such a preacher .
He has known Mike Huckabee for more than 20 years , since they led Baptist churches near each other in Texarkana .
Wallace is a big Huckabee fan .
‘‘ Mike was very conservative with the Scriptures , he did n’t deviate from the Word , ’’ he told me .
Some born - again Christians do n’t like Huckabee ’s light touch , or the fact that he has involved himself in secular politics at all .
A few even accuse him of neglecting the obligation to engage in personal evangelism .
Huckabee addressed this issue in September , in an interview with The Baptist Press .
‘‘ In fact , I think I ’ve had far more opportunities because of my position as a governor and now as a candidate for president to share my faith , ’’ he told Will Hall , a reporter for the paper .
‘‘ Nobody ’s paying me ; nobody ’s forcing me to talk about what Christ means to me , and when I ’m able to share it , I think it has a , you know , a very dramatic and powerful impact , and they know it ’s what really drives me and explains me , if you will . ’’
In late November , Huckabee began running a short television ad called ‘‘ Believe . ’’
It starts with the candidate declaring , ‘‘ Faith does n’t just influence me , it really defines me . ’’
As he speaks , the words ‘‘ Christian Leader ’ ’ flash across the screen .
This ad was , of course , directed at the evangelical voters of Iowa .
But it has also caught the attention of big - time figures in evangelical Christianity , many of whom have refrained from supporting Huckabee ’s candidacy .
This failure has puzzled and angered the governor .
At the Olive Garden he spoke with bitterness about Richard Land , the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention .
‘‘ Richard Land swoons for Fred Thompson , ’’ he said .
‘‘ I do n’t know what that ’s about .
For reasons I do n’t fully understand , some of these Washington - based people forget why they are there .
They make ‘ electability ’ their criterion .
But I am a true soldier for the cause .
If my own abandon me on the battlefield , it will have a chilling effect . ’’
The following week , at the Values Voter Summit in Washington , Huckabee won the roomful of grass - roots evangelicals but failed to gain any significant endorsements from evangelical leaders .
‘‘ The evangelical leadership did n’t , and perhaps still does n’t , perceive Governor Huckabee as a winner , ’’ Charles Dunn , dean of the school of government at Regent University , told me .
‘‘ But more and more , it appears that the leadership is not in touch with its followers . ’’
CHAPEL HILL - Parents of children with autism were roughly twice as likely to have been hospitalized for a mental disorder , such as schizophrenia , than parents of other children , according to an analysis of Swedish birth and hospital records by a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill researcher and colleagues in the U.S. and Europe .
The study , " Parental psychiatric disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders in the offspring , " appears in the May 5 , 2008 , issue of the journal Pediatrics .
" We are trying to determine whether autism is more common among families with other psychiatric disorders .
Establishing an association between autism and other psychiatric disorders might enable future investigators to better focus on genetic and environmental factors that might be shared among these disorders , " said study author Julie Daniels , Ph.D. , an assistant professor in the UNC School of Public Health 's epidemiology and maternal and child health departments .
" Earlier studies have shown a higher rate of psychiatric disorders in families of autistic children than in the general population , " she said .
" We wanted to see if the parents of autistic children were more likely to be diagnosed with mental disorders .
" Our research shows that mothers and fathers diagnosed with schizophrenia were about twice as likely to have a child diagnosed with autism .
We also saw higher rates of depression and personality disorders among mothers , but not fathers , " Daniels said .
This information will help researchers look among related diseases , such as psychiatric disorders , for causes of autism , Daniels said .
" It may eventually help identify opportunities to prevent or treat the disorder . "
The study examined 1,237 children born between 1977 and 2003 who were diagnosed with autism before age 10 , and compared them with 30,925 control subjects matched for gender , year of birth and hospital .
The large sample size enabled researchers to distinguish between psychiatric histories of mothers versus fathers in relation to autism .
The association was present regardless of the timing of the parent 's diagnosis relative to the child 's diagnosis .

According to a recent article over at Newsweek , green homes are very hot right now , despite what is going on in the real estate market .
While typical homes drop in value , energy efficient , environmentally friendly homes are not only retaining their value , they are now in demand and are selling at premium prices .
The National Association of Home Builders , released some survey results showing that the average home buyer was willing to spend an additional $ 8,964 on a green home , if it would in fact save them money on their utility cost .
Unfortunately , the average person knows very little about green building , and that is probably because it is such a broad topic which covers many different facets .
When thinking of the term “ green ” , most people instantly picture huge solar panel arrays and wind turbines .
However , true green building techniques are executed well before these types of expensive additions .
From site selection , building placement , energy efficiency and indoor air quality , real green building starts before the ground is even broken .
It is only after these green building techniques are put in place that is it cost effective to start adding alternative energy sources .
My rule of thumb is every dollar spent in energy efficiency will save four dollars on alternative energy .
Architects ( me :-) and builders are working very hard to educate consumers about which products and techniques will give them the biggest bang for their buck .
In the meantime , organizations like the U.S. Green Building Council and Energy Star are offering certification programs to help rate the greenness of these homes .
These certificates will allow home owners to receive additional tax breaks from the Federal government , and in some cases , they will be eligible to receive state tax breaks .
Green building advocates are hoping that these certificate programs will become widely accepted , like Consumer Reports , and create higher resale values for the home owners .
This shift toward green building just might turn around this broken industry and many smaller builders will attest that their numbers are supper hot .
Unfortunately , most of the larger builders are still only scraping the surface , doing just enough to get by .
However , as this market shifts , I believe that larger builders will be following suit .
The simple fact is that people are becoming educated and they know that this “ green stuff ” means more money stays in their pockets , regardless of their political or environmental views .
A wedding photographer in Sichuan captured the before and after moments : ( Source : http://www.chinareviewnews.com)
May 12 – A couple just took some lovely outdoor wedding shots outside of a beautiful church in Pongzho , Sichuan
When the major quake hit , lots of stones fell off the church buildings all of a sudden .
Since there was no where to hide , everyone except the photographer who captured this precious moment , got down on their knee and held their head down .
Shaking stopped and dust settled .
Everyone gradually stood up and looked around what a destructive force Mother Earth had just released .
What ’s left of this 100 year old church .
The bride full of dust and shaken , but very blessed that everyone is all right .
Dunkin '
Donuts decided to cave into the silly , attention - grabbing boobs who accused Rachel Ray of sending secret pro-Jihadist signals by wearing a checkered scarf in a recent ad .
As Poliblogger says , this " protest " makes about as much sense as a Monty Python skit .
Especially since millions of people in the Middle East who are definitely not Jihadists -- including Israelis , and even US troops stationed in Iraq - - also wear the keffiyah to protect themselves from the desert sun , wind , and sand .
OK , let 's start a silly , attention - grabbing protest of our own .

American Armageddon : How to Win the Epic Battle for Your Wealth
Martin D. Weiss writes : Just when Wall Street was hoping for some relief from surging energy costs , crude oil prices surged more than $ 3 on Friday ... spiking to nearly $ 128 a barrel ... shattering all prior records ... and driving prices at the pump perilously close to $ 4 per gallon .
Worse , next week , despite the highest gas prices in U.S. history , millions of U.S. drivers will start hitting the road as Memorial Day kicks off the summer driving season .
And last week , despite a last - ditch attempt to head off the expected crisis , President Bush failed to persuade the Saudis to pump more oil .
The impact on the dollar and other financial markets will be great ; the opportunities for savvy investors , far - reaching .
And the timing for our recent online event about this crisis could not have been more appropriate .
In this gala issue , I provide the transcript .
American Armageddon : How to Win the Epic Battle for Your Wealth
Edited Transcript
Martin Weiss : Ladies and gentlemen , the crisis we have been warning you about is here .
But it 's far from over ...
Housing industry experts now predict that this will be the greatest foreclosure crisis of all time , with millions of Americans defaulting on their mortgages .
The International Monetary Fund now predicts that big banks and brokers will suffer nearly triple the huge losses they 've already reported — total losses of close to one trillion dollars .
U.S. government data now confirms that , with oil prices surging , inflation is about to burst onto the scene with gale force .
And most worrisome of all , the Federal Reserve is responding to this crisis by pumping paper money into the economy with wild abandon , trashing the value of the U.S. dollar .
But there 's a simple reason for the crisis we face today — a single disease that infects almost every aspect of our economic life :
Debt in huge , almost unimaginable amounts .
For many years , financial experts have warned us about the consequences of excess debt .
They 've issued their warnings so many times that their words have fallen on deaf ears , and their voices have seemed to fade into the background .
But throughout all those years , the excess debts kept growing , and as a result , we now have ...
$ 49 trillion in interest - bearing debts , according to the U.S. Federal Reserve Board ...
$ 50 trillion in federal contingency debts , according to the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , and ...
$ 164 trillion in derivatives , according to the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) .
That 's a grand total of $ 263 trillion in debts and obligations , twenty times more than the total size of the entire U.S. economy .
If Washington would only recognize that excess debt is the true cause of this crisis ... if they would deal with the true disease and not its symptoms ... if Americans would be willing to make the needed sacrifices to reduce their debts ... then the future of your money might be very different .
But that 's not what 's happening now and not what 's likely to happen in the foreseeable future — certainly not in this election year .
Instead ,
Our fellow citizens are so willing to walk away from their debts , they 're abandoning their own homes .
Wall Street 's shakiest corporations have so much political clout , they 've persuaded the government to cover their huge losses .
And our leaders in Washington are so anxious to paper over the debts , they 're threatening the one thing that has made America the leader of the world , the one economic force that helped win the Cold War and that attracted trillions of foreign investments to our shores :
The U.S. dollar .
You do n't have to look very far to see the consequences .
You can see it in the surging price of crude oil , gasoline and diesel .
You can see it in the surging price of bread , milk and eggs .
Plus , it 's evident in the sickening slide of the U.S. dollar in foreign exchange markets .
It 's in the foreign exchange market — Forex , for short — where the dollar has taken the worst beating .
And it's in the Forex market where virtually every other currency in the world goes up when the dollar falls .
This chart is the U.S. Dollar Index compared to a basket of foreign currencies since the beginning of the decade .
In just this relatively short stretch of time — a mere quickstep in the march of history — the dollar lost nearly half of its value .
And here 's the same dollar index going back to 1971 , when the modern foreign exchange market was born .
Look at the range we 've drawn in the chart — the dollar 's norm for most of the history of the modern currency market .
Now , in recent months , it has broken down below that range .
And despite its recent rally , it remains in a veritable forbidden zone in which the world 's oil exporters demand higher prices , the rules of the global economy are changing , and your money could be in grave danger .
My Family and I Have Been Trying To Prevent This Disaster for a Long Time
One half century ago , my father , J. Irving Weiss , founded The Sound Dollar Committee .
He enlisted the support of presidential adviser Bernard Baruch , former President Herbert Hoover , and Federal Reserve Chairman Bill Martin .
They mobilized 11 million U.S. citizens to protest against inflation and protect the dollar .
And with Dwight D. Eisenhower on their side , they won that epic battle for the dollar .
Ultimately , however , they lost the war .
Today , I am Chairman of The Sound Dollar Committee .
But this time , it wo n't be possible to achieve the same result as we achieved 50 years ago .
The apathy about the falling dollar is too great .
Washington 's willingness to let the dollar fall is too deeply ingrained .
The forces amassed against the dollar — in our government , on Wall Street , on Main Street — are too powerful .
So at this juncture , our efforts are twofold .
We are still pursuing the goals of the Sound Dollar Committee to defend the dollar .
But we are also pursuing another goal :
To help you defend yourself against the dollar 's decline and even turn it into a major profit opportunity .
To help you in that goal , let me introduce you to my Associate Editor , Mike Larson .
When Mike first warned investors about the housing and mortgage crisis a few years ago , laying out exactly how it would unfold and why , he was not exactly a popular figure on Wall Street .
They vehemently denied the possibility of his forecasts coming true .
And when he presented his white paper to the Fed and the FDIC on the housing and mortgage crisis , the authorities generally ignored him as well .
But now , Mike 's views are getting widespread attention , and his analysis is in great demand — by CNBC , Fox , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post and many others .
Mike , congratulations !
Mike Larson :
Thank you !
Martin Weiss :
But let me ask you this :
Could your popularity be a contrarian sign — that the housing market has reached bottom ?
Mike :
In some areas , the worst " for sale " inventories are behind us .
In other areas , they still lie ahead .
For the country as a whole , however , the most painful phase is still ahead — price declines .
Price declines are the only thing helping to bring down inventories , and it's exactly what the market needs to see — over the long term — to restore its health by attracting new buyers .
But it can be devastating for existing homeowners .
More than 8 million are now estimated to be " upside down . "
As a result , the foreclosure rate in this country has more than doubled in the past couple of years — to an all - time high .
Martin :
What 's the force that will drive home prices down ?
Mike :
The falling dollar and inflation .
To understand why , think about what automatically comes with inflation : Falling bond prices and rising bond yields .
Then think about the impact rising bond yields will have on mortgage rates !
Martin : Everyone assumes that mortgage rates are going down , or at least will stay where they are .
Virtually no one on Wall Street is talking about higher mortgage rates .
Mike :
They 're pushing their own agenda .
They do n't want to connect the dots for folks .
But the fact is that when inflation rises and bond prices fall , mortgage rates must rise .
Unfortunately , the Fed 's easy money policy is creating huge problems .
Look at oil prices !
Look at food prices !
Falling bond prices are the market 's way of saying : " We 're not going to take this any more ! "
They see the inflation .
And the inflation is going to drive up mortgage rates .
Martin :
And the Fed does not control mortgage rates .
Mike :
It can influence mortgage rates .
But it can never control mortgage rates .
Martin :
Where does this take us ?
Mike :
To even more downward pressure on home prices and home sales , plus another potentially big wave of losses by lenders and investors .
Martin :
For most people , rising mortgage rates are a bit hard to believe .
Could you explain your argument as to why you see bond prices falling and mortgage rates going up ?
Mike :
It 's the falling dollar and the rising inflation .
I have two young daughters , and when my wife comes home from the grocery store , all I hear about is the rising cost of a gallon of milk , a carton of eggs or a box of diapers .
Inflation is everywhere .
Look at import prices — rising at the fastest rate in history .
Look at producer prices — what wholesalers are paying .
Martin :
So inflation drives mortgage rates up .
What does the Fed do ?
Does it counter that by injecting more money into the economy ?
Mike :
That may help slow down the rise in mortgage rates .
But with higher inflation , no matter what the Fed does , mortgage rates must go up .
They just may not go up as much as they should .
Right now , when you consider inflation , short - term money is n't cheap .
It 's free .
In fact , the money is n't just free , the Fed has rigged things so that it 's actually paying folks to borrow money .
And that generates even more inflation .
We have all these cheap , free or even better - than - free dollars sloshing around .
Cheap money rushing into commodities .
Cheap money rushing overseas to stronger currencies .
And cheap money perpetuating the vicious cycle of the falling dollar and rising inflation .
Martin :
So the next question is :
When does the vicious cycle end ?
Mike :
Only when and if you get the reverse scenario — when and if money has a real cost — when interest rates go up higher than inflation .
But that 's not about to happen any time soon .
Martin : I 'm anxious to get to solutions for the investor .
But before we do , I have one more question for you that we 've been getting from subscribers to our Safe Money Report .
The question is :
" You warned about home prices going down , and you were right .
That 's a form of deflation .
At the same time , you warned about consumer prices going up , and you were right about that , too .
That 's inflation .
But can we have deflation over here in the housing market and , at the same time , inflation everywhere else ? "
Mike :
The answer is " Yes " — and the proof is that we already have deflation in the housing market and we already have inflation everywhere else !
Martin : Maybe I should rephrase the question :
How long can we continue to have deflation here and inflation there ?
Mike : Look .
The housing market is a special situation .
Think of it not so much as an inflation - deflation indicator , but as a bubble that 's bursting .
After the dot - com stocks crashed and burned , the Fed cut interest rates like crazy .
That helped create a new bubble in a fresh asset class — housing .
Looking back , did tech stocks re-inflate ?
Did the Nasdaq turn around and ramp right back up to 5,000 ?
No , the index is still almost 3,000 points off its high !
The bottom line :
You can't re-inflate a bubble that has popped no matter how hard you try .
All the Fed can do is try to ease the pain .
But the more the Fed pumps in , the more inflation you 'll get .
Martin : Now , let 's talk about solutions .
In our Safe Money Report , we provide a full model portfolio with recommendations .
Mike , can we reveal some of the investments that are typical of the Safe Money Report for this kind of environment ?
Mike :
For this event , let 's talk strictly about ETFs , which anyone can buy any time .
First , for protection against the dollar , one of our favorites is an ETF that owns strictly Australian dollar deposits .
The symbol on that is FXA .
Second , for further protection against the falling value of your money and for a stake in the commodity boom , another ETF you can look at is the streetTRACKS Gold Trust , symbol GLD .
Martin :
And we have also recommend ETFs that give you a stake in the strongest foreign stock markets .
Mike : Yes , ETFs and stocks in the Brazilian and Chinese markets , for example .
But when they were near a peak , we recommended taking some huge profits , and I 'm glad we did .
Looking ahead , though , when we see a new opportunity to jump back into those — or something similar — we 'll send out a flash alert to Safe Money subscribers via email .
Martin :
Thank you , Mike .
I 'm delighted that you 're finally getting the Wall Street and Washington attention you deserve .
And I want to thank you for a superb job with the Safe Money portfolio !

Jeff Cohen writes an extremely interesting piece on the mainstream media 's self censorship during the build up to the Iraq war .
According to Cohen , MSNBC , CNN etc would only invite military experts on as analysts , excluding relief experts , aid experts and peace activists with on the ground experience of the effects of war .
Also , here is an interview with Cohen on ' The Real News ' on his experiences in the mainstream media , secret memos within MSNBC ostracizing anti war journalists , and his advocacy of independent media outlets :

Now that Barack Obama looks to be the Democratic nominee , speculation is growing about who he will select as his running mate , so I have compiled a list of the top 5 likely candidates to get a good long look from the Obama campaign .
I know that many people favor swing state senators such as Jim Webb and Bob Casey , but there are two problems associated with both of them .
They are both inexperienced , and selecting either of them would leave the Democratic Party vulnerable to losing a seat in the Senate .
Obama ’s running mate preferably would have executive experience , and be able to help the campaign geographically .
These criteria would rule out popular picks like Hillary Clinton , Joe Biden , and Chris Dodd .
Advertisements
Some people like Wesley Clark , but anyone who followed his 2004 campaign can tell you that he has little or no grasp of any issue that is n’t foreign or military related , and he has the charisma of a turnip .
Here ’s the list :
1 ) . Gov. Bill Richardson ( D - NM ) – Richardson is a choice that almost makes too much sense .
He is the most well known Latino politician in the country .
He has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize and has a foreign policy resume as long as your arm .
He is a popular and successful swing state governor , and it can be argued that his endorsement was a turning point in the Democratic primary campaign .
2 ) . Gov. Brian Schweitzer ( D - MT ) – Schweitzer is another rising star in the Democratic Party after he became Montana ’s first Democratic governor in 16 years .
Schweitzer is a rural politician who has loads of charisma .
He is strong on energy issues , agriculture , and has a straight talking cowboy image that appeals to the West , and parts of the South .
3 ) . Gov. Kathleen Sebelius ( D - KS ) – Sebelius is yet another rising star of the Party , who would provide Obama with a female running mate straight out of the Heartland .
Anyone who remembers Sebelius ’s criticism of the Bush administration ’s depletion of the National Guard after tornados devastated part of her state last year knows that she is ready for the national stage .
4 ) . Gov. Janet Napolitano ( D - AZ ) – Some would argue for Napolitano ahead of Sebelius , but to me it is a tossup between the two .
John McCain is not popular in his home state , but Napolitano is .
She is another Southwestern Democrat who could appeal to voters who are John McCain ’s geographic strength .
Napolitano previously served as a U.S. attorney , and was Arizona ’s first female attorney general .
She spoke at both the 2000 and the 2004 Democratic conventions .
John Kerry considered her as a possible running mate in 2004 .
5 ) . John Edwards – Edwards said he does n’t want to run on the number two slot again , and I believe him , but he is the perfect fit for Obama .
He is a charismatic Southerner who appeals to the white blue collar workers that Obama has never quite connected with .
Edwards ’s concern with rural issues and poverty meshes well with Obama ’s language of hope and change .
An Obama / Edwards ticket would be a sure winner , but if Edwards is n’t interested in VP , he would make a great Attorney General .
Laid Off ?
Some Decide to Go Under the Knife Employees turn to plastic surgery to get an edge in their careers .
May 27 , 2008  --
One went for a face - lift .
The other settled for a Botox treatment .
Both were patients of Dr. Malcolm Roth , a plastic surgeon , and both were looking for work after recently losing jobs in the health and financial sectors , respectively .
Roth , the director of plastic surgery at Maimonides Medical Center in New York , said they turned to him in an effort to look more attractive -- literally -– to prospective employers .
" They were hoping this would help them get a better chance getting a job , " Roth said .
" Even if you may be sharp mentally , if you do n't look it " that can affect how others perceive you , he said .
Roth and other plastic surgeons agree that it's not uncommon these days for people to seek cosmetic procedures to bolster their careers .
Darrick Antell , a spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons , said business at his New York practice is up nearly 20 percent from last year , and he has come up with a theory on why :
As the tough economy leads to layoffs , the newly jobless are " buffing up their appearance " as well as their resumes .
" I think that in this day and age , with such a competitive environment , particularly with people losing jobs and being downsized , it 's very important for people to look as good as they can and to look fit and healthy , " he said .
Though treatments can cost thousands ,
Antell said that those who seek his help are more concerned with long - term benefits than short - term costs .
" It ends up being an investment in their career , " he said .
" Unlike an investment in the stock market that takes years to appreciate , this is something that gives an immediate return . "
Different studies have shown that looks do matter in the workplace .
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis released an analysis of such research in 2005 , concluding that attractive people tend to earn more money and are promoted more often than their peers .
Still , it 's debatable whether plastic surgery specifically benefits a person 's career .
Some also question the motivations of those supposedly seeking surgery for job reasons .
" I think saying it 's for career reasons is a big excuse for saying , ' Oh my God , I 'm starting to age and I have to do something to slow this process , ' " said Debbie Then , a Los Angeles social psychologist .
" It 's trying to hang on to your youthfulness . "
The Telltale Turkey Neck
Marie Peters is 76 .
The Pittsburgh investment adviser said she was in excellent health and plans to keep working for a long time .
Still , she worried about clients questioning her longevity .
" People were beginning to look at me like when she 's going to go croke or something , " she said .
So last year Peters had surgery to remove the sagging skin beneath her chin , or as she put it , her " turkey neck . "
" I 'm very pleased with it , " she said .
" I thought I would look younger , and I do . "
And looking younger , she said , impresses upon her clients " that I 'll be around to manage their money . "
Antell , the New York plastic surgeon , said that procedures popular among professionals include chin enlargements and blepharoplasty -- surgery that improves the appearance of eyelids .
Larger chins , he said , give a more authoritative air , while eyelid work can make someone look more energetic .
" If you look better , people will perceive you as being healthier and being more well rested , " he said .
" It 's the same as if you wear a pressed shirt , a nice tie and a clean suit as opposed to having slept in your clothes the night before . "
( A list of average prices for the procedures appears at the end of this story . )
Then acknowledges the pressure to look good in the workplace .
The Los Angeles psychologist , who opposes plastic surgery , said one of her colleagues elected to have a face - lift so she would n't look so much older than her young co-workers .
But
Then also said that many just feel it " sounds more acceptable " to say they 're having work done for career reasons rather than concede that they 're concerned about their own vanity .
That 's especially true for baby boomers , she said .
" I think a lot of them are realizing that they 've lived half of their life already and it's like the alarm clocks are going off :
Wow , I 've got to do as much as I can now with the time I have left and boy , am I going to look good , " she said .
Stigma or Saving Grace ?
Then argues that those who undergo surgery in hopes of getting ahead could see their efforts backfire .
" I think if you 're going to stay at the same company where everybody knows you and everybody sees you and you come back after three weeks with a new face , I do n't think it 's going to get you promoted , " she said .
While
Then conceded that more people are getting plastic surgery overall , she said there 's still a stigma associated with having work done that can stir gossip among co-workers .
Some , she said , might assume that low self - esteem was what prompted the surgery .
" It might actually undermine you because people are thinking ' Oh , gosh , she does n't have confidence in herself .
I do n't want somebody in this high - level leadership position who really does n't have confidence in their skills alone , ' " she said .
Vito Quatela , the president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery , disagrees .
A survey by the academy found that two - thirds of surgeons said they 'd treated patients seeking to remain competitive in the workplace last year .
Quatela said he has heard from patients who initially experienced negative reactions from their co-workers but later -– especially after the patients had fully healed from surgery -– found acceptance .
Some , he said , even had co-workers come to them seeking advice about getting some work done themselves .
Quatela and other plastic surgeons argue that the self - esteem boost that stems from improving your appearance means that surgery and other cosmetic procedures can result in more professional success .
" With increased self - esteem comes increased self confidence and we know that 's a good thing in the workplace , " he said .
But
Then warns that people with self - esteem problems who look to surgery for help will find themselves disappointed .
" Unless you address an underlying self - confidence issue , you could be made over to look like Barbie , but you 're still going to carry around negative thoughts about yourself , " she said .
Peters , the Pittsburgh investment adviser , said her surgery has improved her self - confidence .
Still , her surgeon , Dr. Leo McCafferty , a board member at the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery , stressed that nips and tucks wo n't cure all of a patient 's ills , career or otherwise .
" I think if someone comes in specifically with that desire -- that it 's going to change their life in a dramatic way -- that would tend to be a little bit of a red flag , " he said .
" I think it 's important for people to realize that beauty comes from within and plastic surgery can't change that inner self . "

Hitler .
Mussolini .
Koopa .
For far too long have these three names been thought nearly synonymous within the pantheon of historical villainy ; for far too long has the name “ Bowser ” been equated with evil , malevolence , and selfishness .
No longer .
Today , we celebrate all those things good and righteous in the personality of King Bowser Koopa , ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom and caretaker of its denizens .
In what may be considered a year - late companion piece to Six Sinister Things About Super Mario , it ’s time to examine what makes Bowser not only a morally laudable character , but also a wholly sympathetic one .
Hit the jump , and prepare yourself to feel sympathy -- for the Bowser .
HE'S THE RIGHTFUL POLITICAL LEADER OF THE MUSHROOM KINGDOM
The vast majority of the Mario games , told from the perspective of Princess Peach and her political affiliates , would have the average gamer believe that Bowser is some sort of insurgent who wishes to wrongfully dethrone Peach and turn the entire Mushroom Kingdom into a fascist state .
If you actually look at the evidence , however , the exact opposite seems to be true .
First , let ’s look at political titles : Bowser is a king , where Peach is but a princess .
Assuming they both earned their titles legally and within the same representational government ( which they almost certainly did ) , there is literally no way Bowser could achieve the title of “ king ” without either having been elected to that post , or having earned it through birthright .
Peach ’s essentially useless “ Princess ” title seems to come from virtually nowhere : princess to whom ?
If she were the rightful princess , we ’d have met ( or at least heard mention of ) her father , the Mushroom King .
Since we ’ve never heard so much as an utterance about this character outside of the Super Mario Bros movie ( which is n’t canon , obviously ) , it is therefore reasonable to assume that Peach awarded herself the faux - royal title .
This , in itself , also suggests that it is Peach , and not King Koopa , who represents the confederate insurgency within the Mushroom Kingdom .
If you need proof that Koopa achieved power by legal means , just consider the numbers game : for every one Toad character Mario found in the original Super Mario Bros. , the player sees roughly five dozen Koopa Troopas , Goombas , and Hammer Bros -- all of whom would obviously vote for Bowser in a free and fair election .
Peach , evidently irritated at the fact that her voter base seemed to consist of no more than twenty or so identical citizens , likely seceded from Bowser ’s kingdom and , through a combination of propaganda and sexual manipulation , named herself “ Princess ” and declared herself the rightful ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom .
Peach knew she could n’t beat Bowser through sheer numbers , so she opted to spin the politics of her story and make it seem that Bowser was actually the dissenter .
A ROMANTIC
And yet , despite Peach ’s treachery , Bowser ’s main motivation for all his “ illegal ” actions still comes down to one simple , relatable , and absolutely heartbreaking reason : love .
Bowser loves Princess Peach .
None of the games have made any attempt to dance around this issue .
He kidnaps her in nearly every damn Mario game , and he attempted to marry her in Super Paper Mario .
Far from being the heartless despot Peach and her ilk would paint him to be , Bowser feels very strong , profound romantic emotions toward Peach – a woman who , for all intents and purposes , he should absolutely despise .
Sure , Koopa does n’t necessarily express his feelings in the best of ways , but can you blame him ?
Betrayed by the woman he loves , politically undermined , and left totally alone in his castle save for his soldiers and illegitimate children , is it any surprise that Bowser is socially inadequate when it comes to showing affection ?
He kidnaps Peach and curses her name , yes , but inside -- deep down inside -- he ’s really just trying to tell her that he loves her , while expressing an overwhelming desire that she reciprocate his feelings .
If anything , the man is certainly determined .
He ’s kidnapped Peach damn near a dozen times , always being eventually thwarted by Mario and / or Luigi , but he still tries ; his desire for Peach is so strong that even having his castle destroyed and his children flung into lava pits is not enough to dissuade him from trying to court the object of his affection .
PRINCESS PEACH IS A COCKTEASING BITCH
If Bowser can be blamed for anything , it ’s not his maliciousness ( of which there is practically none ) so much as his naïveté when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex -- Peach , specficially .
I used to think Peach was just stupid .
In an older article , I said I ’d never have sex with her because even after years and years of getting kidnapped by Bowser , she seemed to never have the intelligence to install any sort of security features within her castle , or even make any attempt whatsoever to prevent Bowser from frequently abducting her .
Oh , how wrong I was .
Peach is n’t stupid : she ’s a brilliant , two - faced , evil , manipulative , blue - balls - giving bitch .
She knows the only way to keep the proletariat on her side in the civil war is by constantly playing the part of the victim ; as mentioned earlier , Bowser ’s army obviously outnumbers
Peach ’s numerically , and so it is to her advantage to keep public sympathy on her side .
She does this in two main ways .
Firstly , she gets Bowser to frequently kidnap her ; secondly , she gets Mario to save her .
Peach , like so many femme fatales , knows full well how enamored Bowser is with her , and the lengths to which he would go to win her love .
She also knows how to properly exploit that adoration .
She leaves the gates to her castle wide open , she keeps her palace guards totally unarmed , and generally uses innuendo and reverse psychology to trick Bowser into kidnapping her , time and time again .
And why ?
So she can sic Mario on him , who , similarly cockteased through decades of false or underwhelming promises ( “ Rescue me and I ’ll bake you a cake ? ” A CAKE ?
Bitch , I did n’t fight my way through twenty worlds full of armed guards and spikes and fire just for goddamned baked goods ) , rushes off to save her like a conditioned automaton .
In saving Peach , Mario serves as an iconic hero for Peach ’s troops , thus strengthening her army ’s morale and keeping her in the political fight .
Meanwhile , poor Bowser , his heart bursting with emotion and his head clouded by breasts , is again made to play the fall guy in Peach ’s exquisitely crafted , political puppet show .
Lady Macbeth does n’t have sh*t on Princess Peach .
HE TAKES CARE OF HIS MEN
It takes a hell of a lot of dedication to run headlong into battle , knowing you ’ll meet almost certain death at the hands ( or rather feet ) of an obese minority , but Bowser manages to instill this degree of loyalty in all his troops .
Quite a considerable feat , if I may say so .
Bowser has single - handedly managed to convince his troops not only to ignore all of Princess Peach ’s brainwashing propaganda , but to believe in him and his goals with a strength and conviction which has not , in the thirty years of the Mario series existence , ever been broken .
I think , anyway .
There could be some obscure third - party Mario game or an episode of the animated show involving a double - agent Koopa that I ’m not thinking of , but what happens if I take that little piece of evidence and I simply brush it away with a wave of my hand ?
What do you have then ?
Nothing , that ’s what .
Meanwhile , the “ evil ” goombas , to paraphrase the player ’s manual for the original Super Mario Bros , are described as Mushroom Toadstools who switched sides to join Bowser ’s army .
Bowser ’s soldiers are n’t slaved , or brainwashed , or even draftees ; Bowser ’s men fight for the Koopa cause because they believe in it , while Peach ’s minions are but mere pawns in her grand game of cocktease chess . *
HEROISM
Out of all the villains in the Super Mario universe , no “ baddie ” has ever joined Mario ’s cause , or helped Mario out , so frequently .
In both Super Mario RPG and Super Paper Mario , Bowser chooses to join Mario ’s gang of hoodlums and nogoodniks for the purposes of saving the goddamned world .
Call Bowser petty or short - sighted if you want , but do n’t forget that when the chips are down , Mario just plain ca n’t save the world on his own ; he needs the help of his enemy , who ( begrudgingly , I ’ll admit ) shows a great deal more heroism than any of the “ good ” characters ever give him credit for .
Bowser is willing to put his life on the line not just for himself , and not just for his own army , but for the entire planet , Peach ’s ungrateful dissenters included .
Would Peach do the same if she did n’t absolutely have to ?
I doubt it .
DUDE GOT KIDS
He does n't seem to talk to them that much and I can't imagine who the hell the mother was ( illegitimate children of Peach , perhaps ? ) , but it can be easy to forget that Bowser is , in fact , a father .
It 's fun to idolize Mario because of his bachelor lifestyle and carefree nature , but Bowser is a real dad with real responsibilities , who respected and / or loved his kids enough to give them each a separate castle , all to themselves .
ARGUABLY THE SINGLE WORST CHARACTER IN SUPER SMASH BROS .
MELEE
When I said “ sympathy , ” I meant it – sympathy at all costs .
How can you not feel a twinge ( if not several twinges ) of sympathy for Bowser in SSBM ?
Despite being one fo the largest and most ferocious - looking characters in the game , his moves are hilariously slow and ineffective , leaving him open to counters from damn near every other available character .
Watching Bowser try to win a match is like watching a two - legged dog try to sprint : adorable , but ultimately depressing .
BORN UNDER A BAD SIGN
Nature versus nurture : are evil men born that way , or do they have evil thrust upon them ?
Up until the mid-1990 ’s , Nintendo fans could only guess at what turned Bowser to a life of kidnapping and misanthropy However , with Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi’s Island ( a sequel to the other Mario games in name , but a prequel in actual narrative fact ) we see an indescribably important moment in Bowser ’s upbringing : his adoption by the dark Magikoopa , Kamek .
Before Bowser has even met Mario , Luigi , or Princess Peach , we see him as a baby under the protection of Kamek , who , oddly , looks exactly the same age as he does in the later games .
Is he some sort of immortal demon ?
Or just a very , very gifted magician ?
Anyway , Kamek looks into the future and sees that Mario and Luigi , a pair of twins , will one day cause a great deal of trouble for Bowser before flying off and intercepting the stork that carries them .
From that point , Yoshi finds the babies and the adventure continues , eventually leading up to a large face - off between Yoshi , Baby Mario , and Baby Bowser .
This aspect of Bowser 's development is extremely interesting , and brings to mind a scene from Shakespeare 's Macbeth .
At the beginning of the play , three witches tell Macbeth that he will soon rise to power , and his mere knowledge of this fact causes him to turn into a power - hungry murderer who fulfills his own prophecy .
Similarly , Kamek sees that Mario and Luigi will grow to hate Bowser , but , in trying to act against this maybe - but - not - quite - inevitability , he inadvertently creates the first spark of hatred between Bowser and the Marios as he confuses Bowser into attacking Yoshi and Mario .
So , the question is , would Bowser have still become the enemy of the Marios had it not been for Kamek 's parenting and soothsaying ?
Possibly not .
HE'S NEVER DONE ANYTHING PARTICULARLY EVIL
Okay , kidnapping , yeah , but Peach wanted it .
Other than indulging Peach ’s manipulative fantasies and occasionally detaining a Toadstool or two , what has Bowser really done wrong ?
His troops never aggressively attack Mario ; they merely wait for Mario to initiate violence , and act solely in self - defense .
Bowser has never killed , or even attempted to kill , anyone in cold blood .
Hell , he ’s never even invaded Peach ’s portion of the Mushroom Kingdom , even though he has the manpower and moral superiority to make such an invasion both swiftly dealt and totally justified .
One may easily accuse him of mild idiocy , or slight cowardice , but never of evil or even anything approaching it : Bowser , as we see him in the Mario games , is merely a misunderstood , wrongly - demonized figure in an ever - escalating political struggle with the fascist ( and notably , Aryan ) Princess Peach .
So , the next time you grab his tail and throw him face - first into a bomb , or grab an axe and cut the rope bridge he ’s standing on , remember this :
Bowser never did a goddamn thing to you out of malice or hatred .
After repeatedly and happily sending the sad , rightfully - elected protector of the people to his doom , maybe you ’ll eventually see what I see .
Maybe -- just maybe -- you ’ll one day have some sympathy for the Bowser .

The Trouble with Minarchism By Arnold Kling
Anthony de Jasay writes ,
To the extent that the collective choice rule can define or by a rule - change amend the frontier , its zone may encroach on the zone of individual choices , while the reverse is of course not the case ; individuals have no rule - making power enabling them to encroach on the collective zone .
Much of the problem of limited government is summed up by this sentence …
From the conquering war band and its leader we have moved to a looser feudal structure , to absolute monarchy , to constitutional monarchy , representative government ( either unelected or elected on a restricted franchise ) , and finally to simple majority rule and universal suffrage with constitutional limits or with absolute sovereignty .
The latter may well be a rule - of - thumb approximation of some optimum compromise between the two contradictory objectives of maximum gain for the winning coalition and maximum security of its tenure .
With a touch of good - natured irony , we might say that if this is the optimum combination , it is the “ end of history . ” … rising taxes trigger two streams of exit : a “ brain drain ” typically composed of the most enterprising , ablest , and best - trained members of society , as well as a flight of capital in the form of money , and of going concerns that “ de- localize ” to low - tax jurisdictions .
… Unreasoning , even plainly unreasonable standards can effectively limit government if they are widely followed .
For about a century and a half before Keynes ’s General Theory became common currency for the literate and the semi-literate , it was widely believed that repeated deficits in the state household were mortally dangerous , liable to lead to the country ’s ruin and to be countenanced only in desperate circumstances .
He is concerned with a deep problem .
Those of us who are “ minarchists , ” meaning that we favor government that is limited to adjudicating conflict , have no reliable mechanism for restraining government .
His point is that government can use its rule - making power to remake any rules that were used to create it .
Certainly , we have seen this in the United States , where I would say that the original Constitution lies in shreds .
He concludes that only irrational standards or taboos can constrain the power of government .
I tend to agree .
If there is no taboo against government interference with activity X , then as long as it is in the interests of the governing coalition to interfere with activity X , that will happen .
I call these irrational standards and taboos folk beliefs .
In my view , the real political contest in America is not between Republicans and Democrats but between a folk Locke-ism which restrains government and other folk beliefs , such as folk Marxism of college campuses or the collectivist religion that Daniel Klein calls the people ’s romance .
Responding to de Jasay ’s essay , Gerald Gaus writes ,
The mass of recent evidence from evolutionary biologists , cognitive psychologists , and sociologists is that human ordered anarchy is structured not simply by “ conventional rules banning torts against life , limb and property , nuisances and incivilities ” but by moral rules ( or norms ) .
Certainly moral rules include various prohibitions against harming others and some types of deception .
Although there is dispute about this , I think there is also considerable evidence that these moral rules include some standards of fair distribution .
The norms that enabled human groups to survive and thrive during most of our evolutionary history were not simply coordination rules , but also norms about the fair sharing of goods .
As Cristina Bicchieri ( 2006 : ch. 3 ) has shown , fairness norms are fundamental to social life and we now have a deep “ taste for fairness . ”
… We now see the deep problem for the classical liberal project of holding back the state .
If the rules that are fundamental , according to classical liberals , are merely conventional , then citizens will see them revisable by authority .
The legitimacy of democratic authority and its laws will override the authority of the conventional rules classical liberals so stress .
We do not need an account of how the interests of the state cannot be constrained : it the weakness of conventional rules that is the real culprit .
Of course , if the basic normative commitments of classical liberals were widely conceived of as moral rules , then there would be much deeper resistance to government - made rules that seek to cancel or override them …
The welfare state reigns supreme not because the state and it allies have tricked the rest of us in a power grab ; it reigns supreme because in the eyes of most citizens it conforms to the egalitarian fairness norms that have evolved with humans ( Fong , Bowles , and Gintis , 2005 ) .
Classical liberals who convince themselves that the New Deal is best explained as a power grab by Roosevelt and his allies are manifestly deluded : it was ( and still is ) very widely seen as demanded by our sense of fairness .
… Some apparently obvious applications of our moral concepts — such a treating a far - flung economic order in which each must have an incentive to find his place as if it was a tribe in which the hunt must be fairly shared — are misguided and end up violating other moral notions about freedom and fairness to individuals .
The debate is complex , concerning both empirical and moral issues .
Few proponents of classical liberalism are willing to engage the debate on these complex grounds ( my colleague David Schmidtz is a notable exception ) , preferring instead to ignore our complex pluralistic moral sentiments by building their case only on self - interest , or retreating to a narrow “ natural rights theory ” of morality shared by few .
It is no wonder that classical liberals are losing the debate about the limits of the justified state .
The state grows to a large extent because most citizens think that fair dealing , as well as the protection of everyone ’s basic interests , requires it .
Until they are willing to engage the moral sense of their fellows , classical liberals worried about the unbound state should look no further then their own failure to convince the vast majority of their fellow citizens that morality does not endorse it .
In other words , the irrational standards and taboos that undergird our political system are likely to reflect , for better or worse , our moral sense that evolved under tribal conditions .
Hence , the “ people ’s romance ” comes from a ( misguided ) attempt to apply tribal morals to complex nation - states .
So you get Senator McCain arguing that highly - paid individuals in the private sector are not doing their part to serve the tribe .
There are moments  increasingly rare in risk - abhorrent modern campaigns  when politicians are called upon to bare their fundamental beliefs .
In the best of these moments , the speaker does not just salve the current political wound , but also illuminates larger , troubling issues that the nation is wrestling with .
Inaugural addresses by Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt come to mind , as does John F. Kennedy ’s 1960 speech on religion , with its enduring vision of the separation between church and state .
Senator Barack Obama , who has not faced such tests of character this year , faced one on Tuesday .
It is hard to imagine how he could have handled it better .
Mr. Obama had to address race and religion , the two most toxic subjects in politics .
He was as powerful and frank as Mitt Romney was weak and calculating earlier this year in his attempt to persuade the religious right that his Mormonism is Christian enough for them .
It was not a moment to which Mr. Obama came easily .
He hesitated uncomfortably long in dealing with the controversial remarks of his spiritual mentor and former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. , who denounced the United States as endemically racist , murderous and corrupt .
Rebecca Demorest , a sports - medicine pediatrician , told me that it is common for her to treat young women with injuries from head to toe .
“ They ache and they hurt and they use pain medicine and try to keep on playing , ” she said .
“ When they finally get to the point they ca n’t play , they come in to see me .
. . .
They have a series of nonspecific , overuse injuries that comes down to being worn out .
Do n’t get me wrong .
There ’s a chain of events with boys too .
But I see it more with the girls . ”
( I spoke with Demorest when she was based at Children ’s Hospital in Washington ; she has since moved to the Women ’s Sports Medicine Center at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York . )
Comprehensive statistics on total sports injuries are in short supply .
The N.C.A.A. compiles the best numbers , but even these are based on just a sampling of colleges and universities .
For younger athletes , the numbers are less specific and less reliable .
Some studies have measured sports injuries by emergency - room visits , which usually follow traumatic events like broken bones .
A.C.L. and other soft - tissue injuries often do not lead to an E.R. visit ; the initial examination typically occurs at the office of a pediatrician or an orthopedic surgeon .
Studies of U.S. high - school athletics indicate that , when it comes to raw numbers , boys suffer more sports injuries .
But the picture is complicated by football and the fact that boys still represent a greater percentage of high - school athletes .
Girls are more likely to suffer chronic knee pain as well as shinsplints and stress fractures .
Some research indicates that they are more prone to ankle sprains , as well as hip and back pain .
And for all the justifiable attention paid to concussions among football players , females appear to be more prone to them in sports that the sexes play in common .
A study last year by researchers at Ohio State University and Nationwide Children ’s Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , reported that high - school girls who play basketball suffer concussions at three times the rate of boys , and that the rate for high - school girls who play soccer is about 1.5 times the rate for boys .
According to the N.C.A.A. statistics , women who play soccer suffer concussions at nearly identical rates as male football players .
( The research indicates that it takes less force to cause a concussion in girls and young women , perhaps because they have smaller heads and weaker necks . )
But among all the sports injuries that afflict girls and young women , A.C.L. tears , for understandable reasons , get the most attention .
No other common orthopedic injury is as debilitating and disruptive in the short term  or as likely to involve serious long - term consequences .
And no other injury strikes women at such markedly higher rates or terrifies them as much .
Rachel Young , a former soccer player at Virginia Tech who had to stop playing after two A.C.L. ruptures and substantial cartilage damage in her right knee , told me that young women she knew feared the injury but rarely talked about it .
“ A.C.L. is like a curse word , ” she said .
“ You just cringe when you hear it . ”
AN A.C.L. DOES NOT tear so much as it explodes , often during routine athletic maneuvers  landings from jumps , decelerations from sprints  that look innocuous until the athlete crumples to the ground .
After the A.C.L. pulls off the femur , it turns into a viscous liquid .
The ligament cannot be repaired ; it has to be replaced with a graft , which the surgeon usually forms by taking a slice of the patellar tendon below the kneecap or from a hamstring tendon .
One reason for the long rehabilitation is that the procedure is really two operations  one at the site of the injury and the other at the donor site , where the tendon is cut .
Janelle suffered her first A.C.L. injury at practice with her club during a routine drill .
When she planted her left leg to shoot , the knee buckled .
Her mechanics felt no different than they had thousands of times before : Decelerate .
Fix on the target .
Kick .
There were few things in her life she did with more ease or joy .
Her second A.C.L. injury occurred the following summer at the annual Texas Shootout in Houston , a prestigious event that attracted 300 teams and 360 college coaches as well as major corporate sponsorship , including Adidas , Gatorade and the Texas Sports Medicine Center .
In the first game , she ruptured the A.C.L. in her other knee .
“ This time I was pretty sure what it was , ” she said .
“ I was chasing after this girl , trying to cut to stop her .
And it just went out on me . ”
She stayed down on the field , screaming .
A trainer came out and tried to calm her , assuring her the pain would subside .
But her screams came more from anger than pain .
She instantly understood that most of her senior season of high - school soccer would be wiped out and worried that no college coach would want to recruit her .
( What she did not realize was that if college coaches shunned girls with a history of serious knee injuries , they would struggle to put quality teams together . )
CHAPTER 3
URBAN COMBAT SKILLS
Successful combat operations in urban areas depend on the proper employment of the rifle squad .
Each member must be skilled in moving , entering buildings , clearing rooms , employing hand grenades , selecting and using fighting positions , navigating in urban areas , and camouflage .
Section I. MOVEMENT
Movement in urban areas is the first fundamental skill the soldier must master .
Movement techniques must be practiced until they become habitual .
To reduce exposure to enemy fire , the soldier avoids open areas , avoids silhouetting himself , and selects his next covered position before movement .
3 - 1. CROSSING OPEN AREAS
Open areas , such as streets , alleys , and parks , should be avoided .
They are natural kill zones for enemy crew - served weapons or snipers .
They can be crossed safely if the individual or small - unit leader applies certain fundamentals including using smoke from hand grenades or smoke pots to conceal movement .
When employing smoke as an obscurant , keep in mind that thermal sighting systems can see through smoke .
Also , when smoke has been thrown in an open area , the enemy may choose to engage with suppressive fires into the smoke cloud .
a . Before moving to another position , the soldier makes a visual reconnaissance , selects the position offering the best cover and concealment , and determines the route he takes to get to that position .
b.
The soldier develops a plan for his own movement .
He runs the shortest distance between buildings and moves along the far building to the next position , reducing the time he is exposed to enemy fire .
3 - 2. MOVEMENT PARALLEL TO BUILDINGS
Soldiers and small units may not always be able to use the inside of buildings as routes of advance and must move on the outside of the buildings ( Figure 3 - 1 ) .
Smoke , suppressive fires , and cover and concealment should be used to hide movement .
The soldier moves parallel to the side of the building ( maintaining at least 12 inches of separation between himself and the wall to avoid rabbit rounds , ricochets and rubbing or bumping the wall ) , stays in the shadow , presents a low silhouette , and moves rapidly to his next position ( Figure 3 - 2 ) .
If an enemy gunner inside the building fires on a soldier , he exposes himself to fire from other squad members providing overwatch .
An enemy gunner farther down the street would have difficulty detecting and engaging the soldier .
Figure 3 - 1. Selection of the next position .
Figure 3 - 2 . Soldier moving outside building .
3 - 3. MOVEMENT PAST WINDOWS
Windows present another hazard to the soldier .
The most common mistakes are exposing the head in a first - floor window and not being aware of basement windows .
a .
When using the correct technique for passing a first - floor window , the soldier stays below the window level and near the side of the building ( Figure 3 - 3 ) .
He makes sure he does not silhouette himself in the window .
An enemy gunner inside the building would have to expose himself to covering fires if he tried to engage the soldier .
Figure 3 - 3 . Soldier moving past windows .
b . The same techniques used in passing first - floor windows are used when passing basement windows .
A soldier should not walk or run past a basement window , since he presents a good target to an enemy gunner inside the building .
The soldier should stay close to the wall of the building and step or jump past the window without exposing his legs ( Figure 3 - 4 ) .
Figure 3 - 4 . Soldier passing basement windows .
3 - 4. MOVEMENT AROUND CORNERS
The area around a corner must be observed before the soldier moves .
The most common mistake a soldier makes at a corner is allowing his weapon to extend beyond the corner exposing his position ( this mistake is known as flagging your weapon ) .
He should show his head below the height an enemy soldier would expect to see it .
The soldier lies flat on the ground and does not extend his weapon beyond the corner of the building .
He wears his Kevlar helmet and only exposes his head ( at ground level ) enough to permit observation ( Figure 3 - 5 ) .
Another corner clearing technique that is used when speed is required is the pie-ing method .
This procedure is done by aiming the weapon beyond the corner into the direction of travel ( without flagging ) and side - stepping around the corner in a circular fashion with the muzzle as the pivot point ( Figure 3 - 6 ) .
Figure 3 - 5 . Correct technique for looking around a corner .
Figure 3 - 6 . Pie-ing a corner .
3 - 5. CROSSING A WALL
Each soldier must learn the correct method of crossing a wall ( Figure 3 - 7 ) .
After he has reconnoitered the other side , he rolls over the wall quickly , keeping a low silhouette .
Speed of his move and a low silhouette deny the enemy a good target .
Figure 3 - 7 . Soldier crossing a wall .
3 - 6. USE OF DOORWAYS
Doorways should not be used as entrances or exits since they are normally covered by enemy fire .
If a soldier must use a doorway as an exit , he should move quickly to his next position , staying as low as possible to avoid silhouetting himself ( Figure 3 - 8 ) .
Preselection of positions , speed , a low silhouette , and the use of covering fires must be emphasized in exiting doorways .
Figure 3 - 8 . Soldier exiting a doorway .
3 - 7. MOVEMENT BETWEEN POSITIONS
When moving from position to position , each soldier must be careful not to mask his supporting fires .
When he reaches his next position , he must be prepared to cover the movement of other members of his fire team or squad .
He must use his new position effectively and fire his weapon from either shoulder depending on the position .
a .
The most common errors a soldier makes when firing from a position are firing over the top of his cover and silhouetting himself against the building to his rear .
Both provide the enemy an easy target .
The correct technique for firing from a covered position is to fire around the side of the cover , which reduces exposure to the enemy ( Figure 3 - 9 ) .
Figure 3 - 9 . Soldier firing from a covered position .
b. Another common error is for a right - handed shooter to fire from the right shoulder around the left corner of a building .
Firing left - handed around the left corner of a building takes advantage of the cover afforded by the building ( Figure 3 - 10 ) .
Right - handed and left - handed soldiers should be trained to adapt cover and concealment to fit their manual orientation .
Soldiers should be able to fire from the opposite shoulder .
Figure 3 -10 .
Firing left - handed around the corner of a building .
3 - 8. FIRE TEAM EMPLOYMENT
Moving as a fire team from building to building or between buildings presents a large target for enemy fire ( Figure 3 - 11 ) .
When moving from the corner of one building to another , the fire team should move across the open area in a group .
Moving from the side of one building to the side of another presents a similar problem and the technique of movement employed is the same .
The fire team uses the building as cover .
In moving to an adjacent building ( Figure 3 - 12 ) team members should keep a distance of 3 to 5 meters between themselves and , using a planned signal , make an abrupt flanking movement ( on line ) across the open area to the next building .
Figure 3 - 11 .
Fire team movement .
Figure 3 - 12 .
Movement to adjacent building .
Section II .
ENTRY TECHNIQUES
When entering buildings a soldier must minimize the time he is exposed .
Before moving toward the building he must select the entry point .
When moving to the entry point the soldier should use smoke to conceal his advance .
He must avoid using windows and doors except as a last resort .
He should consider the use of demolitions , tank rounds , and other means to make new entrances .
If the situation permits he should precede his entry with a grenade , enter immediately after the grenade explodes , and be covered by one of his buddies .
3 - 9 . UPPER BUILDING LEVELS
Although entering a building from any level other than the ground floor is difficult , clearing a building from the top down is the preferred method .
Assaulting or defending a building is easier from an upper story .
Gravity and the building 's floor plan become assets when throwing hand grenades and moving from floor to floor .
a . An enemy who is forced to the top of a building may be cornered and fight desperately or escape over the roof .
An enemy who is forced down to ground level may withdraw from the building , thus exposing himself to friendly fires from the outside .
b. Various means , such as ladders , drainpipes , vines , helicopters , or the roofs and windows of adjoining buildings , may be used to reach the top floor or roof of a building .
One soldier can climb onto the shoulders of another and reach high enough to pull himself up .
c. Ladders offer the quickest method to access the upper levels of a building ( Figure 3 - 13 ) .
Units deploying into an urban environment should be equipped with a lightweight , man-portable , collapsible ladder as referenced in the platoon urban operations kit .
Figure 3 -13 .
Entering using portable ladder
(1) If portable ladders are not available , material to build ladders can be obtained through supply channels .
Ladders can also be built with resources available throughout the urban area ; for example , lumber can be taken from inside the walls of buildings ( Figure 3 - 14 ) .
Figure 3 - 14 .
Getting lumber from inside the walls .
(2) Although ladders do not permit access to the top of some buildings , they do offer security and safety through speed .
Ladders can be used to conduct an exterior assault of an upper level if soldiers ' exposure to enemy fire can be minimized .
3 -10 . USE OF GRAPPLING HOOK
The use of a grappling hook and rope to ascend into a building is not recommended .
Experimentation and training has determined that using the grappling hook and rope to ascend is extremely difficult for the average soldier , and makes a unit more likely to fail their mission .
Grappling hooks are still a viable tool for accomplishing the following tasks :
Clearing concertina or other tangle wire .
Clearing obstacles or barricades that may be booby trapped .
Descending to lower floors .
3 -11 . SCALING OF WALLS
When required to scale a wall during exposure to enemy fire , all available concealment must be used .
Smoke and diversionary measures improve the chances of success .
When using smoke for concealment , soldiers must plan for wind direction .
They should use suppressive fire , shouting , and distraction devices from other positions to divert the enemy 's attention .
a . A soldier scaling an outside wall is vulnerable to enemy fire .
Soldiers who are moving from building to building and climbing buildings should be covered by friendly fire .
Properly positioned friendly weapons can suppress and eliminate enemy fire .
The M203 grenade launcher is effective in suppressing or neutralizing the enemy from rooms inside buildings ( Figure 3 - 15 ) .
Figure 3 - 15 .
Employment of M203 grenade launcher for clearing enemy snipers .
b . If a soldier must scale a wall with a rope , he should avoid silhouetting himself in windows that are not cleared and avoid exposing himself to enemy fires from lower windows .
He should climb with his weapon slung over the firing shoulder so he can bring it quickly to a firing position .
If the ROE permits , the objective window and any lower level windows in the path of the climber should be engaged with grenades ( hand or launcher ) before the soldier begins his ascent .
c.
The soldier enters the objective window with a low silhouette ( Figure 3 - 16 ) .
Entry can be head first ; however , the preferred method is to hook a leg over the window sill and enter sideways straddling the ledge .
Figure 3 - 16 .
Soldier entering the objective window .
3 -12 . RAPPELLING
Rappelling is an entry technique that soldiers can use to descend from the rooftop of a tall building into a window ( Figure 3 - 17 ) , or through a hole in the floor , in order to descend to the lower floor .
( See TC 21 - 24 for more information on rappelling . )
Figure 3 - 17 .
Rappelling .
3 -13 . ENTRY AT LOWER LEVELS
Buildings should be cleared from the top down .
However , entering a building at the top may be impossible .
Entry at the bottom or lower level is common and may be the only course of action .
When entering a building at lower levels , soldiers avoid entering through windows and doors since both can be easily booby trapped and are usually covered by enemy fire .
( Specific lower - level entry techniques are shown in Figure 3 - 18 .
These techniques are used when soldiers can enter the building without receiving effective enemy fire . )
a . When entering at lower levels , demolitions , artillery , tank fire , antiarmor weapons fire , or similar means can be used to create a new entrance to avoid booby traps .
This procedure is preferred if the ROE permit it .
Quick entry is then required to take advantage of the effects of the blast and concussion .
b.
When the only entry to a building is through a window or door , supporting fire is directed at that location to destroy or drive away enemy forces .
The assaulting soldiers should not leave their covered positions before the support by fire element has accomplished this procedure .
c. Before entering , soldiers may throw a cooked off hand grenade into the new entrance to reinforce the effects of the original blast .
The type grenade used , fragmentation , concussion , or stun , is based on METT - TC factors and the structural integrity of the building .
( 1 ) When making a new entrance in a building , soldiers consider the effects of the blast on the building and on adjacent buildings .
If there is the possibility of a fire in adjacent building , soldiers coordinate with adjacent units and obtain permission before starting the operation .
( 2 ) In wooden frame buildings , the blast may cause the building to collapse .
In stone , brick , or cement buildings , supporting fires are aimed at the corner of the building or at weak points in the building construction .
NOTE : Armored vehicles can be positioned next to a building allowing soldiers to use the vehicle as a platform to enter a room or gain access to a roof .
Figure 3 -18 .
Lower - level entry technique .
Figure 3 -18 .
Lower - level entry technique ( continued ) .
Figure 3 -18 .
Lower - level entry technique ( continued ) .
3 - 14 . USE OF HAND GRENADES
Combat in urban areas often requires extensive use of hand grenades .
Unless the ROE prevent it , use grenades before assaulting defended areas , moving through breaches , or entering unsecured areas .
Effective grenade use in urban areas may require throwing overhand or underhand , with both the left and right hand .
Normally , the fragmentation grenade should be cooked off for two seconds to prevent the enemy from throwing them back .
a . Three types of hand grenades can be used when assaulting an urban objective : stun , concussion , and fragmentation .
METT - TC factors and the type of construction materials used in the objective building influence the type of grenades that can be used .
( 1 ) The M84 stun hand grenade is a flash - bang distraction device , which produces a brilliant flash and a loud bang to momentarily surprise and distract an enemy force ( Figure 3 - 19 ) .
The M84 is often used under precision conditions and when the ROE demand use of a nonlethal grenade .
The use of stun hand grenades under high intensity conditions is usually limited to situations where fragmentation and concussion grenades pose a risk to friendly troops or the structural integrity of the building .
Figure 3 - 19 .
M84 stun hand grenade .
(2) The concussion grenade causes injury or death to persons in a room by blast overpressure and propelling debris within the room ( Figure 3 - 20 ) .
While the concussion grenade does not discard a dangerous fragmentation from its body , the force of the explosion can create debris fallout that may penetrate thin walls .
Figure 3 - 20 .
MK3A2 ( concussion grenade ) .
(3) The fragmentation grenade ( Figure 3 - 21 ) produces substantial overpressure when used inside buildings and , coupled with the shrapnel effects , can be extremely dangerous to friendly soldiers .
If the walls of a building are made of thin material , such as Sheetrock or thin plywood , soldiers should either lie flat on the floor with their helmet towards the area of detonation , or move away from any wall that might be penetrated by grenade fragments .
Figure 3 - 21 .
Fragmentation grenade .
b. Soldiers should engage upper - level openings with grenades ( by hand or launcher ) before entering to eliminate enemy that might be near the entrance .
( 1 ) The M203 grenade launcher is the best method for putting a grenade in an upper - story window .
The primary round of ammunition used for engaging an urban threat is the M433 high - explosive , dual - purpose cartridge ( Figure 3 - 22 ) .
Throwing a hand grenade into an upper - story opening is a task that is difficult to do safely during combat .
Figure 3 - 22 . 40 - mm , tube - launched , high - explosive , dual - purpose ( HEDP ) grenade .
(2) When a hand grenade must be thrown into an upper - story opening , the thrower should stand close to the building , using it for cover .
This technique should only be employed when the window opening is free of glass or screen .
( 3 ) The thrower should allow the grenade to cook off for at least two seconds , and then step out far enough to lob the grenade into the upper - story opening ( Figure 3 - 23 ) .
He should keep his weapon in the nonthrowing hand , to be used if needed .
The weapon should never be laid outside or inside the building .
At the same time , everyone should have a planned area to move to for safety if the grenade does not go through the window but falls back to the ground .
( 4 ) Once the grenade has been thrown into the opening and detonates , assaulting troops must move swiftly to enter the building .
Figure 3 - 23 .
Hand grenade thrown through window .
c. If soldiers must enter the building by the stairs , they must first look for booby traps , then engage the stairwell door with a grenade ( by hand or launcher ) , let it detonate , and quickly move inside .
They can then use the staircase for cover .
WARNING 1 .
If stealth is not a factor , after throwing the grenade the soldier must immediately announce frag out to indicate that a grenade has been thrown .
He then takes cover since the grenade may bounce back or be thrown back , or the enemy may fire at him .
2 . When the M203 grenade launcher is used to deliver the grenade into a window or doorway , ensure proper standoff for arming the round .
Also , the assaulting element should take cover around a corner or away from the target area .
d. Breachholes and mouseholes are blown or cut through a wall so soldiers can enter a building .
( See Chapters 4 and 7 for more information . )
These are safer entrances than doors because doors can be easily booby trapped and should be avoided , unless explosive breaching is used against the door .
( 1 ) A grenade should be thrown through the breach before entering .
Use available cover , such as the lower corner of the building ( Figure 3 - 24 ) , for protection from fragments .
( 2 ) Use stun and concussion grenades when engaging through thin walls .
Figure 3 - 24 .
Soldier entering through a mousehole .
e . When a door is the only means of entering a building , soldiers must beware of booby traps and fire from enemy soldiers within the room .
( 1 ) Locked doors can be breached ( forced open ) using one of the four breaching methods : mechanical , ballistic , explosive , or thermal ( see Chapter 8 ) .
If none of these methods are available , soldiers can resort to kicking the door open .
This method is the least preferred since it is difficult and tiring to the soldier .
It rarely works the first time , and gives any enemy soldiers in the room ample warning and time to shoot through the door .
Once the door is breached , a grenade should precede the soldier 's entry .
( 2 ) When opening an unlocked door by hand , the assault team should be sure not to expose themselves to enemy fire through the door .
The soldiers should stay close to one side of the doorway to minimize exposure in the open doorframe ( 3 ) Once the door is open , a hand grenade should be tossed in .
After the grenade explodes , soldiers enter and clear the room IAW the tactics , techniques , and procedures discussed in Section III .
f.
Although buildings are best cleared from the top down , this procedure is not always possible .
While clearing the bottom floor of a building , soldiers may encounter stairs , which must also be cleared .
Once again , grenades play an important role .
( 1 ) To climb stairs , first inspect for booby traps , then toss a grenade to the head of the stairs ( Figure 3 - 25 ) .
Soldiers must use voice alerts when throwing grenades .
( 2 ) Using the staircase for cover , soldiers throw the grenade underhand to reduce the risk of it bouncing back and rolling down the stairs .
( 3 ) Once the first grenade has detonated , another grenade should be thrown over and behind the staircase banister and into the hallway , neutralizing any exposed enemy in the hallway .
( 4 ) When the second hand grenade has detonated , soldiers proceed to clear the stairway in accordance with prescribed TTP .
NOTE : Large quantities of hand grenades are used when clearing buildings .
A continuous supply must be available .
Figure 3 - 25 .
Soldier tossing grenade up stairway .
CAUTION
Throwing fragmentation grenades up a stairway has a high probability for the grenades to roll back down and cause fratricide .
Soldiers should avoid clustering at the foot of the stairway and ensure that the structural integrity of the building permits the use of either a fragmentation or concussion grenade .
3 -15 . INDIVIDUAL WEAPONS CONTROL WHEN MOVING
As in all combat situations , the clearing team members must move tactically and safely .
Individuals who are part of a clearing team must move in a standard manner , using practiced techniques known to all .
a . When moving , team members maintain muzzle awareness by holding their weapons with the muzzle pointed in the direction of travel .
Soldiers keep the butt of the rifle in the pocket of their shoulder , with the muzzle slightly down to allow unobstructed vision .
Soldiers keep both eyes open and swing the muzzle as they turn their head so the rifle is always aimed where the soldier is looking .
This procedure allows to soldier to see what or who is entering their line of fire .
b.
Team members avoid flagging ( leading ) with the weapon when working around windows , doors , corners , or areas where obstacles must be negotiated .
Flagging the weapon gives advance warning to anyone looking in the soldier 's direction , making it easier for an enemy to grab the weapon .
c. Team members should keep weapons on safe ( selector switch on SAFE and index finger outside of trigger guard ) until a hostile target is identified and engaged .
After a team member clears his sector of all targets , he returns his weapon to the SAFE position .
d.
If a soldier has a weapons malfunction during room clearing , he should immediately announce " gun down " and drop to one knee and conduct immediate action to reduce the malfunction .
The other members of the team should engage targets in his sector .
Once the weapon is operational , he should announce " gun up " and remain in the kneeling position until directed to stand - up by the team leader .
Section III .
CLEARING
Infantry units often use close combat to enter and clear buildings and rooms .
This section describes the TTP for clearing .
3 -16 . HIGH INTENSITY VERSUS PRECISION CLEARING TECHNIQUES
Precision clearing techniques do not replace other techniques currently being used to clear buildings and rooms during high - intensity combat .
Specifically , they do not replace the clearing technique in which a fragmentation or concussion grenade is thrown into a room before the US forces enter .
Precision room clearing techniques are used when the tactical situation calls for room - by - room clearing of a relatively intact building in which enemy combatants and noncombatants may be intermixed .
They involve increased risk in order to clear a building methodically , rather than using overwhelming firepower to eliminate or neutralize all its inhabitants .
a . From a conceptual standpoint , standard high - intensity room clearing drills can be thought of as a deliberate attack .
The task is to seize control of the room with the purpose being the neutralization of the enemy in the room .
The fragmentation and or concussion grenades can be thought of as the preparatory fires used before the assault .
As in a deliberate attack against any objective , the assaulting elements move into position using covered and concealed routes .
The preparatory fires ( fragmentation and or concussion grenades ) are initiated when soldiers are as close to the objective as they can get without being injured by the fires .
The assault element follows the preparatory fires onto the objective as closely as possible .
A rapid , violent assault overwhelms and destroys the enemy force and seizes the objective .
b. Compared to the deliberate attack represented by high - intensity room clearing techniques , precision room clearing techniques are more conceptually like a reconnaissance in force or perhaps an infiltration attack .
During a reconnaissance in force , the friendly unit seeks to determine the enemy 's locations , dispositions , strength , and intentions .
Once the enemy is located , the friendly force is fully prepared to engage and destroy it , especially if surprise is achieved .
The friendly force retains the options of not employing preparatory fires ( fragmentation and or concussion grenades ) if they are not called for ( the enemy is not in the room ) or if they are inappropriate ( there are noncombatants present also ) .
The attacking unit may choose to create a diversion ( use a stun grenade ) to momentarily distract the defender while they enter and seize the objective .
c.
The determination of which techniques to employ is up to the leader on the scene and is based on his analysis of the existing METT - TC conditions .
The deliberate attack ( high - intensity techniques ) , with its devastating suppressive and preparatory fires , neutralizes everyone in the room and is less dangerous to the assaulting troops .
The reconnaissance in force ( precision techniques ) conserves ammunition , reduces damage , and minimizes the chance of noncombatant casualties .
Unfortunately , even when well - executed , it is very stressful and hazardous for friendly troops .
d. Certain precision room clearing techniques , such as methods of squad and fire team movement , the various firing stances , weapon positioning , and reflexive shooting , are useful for all combat in confined areas .
Other techniques , such as entering a room without first neutralizing known enemy occupants by fire or explosives , are appropriate in only some tactical situations .
e . Generally , if a room or building is occupied by an alerted enemy force that is determined to resist , and if most or all noncombatants are clear , overwhelming firepower should be employed to avoid friendly casualties .
In such a situation , supporting fires , demolitions , and fragmentation grenades should be used to neutralize a space before friendly troops enter .
f.
In some combat situations the use of heavy supporting fires and demolitions would cause unacceptable collateral damage or would unnecessarily slow the unit 's movement .
In other situations , often during stability and support operations , enemy combatants are so intermixed with noncombatants that US forces cannot , in good conscience , use all available supporting fires .
Room - by - room clearing may be necessary .
At such times , precision room clearing techniques are most appropriate .
3 -17 . PRINCIPLES OF PRECISION ROOM CLEARING
Battles that occur at close quarters , such as within a room or hallway , must be planned and executed with care .
Units must train , practice , and rehearse precision room clearing techniques until each fire team and squad operates smoothly .
Each unit member must understand the principles of precision room clearing : surprise , speed , and controlled violence of action .
a. Surprise .
Surprise is the key to a successful assault at close quarters .
The fire team or squad clearing the room must achieve surprise , if only for seconds , by deceiving , distracting , or startling the enemy .
Sometimes stun grenades may be used to achieve surprise .
These are more effective against a nonalert , poorly trained enemy than against alert , well - trained soldiers .
b. Speed .
Speed provides a measure of security to the clearing unit .
It allows soldiers to use the first few vital seconds provided by surprise to their maximum advantage .
In precision room clearing , speed is not how fast you enter the room , rather it's how fast the threat is eliminated and the room is cleared .
c. Controlled Violence of Action .
Controlled violence of action eliminates or neutralizes the enemy while giving him the least chance of inflicting friendly casualties .
It is not limited to the application of firepower only , but also involves a soldier mind - set of complete domination .
Each of the principles of precision room clearing has a synergistic relationship to the others .
Controlled violence coupled with speed increases surprise .
Hence , successful surprise allows increased speed .
3 -18 . FUNDAMENTALS OF PRECISION ROOM CLEARING
The ten fundamentals of precision room clearing address actions soldiers take while moving along confined corridors to the room to be cleared , while preparing to enter the room , during room entry and target engagement , and after contact .
Team members —
Move tactically and silently while securing the corridors to the room to be cleared .
Carry only the minimum amount of equipment .
( Rucksacks and loose items carried by soldiers tire them , slow their pace , and cause noise . )
Arrive undetected at the entry to the room in the correct order of entrance , prepared to enter on a single command .
Enter quickly and dominate the room .
Move immediately to positions that allow complete control of the room and provide unobstructed fields of fire .
Eliminate all enemy in the room by fast , accurate , and discriminating fires .
Gain and maintain immediate control of the situation and all personnel in the room .
Confirm whether enemy casualties are wounded or dead .
Disarm , segregate , and treat the wounded .
Search all enemy casualties .
Perform a cursory search of the room .
Determine if a detailed search is required .
Evacuate all wounded and any friendly dead .
Mark the room as cleared using a simple , clearly identifiable marking in accordance with the unit SOP .
Maintain security and be prepared to react to more enemy contact at any moment .
Do not neglect rear security .
3 -19 . COMPOSITION OF THE CLEARING TEAM
Precision room clearing techniques are designed to be executed by the standard four - man fire team .
Because of the confined spaces typical of building - and room - clearing operations , units larger than squads quickly become unwieldy .
When shortages of personnel demand it , room clearing can be conducted with two - or three - man teams , but four - man teams are preferred .
Using fewer personnel greatly increases the combat strain and risks .
3 -20 . BREACHING
An integral part of precision room clearing is the ability to gain access quickly to the rooms to be cleared .
Breaching techniques vary based on the type of construction encountered and the types of munitions available to the breaching element .
Techniques range from simple mechanical breaching to complex , specialized demolitions .
a . A useful method of breaching is the shotgun ballistic breach for forced entry of standard doors .
A 12 - gauge shotgun loaded with buckshot or slugs can be used to breach most standard doors quickly .
Number 9 shot works equally well with reduced collateral damage on the other side of the door .
When done properly , the shotgun breach requires only a few seconds .
The two standard techniques of shotgun breaching are the doorknob breach and the hinge breach .
When attempting either technique , the gunner is announcing his presence by using the shotgun and is completely exposed to fire through the door .
Therefore , exposure time must be minimized and the number 1 man must be ready to gain entry and return fire as soon as possible .
While holding the stock of the shotgun in the pocket of his shoulder , the gunner places the muzzle tightly against the door , and aims down at a 45 - degree angle .
NOTE : If the shotgun muzzle is not held tightly against the door , splatter may occur that could affect friendly troops .
Also , buckshot and rifled slugs can overpenetrate doors and may kill or wound occupants in the room .
(1) For the doorknob breach , the aim point is a spot halfway between the doorknob and the frame , not at the doorknob itself .
The gunner fires two quick shots in the same location , ensuring the second shot is aimed as carefully as the first .
Weak locks may fly apart with the first shot , but the gunner should always fire twice .
Some locks that appear to be blown apart have parts still connected that can delay entry .
If the lock is not defeated by the second shot , the gunner repeats the procedure .
Doors may not always open after firing .
The gunner should be prepared to kick the door after firing to ensure opening of the entry point .
( 2 ) The hinge breach technique is performed much the same as the doorknob breach , except the gunner aims at the hinges .
He fires three shots per hinge — the first at the middle , then at the top and bottom ( Figure 3 - 26 ) .
He fires all shots from less than an inch away from the hinge .
Because the hinges are often hidden from view , the hinge breach is more difficult .
Hinges are generally 8 to 10 inches from the top and bottom of the door ; the center hinge is generally 36 inches from the top , centered on the door .
Regardless of which technique the gunner uses , immediately after he fires , he kicks the door in or pulls it out .
He then pulls the shotgun barrel sharply upward and quickly turns away from the doorway to signal that the breach point has been cleared .
This rapid clearing of the doorway allows the following man in the fire team a clear shot at any enemy who may be blocking the immediate breach site .
Figure 3 - 26 .
Aim points for shotgun breach of a standard door , doorknob target on left and hinge targets on right .
NOTE : The use of small arms ( 5.56 - mm or 7.62 - mm ) as a ballistic breach on doorknobs and hinges is unsafe and should only be used as a last resort .
b. Demolitions are often needed to defeat more elaborate barriers or to produce a desired effect to aid the initial entry .
( See Chapter 8 for a discussion of expedient demolitions for breaching common urban barriers . ) c. Mechanical breaching is planned as a backup to a ballistic or explosive breach .
Mechanical breaching is an assumed capability within all units .
Taking the time to defeat weak barriers , such as doors or windows , by means of crowbars , saws , sledgehammers , battering rams , axes , or other breaching tools is a decision that must be made based on the conditions of METT - TC .
d. Clearing team members must approach the breach point quickly , quietly , and in standard order .
This approach preserves the element of surprise and allows for quick entry and domination of the room .
The order of movement to the breach point is determined by the method of breach and intended actions at the breach point .
The members of the fire team are assigned numbers 1 through 4 , with the team leader normally designated number 2 .
If one member of the clearing team is armed with the SAW rather than an M16 rifle or carbine , he should be designated number 4 . ( 1 ) Ballistic ( Shotgun ) Breach .
The order of movement for a shotgun breach has the gunner up front , followed by the number 1 man , number 2 man ( team leader ) , and then the number 3 man .
After the door is breached , the gunner moves to the rear of the lineup and assumes the position of the number 4 man .
( 2 ) Explosive ( Demolition ) Breach .
The order of movement for an explosive breach without engineer support is number 1 , number 2 ( team leader ) , number 3 , and then number 4 .
The number 1 man provides security at the doorway .
The number 2 man ( team leader ) carries the demolition charge and places it .
The number 3 man provides security overhead , and the number 4 man provides rear security .
After the demolition charge is placed , the team moves to covered positions and prepares to enter in the standard 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 order .
( Refer to Chapter 8 for information concerning minimum safe distances . )
( 3 ) Mechanical Breach .
A suggested order of movement for a mechanical breach is the initial assault team in order , followed by the breach man or element .
At the breach point , the assault team leader brings the breach team forward while the assault team provides local security .
After the breach is conducted , the breach team moves aside and provides local security as the assault team enters the breach .
3 -21 . CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENTRY
The entire team enters the room as quickly and smoothly as possible and clears the doorway immediately .
If possible , the team moves from a covered or concealed position already in their entry order .
Ideally , the team arrives and passes through the entry point without having to stop .
a . The door is the focal point of anyone in the room .
It is known as the fatal funnel , because it focuses attention at the precise point where the individual team members are the most vulnerable .
Moving into the room quickly reduces the chance anyone being hit by enemy fire directed at the doorway .
b.
On the signal to go , the clearing team moves from covered or concealed positions through the door quickly and takes up positions inside the room that allow it to completely dominate the room and eliminate the threat .
Team members stop movement only after they have cleared the door and reached their designated point of domination .
The first man 's position is deep into the near corner of the room .
The depth of his movement is determined by the size of the room , any obstacles in the room , such as furniture , and by the number and location of enemy and noncombatants in the room .
c.
To make precision room clearing techniques work , each member of the team must know his sector of fire and how his sector overlaps and links with the sectors of the other team members .
Team members do not move to the point of domination and then engage their targets .
They engage targets as they move to their designated point .
However , engagements must not slow movement to their points of domination .
Team members may shoot from as short a range as 1 to 2 inches .
They engage the most immediate enemy threats first .
Examples of immediate threats are enemy personnel who —
Are armed and prepared to return fire immediately .
Block movement to the position of domination .
Are within arm 's reach of a clearing team member .
Are within 3 to 5 feet of the breach point .
d. Each clearing team member has a designated sector of fire unique to him initially and expands to overlap sectors of the other team members .
(1) The number 1 and number 2 men are initially concerned with the area directly to their front , then along the wall on either side of the door or entry point .
This area is in their path of movement , and it is their primary sector of fire .
Their alternate sector of fire is from the wall they are moving toward , back to the opposite far corner .
( 2 ) The number 3 and number 4 men start at the center of the wall opposite their point of entry and clear to the left if moving toward the left , or to the right if moving toward the right .
They stop short of their respective team member ( either the number 1 man or the number 2 man ) .
e . The team members move toward their points of domination , engaging all targets in their sector .
Team members must exercise fire control and discriminate between hostile and noncombatant room occupants .
Shooting is done without stopping , using reflexive shooting techniques .
Because the soldiers are moving and shooting at the same time , they must move using careful hurry .
( Figure 3 - 31 in paragraph 3 - 23 , shows all four team members at their points of domination and their overlapping sectors of fire . )
3 - 22 . TECHNIQUES FOR ENTERING BUILDINGS AND CLEARING ROOMS
Battle Drill 6 is the standard technique used by the four - man fire team when they perform the task , Enter Building / Clear Room .
However , ROE may not allow for , nor the enemy situation requires , such aggressive action on the part of the assaulting unit .
Based on the aforementioned conditions , commanders may determine to use the following techniques when entering and clearing buildings and rooms .
a. Situation .
Operating as part of a larger force ( during daylight or darkness ) , the squad is tasked to participate in clearing a building .
The platoon leader directs the squad to enter the building or to clear a room .
An entry point breach has already been identified , or will be created before initiating the entry .
b. Special Considerations .
Platoon and squad leaders must consider the task and purpose they have been given and the method they are to use to achieve the desired results .
( 1 ) To seize or gain control of a building may not always require committing troops into the structure or closing with the enemy .
The following steps describe effective techniques to be used when training soldiers to the toughest possible conditions .
These techniques and procedures can be trained , rehearsed , and modified to a specific situation and mission .
Before initiating this action the employment of all organic , crew - served , and supporting weapon systems should be directed onto the objective area in order to suppress and neutralize the threat , providing the mission and ROE permit .
( 2 ) When conducting urban operations , soldiers must be equipped at all times with a night vision device or light source to illuminate the immediate area .
NOTE : The following discussion assumes that only the platoon 's organic weapons are to support the infantry squad .
Urban situations may require precise application of firepower .
This situation is especially true of an urban environment where the enemy is mixed with noncombatants .
Noncombatants may be found in the room , which can restrict the use of fires and reduce the combat power available to a squad leader .
His squad may have to operate with no fire areas .
Rules of engagement can prohibit the use of certain weapons until a specific hostile action takes place .
All soldiers must be aware of the ROE .
Leaders must include the specific use of weapons in their planning for precision operations in urban terrain .
c. Required Actions .
Figures 3 - 27 , 3 - 28 , 3 - 29 , and 3-30 illustrate the required actions for performing this task .
( 1 ) The squad leader designates the assault team and identifies the location of the entry point for them .
( 2 ) The squad leader positions the follow - on assault team to provide overwatch and supporting fires for the initial assault team .
( 3 ) Assault team members move as close to the entry point as possible , using available cover and concealment .
( a ) If an explosive breach or a ballistic breach is to be performed by a supporting element , the assault team remains in a covered position until the breach is made .
They may provide overwatch and fire support for the breaching element if necessary .
( b)
All team members must signal one another that they are ready before the team moves to the entry point .
( c ) Team members avoid the use of verbal signals , which may alert the enemy and remove the element of surprise .
( d) Assault team members must move quickly from the covered position to the entry point , minimizing the time they are exposed to enemy fire .
( 4 ) The assault team enters through the breach .
Unless a grenade is being thrown prior to entry , the team should avoid stopping outside the point of entry .
( a ) The number 2 man may throw a grenade of some type ( fragmentation , concussion , stun ) into the room before entry .
( b)
The use of grenades should be consistent with the ROE and building structure .
The grenade should be cooked off before being thrown , if applicable to the type of grenade used .
( c ) If stealth is not a factor , the thrower should sound off with a verbal indication that a grenade of some type is being thrown ( " frag out , " " concussion out , " " stun out " ) .
If stealth is a factor , only visual signals are given as the grenade is thrown .
CAUTION
If walls and floors are thin , fragments from fragmentation grenades and debris created by concussion grenades can injure soldiers outside the room .
If the structure has been stressed by previous explosive engagements , the use of these grenades could cause it to collapse .
Leaders must determine the effectiveness of these types of grenades compared to possibilities of harm to friendly troops .
(5) On the signal to go , or immediately after the grenade detonates , the assault team moves through the entry point ( Figure 3 - 27 ) and quickly takes up positions inside the room that allow it to completely dominate the room and eliminate the threat ( Figure 3- 30 ) .
Unless restricted or impeded , team members stop movement only after they have cleared the door and reached their designated point of domination .
In addition to dominating the room , all team members are responsible for identifying possible loopholes and mouseholes in the ceiling , walls and floor .
NOTE : Where enemy forces may be concentrated and the presence of noncombatants is highly unlikely , the assault team can precede their entry by throwing a fragmentation or concussion grenade ( structure dependent ) into the room , followed by bursts of automatic small - arms fire by the number one man as he enters .
( a) The first man ( rifleman ) , enters the room and eliminates the immediate threat .
He has the option of going left or right , normally moving along the path of least resistance to one of two corners .
When using a doorway as the point of entry , the path of least resistance is determined initially based on the way the door opens ; if the door opens inward he plans to move away from the hinges .
If the door opens outward , he plans to move toward the hinged side .
Upon entering , the size of the room , enemy situation , and furniture or other obstacles that hinder or channel movement become factors that influence the number1 man 's direction of movement .
( b)
The direction each man moves in should not be preplanned unless the exact room layout is known .
Each man should go in a direction opposite the man in front of him ( Figure 3 - 27 ) .
Every team member must know the sectors and duties of each position .
( c ) As the first man goes through the entry point , he can usually see into the far corner of the room .
He eliminates any immediate threat and continues to move along the wall if possible and to the first corner , where he assumes a position of domination facing into the room .
Figure 3 - 27 .
First man enters a room .
(6) The second man ( team leader ) , entering almost simultaneously with the first , moves in the opposite direction , following the wall and staying out of the center ( Figure 3 - 28 ) .
The second man must clear the entry point , clear the immediate threat area , clear his corner , and move to a dominating position on his side of the room .
Figure 3 - 28 .
Second man enters a room .
(7) The third man ( grenadier ) simply goes opposite of the second man inside the room at least one meter from the entry point and moves to a position that dominates his sector ( Figure 3 - 29 ) .
Figure 3 - 29 .
Third man enters a room .
(8) The fourth man ( SAW gunner ) moves opposite of the third man and moves to a position that dominates his sector ( Figure 3- 30 ) .
Figure 3-30 .
Fourth man in a room .
NOTE : If the path of least resistance takes the first man to the left , then all points of domination are the mirror image of those shown in the diagrams .
(9) Points of domination should not be in front of doors or windows so team members are not silhouetted to the outside of the room ( Figure 3 - 31 ) .
No movement should mask the fire of any of the other team members .
Figure 3-31 .
Points of domination and sectors of fire .
( 10 ) On order , any member of the assault team may move deeper into the room overwatched by the other team members .
( 11 )
Once the room is cleared , the team leader signals to the squad leader that the room has been cleared .
( 12 ) The squad leader marks the room ( IAW unit SOP ) .
The squad leader determines whether or not his squad can continue to clear through the building .
( 13 ) The squad reorganizes as necessary .
Leaders redistribute the ammunition .
( 14 )
The squad leader reports to the platoon leader when the room is clear .
d. Reasons for Modifying the Entry Technique .
Although this technique is an effective procedure for clearing a room , leaders may be required to modify the existing action to meet their current situation .
Some example reasons and methods of modifying the technique are shown in Table 3 - 1 .
REASON METHOD
Objective rooms are consistently small .
Clear with two or three men .
Shortage of personnel .
Clear in teams of two or three .
Enemy poses no immediate threat .
One or two men search each room to ensure no enemy or noncombatants are present .
No immediate threat , and speed is of the essence One man visually searches each room .
Table 3 - 1. Reasons and methods for modifying entry techniques .
e. Three - and Two - Man Teams .
When full four - man teams are not available for room clearing three - and two - man teams can be used .
Figures 3 - 32 ( below ) and 3 - 33 show the points of domination and sectors of fire for a three - man clearing team .
Figures 3 - 34 and 3-35 show the same thing for a two - man team .
Leaders should use the entry technique blueprint when modifying their techniques .
Figure 3 -32 .
Points of domination and sectors of fire ( three - man team , center door ) .

Points of domination and sectors of fire ( three - man team , corner door ) .

Points of domination and sectors of fire ( two - man team , center door ) .
Figure 3-35 .
Points of domination and sectors of fire ( two - man team , corner door ) .
CAUTION Ricochets are a hazard .
All soldiers must be aware of the type of wall construction of the room being cleared .
The walls of an enclosed room present many right angles .
Combined with hard surfaces such as concrete , a bullet may continue to ricochet around a room until its energy is spent .
After hitting threat personnel , ball ammunition may pass through the body and ricochet .
Body armor and the Kevlar helmet provide some protection from this hazard .
3 -23 . REFLEXIVE SHOOTING
Precision room clearing allows little or no margin for error .
Too slow a shot at an enemy , too fast a shot at a noncombatant , or inaccurate shots can all be disastrous for the clearing team .
Proper weapon ready technique , stance , aiming , shot placement , and trigger manipulations constitute reflexive shooting .
Reflexive shooting techniques are used by all members of the fire team , to include M203 and M249 gunners .
a. Weapon Ready Positions .
The two weapon ready positions are low ready and high ready ( Figure 3 - 36 ) .
( 1 ) Low Ready Position .
The butt of the weapon is placed firmly in the pocket of the shoulder with the barrel pointed down at a 45 - degree angle .
This position is the safest carry position .
It should be used by the clearing team while inside the room , except when actually entering and clearing .
( 2 ) High , Ready Position .
The butt of the weapon is held under the armpit , with the barrel pointed slightly up , keeping the front sight assembly under the line of sight but within the gunner 's peripheral vision .
To engage a target , the gunner pushes the weapon out as if to bayonet the target .
When the weapon leaves the armpit , he slides it up into the firing shoulder .
This technique is used when moving in a single file .
Figure 3 - 36 .
Ready positions for the M16A2 .
b. Stance .
Feet are about shoulder - width apart .
Toes are pointed to the front ( direction of movement ) .
The firing side foot is slightly staggered to the rear of the non-firing side foot .
Knees are slightly bent and the upper body is leaned slightly forward .
Shoulders are square and pulled back , not rolled over or slouched .
The head is up and both eyes are open .
When engaging targets , the gunner holds the weapon with the butt in the pocket of his shoulder .
c. Aiming with Iron Sights .
The four aiming techniques all have their place during combat in urban areas , but the aimed quick - kill technique is the one most often used in precision room clearing .
( 1 ) Slow Aimed Fire .
This technique is the most accurate .
It consists of taking up a steady , properly aligned sight picture and squeezing off rounds .
It is normally used for engagements beyond 25 meters or when the need for accuracy overrides speed .
( 2 ) Rapid Aimed Fire .
This technique features an imperfect sight picture in which windage is critical but elevation is of lesser importance .
When the front sight post is in line with the target , the gunner squeezes the trigger .
This technique is used against targets out to 15 meters and is fairly accurate and very fast .
( 3 ) Aimed Quick Kill .
This technique consists of using a good spot weld and placing the front sight post flush on top of the rear peep sight .
It is used for very quick shots out to 12 meters .
Windage is important , but elevation is not critical with relation to the target .
This technique is the fastest and most accurate .
With practice , soldiers can become deadly shots at close range .
( 4 ) Instinctive Fire .
This technique is the least desirable .
The gunner focuses on the target and points the weapon in the target 's general direction , using muscle memory to compensate for lack of aim .
This technique should be used only in emergencies .
d. M68 Close Combat Optic .
The M68 close combat optic ( CCO ) is an excellent close combat aiming system when used properly .
Remember , the M68 is not a telescope sight .
( 1 ) Aimed Fire .
This technique requires looking through the CCO with both eyes open and focusing on the target .
An optical illusion places a red aiming dot in front of the firer .
The dot is placed on the target then the target is engaged with fire .
The aiming dot does not have to be centered in the optic .
The CCO is used in the same manner at all ranges .
Therefore , there is no distinction between slow aimed fire , rapid aimed fire , and aimed quick kill techniques .
( 2 ) Instinctive Fire .
This technique remains the same with the CCO .
e. Trigger Manipulation .
Rapid , aimed , semiautomatic fire is the most effective method of engaging targets during precision room clearing .
As each round is fired from the aimed quick - kill position , the weapon 's recoil makes the front sight post move in a small natural arc .
The gunner should not fight this recoil .
He should let the weapon make the arc and immediately bring the front sight post back onto the target and take another shot .
This two - shot combination is known as firing a controlled pair .
Soldiers must practice a controlled pair until it becomes instinctive .
Clearing team members continue to fire controlled pairs until the target goes down .
If there are multiple targets , team members engage with a controlled pair and then return to reengage any enemy left standing or still trying to resist .
f. Shot Placement .
In precision room clearing , enemy soldiers must be incapacitated immediately .
Shots that wound or are mortal but do not incapacitate the target instantaneously are better than misses but may allow the enemy to return fire .
While a solid head - shot is expected to instantaneously incapacitate the enemy , a target area of 5 by 8 inches may be difficult to hit when moving rapidly in a low crouch position .
( 1 ) Members of clearing teams should concentrate on achieving solid , well - placed shots ( controlled pairs ) to the upper chest , then to the head ( Figure 3 - 37 ) .
This shot placement increases the first round hit probability and allows for a second round incapacitating shot .
( 2 ) This engagement technique is more reliable than attempting head - shots only and is easy for soldiers to learn , having been taught previously to aim at center of mass .
Figure 3 - 37 .
Lethal to incapacitating shot placement .
g. Reflexive Shooting Techniques During Limited Visibility .
Reflexive shooting techniques are also used during periods of limited visibility .
( 1 ) Visible Illumination .
When using flashlights or other visible illumination , treat all engagements as day engagements and use the applicable technique as described above .
Bright light shone into the enemy 's eyes can limit his effectiveness ; also , be aware that a flashlight marks your location as well .
( 2 ) AN / PAQ - 4 and AN / PEQ - 2 Aiming Lights .
When using IR aiming lights in conjunction with night vision goggles ( NVGs ) , use the instinctive fire technique to point the weapon at the target while activating the aiming light .
This technique should place the aiming dot within the field of view of the NVGs and on or near the target .
Adjust placement of the aiming dot onto the target and fire .
Note that target discrimination is more difficult when using NVGs .
IR illumination provided by flashlights with IR filters , or the illuminator that is integral with the PEQ - 2 , can aid in target identification and discrimination .
IR illumination is also required inside buildings when there is no ambient light .
( 3 ) AN / PAS - 13 Thermal Weapons Sight .
The thermal weapons sight ( TWS ) offers some distinct advantages over IR viewers .
It does not require any ambient light and does not bloom out when encountering a sudden light source .
However , its weight and bulk are a disadvantage when performing reflexive firing techniques .
With the sight in the ON position , the TWS has a power saving feature that turns off the viewer after a period of inactivity .
The soldier reactivates the sight by placing his eye against the rubber eyecup .
When reactivated , it takes a few seconds for the sight to cool itself down enough to regain an image .
This delay is not acceptable for soldiers using TWS while conducting room and building clearing tasks .
When performing precision clearing tasks , the TWS must remain in the EMERGENCY setting , which allows it to remain continuously active .
NOTE : The emergency setting on the TWS greatly reduces the battery life , which requires more frequent battery changes .
(4) When using the TWS during periods of limited visibility , it is best to use the PAQ - 4 aiming light , with the AN / PVS - 14 Monocular NVG for reflexive shooting engagements .
Use the TWS when the slow aimed fire technique is appropriate .
For daytime and high visibility periods , soldiers using the TWS should not be placed on point , or be among the numbers 1 through 3 men of a room clearing team .
When employed in urban operations , soldiers must be aware that the TWS cannot detect targets through window glass .
The TWS is effective in daytime for locating targets hidden in shadows .
3 - 24 . TARGET DISCRIMINATION
Target discrimination is the act of quickly distinguishing between combatant and noncombatant personnel and engaging only the combatants .
US forces engage in precision room clearing to apply discriminating combat power and limit unnecessary casualties among noncombatants .
Target discrimination is vital in precision room clearing .
If there are no noncombatants then there is less of a need for selective engagements .
However , even if an area is known to be free of noncombatants , other soldiers moving through the area may be mistaken as enemy and engaged unless clearing team members are disciplined and well - trained in fire control and target discrimination .
Even with well - trained , disciplined soldiers , precision room clearing can result in unintentional casualties among noncombatants .
Commanders must recognize this and take steps to relieve the stress it causes soldiers .
3 -25 . MOVEMENT WITHIN A BUILDING
When operating under precision conditions , movement techniques may be modified based on the room clearing technique being used .
The terrain , the enemy situation , visibility , and the likelihood of contact dictate movement techniques .
a. Individual Movement .
When moving within a building , the soldier avoids silhouetting himself in doors and windows ( Figure 3 - 38 ) .
When moving in hallways , he never moves alone — he always moves with at least one other soldier for security .
The soldier should try to stay 12 to 18 inches away from walls when moving ; rubbing against walls may alert an enemy on the other side , or , if engaged by an enemy , ricochet rounds tend to travel parallel to a wall .
Figure 3-38 .
Movement within a building .
b. Hallway Clearing Techniques .
The clearing team must always be alert .
Team members provide security at the breach point and to the rear .
Inside buildings they provide security laterally down corridors , and upward if near stairs or landings .
The two basic techniques for moving down hallways are shown in Figure 3-39 .
Hallway intersections are dangerous areas and should be approached cautiously ( Figures 3 - 40 and 3 - 41 ) .
( 1 ) Serpentine .
The serpentine technique is used in narrow hallways .
The number 1 man provides security to the front .
His sector of fire includes any enemy soldiers who appear at the far end of the hall or from any doorways near the end .
The number 2 and number 3 men cover the left and right sides of the number 1 man .
Their sectors of fire include any soldiers who appear suddenly from nearby doorways on either side of the hall .
The number 4 man , normally carrying the M249 , provides rear protection against any enemy soldiers suddenly appearing behind the clearing team .
( 2 ) Rolling T .
The rolling - T technique is used in wide hallways .
The number 1 and number 2 men move abreast , covering the opposite side of the hallway from the one they are walking on .
The number 3 man covers the far end of the hallway from a position behind the number 1 and number 2 men , firing between them .
Once again , the number 4 man provides rear security .
Figure 3-39 .
Hallway clearing techniques .
(3) Clearing " T " Intersections .
Figure 3 - 40 depicts the fire team 's actions upon reaching a hallway " T " intersection when approaching from the base of the " T " .
The fire team is using the serpentine formation for movement .
The team configures into a 2 - by - 2 formation with the numbers 1 and 2 men left , and the 3 and 4 men right .
( When clearing a right - hand corner , use the left - handed firing method to minimize exposure . )
The numbers 1 and 3 men move to the edge of the corner and assume a low crouch or kneeling position .
On signal , the numbers 1 and 3 men simultaneously turn left and right , respectively .
At the same time , the numbers 2 and 4 men step forward and turn left and right , respectively maintaining their ( high ) position .
( Sectors of fire interlock and the low / high positions prevent soldiers from firing at another . )
Once the left and right portions of the hallway are clear , the fire team resumes the movement formation .
Figure 3-40 .
T - shaped hallway intersection clearing positions .
Figure 3 - 41 depicts the fire team 's actions upon reaching a hallway " T " intersection when approaching along the cross of the " T " .
The fire team is using the serpentine formation for movement .
The team configures into a modified 2 - by - 2 formation with the numbers 1 and 3 men abreast and toward the right side of the hall .
The number 2 man moves to the left side of the hall and orients to the front , and the number 4 man shifts to the right side ( his left ) and maintains rear security .
( When clearing a right - hand corner , use the left - handed firing method to minimize exposure . )
The numbers 1 and 3 men move to the edge of the corner and the number 3 man assumes a low crouch or kneeling position .
On signal , the number 3 man turns right around the corner keeping low , the number 1 man steps forward while turning to the right and staying high .
( Sectors of fire interlock and the low / high positions prevent soldiers from firing at one another . )
The numbers 2 and 4 men continue to move in the direction of travel .
As the number 2 man passes behind the number 1 man , the number 1 man shifts laterally to his left until he reaches the far corner .
The numbers 2 and 4 men continue to move in the direction of travel .
As the number 4 man passes behind the number 3 man , the number 3 man shifts laterally to his left until he reaches the far corner .
As the number 3 man begins to shift across the hall , the number 1 man turns into the direction of travel and moves to his position in the formation .
As the numbers 3 and 4 men reach the far side of the hallway , they too assume their original positions in the serpentine formation , and the fire team continues to move .
Figure 3 - 41 .
Hallway junction clearing .
Figure 3 - 41 .
Hallway junction clearing ( continued ) .
c. Clearing Stairwells and Staircases .
Stairwells and staircases are comparable to doorways in that they create a fatal funnel ; however , the danger is intensified by the three - dimensional aspect of additional landings .
The ability of the squad or team to conduct the movement depends upon which direction they are traveling and the layout of the stairs .
Regardless , the clearing technique follows a basic format :
The squad leader designates an assault element to clear the stairs .
The squad or team maintains 360 - degree , three - dimensional security in the vicinity of the stairs .
The squad leader then directs the assault team to locate , mark , bypass and or clear any obstacles or booby traps that may be blocking access to the stairs .
The assault element moves up ( or down ) the stairways by using either the two - , three - , or four - man flow technique , providing overwatch up and down the stairs while moving .
The three - man variation is preferred ( Figure 3 - 42 ) .
Figure 3 - 42 .
Three - man flow clearing technique .
3 - 26 . VERBAL COMMANDS AND SIGNALS
When conducting precision clearing , soldiers are very close to each other as they engage targets .
The high volume of noise makes communications extremely difficult .
The command and control techniques used during precision combat must consist of terms and actions that soldiers are familiar with and to which they know how to respond .
a . The use of verbal commands and signals within the assault element are extremely important .
The soldier must always let others in the assault element know where he is and what he is doing .
b.
As an example , terms similar to the ones listed in Table 3 - 2 should be a part of each soldier 's vocabulary IAW unit SOP .
TERM EXPLANATION " STATUS ! "
Signal by an element leader that requires all members to report whether their sectors are clear and if they are prepared to continue the mission .
" CLEAR ! " Signal given by individuals to report their sector is clear .
" UP ! "
Signal given by individuals to report they are ready to continue the mission ( weapon loaded , equipment accounted for ) .
" ROOM CLEAR ! "
Signal from team leader to team members , squad leader , and follow - on teams that the room is secure and cleared .
" COMING OUT ! "
Signal given by an individual or team that they are about to exit a room .
" COME OUT ! "
Reply given by security element or follow - on team that it is safe to exit the room .
" COMING IN ! "
Signal given by an individual who is about to enter an occupied room .
" COME IN ! "
Reply given by an occupant of a room stating it is safe to enter .
" COMING UP ( DOWN ) !
Signal given by an individual or team that is about to ascend or descend a stairway .
" COME UP ( DOWN ) ! "
Reply given by security element that it is safe to ascend or descend a stairway .
" MAN DOWN ! "
Signal given when an individual has been wounded or injured and cannot continue his mission .
" SHORT ROOM ! "
Signal given by either the number 1 man or the number 2 man to indicate a small room , and that all team members should not enter .
" GRENADE ! " A command given by any soldier , when an enemy grenade has been thrown .
All soldiers need to take immediate actions .
Although difficult , the soldier should identify the location of the grenade , if possible .
" GO LONG ! " A command given by one member of the team to tell another team member to take up security farther into the room or farther down a hallway .
" GUN DOWN " A signal given when an individual 's weapon has malfunctioned and is being corrected .
" GUN UP " A signal given when an individual has corrected a malfunction and is ready for action .
" RELOADING " A signal given when an individual is reloading any weapon system .
This signal is followed by " GUN UP " when ready .
Table 3 - 2 . Verbal commands and signals .
NOTE : The use of loud verbal commands may reveal to the enemy the location and immediate intent of friendly forces .
Although code words may be substituted , they can be heard and used by enemy forces if friendly forces use them too loudly .
3 - 27 . SAFETY AND FORCE PROTECTION
Precision clearing is high risk , and even training for it can be hazardous .
Only well - trained , disciplined soldiers are able to execute these techniques successfully .
a. Leaders at all levels must enforce safe handling of weapons and demolitions .
The concern that individual soldiers not be injured in accidents is essential to mission accomplishment .
Unintentional and unsafe weapons fire or detonation of explosives or munitions can jeopardize the mission of the clearing team and subsequently the entire unit .
b. Soldiers engaged in precision clearing should wear all their protective equipment .
( 1 ) Soft body armor , such as the standard Army - issue Kevlar vest , is effective in preventing death or serious injury from high - velocity fragments that strike the torso area .
Although the Kevlar protective vest is effective , flexible , and relatively comfortable , it is not designed to stop bullets .
As a rule , soft body armor stops some low - power handgun rounds but not rifle or carbine ammunition .
( 2 ) Some versions of hard body armor stops almost any round fired at it .
They tend to be heavy and stiff , but they have proven effective during precision clearing .
If a commander knows his unit is going to conduct lengthy precision room clearing , he requests a special issue of threat level III or IV protective equipment .
This equipment is excellent , but soldiers must train and rehearse wearing it before they enter combat .
All precision clearing is tiring , and soldiers wearing threat level III or IV protection tire or overheat more quickly .
( 3 ) The standard Army Kevlar helmet and ballistic protective eyeglasses have also been proven to significantly reduce casualties during precision room clearing .
( 4 ) Hard plastic knee and elbow protectors are available on special request .
They are useful , especially during prolonged search and clear operations .
They prevent injury from rubble and broken glass when kneeling or prone .
c. Detailed knowledge of weapons and munitions effects is important to the safety of members of the clearing team , as well as to mission accomplishment .
Most interior building walls do not stop rifle fire .
Fragments from grenades often penetrate interior walls .
Standard home furnishings or office furniture offer little protection from high - velocity rounds .
Excessive amounts of demolitions used to breach a wall may knock it down instead , perhaps even bring the roof of the building down also .
CAUTION
Goggles or ballistic eye protection should always be worn to protect soldiers from debris caused by explosives , tools , weapons , grenades , and so forth .
Section IV .
FIGHTING POSITIONS
Whether a unit is attacking , defending , or conducting retrograde operations , its success or failure depends on the ability of the individual soldier to place accurate fire on the enemy with the least exposure to return fire .
Consequently , the soldier must immediately seek and use firing positions properly .
3 -28 . HASTY FIGHTING POSITION
A hasty fighting position is normally occupied in the attack or the early stages of the defense .
It is a position from which the soldier can place fire upon the enemy while using available cover for protection from return fire .
The soldier may occupy it voluntarily or he may be forced to occupy it due to enemy fire .
In either case , the position lacks preparation before occupation .
Some of the more common hasty fighting positions in an urban area are : corners of buildings , behind walls , windows , unprepared loopholes , and the peak of a roof .
a. Corners of Buildings .
The soldier must be capable of firing his weapon both right - and left - handed to be effective around corners . ( 1 ) A common error made in firing around corners is firing from the wrong shoulder .
This exposes more of the soldier 's body to return fire than necessary .
By firing from the proper shoulder , the soldier can reduce exposure to enemy fire .
( 2 ) Another common mistake when firing around corners is firing from the standing position .
The soldier exposes himself at the height the enemy would expect a target to appear , and risks exposing the entire length of his body as a target for the enemy .
b. Walls .
When firing from behind walls , the soldier must fire around cover and not over it ( Figure 3 - 43 ) .
Figure 3 - 43 .
Soldier firing around cover .
c. Windows .
In an urban area , windows provide convenient firing ports .
The soldier must avoid firing from the standing position since it exposes most of his body to return fire from the enemy and could silhouette him against a light - colored interior beyond the window .
This is an obvious sign of the soldier 's position , especially at night when the muzzle flash can easily be observed .
In using the proper method of firing from a window ( Figure 3 - 44 ) , the soldier is well back into the room to prevent the muzzle flash from being seen , and he is kneeling to limit exposure and avoid silhouetting himself .
Figure 3 - 44 .
Soldier firing from window .
d. Loopholes .
The soldier may fire through a hole created in the wall and avoid windows ( Figure 3 - 45 ) .
He stays well back from the loophole so the muzzle of the weapon does not protrude beyond the wall , and the muzzle flash is concealed .
Figure 3 - 45 .
Soldier firing from loophole .
e. Roof .
The peak of a roof provides a vantage point for snipers that increases their field of vision and the ranges at which they can engage targets ( Figure 3 - 46 ) .
A chimney , a smokestack , or any other object protruding from the roof of a building can reduce the size of the target exposed and should be used .
Figure 3 - 46 .
Soldier firing from peak of a roof .
f. No Position Available .
When the soldier is subjected to enemy fire and none of the positions mentioned above are available , he must try to expose as little of himself as possible .
The soldier can reduce his exposure to the enemy by lying prone as close to a building as possible , on the same side of the open area as the enemy .
To engage the soldier , the enemy must then lean out the window and expose himself to return fire .
g. No Cover Available .
When no cover is available , the soldier can reduce exposure by firing from the prone position , by firing from shadows , and by presenting no silhouette against buildings .
3 -29 . PREPARED FIGHTING POSITION
A prepared firing position is one built or improved to allow the soldier to engage a particular area , avenue of approach , or enemy position , while reducing his exposure to return fire .
Examples of prepared positions include barricaded windows , fortified loopholes , sniper positions , antiarmor positions , and machine gun positions .
a .
The natural firing port provided by windows can be improved by barricading the window , leaving a small hole for the soldier 's use .
Materials torn from the interior walls of the building or any other available material may be used for barricading .
( 1 ) When barricading windows , avoid barricading only the windows that are going to be used as firing ports .
The enemy can soon determine that the barricaded windows are fighting positions .
( 2 ) Also avoid neat , square , or rectangular holes that are easily identified by the enemy .
A barricaded window should not have a neat , regular firing port .
The window should keep its original shape so that the position of the soldier is hard to detect .
Firing from the bottom of the window gives the soldier the advantage of the wall because the firing port is less obvious to the enemy .
Sandbags are used to reinforce the wall below the window and to increase protection for the soldier .
All glass must be removed from the window to prevent injury to the soldier .
Lace curtains permit the soldier to see out and prevent the enemy from seeing in .
Wet blankets should be placed under weapons to reduce dust .
Wire mesh over the window keeps the enemy from throwing in hand grenades .
b.
Although windows usually are good fighting positions , they do not always allow the soldier to engage targets in his sector .
( 1 ) To avoid establishing a pattern of always firing from windows , an alternate position is required such as in an interior room and firing through a rubbled outer wall ( Figure 3 - 47 ) , or a prepared loophole ( Figure 3 - 48 ) .
The prepared loophole involves cutting or blowing a small hole into the wall to allow the soldier to observe and engage targets in his sector .
Figure 3 - 47 .
Interior room position .
Figure 3 - 48 .
Prepared loophole .
(2) Sandbags are used to reinforce the walls below , around , and above the loophole ( Figure 3 - 49 ) .
Two layers of sandbags are placed on the floor under the soldier to protect him from an explosion on a lower floor ( if the position is on the second floor or higher ) .
A wall of sandbags , rubble , furniture , and so on should be constructed to the rear of the position to protect the soldier from explosions in the room . ( 3 ) A table , bedstead , or other available material can provide overhead cover for the position .
This cover prevents injury to the soldier from falling debris or explosions above his position .
Figure 3 - 49 .
Cut - away view of a sandbag reinforced position .
(4) The position should be camouflaged by knocking other holes in the wall , making it difficult for the enemy to determine which hole the fire is coming from .
Siding material should be removed from the building in several places to make loopholes less noticeable .
( 5 ) Because of the angled firing position associated with loopholes , primary and supplementary positions can be prepared using the same loophole ( Figure 3 - 50 ) .
This procedure allows the individual to shift his fire onto a sector that was not previously covered by small arms fire .
Figure 3-50 .
Loopholes with primary and supplementary positions .
c. A chimney or other protruding structure provides a base from which a sniper position can be prepared .
Part of the roofing material is removed to allow the sniper to fire around the chimney .
He should stand inside the building on the beams or on a platform with only his head and shoulders above the roof ( behind the chimney ) .
Sandbags placed on the sides of the position protect the sniper 's flanks .
d.
When the roof has no protruding structure to provide protection , the sniper position should be prepared from underneath on the enemy side of the roof ( Figure 3 - 51 ) .
The position is reinforced with sandbags , and a small piece of roofing material should be removed to allow the sniper to engage targets in his sector .
The missing piece of roofing material should be the only sign a position exists .
Other pieces of roofing should be removed to deceive the enemy as to the true sniper position .
The sniper should be invisible from outside the building and the muzzle flash must be hidden from view .
Figure 3 - 51 .
Sniper position .
e. Some considerations for selecting and occupying individual fighting positions are :
Make maximum use of available cover and concealment .
Avoid firing over cover ; when possible , fire around it .
Avoid silhouetting against light - colored buildings , the skyline , and so on .
Carefully select a new fighting position before leaving an old one .
Avoid setting a pattern ; fire from both barricaded and non-barricaded windows .
Keep exposure time to a minimum .
Begin improving your hasty position immediately after occupation .
Use construction material that is readily available in an urban area .
Remember that positions that provide cover at ground level may not provide cover on higher floors .
f . In attacking an urban area , the recoilless AT weapon and ATGM crews may be hampered in choosing firing positions due to the backblast of their weapons .
They may not have enough time to knock out walls in buildings and clear backblast areas .
They should select positions that allow the backblast to escape such as corner windows where the round fired goes out one window and the backblast escapes from another .
When conducting defensive operations the corner of a building can be improved with sandbags to create a firing position ( Figure 3 - 52 ) .
Figure 3 - 52 .
Corner firing position .
g . The rifle squad during an attack on and in defense of an urban area is often reinforced with attached antitank weapons .
The rifle squad leader must be able to choose good firing positions for the antitank weapons under his control .
h.
Various principles of employing antitank weapons have universal applications such as : making maximum use of available cover ; trying to achieve mutual support ; and allowing for the backblast when positioning recoilless weapons , TOWs , Dragons , Javelins , and AT4s .
i. Operating in an urban area presents new considerations .
Soldiers must select numerous alternate positions , particularly when the structure does not provide cover from small - arms fire .
They must position their weapons in the shadows and within the building .
j. AT4s and Javelins firing from the top of a building can use the chimney for cover ( Figure 3 - 53 ) .
The rear of this position should be reinforced with sandbags but should not interfere with backblast area .
Figure 3 - 53 .
A recoilless weapon crew firing from a rooftop .
k . When selecting firing positions for recoilless weapons and ATGMs , make maximum use of rubble , corners of buildings , and destroyed vehicles to provide cover for the crew .
Recoilless weapons and ATGMs can also be moved along rooftops to obtain a better angle to engage enemy armor .
When buildings are elevated , positions can be prepared using a building for overhead cover ( Figure 3 - 54 ) .
The backblast under the building must not damage or collapse the building or injure the crew .
See Chapter 7 .
NOTE : When firing from a slope , ensure that the angle of the launcher relative to the ground or firing platform is not greater than 20 degrees .
When firing within a building , ensure the enclosure is at least 10 feet by 15 feet , is clear of debris and loose objects , and has windows , doors , or holes in the walls for the backblast to escape .
Figure 3 - 54 .
Prepared positions using a building for overhead cover .
l . The machine gun can be emplaced almost anywhere .
In the attack , windows and doors offer ready - made firing ports ( Figure 3 - 55 ) .
For this reason , the enemy normally has windows and doors under observation and fire , which should be avoided .
Any opening in walls created during the fighting may be used .
Small explosive charges can create loopholes for machine gun positions ( Figure 3 - 56 ) .
Regardless of what openings are used , machine guns should be in the building and in the shadows .
Figure 3 - 55 .
Emplacement of machine gun in a doorway .
Figure 3 - 56 .
Use of a loophole with a machine gun .
m. Upon occupying a building , soldiers ' board up all windows and doors .
By leaving small gaps between the slots , soldiers can use windows and doors as good alternate positions .
n. Loopholes should be used extensively in the defense .
They should not be constructed in any logical pattern , nor should they all be at floor or tabletop level .
Varying their height and location makes them hard to pinpoint and identify .
Dummy loopholes , knocked off shingles , or holes cut that are not intended to be used as firing positions aid in the deception .
Loopholes located behind shrubbery , under doorjambs , and under the eaves of a building are hard to detect .
In the defense , as in the offense , a firing position can be constructed using the building for overhead cover .
o. Increased fields of fire can be obtained by locating the machine gun in the corner of the building ( Figure 3 - 57 ) , in the cellar ( Figure 3 - 58 ) , or sandbagged under a building ( Figure 3 - 59 ) .
Available materials , such as desks , overstuffed chairs , couches , and other items of furniture , should be integrated into the construction of bunkers to add cover and concealment .
Figure 3 - 57 .
Corner machine gun bunker .
Figure 3-58 .
Machine gun position in cellar .
Figure 3-59 .
Sandbagged machine gun emplacement under a building .
p. Although grazing fire is desirable when employing the machine gun , it may not always be practical or possible .
Where destroyed vehicles , rubble , and other obstructions restrict the fields of grazing fire , the gun can be elevated to where it can fire over obstacles .
Firing from loopholes on the second or third story may be necessary .
A firing platform can be built under the roof and a loophole constructed ( Figure 3- 60 ) .
Again , the exact location of the position must be concealed .
Camouflage the position by removing patches of shingles , over the entire roof .
Figure 3-60 .
Firing platform built under roof .
3-30 .
TARGET ACQUISITION
Urban areas provide unique target acquisition challenges to units .
Buildings mask movement and the effects of direct and indirect fires .
The rubble from destroyed buildings , along with the buildings themselves , provides cover and concealment for attackers and defenders , making target acquisition difficult .
Urban areas often favor the defender 's ability to acquire targets so this makes offensive target acquisition extremely important , since the side that fires first may win the engagement .
Target acquisition must be continuous , whether a unit or soldier is halted or moving .
The six steps of target acquisition , search , detection , location , identification , classification , and confirmation are no different in an urban environment than anywhere else but are usually performed at a much faster pace .
a. Search .
Using all senses during the search step enhances the detection capabilities of all soldiers on the urban battlefield .
The techniques of patrolling and using observation posts apply in urban as well as in wooded or more open terrain .
These techniques enable units to search for and locate the enemy .
Soldiers searching the urban battlefield for targets should employ target acquisition devices .
These devices can include binoculars , image intensification devices , thermal sights , ground surveillance radar ( GSR ) , remote sensors ( REMs ) , platoon early warning systems ( PEWS ) , and field expedient early warning devices .
Several types of devices should be used since no single device can meet every need of a unit .
( 1 ) Observation .
Observation duties must be clearly given to squad members to ensure 360 degrees and three - dimensional security as they move .
This security continues at the halt .
Soldiers soon recognize the sights , smells , sounds and so forth , associated with their urban battlefield and can soon distinguish targets .
( 2 ) Movement .
Stealth should be used when moving in urban areas since there are often short distances between attackers and defenders .
Hand and arm signals should be used until contact is made .
The unit should stop periodically to look and listen .
Routes should be carefully chosen so that buildings and piles of rubble can be used to mask the unit 's movement .
( 3 ) Movement Techniques .
Techniques are basically the same as in open terrain ( traveling , traveling overwatch , bounding overwatch ) .
When a unit is moving and enemy contact is likely , the unit must use a movement technique with an overwatching element .
This principle applies in urban areas as it does in other kinds of terrain except that in urban terrain , the overwatching element must observe both the upper floors of buildings and street level .
( 4 ) Observation Posts .
The military aspects of urban terrain must be considered in selecting observation posts ( OPs ) .
OPs can be positioned in the upper floors of buildings , giving soldiers a better vantage point than at street level .
Leaders should avoid selecting obvious positions , such as water towers or church steeples that attract the enemy 's attention ( Figure 3 - 61 ) .
Figure 3-61 .
Selection of OP location .
b. Detection .
Personnel , weapons , and vehicles have distinguishing signatures .
Soldiers must recognize signatures so they can acquire and identify targets .
This is extremely important in the urban battlefield , where one or more senses can be degraded .
For example , soldiers operating in an urban area where smoke is used as an obscurant will have their sense of sight degraded , since they may not be able to see through the smoke with the naked eye .
Their sense of smell and breathing is also affected .
Some considerations are :
Soldiers must look for targets in areas where they are most likely to be employed .
Squad leaders must place OPs where they are most likely to see targets .
Odors from diesel fuel , gasoline , cooking food , burning tobacco , after - shave lotion , and so forth reveal enemy and friendly locations .
Running engines , vehicles , and soldiers moving through rubble - covered streets can be heard for great distances .
Vehicles driven in urban areas produce more noise than those moving through open terrain .
Soldiers moving through rubble on a street or in the halls of a damaged building create more noise than in a wooded area .
Sounds and smells can aid in acquiring targets at night since they transmit better in the cooler , damper night air .
Dust and noise created by the firing of some weapons such as a tank main gun can be seen and smelled .
Irregularly shaped objects that do not conform to the surrounding area stand out .
Abnormal reflections or flashes from movement of optics or metal can be seen .
Voices can often be heard at long distances , with the sound reflecting off of structures .
Shadows can be seen day or night .
When scanning multistory buildings , soldiers may have to scan up as well as out ( three - dimensional scanning ) .
c. Location .
In an urban environment , determining the target location can be difficult .
The cover and concealment provided by buildings and rubble can provide the enemy with an advantage that is not easily overcome .
After the enemy is detected or contact is made , soldiers must visualize the situation from the enemy 's viewpoint .
This visualization helps the soldier determine where the likely enemy position is .
At that point , the suspected enemy position should be suppressed , consistent with the ROE .
d. Identification .
Being able to identify potential targets as quickly as possible after they are detected gives soldiers the advantage during urban combat .
As a minimum , identification must determine if the potential target is friend , foe , or , a noncombatant .
Correct identification is the key to preventing fratricide .
Soldiers must know and understand the ROE .
Soldiers must know what to engage and what not to engage .
e. Classification .
To determine an appropriate method of dealing with a target , the soldier must determine the danger it represents .
It requires quick decisions as targets are observed and occurs virtually simultaneously with identification .
Situational awareness is vitally important .
Multiple targets must be classified from most dangerous to least dangerous and engaged starting with the most dangerous .
f. Confirmation .
This rapid verification of the initial identification and classification of the target is the final step of target acquisition .
Identification , classification , and confirmation are done simultaneously .
3-31 . DEFENSE AGAINST FLAME WEAPONS AND INCENDIARY MUNITIONS
Incendiary ammunition , special weapons , and the ease with which incendiary devices can be constructed from gasoline and other flammables make fire a threat during urban operations .
During defensive operations , fighting fire should be a primary concern .
Steps must be taken to reduce the risk of a fire that could make a chosen position indefensible .
a. Soldiers should construct positions that do not have large openings .
These positions should provide as much built - in cover as possible to prevent penetration by incendiary ammunition .
All unnecessary flammable materials should be removed including ammunition boxes , furniture , rugs , newspapers , curtains , and so on .
Electricity and gas coming into the building must be shut off .
b.
A concrete block building , with concrete floors and a tin roof , is an ideal place for a position .
However , most buildings have wooden floors or subfloors , wooden rafters , and wooden inner walls , which require improvement .
Inner walls should be removed and replaced with blankets to resemble walls from the outside .
Sand should be spread 2 inches deep on floors and in attics to retard fire .
c.
All available fire - fighting gear is pre-positioned so it can be used during actual combat .
For the individual soldier such gear includes entrenching tools , helmets , sand or earth , and blankets .
These items are supplemented with fire extinguishers .
d. Fire is so destructive that it can easily overwhelm personnel regardless of precautions .
Soldiers should plan routes of withdrawal so a priority of evacuation from fighting positions can be established .
This procedure allows soldiers to exit through areas that are free from combustible material and provide cover from enemy direct fire .
e.
The confined space and large amounts of combustible material in urban areas can influence the enemy to use flame weapons or incendiary munitions .
Two major first - aid considerations are burns and smoke inhalation .
These can easily occur in buildings and render the victim combat ineffective .
Although there is little defense against flame inhalation and lack of oxygen , smoke inhalation can be reduced by wearing the individual protective mask .
Medics and combat lifesavers should be aware of the withdrawal plan and should be prepared to treat and evacuate burn and smoke inhalation casualties .
f. Offensive operations also require plans for fighting fire since the success of the mission can easily be threatened by fire .
Poorly planned use of incendiary munitions can make fires so extensive that they become obstacles to offensive operations .
The enemy may use fire to cover his withdrawal and to create obstacles and barriers to the attacker .
Intentional flame operations , in an urban area , are difficult to control and may undermine mission success .
g .
When planning offensive operations , the attacker must consider the effects of all weapons and munitions .
Targets are chosen during the initial planning to avoid accidentally destroying critical facilities within the urban area .
When planning flame operations in an urban area , priorities must be established to determine which critical installations ( hospitals , power stations , radio stations , and historical landmarks ) should have primary fire - fighting support .
h.
Every soldier participating in the attack must be ready to deal with fire .
The normal fire - fighting equipment available includes the entrenching tool , helmet ( for carrying sand or water ) , and blankets ( for snuffing out small fires ) .
3 -32 . DEFENSE AGAINST ENHANCED FLAME WEAPONS
Combat operations in Afghanistan , Chechnya , and Bosnia saw the increased use of enhanced flame weapons in an urban environment .
While these weapons have been in existence for some time , US forces have not had much experience ( after Vietman ) in the use of and defense against them .
Because future threats may use these weapons against US forces , this paragraph explains what enhanced flame weapons are and how to defend against them .
a. Enhanced Flame Weapons .
These types of weapons primarily rely on blast , flame and concussion to inflict damage , rather than explosively driven projectiles , fragments , or shaped charges .
The Russians found these weapons to be especially effective in Chechnya because they produced casualties without fragmentation and shrapnel .
As Chechens would " hug " Russian units to negate the use of Russian firepower , Russians would use directed blast weapons against enemy personnel and positions to minimize fratricide due to ricochets , shrapnel , and fragmentation .
( 1 ) Types of Enhanced Flame Weapons .
There are two types of these weapons , though their effects are the same .
Fuel air explosives ( FAE ) are the older generation of blast weapons .
FAE rely on distributing fuel in the air and igniting it .
Casualties are primarily produced by fuel exploding and burning in the air .
The newer generation blast weapons are referred to as volumetric or thermobaric .
They throw out explosives from a warhead into a larger volume and use oxygen to ignite as a single event .
This technique provides more reliable and controllable effects than FAE .
Thermobaric weapons cause a tremendous blast in a confined space , such as a room or small building — the larger the volume of the weapon , the larger the blast effect .
Many of these weapons are shoulder fired and are operated by a single gunner ( Figure 3 - 62 ) .
Some shoulder fired blast weapons have tandem warheads that consist of a shaped charge followed by a Thermobaric munition ( Figure 3- 63 ) .
Currently , there are no thermobaric weapons in the US inventory , but are under research and development as a possible replacement for the M202A2 ( Flash ) .
Figure 3 - 62 .
Russian RPO -A SHMEL , a shoulder fired thermobaric weapon .
Figure 3-63 .
Russian RShG - 1 , tandem warhead .
(2) Effects of Enhanced Flame Weapons .
These types of weapons are characterized by the production of a powerful fireball ( flame temperatures of up to 1,200 degrees centigrade ) together with a relatively long duration pressure wave .
The fireball , and its associated dust storm , damages exposed skin and eyes over a wider radius than the blast effect .
Most physical damage is caused by the heave and the push of the blast wave .
This blast wave can collapse brick or block - built structures .
Therefore , internal injuries to vital organs and internal bleeding are common blast effects to personnel .
Such weapons are particularly effective against fortified positions such as buildings .
Confined spaces enhance the blast effect and , unlike fragments , blast and flame can travel around corners and down passages such as hallways or tunnels .
Since blast pressure falls off rapidly in the open , much shorter minimum safety distances are possible and assault troops can be relatively close ( to within 40 meters depending on the size of the munition ) when many of these weapons are employed .
b. Defensive Measures .
Using materials that absorb its energy or block its path can reduce the lethality of the blast / flame wave .
The best protection is to isolate personnel from the wave ; however , this procedure may not be possible in many tactical situations .
Balance should be struck between protecting soldiers and not hampering their ability to fight or protect themselves from other threats .
The first step is to prevent the munition from entering a structure by providing a physical barrier .
If that is not possible , then the next step is to minimize damage from the weapons by weakening and isolating their effect .
Another consideration is to make enhanced flame weapon gunners ' priority targets for snipers or selected marksmen .
( 1 ) Personnel .
Personal injury can be minimized if soldiers wear a balaclava or similar garment to protect the face , goggles to protect the eyes from flash and flying dust and debris , and leather gloves to protect the hands .
( 2 ) Armored Vehicles .
If vehicles are buttoned up , the crew is protected against blast / flame damage ; however , antennas , external components , and optics suffer varying degrees of damage .
Tandem warheads pose a greater threat to armored vehicles .
c. Fighting Positions .
Fixed fortifications , such as concrete bunkers or heavy - clad framed buildings , provide good protection against enhanced flame weapons detonating near the outside of the structure .
Hastily prepared fighting positions or prepared fighting positions in lighter clad or framed buildings are more susceptible to blast effects .
Unframed masonry buildings with concrete floors should be avoided since a falling floor is likely to cause injury to personnel .
Fighting from basements or below ground positions or from prepared strong points in heavy - clad framed buildings provide additional protection .
To reduce blast effects within a structure , unused ope

Charles Lindbergh and Alexis Carrel , with their perfusion pump Flying had a strange effect on the great aviation pioneer Charles Lindbergh , leading him to team up with a French surgeon and embark on a quest for ever - lasting life ... for a chosen few .
What do you know about Charles Lindbergh ?
You probably know he was an American aviator .
He achieved overnight world stardom when he became the first person to fly non -stop across the Atlantic , solo , in 1927 .
You might also know that Lindbergh was strongly opposed to American involvement in World War II - until Pearl Harbor , after which he volunteered to fly combat missions in the Pacific .
And you might know that in later life he became a prolific author , an explorer and an environmentalist .
But did you know that he was also a machine - obsessed inventor , who entered into a macabre alliance with a French - born surgeon to try to achieve immortality ?
Forget aviation hero .
On the side , Lindbergh was a Dr Frankenstein figure , who used his mechanical genius to explore the possibility of conquering death - but only for the select few who were considered " worthy " of living forever .
" Beating death was something he thought about his entire life " , says David M Friedman , American author of the new book The Immortalists .
" Even as a small child , he could n't accept that people had to die .
He would ask : ' Why do you have to die to get to heaven ? ' "
Machine - enabled people Friedman's
The Immortalists relates the untold story of Lindbergh 's frequently bizarre efforts to cheat death by creating machines that might sustain human life .
Lindberg and his monoplane which flew from New York to Paris
In the 1930s , after his historic flight over the Atlantic , Lindbergh hooked up with Alexis Carrel , a brilliant surgeon born in France but who worked in a laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan .
Carrel - who was a mystic as well as a scientist - had already won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering work on the transplantation of blood vessels .
But his real dream was a future in which the human body would become , in Friedman 's words , " a machine with constantly reparable or replaceable parts " .
This is where Lindbergh entered the frame .
Carrel hoped that his own scientific nous combined with Lindbergh 's machine - making proficiency ( Lindbergh had , after all , already helped design a plane that flew non-stop to Paris ) would make his fantasy about immortal machine - enabled human beings a reality .
" Both of their needs were met in this rather strange relationship " , says Friedman .
" Carrel benefited from Lindbergh 's mechanical genius and inventiveness , and for Lindbergh - well , Carrel became the most important person in his life , effectively steering the way he viewed the world and the people who lived in it . "
At the Rockefeller lab , Lindbergh and Carrel - almost like a real - life Jekyll and Hyde double act - made some extraordinary breakthroughs .
Lindbergh created something that Carrel 's team had singularly failed to : a perfusion pump that could keep a human organ alive outside of the body .
It was called the " Model T " pump .
In later years , Lindbergh 's pump was further developed by others , eventually leading to the construction of the first heart - lung machine .
Eugenics " Some people , even academics and science students , are still shocked when they hear about the contribution that the aviator Lindbergh made to developing life - saving cardiac machinery , " says Friedman .
As a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality - he had had a god - like experience
David M Friedman
But there was a serious downside to what Friedman refers to as Lindbergh and Carrel 's " daring quest " to live forever .
Carrel was a eugenicist with fascistic leanings .
He believed the world was split into superior and inferior beings , and hoped that science would allow the superior - which included himself and Lindbergh , of course - to dominate and eventually weed out the inferiors .
He thought the planet was " encumbered " with people who " should be dead " , including " the weak , the diseased , and the fools " .
Something like Lindbergh 's pump was not intended to help the many , but the few .
Lindbergh himself sympathised with the Nazis .
" I would n't say Lindbergh was the philosophical partner of Himmler or Hitler , " says Friedman .
" But yes , he certainly admired the order , science and technology of Nazi Germany - and the idea of creating an ethnically pure race . "
Friedman says Lindbergh considered himself a " superior being " .
" Let 's not forget that , as a pilot , he felt he had escaped the chains of mortality .
He had had a god - like experience .
He flew amongst the clouds , often in a cockpit that was open to the elements .
Flying was such a rare experience back then .
In taking to the skies , he did something humans have dreamt of for centuries .
So it is perhaps not surprising that he ended up trying to play god in a laboratory . "
Ethical ever - lasting life Even contemporary transhumanists - the name given to those who want to extend human longevity and possibly conquer death - are surprised to hear about Lindbergh 's contribution to machine - assisted life .
Alexis Carrel 's quest for ever - lasting life goes on , but is now more ' ethical ' " I never knew that " , says Nick Bostrom , director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University and President of the World Transhumanism Association .
For Bostrom and his colleagues , aware that some people think transhumanism is the same thing as eugenics , the key today is the " ethical use of technology to extend human capabilities " .
" There are many ways we have used science and technology effectively to ' cheat death ' " , says Bostrom , " whether it 's through antibiotics , organ transplantation , or even lightning rods to deflect electrical currents from the sky .
You know , when they were first invented some people said it was ' playing god ' to try to deal with lightning in this way . "
Bostrom believes that reversing the ageing process , or at least using stem cell therapy to slow down the negative effects of ageing , should be " the next frontier " in medical science .
" But it should be for the benefit of everyone and it should be done ethically - somewhat different to what Lindbergh got up to " , he argues .
Stuart Derbyshire , a leading expert in pain based at the University of Birmingham , says it is certainly " desirable to live a long and healthy life " - but from Lindbergh 's experiments to today 's ethical question for longevity , he says there is also a " troubling " side to the " quest to live forever " .
" Any life , long or short , is only worthwhile if it is lived towards some purpose .
The zealous pursuit of health and longevity can too easily become a substitute for real purpose .
" Health itself becomes a quasi- religious crusade against the old sins of the flesh - gluttony , sloth , lust - with all the attendant odious associations of physical impairment or disease with moral turpitude or a bad life . "
His implication is clear - while Lindbergh and Carrel 's quest had all the hallmarks of Nazi - promoted eugenics , it 's perhaps impossible to separate the pursuit of ever - lasting life with notions of supremacy .
The Immortalists by David M Friedman is published in the UK by JR Books on 16 June .
Below is a selection of your comments .
There is a trend towards human immortality that is almost inevitable .
The research being done in cybernetics , stem cell regeneration , genetics etc ... all lend themselves to fulfilling the quest for longer lives .
Already humans have extended their biological capabilities with technology , and the next move will be towards embedding this technology in ourselves ( nano - robots , wireless sensor networks , brain interfaces for our technology ) .
After that it is a sure march towards immortality .
Humans are still evolving , and the next stage will be through our technology rather than through our biology .
Dennis , Galway , Ireland
This article focuses on " ethical " .
Ethical can be achieved only in limited groups .
What is ethical in spending a million dollars to save a person 's life in the Western World , sometimes a life left without quality , when $ 30 / month could save from salvation a fully productive person in a poor country .
Even if we do n't want to admit it , there is no perfect ethical way .
Andrew Valachi , Otawa , Canada
" Any life , long or short , is only worthwhile if it is lived towards some purpose .
The zealous pursuit of health and longevity can too easily become a substitute for real purpose " ... says a critic of Transhumanism .
That itself is a pretty elitist view of the ' deserving ' .
Most people do n't have some grand ' purpose ' - they just want to get on with living and muddling through .
dirk bruere , bedford Although Lindbergh may have influenced the design of his airplane , particularly size and capacities of fuel storage , I believe it was actually built by the Ryan Aircraft Co .
Bill Kilgore , Tombstone , USA
Odd that the author writes an article about Lindbergh and death without once mentioning what was called the " Crime of the Century . "
Lindbergh 's first son was abducted and killed at age 20 months .
Greta Warren , Battle Creek , Michigan
Yet another vulgar attempt to slander a great American thinker .
Certain types have never forgiven him for opposing Roosevelt 's campaign to get the US involved in WWII , which turned out to be a disaster , as Communist armies marched half - way across Europe and impose sixty years of backwardness and oppression .
denis ,
Even if contemporary transhumanists " say " they are looking to help all of humankind .
The first beneficiaries of the technology will , de facto , be the wealthy .
AIDS is now a deadly disease to the world 's poor mostly .

Mohammad Abtahi : " The current conservative opposition to the vice presidential choice is in fact an attempt to convince the President that somehow without their presence , it would have been impossible for him to obtain a huge victory in the election . "
Roger Cohen : " It was precisely emotion , and notions of good and evil , that the Obama administration had spent the previous months trying to drain from the charged U.S. - Iranian relationship . "
This Wave is already in uncharted waters for the Islamic Republic , and I doubt any of us have the map to indicate where it goes .
More food for thought on Sunday .
The website Mowjcamp , associated with Mir Hossein Mousavi , has claimed that “ a few high - ranking prominent clergymen of Qom are applying pressure upon Khamenei in order to induce him to accept the protests of the public and clergy and abandon his support of Ahmadinejad ” .
1 ) Can Khamenei really rely on the “ foreign menace ” to maintain the support of most of the Iranian population , especially if that means a political showdown with a Rafsanjani or a Mousavi ? ; 2 ) How far can the call to “ morality ” take precedence over the specific concerns over the Iranian system during and after the system ?

At the same time that he supposedly accepted the “ two - state ” peace process , his carefully - framed speech — for the moment — made it disappear .
“ Talks with Iran are not a reward for good behavior ; they ’re only a consequence if the President makes the judgement that it ’s in the best interests of the United States of America …. to talk to the Iranian regime .

Enduring America ’s Chris Emery on BBC News 24 on Saturday , giving one of the first reactions in Britain to the unfolding events in Iran ....
" The priorities of the Obama administration are also still the same .
Resolving the Israel - Palestine conflict means Iran cannot be pushed to the forefront as the immediate challenge .
And in the longer term , the demands on the US from Afghanistan and Central Asia to relations with the wider Islamic world still mean that engagement is the preferred alternative .
Irrespective of the outcome of the presidential election in Iran , there is no reason to suggest these will not be potentially effective strategies . "

On the eve of today ’s elections , Presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi spoke with Al Jazeera .

President Obama ’s envoy to the Middle East , George Mitchell , visited Israeli leaders on Tuesday and again established why he is an outstanding diplomat .

Wednesday ’s election debate between Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and one of his challengers , Mir Hossein Mousavi , is still sending ripples through and outside Iran .
Given the US delay in moving its Embassy , how does Benjamin Netanyahu — facing a difficult position in his Cabinet and with Israeli public opinion — respond ?
It may be less than 48 hours since the Obama speech , but the US and Israel are already manoeuvring — and testing each other — over Palestine .
Perhaps the most striking response to President Obama 's speech is coming from Hamas officials , who are cautiously signalling that they are ready for discussions .
The wars may have ostensibly ended in Gaza and Sri Lanka , but the conflicts and hardships continue .
As hundreds of thousands of residents languish in detention camps or endure a protracted siege , British medics trying to help also find themselves hindered — and worse — by Government officials .

And so the paradox of Cairo : at the end of Obama ’s hour , his exaltation of values across faiths comes to Earth in those buildings in East Jerusalem and across the West Bank .

Enduring America's Final Projection : Obama 338 , McCain 200
More than a dozen overnight polls have settled in a remarkably narrow range of a lead of about 7 points for Obama - Biden .
If they are on the mark , Obama has not only checked McCain ’s fight - back of the last week but has slightly widened his advantage .
In light of this national trend and — more importantly — early voting patterns and state polls , Enduring America is now putting Florida back in the Democratic camp .

48 Hours to Go : Despite Republican Scare Tactics , Obama Secure
It ’s a sign of the new politics that 72 hours away from a computer offers not only an old - fashioned but distorted view of the Presidential campaign .
Relying in a Dublin flat on Sky News ’s rolling Saturday morning news - loop , I could reduce the race to The Terminator Comes Out for McCain .
That dramatic headline was followed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger rallying the GOP faithful , and probably more than a few star - spotters , with : “ I played an action hero .
But John McCain is a real American action hero . ”
( And , oh yes , Barack Obama is a girly - man , or something to that effect )
Like a DVD that will never eject , Arnie repeated the theatrics every 30 minutes .
So did the Sky reporters , preferring screengrabs like “ Lipstick Chicks for Palin ” and keeping any meaningful analysis in check .
For example , why did n’t Schwarzenegger come out in California weeks ago for Big John McCain instead of popping up as a last - minute guest in Ohio ?
Could it be that the Governor , even in his second term , was n’t going to risk his political image at home , linking himself for more than a moment with a struggling campaign ?
And what does it say for the Republicans when their Presidential candidate becomes no more than a flailing second - string actor — “ Senator Obama is going to take more than a trillion dollars from you in taxes ” — behind the star introducing him ?
Most importantly , take note of the guide to political and property success : Location , Location , Location .
The Republican star event was in Ohio , as Obama was whipping up the crowds in Indiana .
Translation ?
While McCain was having to play for a must - win state for the GOP , his opponent had the luxury of trying to snare a swing state that is far from critical for Democratic hopes .
So , even in this analytic backwater , a bit of insight was possible .
Sky kept trying to whip up the drama for its coverage — they have their own “ White House ” in Florida for Election Night ! — with the headline reading that McCain was now slightly ahead in Indiana and Missouri .
In this race , that ’s the equivalent of a 90th - minute goal when you ’re 4 - 0 down ( or , for my brother - in - law , the 4th - quarter touchdown for the University of Georgia so it only lost 49 - 10 rather than 49 - 3 to arch- rvial Florida ) .
Safe in cyber - land this morning , I can confirm : for all the Schwarzenegger - aided attempt at sound and fury , little has changed .
McCain - Palin are still around seven points down ( and no closer than four points in any poll ) in their Hail Mary target of Pennsylvania .
Meanwhile , here ’s the checklist on the states , held by the Republicans in 2004 , that the Democrats could take — Obama - Biden need only a maximum of three of these and , in some cases , one to get to the White House :
Florida : Democrats up 2.5
Ohio : Democrats up 5.1
Virginia : Democrats up 6.5
North Carolina : Democrats up 1.9
Indiana : Republicans up 0.2
Missouri : Democrats up 0.6
Colorado : Democrats up 7.0
Nevada : Democrats up 4.9
New Mexico : Democrats up 11.6
And that does n’t even count the real surprises that have come into play : RealClearPolitics — which seems more intent than FiveThirty Eight on hedging its bets has added to the toss - up column McCain ’s home state of Arizona to Montana , North Dakota , and Georgia ( my devout Republican brother - in - law is having a very bad weekend ) and has moved Arkansas — deep redneck Arkansas ! — into the “ leaning ” rather than “ solid ” Republican category .
I think those new supposed battlegrounds are just a bit of bonus news for the Democrats .
Indeed , I ’m still playing the conservative hand of McCain - Palin holding Missouri , Indiana , and North Carolina .
But that ’s no change on Obama 338 , Big John 200 in the final electoral count .
( For what it ’s worth , RealClearPolitics is tapping into Enduring America ’s oracle powers — with the exception of giving North Carolina to Obama - Palin , it ’s in line with this projection . )
Here ’s the latest smoke signals of Republicans burning in desperation .
Once their charge that Obama - Biden were Marxists was rebuffed by Barack ’s classic , “ According to Senator McCain , I must be a Communist because I shared my toys in kindergarten ” , they reached for a last handful of mud with Obama - hangs - out - with - extremists .
The bad guy in this scenario was Columbia University Professor Rashid Khalidi , author of numerous books on the Middle East and US foreign policy .
I ’ve had the fortune of not only reading but listening to Khalidi ’s academic presentations .
He is engaging , challenging , and forthright .
He is critical of US policy towards the Middle East and Washington ’s support for Israel .
Twinning that with the fact that Khalidi is Palestinian to make the charge of “ anti- Semitic ” is a slur and no more .
However , even granting Khalidi as an imminent danger to mankind and thus making Obama — who has supported Khalidi ’s work in Palestine — an appeaser of anti-Semitism , the Republican strategy has a couple of flaws .
Such as forgetting that the International Republican Institute , led by one John McCain , gave more than $ 400,000 to Khalidi ’s group .
Such as putting up this McCain campaign worker to prove that Obama hung out with devoted enemies of Israel ( hat - tip to Juan Cole ) … .

Election Projection : The Latest Reading of the Campaign
It appears some hearts are a - flutterin ’ today at the prospect that the Presidential race on November 4 may not be over by bedtime on the East Coast of the US , let alone here in Britain .
Four of the eight new national polls ( Rasmussen , Gallup Traditional , IBD / TIPP , and GWU / Battleground ) , including two of the three with the largest samples , have Obama only up three points on McCain .
This quicker heartbeat is n’t just the symptom of a broadcast media hoping for more drama ( and ratings ) approching that of 2000 and 2004 .
Some colleagues , both in Britain and the US , are thinking that the Democrats — for all their spending and push for voter registration — have n’t solidified their voting base .
All the same , I have to be a bit of a party pooper .
The issue is not that those “ other ” polls ( including the Gallup Expanded , which is more likely than the Traditional to be relevant in a year of high voter turnout ) have Obama with a steady 5 - 7 point lead .
Let ’s even set aside that FiveThirty Eight.com , comprehensive and by far the shrewdest assessor of what polls can and can’t indicate , has the gap still holding at just under 6 percent .
To paraphrase Brother Bill Clinton ’s folks , it ’s the states , stupid .
And there is little movement towards McCain in the nine battleground states ( Florida , Ohio , North Carolina , Virginia , Indiana , Missouri , Colorado , New Mexico , Nevada ) that will decide this contest .
Yes , he has closed to level - pegging with Obama in Missouri and he ’s only 1 1/2 points out in Indiana .
It ’s a minor yes — even with Missouri and Indiana in his column , which we projected on Monday , the Republicans are more than 130 electoral votes adrift .
If anything , the unexpected shifts today are away from the Republicans .
RealClearPolitics , for example , has excitedly moved Georgia — yep , the red- state Georgia where my relatives live — into the toss - up column .
I hasten to add that the other top sites , including FiveThirtyEight , still have the Peach State firmly Republican — it appears that RCP has made its move because of one poll that has Obama down only a point and on the basis of strong early voting returns in Georgia in favour of the Democrats .
That last point is important , however , not necessarily for Georgia but for other states .
FiveThirtyEight has noted an unprecedented early turnout .
In the states of Louisiana , Georgia , and North Carolina , the early returns already exceed 2004 totals .
And , just as important , that surge is favouring Obama .
The trend is n’t just at state level .
In key counties in Ohio , the pivot state of 2004 , early returns are two to three times the entire 2004 turnout .
If Obama is performing as well in those returns as in the state , his lead would be more than enough to wipe out the narrow deficit that defeated John Kerry in Ohio in 2004 .
That ’s a big if , of course , as it assumes that all other things will be equal on Election Day .
Of course , McCain could surprise me with an unexpected surge .
Of course , there may be some truth to the legend of the “ Bradley effect ” , with declared Democratic voters suddenly turning Republican as they enter the voting booth .
But “ may ” does n’t translate into likely .
A friend sounded off earlier this evening that pollsters do n’t seem to be mentioning “ margin of error ” in their reporting of samples — given that the margin for even a medium - sized poll is 3 percent either way , it could more than wipe out Obama ’s putative lead in key states .
It ’s a fair point , but when you match up an accumulation of polls with readings of other factors from organisation to high voter registration for the Democrats to the early voting patterns , the case for an Obama victory — and an early victory — on 4 November continues to be close to open - and - shut .

Election Talk : The Campaign and The Races in the Senate
States of Play
To paraphrase Saturday Night Live ’s classic 1970s sketch on General Francisco Franco , “ The McCain - Palin campaign is stubbornly clinging to death . ”
There are no significant shifts in likely state outcomes from Monday .
RealClearPolitics has only two changes .
New Hampshire is back in play , i.e. , “ leaning ” rather than “ solid ” Democratics , primarily on the basis of two polls that have Obama only 4 - 5 points up vs. previous readings of 7 - 15 points .
The problem here is that , in such a small state , polling samples can be quite volatile .
Even if New Hampshire is now up for grabs , with 4 electoral votes , it ’s not a key player despite all the “ as New Hampshire goes , so goes the United States ” clichés .
Much more fun is Arizona --- that ’s right , Big John ’s home patch --- moving into “ leaning ” rather than “ solid ” Republican .
It ’s a mirror image of New Hampshire , with a 21 - point poll gap suddenly coming down to 5 - 8 .
Again , I do n’t think the state will shift on 4 November although , as FiveThirty Eight shrewdly notes , the spillover effect from Obama ’s rally in Arizona is that it bolsters his position in neighbouring New Mexico .
No changes on FiveThirtyEight , which keeps both Arizona and New Hampshire safe for the respective favourites .
Reading the state polls , however , they now have McCain down to a 3 % chance of triumphing on Election Day .
Just for Comparison
In case you ’re suspicious of a pro-Obama bias here , Watching America is a bit more cautious on his prospects than either FiveThirty Eight or RealClearPolitics .
Our 338-200 prediction matches up with 351- 187 on FiveThirtyEight and an Obama landslide of 375 - 163 on RCP .
Turning to Congress
We ’ll try and do a full run-down on both the Senate and House before next Tuesday , particularly as they have been largely overlooked by the British media ( Anne Applebaum ’s column in the Daily Telegraph is today ’s exception ) .
Here ’s a snapshot of a quite interesting year for Senate contests , which features a convicted felon ( Republican Ted Stevens of Alaska , found guilty yesterday on seven counts of violating Federal ethics laws ) , a comedian / best - selling writer ( Democrat Al Franken of Minnesota ) , former Cabinet member ( Republican Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina ) , and several long - serving Republicans in the fights of their electoral lives .
The current Senate is balanced at 49 - 49 between the two parties , although the Independents Joseph Lieberman and Bernie Sanders are with the Democratic Caucus ( in the case of Lieberman , very “ technically ” with the Democratic Caucus ) .
However , with the “ Bush effect ” kicking in big- time , an Election Day bonanza for the Democrats is possible .
There are 35 races this year ( because of the six - year term of Senators , only one - third come back to the voters in every two - year electoral cycle ) .
The 2002 success of the Republicans now turns against them , as only 12 of the seats are held by Democrats .
More importantly , all of those Democratic seats are safe .
In contrast , no less than eleven of the Republican seats are now vulnerable , including --- in a late turnaround at the polls --- that of the Republican leader in the Senate , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky .
In a country where an incumbent Senator used to be only at risk if he is found naked in a park , is outed by his mistress , or “ does a Stevens ” and gets jail time , this level of vulnerability is extraordinary .
This , however , is no ordinary year .
In three of the Republican seats , the incumbent is not standing .
Those can be handed to the Democrats ( Mark Warner in Virginia , Mark Udall in Colorado , Tom Udall in New Mexico ) right now .
In New Hampshire , incumbent Republican John Sununu has been trailing former Governor Jeanne Shaheen by about nine points
In Oregon , incumbent Republican Gordon Smith is trying to claw back a four - point deficit to Jeff Merkley with a clever tactic : he ’s claiming common ground with Barack Obama in the hope that Oregonians , who lead the nation in their disapproval of George W. Bush , will see him as a bridge - builder with the next President .
Three other seats should have been safe Republican holds but , in the last few weeks , have suddenly turned into real electoral races .
Roger Wicker is down to a 1 - 2 point lead in some polls in Mississippi .
Saxby Chambliss in Georgia , who got into the Senate in 2002 thanks to an atrocious smear campaign by Bush ’s political spinners against the Vietnam veteran Max Cleland , is only two points up .
And Republican Senate leader McConnell now finds he is only a couple of points ahead in Kentucky .
It makes for interesting viewing ( and , for partisan Democrats , hopes of a night comparable to the 1997 Labour thrashing of the Tories in Britain ) , but all three races should stay with the Republicans .
That leaves three Senate races in the balance .
In a race which , for politicos with no other life , has been fascinating train - wreck viewing , Elizabeth Dole in North Carolina has been tumbling against Kay Hagan --- she ’s now two points down and can be marked as the underdog .
In Alaska , Felon Ted Stevens is now one point behind Mark Begich --- FiveThirtyEight is confident that the Democrats will take the seat but Stevens now only has the look and morals but also the rising - from - the - dead quality of a vampire .
Last but definitely not least , in the race which may capture the essence of the last seven Bush years , Al Franken --- Saturday Night Live member and author of books such “ Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot ” and “ Lies and the Liars Who Tell Them ” --- has come from way back to a realistic shot of unseating Republican Norm Coleman , best known for getting his political backside handed to him when he questioned George Galloway over Iraq .
This seat was held by the Democrat Paul Wellstone , one of the finest persons ever to serve in Congress , until he died just before the 2002 election , so it has a special resonance for activists .
How do the numbers work out ?
At a maximum , the Democrats will be up 60 - 38 ( with two Independents ) in the new Senate but a more realistic “ high hope ” is a 57 - 41 split ( if Hagan , Begich , and Franken triumph ) .
In practical terms , that is n’t an overwhelming turn of fortunes in the Congress .
The media ’s one grasp of this is that the Democrats get a “ lock ” on the Senate if they have 60 seats , as they can prevent another Republican filibuster to block legislation .
That , however , is a relatively minor consideration , testimony less to political reality than to the fact that Jimmy Stewart and the movie Mr Smith Goes to Washington still defines the Congress for some onlookers .
What is clear , however , is that the Democrats do n’t need Joe Lieberman anymore to ensure a majority .
So they solidify their hold on Committee chairmanships and key posts .
More importantly , a gain of eight seats for the Democrats will be a powerful symbol in its own right , complementing that of an Obama Change .
After close to a generation of supposed defining of American values by the Republicans --- from Ronald Reagan to little Bush --- the other party has the chance to take responsibility .
Whether it does , in a meaningful rather than rhetorical way , will do a lot to answer the question of “ What is America ? ” for those of us outside the United States .

Your State - by - State Snapshot of the 2008 Election
Eight mornings to go before Indecision Day , as the Daily Show would call it , and last week ’s analysis ( Watching America , 23 October ) is holding up well .
There might well be a party on 4 November but there wo n’t be much drama .
Surprisingly --- well , surprising to me because it seems to be a forlorn strategy --- the media line that McCain - Palin were going to gamble on turning Pennsylvania Republican seems to have borne out over the weekend .
Unsurprisingly , the Democrats countered by upping their presence in the state , with Obama attending rallies in Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania suburbs this week .
Obama - Biden are still up between 11 and 13 points in the latest state polls .
The more important story , picked up by the New York Times this AM , is the desperate attempt of the Republicans to hold onto “ their ” states from 2004 : “ Mr. McCain and his running mate , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , are planning to spend most of their time in Florida , Ohio , Virginia , North Carolina , Missouri , and Indiana . ”
That ’s significant because those are six of the 10 Republican - held swing states that we identified on Thursday .
What ’s even more significant is that even a Republican miracle in these states wo n’t be enough : there ’s an indication here that the Republicans do n’t have the resources to defend Colorado , New Mexico , and Nevada --- a Democratic victory in Colorado plus one of the other two means a President Obama ( barring a surprise McCain win in Pennsylvania ) .
The broader weekend spin was McCain ’s Braveheart call to his troops , insisting , “ We ’re going to win ” and claiming that Obama and Co. are already treating the election as won .
It ’s a shrewd if expected move , trying to win over floating voters with the impression of an overconfident , even arrogant Democratic campaign .
However , in the equally shrewd and expected counter - move , the Democrats are putting out the message that “ it ai n’t over until it ’s over ” and no one should expect an easy walk to the White House .
My reading is that McCain will close the national gap slightly over the next week .
Underdogs often do so in the last phase of a campaign ( Ford v. Carter ’ 76 , Bush v. Clinton ’ 92 as examples ) .
That will be a token gain , however --- McCain may cling on to a couple of states where he ’s slightly behind , but there is no way that he pulls out the “ Hail Mary ” of modern US politics and takes himself and the Hockey Mom to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue .
I wo n’t be putting my final picks into the office pools until next Monday , but here ’s a snapshot of the likely scenario .
Remember that 270 electoral votes are needed for victory .
SAFE DEMOCRATIC STATES ( 20 and Washington D.C --- 259 electoral votes ) : I wo n’t list them all but this includes Michigan , Minnesota , and Wisconsin , where the Republicans had hopes of wins , and …
Pennsylvania ( 21 votes ) : Sorry , Big John .
There ’s not much hope in the appeal to that mythical working - class , white multitude in “ western Pennsylvania ” to come out in force to stop Obama .
Any bump in those areas will be more than offset by big Democratic margins in the urban areas .
SAFE REPUBLICAN STATES ( 19 --- 157 electoral votes ) :
The fragment of good news for the GOP is that Georgia and West Virginia , which should never have been in doubt , have been shored up in recent days .
The fun story , if it ’s borne out in the next week , is that Obama is closing the gap in McCain ’s home state of Arizona , but I think that ’s just a bit of electoral froth and mischief .
THE 11 STATES IN PLAY ( 122 electoral votes ) : From largest to smallest …
Florida ( 27 votes ) : Obama ’s up by just over two points here , a margin which could easily be overturned by the Republicans .
Normally I would expect the diehard GOP folks to bring this back to McCain - Palin but memories of 2000 are a force here .
The Democrats will want Florida big - time not only to lock down the election but as in - your - face statement to those they think took the Presidency from them eight years ago .
A nail - biter but …
Obama - Biden
Ohio ( 20 votes ) : Obama ’s up 4 - 6 points and the 2000 / 2004 “ bump ” is in play here as well .
This was the decisive state four years ago and , discounting the theory that is still about that the Republicans stole the state , the Democrats think they should have made sure of the Buckeye State last time .
This time …
Obama - Biden
North Carolina ( 15 votes ) : Obama ’s up a point in the polls .
This is one of those places where I expect a late Republican push to make a difference --- a big turnout in the rural areas may make a difference .
Remember , this used to be the state of the late Jesse Helms , the spectre of parochial , xenophobic Republicanism .
McCain - Palin
Virginia ( 13 votes ) : Looking back on it , maybe the key state in this campaign .
Republican for the last generation but , with its mix of rural areas and affluent suburbs , increasingly up for grabs --- in contrast to North Carolina to the south , not as definable in working - class , white terms .
Swung early in the campaign towards the Democrats and Obama ’s now up 6 - 7 points .
Obama - Biden
Missouri ( 11 votes ) : See North Carolina ---
Obama ’s up a point but McCain ’s small bounce - back this week may take this one back into the Republican column .
Still , I would n’t put the house --- or even my children --- on the outcome here .
McCain-Palin
Indiana ( 11 votes ) :
The first vote to watch on Election Night , as it reports back just after 10 p.m. British time .
If it goes for Obama , Democrat parties can already swing .
Obama ’s lead is whisker - thin , though .
This state was such a Republican lock in 2000 and 2004 that , disappointing my colleague “ Canuckistan ” , have to call it …
McCain-Palin
Colorado ( 9 votes ) : Obama up 6 - 7 points .
In a state balanced between big -city liberals , Christian fire - breathers , and rural whites , it ’s the liberals who have been better - organised .
No surprise that Obama made an appearance in Denver this week to get the party started .
Obama - Biden
New Mexico ( 5 votes ) : Obama has steadily gained in the last month , turning a toss - up into an 8 - 9 point lead .
Somebody sometime is going to figure out the US Southwest has never been a die - hard “ Red State ” area , particularly with Hispanic voters drifting away from the Republicans .
Obama - Biden
Nevada ( 5 votes ) :
The real surprise for those of us who have always lumped it with arch - conservative Utah .
Enough swing voters --- by class and education , if not race --- to make this possible hunting ground for the Democrats .
The local organization has converted the opportunity --- Obama ’s up 2 - 3 points .
Obama - Biden
North Dakota and Montana ( 3 votes each ) : Should never have been in doubt .
Even listing them here is a sign of how McCain - Palin have crumbled since early October .

Grand Delusions : From McCain ’s Defeat to “ Victory ” in Iraq
Amidst this week ’s rationalizations by numerous Republicans of John McCain ’s forthcoming defeat , one in particular is especially tragic .
Michael Gerson , who once wrote speeches for President George W. Bush , explains that McCain will lose the election because he --- and Gerson --- were right about the surge in Iraq whereas Barack Obama is completely wrong .
Forget , for the moment , that Gerson ’s explanation ignores what happened in Iraq between 2003 and 2007 in the aftermath of the war he supported .
Gerson is flat - out wrong on what is happening in Iraq , wrong not only in description but in what is likely to happen in Iraq in forthcoming months .

Tales from the Presidential Campaign
Election Talk : The Republican Alamo
Some Republicans were talking up a slight bump in the polls this weekend for McCain - Palin --- translation : instead of being 5 - 6 points down in national surveys , they were " only " 4 - 5 points down .
FiveThirtyEight.com , excellent as always , put this in perspective by noting that to overhaul Obama , McCain would have to keep picking up a half - point each day , every day to the election .
There 's a more important point , however : at this point , it 's not a question of the national poll but the numbers in each " swing " state .
So , to get to the nitty - gritty , McCain 's limited national gain plays out at state level with a movement back to him in places like West Virginia and Indiana , which now lean back to the Republicans .
These states , however , should never have been in question --- at least in any scenario where the GOP has a chance of winning --- they should have been " safe " .
So , to be blunt , McCain is only clawing back a bit of his lost territory .
Contrast this with the important " swing " areas .
McCain - Palin - in my humble opinion - have no hope of taking any state that went Democratic in 2004 .
In three states which were seen as possible Republican gains only a month ago --- Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota -- Obama is up 10 - 12 points in polling .
That means McCain has to hold all but two ( and possibly all but one ) states that Bush took four years ago .
But in eight of these , McCain is trailing by a clear margin in three ( Virginia , Colorado , New Mexico ) and down 2 - 4 points in five ( Missouri , North Carolina , Nevada , Florida , and Ohio ) .
And this does n't even include Indiana and , bizarrely , North Dakota which could still be in play .
The media line over the last 48 hours is that the Republicans may make a last grandstand effort by throwing resources into Pennsylvania to pray that state away from the Democrats .
If true , this is either desperation or mad genius , as Obama is up 11 points in latest polling .
More likely is the scenario that the Republicans are going to the Alamo - a last , frantic defense to keep the eight states listed above .
But there are tales that they have given up on Colorado , which means it comes down to clinging onto the other seven .
Possible ?
In a politics of " never say never " , sure .
But you do know what happened to the defenders of the Alamo .
Election Talk : The Backfire of the Culture Wars
The immediate furour over Colin Powell 's weekend endorsement of Barack Obama missed a key dimension of the reasons for his decision .
The issue was not just Obama 's " proving himself " or , conversely , the inexperience and weaknesses of Sarah Palin but the Republican strategy of pitting " good Americans " against others :
Now , I understand what politics is all about .
I know how you can go after one another , and that 's good .
But I think this goes too far .... I'm also troubled by , not what Senator McCain says , but what members of the party say .
And it is permitted to be said such things as , " Well , you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim . "
Well , the correct answer is , he is not a Muslim , he 's a Christian .
He 's always been a Christian .
But the really right answer is , what if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ?
The answer 's no , that 's not America .
Is there something wrong with some seven - year - old Muslim - American kid believing that he or she could be president ?
Yet , I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion , " He 's a Muslim and he might be associated terrorists . "
This is not the way we should be doing it in America .
I feel strongly about this particular point because of a picture I saw in a magazine .
It was a photo essay about troops who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan .
And one picture at the tail end of this photo essay was of a mother in Arlington Cemetery , and she had her head on the headstone of her son 's grave .
And as the picture focused in , you could see the writing on the headstone .
And it gave his awards -- Purple Heart , Bronze Star - - showed that he died in Iraq , gave his date of birth , date of death .
He was 20 years old .
And then , at the very top of the headstone , it did n't have a Christian cross , it did n't have the Star of David , it had crescent and a star of the Islamic faith .
And his name was Kareem Rashad Sultan Khan , and he was an American .
He was born in New Jersey .
He was 14 years old at the time of 9/11 , and he waited until he can go serve his country , and he gave his life .
I still Powell has a lot to answer for , notably his failure to stand up to others in the Bush Administration and stop the mad quest for executive power and a war in Iraq , but I think his words should be a prominent reply to the political poison of " us " v. " them " , a poison which has not only threatened electoral politics but wreaked havoc in the name of US foreign policy .
And there are other encouraging signs .
Sarah Palin has finally apologised -- well , kind of - for her praise of " pro-American " parts of the United States ( presumably those favouring the Republicans ) and implication that other areas were just a bit suspect .
Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann 's call for her colleagues to be investigated and classifed by the media as " pro-American " and " anti-American " has given a boost to her opponent both in finances and polling .
American fingers crossed that this continues .
Election Talk : McCain's Fightback ---
An Unexpected Endorsement
" Al - Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming election , " said a commentary posted Monday on the extremist Web site al - Hesbah , which is closely linked to the terrorist group .
It said the Arizona Republican would continue the " failing march of his predecessor , " President Bush .

Tuesday Buffet : Obama , Khomeini , and the Chavez - McDonald 's War
A Footnote to the Election Talk : The Sublime ....
I neglected to say in Monday 's Buffet that , in contrast to some of the media witterings over the Colin Powell endorsement , Juan Cole 's detailed reading is almost as effective as the former Secretary of State 's simultaneous promotion of the Democrats and demolition of McCain - Palin .
A reader , noting the Cole column , helpfully adds that Powell 's endorsement is just as valuable in offsetting Obama 's supposed weaknesses , namely , his lack of foreign policy experience , as it is in pushing Obama 's positives to uncommitted voters .
And The Ridiculous : Barack Obama --- The Next Ayatollah Khomeini
A reader points us to Baron Boddissey 's Islam - bashing website Gates of Vienna .
There you can find this masterpiece , " Understanding Obama : The Making of a Fuehrer " :
I must confess I was not impressed by Sen. Barack Obama from the first time I saw him .
At first I was It is surreal to see the level of hysteria in his admirers .
This phenomenon is unprecedented in American politics .
Women scream and swoon during his speeches .
They yell and shout to Obama , “ I love you . ”
Never did George Washington , Abraham Lincoln , Franklin Roosevelt .
Martin Luther King Jr. or Ronald Reagan arouse so much raw emotion .
Despite their achievements , none of them was raised to the rank of Messiah .
The Illinois senator has no history of service to the country .
He has done nothing outstanding except giving promises of change and hyping his audience with hope .
It ’s only his words , not his achievements that is causing this much uproar .
When cheering for someone turns into adulation , something is wrong .
Excessive adulation is indicative of a personality cult .... During 1979 , when the Iranians were tired of the dictatorial regime of the late Shah , they embraced Khomeini , not because they wanted Islam , but because he promised them change .
The word in the street was , “ anything is better than the Shah . ”
They found their error when it was too late ....
Listening to Obama … it harkens back to when I was younger and I used to watch Khomeini , how he would excite the crowd and they ’d come to their feet and scream and yell .
And the Surreal : " I Can See Russia in My Name "
" Publius " notes Monday 's story in The Times of London , " I Can Live with Defeat , Says McCain " , and comments , " In the guise of America 's " who cares who came second " , to talk about defeat tells me his internal polling is really bad news . "
Sprinkling a bit of salt on the wound , he takes on McCain 's declaration that " Mr Obama was seeking to buy the election with his massive fundraising and spending " with the rejoinder , " The chutzpah of ' Obama 's buying the election ' when McCain did not avail himself of McCain - Feingold , the law [ on campaign finance reform that ] he championed , is just too much . "
However , it is Publius 's afterthought that concerns me , either for his well - being or that of America under GOP leadership : " If the name of McCain 's VP is spelled S. Palin , try removing the P and inserting a T . "
Saying the Unsayable ?
The US and Iran
Flynt Leverett , who handled Middle Eastern affairs for the National Security Council , and Hillary Mann Leverett , a National Security Council staffer who was involved in the " unofficial " dialogue with Iran over Afghanistan between 2001 and 2003 , propose a US - Iranian " Grand Bargain " .
Contending that " as a result of a dysfunctional Iran policy , among other foreign policy blunders , the American position in the region is currently under greater strain than at any point since the end of the Cold War " , they argue :
It is clearly time for a fundamental change of course in the U.S. approach to the Islamic Republic .
By fundamental change , we do not mean incremental , step - by - step engagement with Tehran , or simply trying to manage the Iranian challenge in the region more adroitly than the Bush administration has done .
Rather , we mean the pursuit of thoroughgoing strategic rapprochement between the two nations .
Update : Hugo Chavez v. Ronald McDonald
A reader from Alabama offers this nostalgic reflection on the Venezuelan Government 's temporary shutdown of McDonald 's outlets :
In 1989 there was a general strike in Venezuela .
Really eerie to have the entire city absolutely silent on a weekday -- the only traffic were occasional security vehicles .
I played city editor from home because we were allowed only a certain number of workers -- two reporters and photographers or something like that -- until after daytime working hours .
McDonald 's and , I believe , certain banks were just about the only ones to remain open in defiance of the strike .
The banks I understood because of bankers ' political beliefs , but McDonald 's was n't making any friends .
Remember , though , that McDonald 's at least then was a relatively pricey meal there .
Goon squads ... er , labor committees made sure people stayed closed and ended up at one of the McD 's in Caracas .
A garbage can ended up going through the plate glass and , by the end of the day , there was a tank and soldiers in the parking lot protecting the restaurant .
Very weird .
McD 's in Caracas , unlike Burger King or Tropi Burger , was different than your normal fast - food experience .
It always was spotless , the food fast and fresh .
And the wholesome kids who worked there -- it was like stepping into a television ad !
You expected them to break out into song .
Clearly , pay must have been decent and upwardly mobile student - types were their main counter help ( janitorial , of course , was another story ) .
They were probably all the Venezuelan equivalent of the College Republican Club and the Future Business Leaders of America .
Anyway , McDonald 's always was crowded .
Before and after the strike .

Monday Buffet : From the US Elections to New Old Cold Wars
A General 's Endorsement I must admit Colin Powell 's ringing call , made on the flagship Sunday TV programme Meet the Press , surprised me .
I was particularly shocked by his remark , " I was ... concerned at the selection of Governor Palin .... Now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks , I do n't believe she 's ready to be president of the United States . "
However , Watching America can now reveal the reason behind the former Secretary of State 's decision to back Obama .
Last week Powell appeared with Palin on the legendary US game show " The $ 800 Billion ( formerly $ 25,000 ) Pyramid " .
Watching America has obtained an exclusive clip .
Funtime with Colin
This morning 's Today programme on BBC radio added a needed giggle to the serious political events .
First , just after 6 a.m. , our favourite US correspondent Justin Webb offered the insight that Powell 's endorsement might be " marginal " because many right - wing Republicans distrusted the former General and added that many Democrats who opposed the Iraq War might not be persuaded because of Powell 's role in the Bush Administration .
Well done , Justin !
Right - wing Republicans would n't vote for Obama - Biden if Todd Palin , George W. Bush , and the Lord Jesus endorsed the Democrats , and any anti-war Democrat is highly unlikely to be backing the GOP .
The groups to watch , of course , are moderate Republicans who are unhappy with their Presidential ticket and the sizeable group of " independent " voters who will likely be decisive in this contest .
The anchor of Today , James Naughtie , righted the BBC ship with an entertaining grilling of Emily Walker , a Republican spokeswoman who gave a dismissive wave of her hand to Powell 's statement .
She explained that his words " would not change the direction of this campaign " .
Quite right --- as Naughtie pointed out in a subsequent question , the polls are always running away from the Republicans .
President Obama : Will It Make a Difference ?
Readers have pointed Watching America to two excellent but divergent views of the next Administration .
Mark Danner seizes optimism from the last eight years of despair , " It is the very unpopularity of Bush and the atmosphere of profound disillusion and crisis that helped produce a Democratic challenger whose election — however remarkable his talents , however stirring his eloquence , however bright his promise — would constitute a true revolution . "
Mike Davis , however , worries that the Obama team may just follow its predecessor into the abyss : " It is bitterly ironic , but , I suppose , historically predictable that a presidential campaign millions of voters have supported for its promise to end the war in Iraq has now mortgaged itself to a " tougher than McCain " escalation of a hopeless conflict in Afghanistan and the Pakistani tribal frontier .
In the best of outcomes , the Democrats will merely trade one brutal , losing war for another .
In the worst case , their failed policies may set the stage for the return of Cheney and Rove , or their even more sinister avatars . "
It 's the New Old Cold War ( Chapter 438 ) Far from content with several Wars on Terror / Iraq / Afghanistan , Strategic Forecasting reaches back for an earlier Battle to the End of Time .
( This , of course , is entirely unconnected from the suspicision that Stratfor tries to pick at least $ 99 a year from your pocket by making you very , very worried . )
Conveniently re-framing the link of Saddam Hussein to terrorism , Reva Bhalla puts the Kremlin in the seat of Master Planner Wanting to Kill All of Us : " The potential revival of Russian state - sponsored terrorism is most likely still early in its development .
But one should not forget that after the Cold War , many experts proclaimed a ' New World Order ' in which terrorism had become a thing of the past — and U.S. intelligence capabilities atrophied as a result .
About a decade later , the 9/11 attacks caught the United States off guard and brought into being a new era of Islamist terrorism that is only now declining .
With state - sponsored terrorism back on the horizon , the time has come to recognize the changing face of terrorism beyond the post - 9/11 world . "
Mentioning Bhalla 's analysis is a convenient way to welcome back our old friend John Bolton , who is also finding solace --- amidst the " appeasement " of Iran , North Korea , Venezuela , etc. --- in a new old campaign : " Ultimately , what most risks " provoking " Moscow is not Western resolve but Western weakness .
This is where the real weight of history lies .
Accordingly , attitude adjustment in Moscow first requires attitude adjustment in NATO capitals , and quickly , before Moscow 's swaggering leaders draw the wrong lessons from their recent successes .... Such an approach will not endanger Western security but enhance it .
And if Russia takes offense , better to know that now than later , when the stakes for all concerned may be much higher . "

Friday Buffet : From the Campaign Trail to Iraq
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WATCH-LIST
Four Signs That This Race is Over
1. Joe the Plumber Goes Down the Drain
On Wednesday night , John McCain 's economic shtick was that he was the President who would look out for " Joe the Plumber " , a working - class fella from Ohio who apparently would not be able to buy his business under Barack Obama 's tax proposals .
JoeWurzelbacher instantly became the newest celebrity of Campaign 2008 .
Unfortunately for McCain , the New York Times became more than a fan :
Mr. Wurzelbacher had never held a plumber ’s license , which is required in Toledo and several surrounding municipalities ....
His full name is Samuel J. Wurzelbacher .
And he owes back taxes , too , public records show .
The premise of his complaint to Mr. Obama about taxes may also be flawed , according to tax analysts .
Contrary to what Mr. Wurzelbacher asserted and Mr. McCain echoed , neither his personal taxes nor those of the business where he works are likely to rise if Mr. Obama ’s tax plan were to go into effect , they said .
[ OTHER FAMOUS JOES WHO COULD SAVE MCCAIN : Joe Pesci , Joe Louis , Joe and the Volcano , Joe Mama , Joe 90 , and ( hat tip to Liam Kennedy ) Joe Soap ]
2 . One Last Wild Cultural Swing Following on from the " Culture Wars " theme : FiveThirty Eight.com took the line , immediately after the debate , that McCain lost his early advantage in the debate when he took a pop at Congressman John Lewis of Georgia .
A man I admire and respect -- I 've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis , an American hero , made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history , segregation , deaths of children in church bombings , George Wallace .
That , to me , was so hurtful .
And , Senator Obama , you did n't repudiate those remarks .
So , the issue is not that the McCain - Palin rhetoric with their question , " Who is Barack Obama ? " and the answer , " Palling around with terrorists .... This is not a man who sees America like you and I see America , ” , was prompting crowd responses of " traitor " and " terrorist ... kill him " .
Instead , it 's Big John who is the victim ?
Hmmm ....
Here 's what Lewis , one of the leaders of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement , actually wrote :
What I am seeing reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history .
Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse . "
George Wallace [ segregationist Governor of Alabama and Presidential candidate in 1968 and 1972 ] never threw a bomb .
He never fired a gun , but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise
their constitutional rights .
Because of this atmosphere of hate , four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham , Alabama .
Well , the way I read it , Lewis was not accusing McCain and Palin of the crimes of the 1960s .
Instead , he was warning that character attacks on Obama with the clear message that he is " un-American " and the ( unstated ) reminder that he is a black un-American are not exactly conductive to good - neighbourly relations .
If the language was over the political line ( and the Obama campaign quickly pointed this out ) , Lewis ' allegation does n't stand up to the Republicans ' own guilt - by - association tactics .
It 's not my reading that matters , however , but the reaction of the American public .
And , judging by the hysteria coming from Charles Krauthammer in the Washington Post , the GOP 's last cultural gambit --- please vote for us because we 've been terribly wronged --- has failed .
2A .
One Last Wild Cultural Swing --- UPDATE Charles Krauthammer fades away screaming as Saturday Night Live features " the crazy McCain - Palin Rally Lady " .
3 . The First Swallows of the Electoral Autumn Leave aside the snap polls that showed --- even on Fox --- Obama " winning " the debate by a 2:1 margin amongst undecideds .
FiveThirtyEight.com has some dramatic numbers on Obama 's margins in five states allowing early voting : % Voting Early Margin amongst Early Voters Margin in Polls New Mexico 10 % Obama + 23 % Obama +6 %
Ohio 12 % Obama +18 % Obama +4 %
Georgia 18 % Obama +6 % McCain +11 %
Iowa 14 % Obama +34 % Obama +10 %
North Carolina 5 % Obama +34 % McCain +5 %
Even if you pop a couple of grains of salt on these numbers , say , that pro-Obama folks are quicker to get to the mailbox , Obama 's lead --- even in what should be " safe " Republican state of Georgia and North Carolina , which McCain has to win to have any hope --- is ominous if you 're a Big John backer .
4 . Crossing to the Other Side The Times of London --- that 's right , the staunch defender of Thatcherism in the 1980s , flagship newspaper of Rupert Murdoch --- endorses Obama .
( By the way , so did the Washington Post . )
A Necessary Correction
JM writes from London :
" As a fervent reader of your Journal , I must complain about the glaring omission in the Sarah Palin Flowchart ( Watching America , 16 October ) .
You forgot THE WINK that tells the fellow travellers that ' I 've got this one right ' and the rest of us , ' What am I doing here ? ' "
Happy to set the record straight , JM .
Consider the flowchart amended with a special SP wink aimed straight at you .
TODAY'S IRAQ CELEBRATIONS
Michael Gerson , former Bush speechwriter ( and thus one of the scribblers behind the American adventure in Iraq ) , is the latest columnist to give General / King David Petraeus a big kiss :
Petraeus may be uniquely capable of convincing our friends in the region of America 's long - term commitment , precisely because he did n't leave Iraq to its fate -- because he is the man who stayed .
In the Times of London , Richard Beeston has the classic line , " Without the distractions of the bombings and shootings , it is easier to see Iraq for what it really is . "
Which is bit like asking , " Apart from the shooting , Mrs Lincoln , how did you like the play ? "

US Presidential Debate : The Anti-Climax
There was a 3rd presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain last night .
And , before that , there was the Main Event .
My thanks to Steve Hewitt , who organised the Election Roundtable at the University of Birmingham yesterday , and to David Dunn and Mark McClelland , who joined me on the panel .
It was 90 minutes of wide - ranging discussion --- fun , sometimes sparky , and I thought informative --- which covered not only the campaign but also what might come next with a President Obama or a President McCain .
The consensus was that it would be a President Obama .
Everyone agreed that the key moment in the campaign was the emergence of the economic crisis , although one of us held out the prospect that --- with a stabilised stock market --- McCain might be able to rebound with attention on Obama 's weaknesses and an appeal to the American middle ground .
What was of more interest to me , however , at least with respect to what happens up to 4 November , was discussion of the role of " culture wars " in this election .
I hasten to add that does n't mean a return to the hallowed Hockey Mom ground of Sarah Palin , who barely made an appearance in the discussion .
Instead , it was a lively consideration of whether the Republicans ' invocation of a battle against extremism , elitism and liberalism , including ( clearly stated ) shadings of " working class " and ( unstated ) shadings of race , had been and would be of significance in the next three weeks .
I have to admit that I played sceptic in these exchanges , repeating my line that in this economic situation " Green Trumps Black and White " .
And , with apologies to the audience and panellists , I lost my cool when the discussion turned to whether it was legitimate for McCain to tag Obama as an extremist because of his association with his former pastor , the Reverend Jeremiah Wright , who was featured earlier this year for his " anti-American " views ,
Those exchanges were illuminating , however .
It 's not just a case of whether " culture wars " lose their impact when people are more worried about their mortgages and jobs .
On concrete issues of culture , let 's say , that of same - sex relationships , I do n't see the political mileage in promoting conflict .
For all the polarising effects of talk radio and outlets like Fox News , I think in much of America there is a live - and - let - live tolerance that was not evident even a decade ago .
Note , for example , that McCain - Palin have n't pushed hard on issues like abortion , stem - cell research , and immigration .
The advantage of shoring up their electoral base is likely to be outweighed by losing voters in the " center " .
Instead , the culture war is an abstract one against bogeymen of a leftist media , do - gooder community organisers , former terrorists , the ( unstated ) dangerous blacks , and foreigners .
This aspect of the Roundtable came back to me this morning when reflecting on the McCain - Obama debate .
The media headline is that an " aggressive " McCain went after an Obama who tried to appear in control and " presidential " .
Fair enough , but McCain 's aggression on the culture issue was staged to the point of half - heartedness .
He had to be invited by the moderator to go after Obama 's alleged dangerous associations , for example , with former Weather Underground member / current academic and community organiser Wiliam Ayers .
Even then , he hesitated .
It was only a couple of minutes later that he seemed to think , " I better have a go , " and came out with this :
Yes , real quick .
Mr. Ayers , I do n't care about an old washed - up terrorist .
But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you , we need to know the full extent of that relationship .
We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama 's relationship with ACORN , who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy .
The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $ 832,000 for " lighting and site selection . "
So all of these things need to be examined , of course .
Desperation does n't begin to capture McCain 's stab into the dangerous dark .
One last go at tying Obama to " terrorism " is followed by a more detailed reference to a community organisation which has been pursuing voter registration --- inevitably , given its community position , of folks more likely to vote for the Democrats than the Republicans .
Even if most , or even some , Americans have enough knowledge of ACORN to care , it 's a weak allegation .
As happens with most registration efforts , there are registrations of false names , for example , because of canvassers who get paid per voter and thus pad their lists .
Few of these false names translate into " fake " voters who make it into the booths on Election Day ( a fact backed up by the non-appearance of these false names in early voting in several states ) .
The headline in the Independent of London pretty much summed up that last Republican tactic : " Obama Stretches Poll Lead as Mickey Mouse Joins Fray " .
( And I 've got to add this .
For Republicans to be clinging to voter - padding and election - jiggling tactics after 2000 is pot frantically painting kettle black . )
What is intriguing that McCain 's attempt seems to have flopped miserably .
CNN 's focus group of undecideds turned their dials to " negative " during the passage , and the exit polls --- to the extent that they can be trusted --- indicate that Obama outperformed Big John , especially amongst " floating " voters .
Which , I think , puts this debate into the category of Anti-Climax rather than Surprise Twist .
And , as folks noted yesterday , that means the huge questions are not what happens before 4 November but afterwards .
More on that in days to come ....

Lest We Forget : The Bush Administration and Torture
From this morning 's Washington Post : " The Bush administration issued a pair of secret memos to the CIA in 2003 and 2004 that explicitly endorsed the agency 's use of interrogation techniques such as waterboarding against al - Qaeda suspects -- documents prompted by worries among intelligence officials about a possible backlash if details of the program became public . "
Joby Warrick 's front - page story offers a narrative of how an Administration --- all high - level members of the Administration , including the President --- sanctioned torture .
Not only did they sanction it , they did so repeatedly .
Justice Department lawyers such as John Yoo provided the " legal " rationale in 2002 .
The subsequent memoranda were produced because of the worries of Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet that his officers were still exposed , either to criminal prosecution or as scapegoats for the Administration , if the programmes of " coercive interrogation " were exposed .
Tenet 's second request for legal cover came in June 2004 , two months after the disclosure of the abuses of detainees at Abu Ghraib in Iraq .
Warrick 's article , however , is far from original in its disclosures .
Indeed , the reporter leaves out key details .
By coincidence , yesterday I was reading the section in Barton Gellman 's Angler disclosing the key official behind the authorisation for torture : Vice President Dick Cheney .
Within days of 9 - 11 , Cheney --- primarily through his assistant David Addington --- was seeking the legal rationale to avoid any adherence to the Geneva Conventions and thus to permit the widest possible range of interrogation techniques .
By keeping other officials ( including Secretary of State Powell , National Security Advisor Rice , and Attorney General Ashcroft ) in the dark and using Addington 's bullying tactics , Cheney got the Executive Order necessary to implement the policy .
He presented it to President Bush , who signed it in November 2001 , and then ensured that it was processed before any other high - ranking advisor could object .
The Justice Department 's memos of 2002 , more than eagerly provided by John Yoo , only put the gloss on Cheney 's precedent - setting decisions .
It gives pause for reflection that , amidst other stories of economic crisis and Presidential campaigns , Warrick 's piece will probably be seen as " history " .
Its revelations still demand a contemporary answer .
How did an American government , in the name of " freedom " and " democracy " , sanction these activities ?
The demand for that answer should never be given up .
By coincidence , the book After Bush is being formally launched in London today .
Amongst its many egregious errors , distortions , and distractions --- all in the service of " proving " that George W. Bush has established a legacy in the conduct of US foreign policy , one which should be exalted and continued --- is this sentence : " ' Prisoner abuses ’ were aberrations --- recurrent in every war --- rather than the logical consequence of the authority under which Bush acted . ”
These were abuses --- without the quote marks .
They were not aberrations .
They were not just the logical outcomes , they were the intended outcomes of a policy developed from September 2001 by the Bush Administration , led by a Vice President dedicated to the expansion of his personal power and that of the Executive , supported by second - level officials like John
Yoo happy to promote their own perversions of legality , and abetted by colleagues from Condoleezza Rice to Colin Powell to George Tenet who were either too cowed to fight back or too intent on covering their own backsides .
Any attempt to pretend otherwise , that we can just whisk away torture as a silly little aberration , is a disgrace to those of us who believe that " America " should stand for something beyond the expedient and the power - hungry .

It 's as easy as stringing a few words together in a soundbite .
While We 're Playing Games with the Vice - Presidency
In a tribute to the wonders of both American politics and 1970s US game shows , Sarah Palin makes a guest appearance on the $ 800 Billion ( former $ 10,000 ) Pyramid .
The Award for Fastest 180 - Degree Turn by a Political Guru
Sunday , 5 October : William Kristol showcases the political strategy of Sarah Palin :
Palin also made clear that she was eager for the McCain - Palin campaign to be more aggressive in helping the American people understand “ who the real Barack Obama is . ”
Part of who Obama is , she said , has to do with his past associations , such as with the former bomber Bill Ayers .
Palin had raised the topic of Ayers Saturday on the campaign trail , and she maintained to me that Obama , who ’s minimized his relationship with Ayers , “ has n’t been wholly truthful ” about this .
I pointed out that Obama surely had a closer connection to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright than to Ayers — and so , I asked , if Ayers is a legitimate issue , what about Reverend Wright ?
She did n’t hesitate : “ To tell you the truth , Bill , I do n’t know why that association is n’t discussed more , because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country , and to have sat in the pews for 20 years and listened to that — with , I do n’t know , a sense of condoning it , I guess , because he did n’t get up and leave — to me , that does say something about character .
But , you know , I guess that would be a John McCain call on whether he wants to bring that up . ” ...
She paused , and I was about to thank her for the interview , but she had one more thing to say .
“ Only maybe I ’d add just a couple more words , and that would be : ‘ Take the gloves off . ’ ”
Sunday , 12 October : William Kristol comments on the campaign approach of Sarah Palin and John McCain :
Right now Obama ’s approval / disapproval rating is better than McCain’s .
Indeed , Obama ’s is a bit higher than it was a month ago .
That suggests the failure of the McCain campaign ’s attacks on Obama .
So drop them .

Now It 's War : Hugo Chavez v. Ronald McDonald
From the New York Times : " The Venezuelan government ordered nearly all McDonald ’s restaurants in the country closed for two days last week for what it called irregularities in the chain ’s financial books .
The government ’s tax agency said Friday that it had ordered more than 100 McDonald ’s restaurants to shut temporarily .
José David Cabello , the agency ’s chief , announced on state television that “ inconsistencies ” had been found in sales and purchases books , as well as in taxes collected . "
According to my informants , the US military response is likely to include not only the Marines but also the Hamburglar ( working for Blackwater , Inc. ) , while Mayor McCheese will be joining President Bush 's War Cabinet .
It is still to be confirmed whether the US will supplement conventional operation with the chemical warfare of Hot Apple Pies .

Your 10 - Minute Guide to the Economic Crisis :
" Whatever Is Necessary , For as Long as Necessary "
So my father calls up and says , " What do you think is happening with this economy ? "
That 's when I knew the situation was serious .
So I got a lesson in all things financial , including swaps and derivatives , from my wife to figure out the following :
1. Capitalist systems are built on faith that money is good , so economic crises are crises of confidence .
If banks or mortgage companies stop believing that they will get repaid , then they stop lending to each other and to us .
When they do , a crisis of confidence because a very real crisis of no liquidity in the system .
2 . The trigger for this crisis was the amount of " bad " mortgage debt that accumulated .
Because of " swaps " , not only the original lender but secondary lenders ( who in effect took over the mortgage , swapping for it with money given to the original lender ) ran into trouble on their books .
When enough lenders --- not just " sub - prime " ones but the big ones in the industry --- fought themselves in this position , then the bubble of debt - financed growth burst .
3 . Because Britain has the highest percentage of home ownership in Europe and is a key financial / lending centre , then it finds itself at the centre of the crisis , perhaps the most important player outside the United States .
And that 's why the British government has decided to move aggressively , in effect part - nationalising large banks this morning .
4. Besides buying Prime Minister Gordon Brown his political life , the British Government has bought itself some time .
The question : can it rebuild enough confidence in the system to withstand the recession that is going to hit soon ?
5. Second question : has the British Government taken the essential step that the US Government has refused to accept ?
Put another way , with a nod to Paul Krugman of the New York Times , has the US tied itself so firmly to a " private " , case - by - case solution --- the latest measure being a quiet US Government guarantee for a Japanese buy - out of Morgan Stanley --- that it has tied its hands in solving the confidence / liquidity crisis ?

Friday Buffet : Things That Make you go Mmmm
Eternal Progress
There is a philiosophical / mathematical concept called the Paradox of Xeno's Arrow , in which the arrow perpetually approaches its target but never reaches it .
Welcome to the 21st - century variant in US foreign policy : the Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq .
We have been told for close to two years that this arrangement , which in no way is a legitimation of the US occupation ( and which in no way is a treaty , otherwise the US Congress would actually have to give its approval ) , is near .
But , though it gets closer and closer , the agreement is never signed .
US Secretary of State Condi Rice was even in Baghdad this summer to put the ink on the paper but had to go away empty - handed because of " bureaucratic reasons " .
So , on Wednesday , this from Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zubari as he sat next to US Ambassador John Negroponte , " We are very close to a satisfactory result . "
You think ?
Given that the Iraqi Parliament still can't agree on provincial elections across the country or an oil law and given that the Iraqi Parliament ( unlike its US counterpart ) has to be consulted , I think more weight should be put on Zubari 's wishful call for " bold political decisions " .
Translation ?
The US Government will not agree to any Iraqi political or judicial oversight of the actions of the US military , which means the price of this agreement is a pretty sizeable chunk of the sovereignty of a " liberated " Iraq .
Commander - in - Chief Petraeus
This from Reuters " US Army General David Petraeus said on Tuesday that security gains in Iraq are increasingly durable but warned that the methods which helped reduce violence there may not work in Afghanistan . "
Would - be President Obama , take note , because you 've got a rival for command of US military strategy .
Petraeus ' statement translates as Surge in Iraq , No Surge in Afghanistan .
That 's not only a warning shot for Obama and his declaration that the fight for Afghanistan will define US foreign policy in 2009 but also to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates .
I 'm increasingly thinking that , in this electoral campaign , the most effective politician is the one sitting with four stars on his shoulder in Baghdad .
Today 's Palinwatch
Publius , a reader from London , replies with appropriate reverence , to " The " Radicals " Take Over the White House ! " ( 8 October ) :
" Palin is ..... beyond the Palin !
What occurs to me is that Bob Dylan got it right when he wrote : ' You do n't need a Weatherman to tell which way the wind blows . '
" I have bought a bumper sticker which reads , ' Republicans : You 're Fired ' .
I am sure you 're right .
Mccain is toast . "
Move Along ,
It 's Just a Coincidence
The New York Times on Sunday : " Reports Link Karzai's Brother to Afghanistan Heroin Trade "
The BBC on Wednesday : " The Afghan president 's brother sat with former Taleban leaders at a religious meal hosted by the Saudi King Abdullah last month .
The meeting is regarded as a possible prelude to talks between the Afghan government and the Islamic movement . "
So a case of good ol ' free - market drug economics bringing together former enemies or good ol ' American " information " to stave off any negotiations with the Taliban ?
The Final Word on Billy Joel
Replying to " Watching America 's Culture Debate of the Day " ( 8 October ) , a reader from Birmingham has tracked down the official story of " Scenes from an Italian Restaurant " :
" In 1982 , I met Billy Joel through a friend who worked with one of the producers on " The Stranger " ( He calls himself " Bill " ) .
I asked Billy about this song and he told me it was actually three songs --- rather , unfinished pieces of three songs .
He tied them all together into the medley we all love today as an homage to the B side of Abbey Road .
The song , as Billy himself told me , is based LOOSELY on some High School chums of his , not the King and Queen of the prom ( that was just some added flair he said ) , but lovers who had a passionate relationship that fizzled after real - life set in .
He continued to say that the song is about how we are changed by time , circumstance , and love ; and also about how we adapt to those changes as we get older and our own circumstances change around us .
These words are from the man himself . "
In our opinion , however , the last word on this 1970s cultural memory has come from a reader in Leicester :
" Scenes from an Italian Restaurant is rubbish .
It does n't matter if you stripped down the production it would still be a really generic , impersonal - sounding song that has no right to be upbeat in the middle section , a fact that only highlights that it 's actually two songs badly spot - welded together .
And the only thing that dates it to the 70s is the fact that it was written by an ageing babyboomer known for whining about how things were better when he was in high school and America was great and Kennedy was still alive . "

It 's Almost Official : The " Radicals " Take Over the White House !
[ Apologies to anyone who sees triumphalism in the headline .
But the Red Sox beat the Angels in Game 5 of the Baseball Division Series --- a " quarter - final " for you Brits who do n't appreciate the finer sports --- and Tina Fey is becoming a comedy demi-goddess with her takeover of Sarah Palin .
So , all in all , a great week for culture if a dodgy one for politics and , oh yeah , the economy . ]
I noticed the story a couple of weeks ago and then , with the financial crisis kicking off , filed it away .
It was irritating , as another example of distortion and name - calling masquerading as news , but I did n't think it would have much of a shelf life .
This morning , I returned to that headline in the 23 September issue of the Wall Street Journal .
This purported investigative journalism concerns the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , a foundation supporting educational initiatives in the city or , as the story frames it , " pour[ing ] more than $ 100 million into the hands of community organizers and radical education activists " .
It so happens that Barack Obama was a board member of the CAC from 1995 to 2001 .
However , the main point of Stanley Kurtz 's article is not to critique Obama 's approach to education , which apparently focuses more " on political consciousness , Afrocentricity and bilingualism than traditi ] onal education " .
Instead , it is to tie Obama , once and for all , to the radical menace named William Ayers .
Ayers , a teacher and community organiser , was a founder of the political movement Weather Underground in the 1960s .
The " Weathermen " adopted violent methods in the early 1970s , including a series of bombings between 1969 and 1975 .
Although he was never convicted on criminal charges , Ayers was a fugitive until 1980 .
He subsequently returned to education , becoming a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago and serving on a series of community educational projects .
Now , since Barack Obama did n't even show up in Chicago until the mid-1980s , it 's a bit of a stretch to make him an honorary Weatherman / terrorist .
So Kurtz 's strategy is to argue , " for Ayers , teaching and his 1960s radicalism are two sides of the same coin " .
That , in turn , makes the CAC is " infusing students and their parents with a radical political commitment " .
Which mean Obama is " lending moral and financial support to Mr. Ayers and his radical circle " .
One could , with the same series of leaps across times , politics , and social activism , claim that Chicago Mayor Richard Daley Jr. , who supported the CAC , is also an accomplice in this support of radicalism .
The Annenberg Foundation , the legacy of the media magnate Walter Annenberg , becomes the funder not of education , but of terrorism and incredible evil .
Why spend valuable time replaying Kurtz 's allegations rather than , say , discussing last night 's Presidential debate between McCain and Obama ?
Well , because the real contribution of the Wall Street Journal in this case is not to journalism but to a political funeral .
So long , John .
And Sarah .
The media line has been that the McCain campaign turned to the Big Negative this weekend when Vice - Presidential candidate Sarah Palin labelled Obama as " someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists " .
She added , via the increasingly - frantic William Kristol that it would be nice if someone mentioned Obama 's relationship with the Reverend Jeremiah Wright : " I do n’t know why that association is n’t discussed more , because those were appalling things that that pastor had said about our great country . "
However , Kurtz 's piece , published before the first Presidential and Vice - Presidential debates , makes it clear that the McCain - Palin camp and their media supporters have never let go of the demonising , guilt - by - association strategy .
It 's just that , while the Republicans thought they had a good shot at victory , these stories would just be filtered --- not so loudly , but just as insidiously --- through the coverage and chit - chat about the election .
The last gasp of that approach came last Thursday when Palin played nice in the debate with Joe Biden .
She set aside the swipes at radical and extremists in favour of the " aw shucks " smile - and - wink appeal to the American public .
When it became clear in the following 48 hours that Palin had n't turned around the polls or the media focus , the Hockey Mom start swinging her mean stick again .
Ain't gonna work .
In the opening stages of a campaign , playing nasty with guilt - by - association --- as the elder Bush did in 1988 against Michael Dukakis or the younger Bush did in the 2000 primaries against McCain --- can give you a valuable advantage .
That depends , however , on no other " critical " issues emerging and taking over the campaign agenda .
Forgive my repetition , but economy , economy , economy is now the name of this electoral game .
( In an unguarded moment , a McCain advisor admitted this over the weekend . )
Which is why you can file away last night 's debate in the Makes No Difference folder .
The Palin tactic of " I 'm not going to answer that question , instead I 'm going to talk about ... " was n't possible for Big John .
There was never a chance that McCain could respond to a question like " How would you respond to the worsening situation in the stock markets and the financial sector " with the reply , " My opponent Barack is a raving socialist who will take down the entire economic system and turn your children into Commie radicals . "
No possibility of leaping from " What do you think of the downturn in a place like Wisconsin ? " to " Wow , did you know that Bill Ayers --- a neighbour of my opponent --- once fire - bombed the University of Wisconsin ? "
It 's a somewhat bizarre and not - too - uplifting note , but let 's note it anyway ....
Seems that , when the economy is collapsing , folks do n't have time for good ol ' culture wars .

You ( and probably John McCain ) Have Just Been Barack Roll'd
I 'm teaching in Dublin today .
So , in advance of an Election Special on Wednesday , here 's a treat from the happy marriage of politics and culture .
Students have told me of a phenomenon called Rick Rolling , which must be good as it has propelled 1980s music legend Rick Astley into the cultural spotlight .
While many are now trying to seize upon Rick Rolling for their own worthy / dubious ends , it seems the Democratic candidate for President may have outdone them all ....

Iraq and Afghanistan : Can We Just Declare Victory and Go Home ?
OK , I give .
Can we just call it a draw on the " victory of the Iraq surge " story ?
Never mind that suicide bombings are still a regular occurrence .
Forget the political violence and assassinations , which continue if on a reduced level from the worst days of 2006 .
Do n't give a thought to the border issues , with Turkey attacking areas in Kurdistan in retribution for the killing of their troops by Kurdish insurgents .
And do n't try to get a grip on the manoeuvring for power , which has led to " partial " democracy in 2009 --- provincial elections in parts of Iraq but not in areas like Kirkuk .
Just hail King David ( as he is anointed in The Times today ) --- General Petraeus , saviour of Iraq .
Tragically , it 's still too easy to cut through this guff .
The latest refutation comes from researchers at the University of California , Los Angeles , who have used satellite imagery to establish that the drop in Iraqi violence is due in large part to " ethnic cleansing " .
Simply and brutally put , after years of fighting and intimidation , there were n't as many folks of the " wrong " religion ---
Shi'a in Sunni areas , Sunni in Shi'a --- to be killed .
The surge myth is necessary , however , for two reasons .
One is straightforward domestic politics in the US --- who would want to admit that five years in Iraq end not with a glorious bang but with the continuing whimper of American failure ?
Certainly not an outgoing President whose " legacy " , up to the economic events of the last month , was going to be defined by the war .
And certainly not a Republican candidate for President whose strategy , up to the economic events of the last month , was to use Iraq to show he was tougher than his Democratic opponent .
The second reason , a more serious one in the long one , is to lay the platform for the long - term US presence in Iraq .
It 's difficult to rationalise permanent bases and 50,000 American troops in the country on the basis that Iraq is going to hel

The Guardian ,
Saturday May 3 2008
Traditionally on May Day the fool plays at pratfalls and buffoonery around local morris dancers , brandishing his fool ’s bauble , an inflated pig ’s bladder on a stick , with which he bewitches and controls the crowds .
To the uninitiated it looks like chaos , but for his own safety the fool must know the dances as well as anyone , so that his weaving tomfoolery meshes perfectly with the intricate pattern of kicks , handkerchief waving , and stickbashing .
In the newspapers on May Day , meanwhile , journalists were earnestly reporting the news that pig ’s bladder extract had been used by scientists in a major breakthrough allowing one man to magically regrow a finger .
“ ‘ Pixie dust ’ helps man grow new finger , ” squealed the Telegraph ’s headline .
“ ‘ Pixie dust ’ makes man ’s severed finger regrow , ” said the Times .
“ Made from dried pig ’s bladder , ” they explained , this magic powder “ kick - starts the body ’s healing process ” .
Now firstly , if you look at the pictures accompanying this column , you will see from the “ before ” image that there is no missing finger , so we might naively intuit that there is no “ missing finger grows back ” story to be written .
In fact , from the grainy images and scant descriptions available – despite blanket news media coverage , including television interviews – it seems this bloke lost about 3/ 8 of an inch of skin and flesh from the tip of his finger , and the nail bed is intact .
[ Photograph : Lee Spievack / Al Behrman / AP ]
Make no mistake : I ’d be whingeing a lot if it happened to me , but injured fingers do heal , sometimes badly , often nicely , just like gouges and scrapes on the rest of your body .
“ Nerves , tissue , blood vessel , skin ” regrew , said the BBC .
Yes .
Up and down the country as we speak .
Here are some more examples .
The body is an amazing thing .
If your experience of rollerskating injuries is not enough , Simon Kay , professor of hand surgery at the University of Leeds , saw the before - and - after pictures , and says : “ It looked to have been an ordinary fingertip injury with quite unremarkable healing .
This is junk science . ”
Where did this miraculous story come from ?
Dr Badylak is the scientist quoted in all of these stories .
He told me : “ This story came to the media not through us , but rather through the patient .
I would just as soon it had not gone out until we complete our pilot study . ”
That is unfortunate .
I asked how this patient was recruited , what consent was obtained , how safety was assessed , whether this work has been published , and whether it will be published .
He did not answer .
Fair enough .
He agrees that scepticism is understandable .
I ’m grateful .
The patient is Lee Spievack .
He was given the powder by Acell , a large and longstanding biotech firm founded by Alan Spievack .
He is Lee Spievack ’s big brother .
Dr Badylak is Acell ’s chief scientific adviser , and he can be seen bravely making the best of all this unwelcome media attention by showing TV cameras around his labs and giving lengthy interviews , both now and in February 2008 , when this story made the US news , and also , interestingly , in February of 2007 , when it made the news for the first time , in exactly the same form , with exactly the same characters , and many identical quotes , verbatim , in the Wall Street Journal , MSNBC , and more .
The injury itself , meanwhile , apparently happened ( and healed ) way back in 2005 .
Reconstructing the media frenzy , it all seems to have kicked off – this time around – with BBC New York correspondent Matthew Price doing a very credulous set of interviews that went live on the BBC site on Wednesday at 3 pm .
He nods endlessly and says “ that ’s astonishing ” when the company founder ’s little brother tells him that the tip of his finger healed .
In the computer animation used by the BBC [ 1m10s into this video , I really recommend you watch it ] , a finger miraculously grows back more than half its length , at least two joints worth ( stills on the left ) .
At 11:30 pm that same day the Press Association put out a story , but the newspapers must have had it sooner for the next day ’s papers , so I guess they lifted it from the BBC , too .
By May Day 3:30 pm the story was on Fox news ( their morning ) , and by 11:30 pm it hit ABC Australia .
All used the same quotes in different permutations .
And that ’s how news works .
Meanwhile , Dr Badylak now tells me that the entire nail bed was missing .
This contradicts various previous news reports and apparently the pictures .
He also says half the distal bone was missing .
Confused ?
You should be .
I ’ve asked him for more pictures .
I guess that just goes to show that the media is a confusing and inappropriate place to communicate new and unpublished epoch - making scientific breakthroughs ( from 2005 ) .
But we can console ourselves with the thought that one lucky company has had plenty of international media exposure .
On three separate occasions .
Over two years .
· Please send your bad science to bad.science@guardian.co.uk
And another thing :
There are three features that are very striking about this story .
Firstly , with few exceptions this was a story initiated – and followed – not by health or science correspondents ( who I now know were all telling their newsdesks that this story was nonsense ) but by non-specialist , generalist journalists .
As I have shown previously , this is a recurring theme in all of the media ’s most serious science hoaxes of the past decade .
BBC New York correspondent Matthew Price in particular wets himself with excitement at the fact that he is reporting on a new medical breakthrough on a scale with IVF .
Any decent science or health correspondent would have known it was duff .
He and all of the other journalists covering the story used terms like “ Extra Cellular Matrix ” as if this is only to be found in pig ’s bladder , when in fact extra- cellular matrix can be found around all the cells in all the bodies of all of the people reading this article .
Secondly , many papers used the image below , in which the distal phalanx is foreshortened , so it was hard to assess the extent of the damage .
.
Lastly , I have asked Dr Badylak for more photographs of the injury , and various other details , but he has not replied .
As I have argued on many previous occasions , it ’s all very well to go straight to the media with your breakthrough scientific findings in advance of publication , but it makes a very unsatisfactory place to report on original science [ er , from 2005 ] , and so you do have an obligation to clarify the technical details when approached .
I have no doubt there is a grain of reality to these dramatic claims , and it ’s perfectly possible that their product represents a small valid step in an exciting new field .
.
On a personal note .
I do n’t usually solicit diggs , reddit clicks , del.icio.us tags , or boingboings , but stories like this really piss me off , so if you wanted to pimp , it might be fun to see the debunking get as much coverage as the original bogusity .
You can hear me giving this story some chat , and making a plea for more specialist science correspondents in the media , on the Today Programme this morning

The atom is like a solar system , with electrons whirling around the nucleus like planets orbiting a star .
No , actually , it is n’t .
But as a first approximation to help us visualize something that is so invisible , that image works as a metaphor .
Science traffics in metaphors because our brains evolved to grasp intuitively a world far simpler than the counterintuitive world that science has only recently revealed .
The functional activity of the brain , for example , is nearly as invisible to us as the atom , and so we employ metaphors .
Over the centuries the brain has been compared to a hydraulic ma­chine ( 18th century ) , a mechanical calculator ( 19th century ) and an electronic computer ( 20th century ) .
Today a popular metaphor is that the brain is like a Swiss Army knife , with specialized modules for vision , language , facial recognition , cheating detection , risk taking , spi­rit­uality and even God .
Modularity metaphors have been fueled by a new brain - scanning technology called functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
We have all seen scans with highlighted ( usually in red ) areas where your brain “ lights up ” when thinking about X ( money , sex , God , and so on ) .
This new modularity metaphor is so seductive that I have employed it myself in several books on the evolution of religion ( belief modules ) , morality ( moral modules ) and economics ( money modules ) .
There is a skeptical movement afoot to curtail abuses of the metaphor , however , and it is being driven by neuroscientists themselves .
The November 11 , 2007 , edition of the New York Times , for example , published an opinion piece entitled “ This Is Your Brain on Politics , ” by neuroscientist Marco Iacoboni of the University of California , Los Angeles , and his colleagues .
The writers presented the results of their brain scans on swing voters .
“ When we showed subjects the words ‘ Democrat , ’ ‘ Republican ’ and ‘ independent , ’ they exhibited high levels of activity in the part of the brain called the amygdala , indicating anxiety , ” the authors note .
“ The two areas in the brain associated with anxiety and disgust — the amygdala and the insula — were especially active when men viewed ‘ Republican . ’
But all three labels also elicited some activity in the brain area associated with reward , the ventral striatum , as well as other regions related to desire and feeling connected . ”
So the word “ Republican ” elicits anxiety and disgust , except for when it triggers feelings of desire and connectedness .
The rest of the conclusions are similarly obfuscating .
In a response befitting the self - correcting nature of science , Iacoboni ’s U.C.L.A. colleague Russell Poldrack and 16 other neuroscientists from labs around the world published a response three days later in the Times , explaining : “ As cognitive neuroscientists who use the same brain imaging technology , we know that it is not possible to definitively determine whether a person is anxious or feeling connected simply by looking at activity in a particular brain region .
This is so because brain regions are typically en­gaged by many mental states , and thus a one - to - one mapping between a brain region and a mental state is not possible . ”
For example , the amygdala is activated by arousal and positive emotions as well , so the key to interpreting such scans is careful experimental design that allows comparison between brain states .
Additional skepticism arises from knowing that fMRI measures blood - flow change , not neuronal activity , that the colors are artificially added in order to see the blood - flow differences and that those images are not any one person ’s brain but are instead a statistical compilation of many subjects ’ brains in the experiment .
“ Some of the claims made by neuroscientists sound like astrology , ” Poldrack told me in an interview .
“ It ’s not the science itself that is the problem .
It ’s taking a little bit of science and going way beyond it . ”
For example , there is the problem of reversing the causal inference , “ where people see some activity in a brain area and then conclude that this part of the brain is where X happens .
We can show that if I put you into a state of fear , your amygdala lights up , but that does n’t mean that every time your amygdala lights up you are experiencing fear .
Every brain area lights up under lots of different states .
We just do n’t have the data to tell us how selectively active an area is . ”
University of California , San Diego , philosopher of the mind Patricia S. Churchland told me with unabashed skepticism : “ Mental modules are complete nonsense .
There are no modules that are encapsulated and just send information into a central processor .
There are areas of specialization , yes , and networks maybe , but these are not always dedicated to a particular task . ”
Instead of mental module metaphors , let us use neural networks .
The brain is not random kludge , of course , so the search for neural networks associated with psychological concepts is a worthy one , as long as we do not succumb to the siren song of phrenology .

Al Franken says his accountant made a mistake on a practice that many other accountants say is basic in their business .
MPR Photo / Mark Zdechlik
Minnesota Public Radio News contacted 60 local accountants , and heard back from a dozen of them .
They all said Franken is ultimately responsible for making sure he pays taxes in the right states .
They pointed out multi-state tax filings can be intensely complicated , and accountants do mess up from time to time .
But most of them also echoed Woodbury tax accountant Michael Shaffer .
" It really seemed like it was a rookie mistake , " Shaffer said .
The mistake was that instead of paying taxes in the many states where he earned money from 2003 through 2006 , Franken paid state income taxes only in the states where he lived -- New York and Minnesota .
That meant he overpaid taxes in those two states , but shorted the other 17 states by more than $ 50,000 .
Franken says he will pay those states now , plus interest and penalties , for a total of about $ 70,000 .
Then he 'll file for a refund in Minnesota and New York .
The divvying up of tax payments based on where you 've worked is called apportionment , and while accountant Michael Shaffer says it can be complex to calculate , it 's not exactly an obscure accounting principle .
" I learned it in my first tax class in college , " he says .
" I learned it in my first tax class in college . "
Mark Sellner , who directs the graduate studies program in taxation at the University of Minnesota , has some first - hand experience with apportionment , because he conducted seminars last year for an East Coast accounting firm .
" I looked at the New Jersey rules and said , Yes , I 've done some teaching there , " Sellner said .
" I did it for more than a couple days .
I should file a New Jersey return . "
Sellner says apportionment comes up all the time .
If a Minnesota salesman closes a big deal in Wisconsin , he might have to file tax forms in both places .
States even try to capture revenue from trucking companies whose 18 - wheelers pass along their highways .
" It would be an issue of , if you shipped something from here to Dallas , what 's really earned in each state that you pass through ? "
Sellner said .
Sellner says routine business trips are usually exempt , and you also have to make a certain amount of money in a state before you trigger taxes there .
For instance , you have to file forms in Minnesota only if you make more than $ 8,750 here .
Franken used to make his living as a comedian and a political commentator , and he collected speaker 's fees for performances all over the country .
But in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio this week , he said his New York accountant , Allen Chanzis , told him he needed to file taxes only in states where he lived .
" This all really comes from one mistake , which is him not understanding that I was supposed to pay state taxes in these other states , " Franken said .
Mark Sellner says it 's pretty common for people to make mistakes with apportionment .
But accounting firms like Chanzis 's that specialize in the entertainment industry deal with those issues all the time .
The firm 's
Web site says it handles multi-state tax filings , and it says Allen Chanzis " has a unique expertise in all aspects of tour accounting and reporting . "
And tour accounting means keeping track of the money a touring entertainer makes in various states .
" If I was going to tell clients I was specializing in tour accounting , I would make sure I was following those issues a little closer , " said U of M tax professor Mark Sellner .
Sellner says there is some good that will come out of Franken 's tax troubles .
He plans to use situation as an example when he teaches his accounting students about apportionment .
Up to 500 people have gathered in Sydney 's Martin Place as part of a global day of action against violence in Tibet .
Today 's protests have been timed to coincide with the handover of the Olympic torch to Chinese representatives .
Many of the speeches have called for boycotts of the Beijing Games .
Some protesters have draped themselves in Tibetan flags and there are banners calling for China to start a dialogue with the Dalai Lama .
Speakers have called for China to not take the Olymic torch into Tibet and to give greater media freedom .
The Dalai Lama 's representative in Australia , Tenzing Atisha , has challenged Chinese Government claims that the Dalai Lama masterminded the recent uprising .
Police say the behaviour of protesters has so far been exemplary but they are monitoring the gathering carefully .

More on the Missing Macroeconomists
My recent post bemoaning the “ missing macroeconomists ” in today ’s policy debate yielded a number of very insightful responses .
I received two particularly interesting missives from two of the brightest stars in macroeconomics .
First , Princeton ’s Ricardo Reis added a new explanation for the missing macroeconomists :
Macroeconomics has taken a turn towards theory in the last 10 - 15 years .
Most young macroeconomists are more comfortable with proving theorems than with getting their hands on any data or speculating on current events .
Partly , this is due to the macroeconomy being quite boring in the last 10 - 15 years of prosperity .
Most young PhD ’s with an interest in the world ’s problems have gone to work in applied micro ( like you ) or in development , where the real - world questions seem more pressing .
And another part is due to a change in the structure of the older members of the profession .
As economists have become more respected in policy circles , many practical macroeconomists have left for policy work .
When Bernanke , Blinder , Mankiw , and many others decided to spend time in D.C. , they left the control of the top journals and the tenure committees in the hands of their more theory - inclined colleagues .
Young people were quick to catch on to who was in charge , and they became more theoretical .
Chicago ’s Erik Hurst wanted to let me know : “ I found the missing macroeconomists . ”
To his eye , “ the initial ‘ shock ’ to the economy was a finance shock , ” and so , “ they just happen to be working undercover as ‘ finance ’ economists . ”
To prove his point , Erik suggested a really useful ( and slightly Chicago - centric ) reading list :
1. David Greenlaw , Jan Hatzius , Anil Kashyap , and Hyun Song Shin , “ Leveraged Losses : Lessons from the Mortgage Market Meltdown ” ( also suggested by Romain Wacziarg ) .
2. Atif Mian and Amir Sufi , “ The Consequences of Mortgage Credit Expansion : Evidence from the 2007 Mortgage Default Crisis . ”
3. Benjamin Keys , Tanmoy Mukherjee , Amit Seru and Vikrant Vig , “ Did Securitization Lead to Lax Screening ?
Evidence from Subprime Loans 2001 - 2006 . ”
4. Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff , “ This Time is Different : A Panoramic View of Eight Centuries of Financial Crises ” ( ungated version here ) .
Erik has also been quite vocal on the likely consequences for consumption :
See more in an interview , which aired last week on NBC Nightly News .
And Doug Elmendorf , back from vacation , adds his $ 0.02 , arguing for a role for specialization :
I agree with you that our profession has been slow to react to events .
However , I think the principal reason is one you did not include on your list : Professors are generally people with the inclination to think long and deeply and carefully about specific problems , not people with the inclination to take a few general principles and wade into a complex mess of problems changing daily .
Thus , professors tend to be good at developing fundamental new truths but not at offering practical policy advice .
On the bright side , that leaves a lot of running room for policy - oriented economists like me !
On the dark side , that means that economists are often under the streetlight rather than closer to where their keys might be .
This problem may be especially acute when the problems are new and hard .
The profession took a decade , perhaps , before we got our minds around stagflation .
For those who are after a more digestible reading list , the always - excellent vox blog has included a number of excellent crisis - related posts from Willem Buiter , Stephen Cecchetti , Richard Portes , Carmen Reinhart , and others .
Baywords is a new blog host running WordPress MU , offering free blogs completely , and promising not to extract any censorship as long as you abide the Swedish law .
Behind the initiative stands
The Pirate Bay , and Peter “ brokep ” Sunde had this to say in the launch post :
Many blogs are being shut down for uncomfortable thoughts and ideas .
We will not do that .
Our goal is to protect freedom of speech and your thoughts .
As long as you do n’t break any Swedish laws in your blog , we will defend it .
The reason behind all this is said to be that a WordPress.com blog was closed down due to linking to copyrighted material .
TorrentFreak got this quote from Automattic ’s Matt Mullenweg :
“ Word Press.com supports free speech and does n’t shut people down for “ uncomfortable thoughts and ideas ” , in fact we ’re blocked in several countries because of that .
However as a US - based companies we must comply with US laws , which means if the primary purpose of a blog is distributing illegal material it ’s not a good fit for WordPress.com , ” Matt said .
The Baywords service is free , but there will be some ads , kept to a minimal though .
The team is also working on the option to add your own domain , captcha to battle spam , and better stats .
It ’ll be interesting to follow this one .
There is no sign the fighting is abating
Doctors said at least eight were children and up to 16 were militants .
Israel said most were militants .
More than 150 Palestinians - and seven Israelis - have been injured .
Israel says it wants to stop rocket attacks , but about 50 hit Israel on Saturday .
Palestinian leaders have called for international protection .
The UN Security Council is meeting in emergency session at the request of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
RISING VIOLENCE
Saturday :
At least 52 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers killed Friday : Ashkelon activates warning system after rocket hits Thursday : Four Palestinian children and seven militants killed Wednesday : Six - month - old Palestinian boy and six militants killed Israeli civilian killed in Sderot
In pictures : Gaza violence
As the council went into closed session , Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned Israel for " excessive and disproportionate " use of force in the Gaza Strip .
He also condemned Palestinian rocket attacks against southern Israel .
The BBC's Laura Trevelyan at the UN says diplomats will have problems agreeing a statement on the crisis that is acceptable to both the Arab grouping and the US - a staunch ally of Israel .
As the Security Council was assembling reports came in that an Israeli air strike in Gaza City had destroyed the empty offices of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya , prime minister in the territory 's unrecognised government .
Battle of words
Mr Abbas earlier said the Israeli raids were " more than a holocaust " .
Israel says it wants to end the agony caused by militant rockets
He was apparently alluding to controversial remarks made on Friday by Israel 's Deputy Defence Minister Matan Vilnai , who said Palestinians risked a " shoah " - the Hebrew word for a big disaster as well as for the Nazi Holocaust .
Mr Vilnai 's colleagues insisted he had not meant " genocide " .
Khaled Meshaal , Hamas 's exiled leader in Syria , went further , calling Israel 's actions " the real holocaust " .
The Israeli raids began after a rocket fired by Hamas militants killed an Israeli student in the southern town of Sderot , the first such death in nine months , on Wednesday .
More than 80 Palestinians have been killed since then .
In a statement on Saturday , Israel 's Defence Minister Ehud Barak blamed Hamas for the killings .
" We are not happy about civilians being hurt in Gaza , " Mr Barak said .
" Hamas and those who fire rockets at Israel are responsible and they will pay the price . "
Air raids
Israel has said it may launch a full - scale attack on Gaza in response to militant rocket attacks .
The BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says Israel 's leaders have been under pressure from some quarters to launch a ground invasion .
However , a recent opinion poll has indicated a majority of Israelis favour a truce with the Islamist movement Hamas , which controls Gaza .
Tanks and troops have made an incursion into northern Gaza , encountering resistance from Palestinian militants , as Israeli planes made several air raids .
On one occasion , a house east of the Jabaliya refugee camp was struck - two children , a brother and sister , were killed .
Later , a 15 - year - old girl and her 16 - year - old sister were also killed .
In another attack , a mother was killed as she was preparing breakfast for her children , medical workers said .
And a resident of Jabaliya told the Associated Press news agency that one of his relatives had been killed .
" His body is still lying on the ground , " he said .
" Ambulances tried to come , but they came under fire . "
A walkway 18 m ( 59 ft ) above ground has been unveiled at London 's Kew Gardens , enabling visitors to explore the treetop canopy .
Designed by architects behind the London Eye , the 200 m ( 656ft ) long Xstrata walkway will also offer aerial views of the capital 's skyline .
Another attraction enables visitors to study the soil beneath the trees .
" We hope [ they will ] realise trees do matter and we need to nurture them , " project manager Tony Kirkham said
" As a trained arborist I have had the privilege of being up in the tree canopy , experiencing trees at height and birds and other wildlife from a completely different perspective .
" It 's fantastic that we are able to give visitors the same experience . "

Designed by Marks Barfield Architects , the treetop walkway enables visitors to enter the canopy of sweet chestnuts , limes and deciduous oaks to see birds , insects , lichens and fungi that rely upon them .
The other attraction - the Rhizotron - will be entered through an apparent crack in the ground and will show visitors the natural world beneath the trees , explaining the relationship between tree roots and micro-organisms in the soil .
This Behind the Scenes article was provided to LiveScience in partnership with the National Science Foundation .
In his classic novella " Heart of Darkness , " Joseph Conrad 's protagonist , Marlow , describes the Congo River as an immense snake " ... uncoiled , with its head in the sea , its body at rest curving afar over a vast country , and its tail lost in the depths of the land . "
A description that , while wonderfully evocative , is also a bit menacing .
I am happy to report that my own experiences conducting research in the Congo have been nothing so menacing nor so dark .
On the contrary .
For the past three years I have — with support from the National Science Foundation and a team of U.S. and Congolese students and colleagues — been exploring and documenting the fish biodiversity of the lower Congo River , which is the head and neck of Conrad ’s imaginary snake .
What we have found there is an extraordinarily beautiful place that is redolent in history , new discoveries , and amazingly rich in aquatic biodiversity .
The Congo River is a place of superlatives ; it is the world ’s second largest river basin , draining an area the size of Europe ; so immense that its source waters in the highlands of east Africa take more than six months to exit into the Atlantic Ocean , some 2,900 miles ( 4,670 km ) to the west .
The river and its tributaries represent over 9,000 miles ( 14,500 km ) of navigable passage across central Africa , and provide food and livelihoods for the 30 million people who live in this vast region .
Big barrier
This massive river also forms one of the largest biogeographical barriers in Africa .
For example , our closest relatives , the chimps ( Pan troglodytes ) and the bonobos ( Pan paniscus ) are separated by the Congo River ; chimps are found only to the north and bonobos only to the south .
Many other animals show a similar pattern of distribution ; the Congo River has clearly played an important role in sorting African biogeography .
Nevertheless , we know surprisingly little about its history .
But we do know that the river has not always looked the way it does today .
Geologists estimate that perhaps as recently as half a million years ago , the Congo was a large lake or series of lakes with no outflow to the Atlantic Ocean .
At some point the Congo breached a high plateau in the region of present day Malebo Pool — a peculiar place where the river expands into an enormous 14 - mile - wide ( 22.5 km - wide ) pool .
In Conrad ’s day this strange place was known as Stanley Pool , after the explorer and emissary of the now infamous Belgian King Leopold II .
Most of the great inland lake was drained and a " new " river cascaded down through the gorges of the Crystal Mountain region , dropping about 920 feet ( 280 m ) over 220 miles ( 350 km ) to reach the Atlantic .
Today , some of the most spectacular rapids on Earth and a rich endemic fish fauna are found in the river as it flows between Pool Malebo and the Atlantic .
These fishes are termed lower Congo " endemics " because they occur only in this short stretch of the river .
It is this region , called the lower Congo River rapids , with its spectacular array of rapids , pools and runs , that is our study area .
Isolated stretch
The extraordinary hydrology of the lower Congo appears to have isolated it from the remainder of the river basin and this short stretch represents a model system for exploring patterns of species richness and local endemism , while perhaps also holding the key to understanding the origin and age of the entire Congo River itself .
The fishes found only in the lower Congo rapids can only have evolved after the formation of the rapids themselves , and those rapids formed when the proto - lake Congo drained to the Atlantic .
By studying those fishes we hope to get a handle on when the Congo took its present - day form .
But studying those fishes is no easy task ; the area is remote and rugged , roads are few and far between and when present are often impassible .
What ’s more , few reliable maps are available to aid our search for access to the river .
But unlike Stanley and other earlier travelers in the region , we have the luxury of remotely sensed satellite imagery to help us locate possible access points by road and by foot that can take us to river collecting sites and places to set up camp – large sand banks and bars that are scattered between huge rocky outcrops along the river , make idyllic camp sites from where we can cautiously venture out in local piroges ( huge canoes carved out of tree trunks ) .
Analysis of remotely sensed data also gives us an invaluable birds - eye view of the numerous macrohabitats and channel features that characterize this hydrologically complex stretch of river .
Using the latest remote sensing technologies , and with much on - the - ground sampling and analysis , we are beginning to get a much clearer picture of just how the hydrology of the river has played a major role in isolating fish populations .
We have mapped rapids and can begin to measure their power , we have found evidence of extremely deep underwater canyons , we have found blind fishes and fishes with bizarre anatomical features and adaptations to life in fast waters , and we have discovered numerous species new to science .
Yet working in this region is difficult .
Catching fish in such turbulent water flowing at extreme velocities over treacherous rocks is a bit like trying to " catch " a needle in a haystack — we rely heavily on the experience and ingenious skill of the local people who have been fishing these difficult waters for millennia .
But despite how much we are learning and documenting , our project has only begun to scratch the surface of this extraordinary place — we are certainly leaving a great deal for our Congolese colleagues and students to continue to explore .

It was 1958 ; IBM was the leader in creating computers that took up entire rooms .
Their recent creation , the IBM 704 , was projected to only sell six units and was priced accordingly .
When it ended up selling well over 100 units , it helped propel the careers of its two lead designers .
Gene Amdahl , from whom we get Amdahl ’s Law ( which is still a hot topic ) , led the hardware design .
John Backus , the B in BNF , was responsible for leading a team to define and develop an implementation of Fortran that would help ease programming on the system .
It offered a choice besides writing in the 704 ’s assembly language .
One of the newest features of their design was what would later be referred to as the “ for loop . ” I say “ later , ” because at the time of its introduction , it was really a “ do loop ” in syntax , but it had the modern day meaning of a for loop .
As a programmer , you ’d sit down at a typewriter - like device called a keypunch , and would type out a line like “ 310 DO 400 I =1,50 ” that would tell the compiler that “ starting at line 310 , keep executing code until you get to line 400 , then increment the ‘ I ’ variable and start all over until ‘ I ’ exceeds 50 , then stop by jumping to the line right after 400 . ”
There are several things to note about that last statement .
The first is that the idea of a “ for loop ” is over 50 years old .
The second is that since there were only 72 characters of usable space on the 704 ’s card reader , the syntax had to be incredibly terse .
Due to the design of language , “ I ” was the first integer variable available for use ( “ N ” was the last , all others were floating point ) .
Like it or not , this is probably the driving reason why you were taught to write statements like “ for ( int i = 0 ; i < 50 ; i++ ) ”
It ’s only convenient that “ I ” is also the first letter in “ index ” and “ iterator . ”
Computer programming teachers and books inevitably all trace back to Fortran .
I ’m sure that as a programmer you ’ve written thousands of for loops in your life .
If you ’re a professional programmer , you ’ve probably read thousands of for loops written by other people .
If you do this long enough , you ’ll likely come across several different styles .
The first style is by far the most popular .
We can illustrate it by an example .
Let ’s say that we have a list of presidents of the United States and we want to know how many presidents have a last name that is longer than six letters .
You might have a program that has a helper class like this :
You ’d then create and initialize a list of Presidents explicitly or from a file / database :
Finally , you ’d be able to have your dear friend , the for loop :
We ’ve all written code like this .
It ’s so easy you do n’t even have to think about it .
Right ?
Well , let ’s think about it just for fun .
The second style would be to do something like this :
Did you catch the difference ?
The first style used the post - increment ( i++ ) operator for the for - iterator and the latter one used the pre-increment ( ++i ) operator .
Most of the world uses the post - increment notation because that ’s what we all saw in our textbooks and online samples .
People that use the second notation are usually very particular about it .
Almost all of them come from a C++ background .
The reason is that in the Standard Template Library ( the C++ rough equivalent of the .net Base Class Library ) has the concept of iterators that allow you to go through a data structure like a vector .
In the implementation of the post - increment operator on the iterator , one needs to preserve a copy of the old value and then increment the value and return the old value to keep with the proper meaning of the operator in language specification .
The post - increment operator is usually implemented by calling the pre-increment operator with the added tax of keeping the old value .
Typically users of the “ ++i ” style will come back at you and say something like “ i++ is so wasteful !
You ’ve got that copy that you are n’t even using !
Shame on you buddy ! ”
Ok , maybe that ’s a bit extreme .
But it could happen .
But , let ’s check out the truth for .net code .
In this particular situation , is it wasteful ?
Let ’s look at the IL instructions for the post - increment ( i++) version of our “ for loop ” using ILDASM ( with my comments on the right ) :
Now , to save time , let ’s see how the above compares with the pre-increment ( ++i ) version :
There you have it folks .
The code is the exact same except for how the C# compiler names the throw - away variable used for checking inequalities .
This has absolutely no effect on performance .
All other instructions are exactly identical .
The C# compiler sees that no one cares about preserving a copy of the value , and makes a decision to ignore that .
This is so basic of a technique that this happens even in debug builds .
In case you ’re wondering , we could n’t have just done a simple diff on the two EXEs even if the C# compiler emitted the same code because .
net compilers place a Module Version Identifier ( MVID ) GUID that is different every time you compile your assembly .
Anyways , with all due respect , any C++ compiler worth its file size would perform the same optimization trick ( for integer types ) .
Like I said , the only real difference came with iterators .
In .net , we do n’t have the exact equivalent of iterators , but we do have Enumerators .
This allows us to change the code above to look like this :
Notice that we got rid of “ i ” completely !
However , it ’s just slightly less efficient from a performance perspective .
The reason is that the compiler turns this into a call to the List ’s GetEnumerator ( ) which in turn does this :
Which just punts to this method :
Now , during the actual enumeration / iteration , the code will call MoveNext ( ) that looks like this :
There are two things that I found interesting .
The first is that there is a check on a “ _version ” field to see if it ’s different and if so , throw an error .
After doing some reflectoring , it turns out that any time you modify a List through calls to methods like Add or Remove , the “ _version ” member gets incremented .
This tells the class that it ’s been changed .
If you changed the List after creating the Enumerator , you ’ll get this unfriendly error message :
This design is ultimately caused by the second interesting thing in the code above .
If you look carefully , you ’ll see that the core of MoveNext is exactly the same as the “ for loop ” style mentioned earlier .
We have a “ this.index ” variable that gets incremented on every call and then we check to make sure that the index is less than “ list._size ” .
If the List is modified , the “ this.index ” might not make sense , and therefore an exception needs to be thrown .
After all enumeration is done , there is a call to dispose the Enumerator .
Therefore , the “ foreach ” syntax is roughly rewritten to this code by the compiler :
which just makes me even more thankful for the C# “ foreach ” syntax sugar .
Clearly the “ foreach ” method takes more instructions and performs a generation 0 memory allocation and therefore is slightly slower than the “ for loop ” method .
However , it ’s more readable and intuitive .
It lets you focus on the problem at hand ( enumerating ) rather than having to worry about things like the size of the List or being explicit with incrementing an index .
Can we go even better than “ foreach ” ?
Absolutely !
I ’m sure you ’ve even seen “ foreach ” a lot in production code for the reasons I mentioned .
However , it ’s very repetitive and boring to have explicitly tell the computer to go through the List looking for a match .
Some programmers might have noticed that List has a [ ForEach ] ( http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bwabdf9z.aspx) method that executes a delegate on each item in the list .
This allows you to write statements like this :
The messy delegate notation in C# 2.0 made this approach hardly more elegant .
With lambda expressions and type inference , we can rewrite the above statement as :
This really did n’t buy us too much .
It ’s still a bit messy .
The final solution would be to use the LINQ Count extension method to get code like this :
Now we ’ve actually made some progress !
We ’ve compressed all of the work to one clean line of code .
That was a long journey !
Congratulations if you made it this far .
Was it worth the investment ?
Lessons Learned
When you do n’t care about what the specific item offset / index number is , prefer a foreach since it ’s cleaner and not that much more expensive .
Sometimes you ca n’t use a foreach because you need to know index number ( e.g. going through two lists of the same size at the same time ) .
This might be a better candidate for the “ classic ” for loop .
However , do n’t bother with using a pre-increment operator because it ’s not the way the vast majority of people does it and it does n’t buy you any performance improvement .
If performance is absolutely critical , use a for loop as it avoids the Enumerator allocation .
You ’ll note that the source code for the .net Base Class Library tends to avoid “ foreach ” because it has been aggressively optimized for performance .
It has to sacrifice readability for performance because the BCL is used everywhere .
However , it ’s likely that your code does n’t have that type of strict performance requirement .
Therefore , favor readability .
It is worth your time to look at the LINQ extension methods like Count , Sum , Min , Max , Where , OrderBy , and Reverse .
It ’s amazing how these can dramatically simplify 6 - 7 lines down to a single line .
By using the new extension methods , you ’ll be able to quickly take advantage of upcoming technologies like Parallel LINQ .
Say you had a billion presidents and 4 cores .
You ’d just simply change your code to “ presidents .
AsParallel ( ) .
Count (.. ) ” and your code would scale automatically to all processors .
In short , consider thinking outside of “ for loops ” prefer to think at a higher level .
One day , you just might be able to honestly say that you ’ve written your last “ for loop . ”
One last thing : as Backus was developing Fortran , John McCarthy was developing LISP .
Although the two languages started at roughly the same time , they had notably different design philosophies .
Fortran was designed with a bottom - up style that was slightly higher than the raw assembler , but it was fast .
LISP was deeply entrenched in the symbolic world of lambda calculus .
It was powerful , but slow at first .
Many of LISP ’s ideas are just now entering into common practice with popular languages like Python , Erlang , F# , and as we saw in the code above , C# 3.0 .
So it seems that in 1958 , two roads diverged in a wood and LISP became the road less traveled by .
At least now , fifty years later , our industry is starting to bridge those two paths .
Maybe Anders is right saying that in 10 years , it ’ll be hard to categorize languages like C# because they will have deeply incorporated both paths .
But I ca n’t help but think what programming would be like now had Fortran become the road not taken .
P.S. In case you care , there are 23 presidents of the United States who have a last name longer than 6 letters .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
So gasoline prices are at an all - time high .
But after adjusting for inflation , rising incomes and better fuel efficiency , how bad are they really ?
The experts ' answer : Bad .
Nearly as bad as they 've ever been , and not likely to get better anytime soon .
Adjusted for inflation , gasoline at $ 3.227 a gallon , according to AAA , is still about 18 cents below its peak of $ 3.405 , set in March 1981 , according to the Energy Information Administration .
And Americans are spending about 6 % of their total disposable income on energy , down from about 8 % in 1982 .
But prices are higher than they have been at any time in recent memory .
In 2002 , when many people may have bought a vehicle they are still driving today , Americans spent just 4 % of their income on energy .
Gas prices , adjusted into 2008 dollars , were at a near all - time low of around $ 1.30 a gallon .
" It really has n't reached a level it did in 1982 , but it 's approaching it , " said Kay Smith , an economist at EIA .
" It 's becoming a burden . "
Moreover , Americans have n't spent this much of their income on energy since 1986 .
Except for a few months , inflation - adjusted retail gasoline prices did n't cross the $ 2 a gallon mark anytime in the 18 years between 1986 and 2004 .
Now there are some studies that say it 's not really that bad .
In 1980 , the average American had to work 105 minutes to buy enough gas to drive the average car 100 miles , according to Beth Ann Bovino , a senior economist at Standard and Poor's .
Now , the average American needs to work only 53 minutes , thanks to better fuel efficiency and higher wages .
" Even though it certainly does n't feel so good at the pump , we 're a bigger economy and we make more money , " said Bovino .
And some people , usually Europeans , like to point out that gasoline is still far cheaper in the United States than it is in Europe , where it can cost upwards of $ 8 a gallon .
Others argue that 's it's not fair to compare the United States and Europe , as Europe 's high prices are largely due to taxes , which are then used to fund public benefits such as mass transit or cheaper health care .
Either way , most economists agree that these current record gas prices are beginning to take their toll .
For each penny increase in the cost of gas , U.S. consumers pay an extra billion dollars a year , said Dean Baker , assistant director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
So to go to $ 3.22 a gallon from $ 1.74 a gallon in March 2004 is costing an extra $ 148 billion dollars this year alone .
" There 's definitely a hit , " said Baker .
" It does n't explain the recession , but it certainly adds to it . "
Falling home prices and the loss of jobs are the main reasons behind the economic downturn , economists say .
But food prices have also risen with gas prices , as the economy worsens and investors of all stripes pour money into commodities as a hedge against inflation and the falling dollar .
Food prices rose nearly 5 % in January , the highest one - month gain since December 1990 , said John Lonski , chief economist at Moody 's Analytics .
" It 's a drag on consumer spending , " said Lonski .
" Consumers right now are suffering from a double whammy . "
For those hoping things will get better , there may be a while to wait .
EIA predicts gas prices will remain above $ 2.70 a gallon until at least 2010 .

This is the first in a series of posts I ’m planning to write on the paper “ Recounting the Rationals “ , by Neil Calkin and Herbert Wilf , mathematicians at Clemson University and the University of Pennsylvania , respectively .
I ’m really excited about it , and I hope that you ’ll soon see why !
It ’s an incredibly elegant and interesting paper , but it ’s also quite accessible to anyone with only a modest background in mathematics — that is , it would be if it were longer than three and a half pages .
Calkin and Wilf ’s main audience is other mathematicians , of course , so their presentation is fairly concise , trusting the reader to fill in many of the details .
So , I plan to take my time going through their ideas , filling in many of the details , and highlighting some interesting tangents along the way .
However , I do not plan to “ dumb it down ” in any way — I ’m going to write about every single bit of mathematics in their paper .
Today , by way of introduction , I ’d like to talk about the motivating question : is it possible to make a list of all the positive rational numbers ?
If it is possible , how can we do it in a nice way ?
Well , let ’s think about it .
How would you make a list of all the positive rational numbers ?
( You may wish to stop and actually think about this question for a few minutes .
No , really ! )
Recall that rational numbers are simply fractions of the form , where p ( the numerator ) and q ( the denominator ) are integers , and q is n’t zero .
For example , , and are positive rational numbers .
( You may have learned about “ proper ” and “ improper ” fractions in school , where “ proper ” fractions are those in which the numerator is less than the denominator ; I would advise you to forget about such a mathematically useless distinction as quickly as possible ! )
Here ’s one idea : list all the rational numbers with a denominator of 1 , followed by all the rational numbers with a denominator of 2 , and so on .
Like this :
Unfortunately , while technically correct ( for suitable values of “ technically ” ) , this is not a very good solution .
The problem is that if you tried to write down this list , you ’d never even make it through the rationals with denominator 1 , since there are infinitely many !
You would never , ever get to 1/2 , let alone something like 43/19 .
We ’d like our list to contain every positive rational at a finite index : that is , if someone else ( say , your evil , plaid - pants - wearing , math - hating arch - nemesis ) picks a positive rational number , no matter what it is , you should be able to start writing out your list of rationals from the beginning and eventually — as long as you keep writing for a long enough , yet finite , amount of time — write down the chosen rational .
Obviously , our first try is a failure in this department .
That evil arch - nemesis has only to pick something like 1/3 , and we ’re sunk !
Now , you may think this is impossible : our first try failed , so it would seem , because there are “ too many ” rationals .
We could n’t even make it through all the rationals with denominator 1 ; how can we possibly hope to rearrange things so that every rational occurs at a finite place in the list ?
Well , the first rule of dealing with infinity is : do n’t trust your intuition when dealing with infinity !
As it turns out , there are n’t “ too many ” rationals , we just happened to put them in a bad order .
To get a better sense of what ’s going on here , think about making a list of all the positive integers , like this : first , write down all the odd positive integers ; then , write down all the even ones .
This list obviously includes all the positive integers , but it ’s a bad list in the same way as our initial try at a list of rationals : if you tried to write it down , you would keep listing out odd integers forever , without ever getting around to the even ones .
But in this example , it ’s easy to see that this can be fixed : everyone knows that if you write out the positive integers in order , you ’ll eventually get to any positive integer you want , as long as you keep writing long enough .
Ah , that ’s better !
Okay , so here ’s another idea : list the positive rationals in order by the sum of their numerator and denominator .
We can agree to list rationals with the same sum in order by their numerator .
So , the first rational in our list is the only one with a sum of 2 , namely , 1/1 .
Next , the rationals with a sum of 3 : 1/2 , 2/1 .
Then 1/3 , 2/2 , 3/1 , followed by 1/4 , 2/3 , 3/2 , 4/1 , and so on .
This is the same thing as putting the rationals in a grid , and listing them by “ diagonals ” , like this :
Pretty simple , right ?
Now , it ’s easy to see that every positive rational is included in this list : the numerator and denominator of every positive rational sum to something ( duh ! ) , so any rational we can think of will get included when we get to that sum .
More exciting is the fact that there are only a finite number of rationals with any given sum ( in fact , you can see that there are exactly rationals with sum ) , which means that every rational must occur at a finite place in the list !
Hooray !
( By the way , another way to say that we can make a list of the positive rational numbers like this is that the positive rationals are countable .
It is an astonishing fact ( with a nifty proof ) that although the rational numbers are countable , the real numbers are n’t — but that ’s for another post ! )
There ’s still something unsatisfying about this solution , though : many numbers occur more than once .
In fact , every number occurs infinitely many times !
For example , 1/1 , 2/2 , 3/3 , 4/4 , and so on are really all the same rational number ( namely , 1 ) but they all occur separately in our list .
The same is true of 1/2 , 2/4 , 3/6 … and so on .
Should we leave the repeats in ?
( Bleh . )
Should we just say that we wo n’t write down any numbers that have already occurred earlier ?
( Yuck . )
Either way seems inelegant .
Is it too much to ask for a list of the positive rationals which includes each number exactly once , in lowest terms ?
As you have probably guessed , it is n’t too much to ask — and that ’s where Calkin and Wilf ’s paper comes in !
They describe an extremely elegant way to list all the positive rational numbers , which has all the nice properties we ’ve just talked about , and a few more besides .
In the next post in this series , I ’ll reveal what that list actually is , and then I ’ll spend several posts talking about ( and proving ) all of its nice properties .
Along the way we ’ll talk about binary trees and binary numbers , the principle of induction , recursion , and a bunch of other interesting things .
( PS — the Carnival of Mathematics is coming soon !
There are still a few more hours left for last - minute submissions …
I should have it up by midnight at the earliest or tomorrow morning at the latest .
Get excited ! =)

The German government erred in getting involved in the lead - up to the Iraq War without parliamentary approval , according to a Wednesday , May 7 decision from Germany 's highest court .
The German center - left government under then - Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder should have gotten prior approval from the Bundestag , Germany 's lower house of parliament , before taking part in a surveillance mission to Turkey in 2003 , the court ruled .
Parliamentary disapproval
The ruling strengthens parliamentary power
Germany 's parliament had refused to join in the US military invasion of Iraq .
But Schroeder 's government agreed to supply troops for the Turkey flights .
This outraged members of Germany 's Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , a free - market liberal party .
Five years ago the FDP asked a court for an emergency injunction to stop the deployment .
The German constitution requires parliamentary approval for all foreign armed deployments , and Turkey qualified , the FDP said .
Germany had sent its Airborne Warning and Control System ( AWACS ) planes at the request of its NATO ally , Turkey .
Germany provided crews to man NATO planes that flew surveillance flights near Turkey 's southern border which were meant to protect Turkey against an Iraqi attack during the US - led invasion .
Schroeder 's government described the 2003 deployment as a " routine " NATO operation .
A lower court agreed , lifting the FDP 's injunction .
Flights were form of deployment
Not a " routine " operation
Yet the constitutional court reversed that decision Wednesday .
The court ruled that there was a real possibility German military personnel could have been drawn into a conflict .
The court equated the flights with " armed deployment " which needs parliamentary approval .
" It is important that the responsibility for the deployment of armed troops remains in the hands of the representative body of the people , " i.e. parliament , the judges said in the ruling .
FDP head Guido Westerwelle hailed the Constitutional Court ruling as " historic , " saying that it would keep the German army under parliamentary control and prevent it from being turned into a tool of the government .
Schroeder went ahead without parliamentary approval
While the law suggests that the parliament has to approve all foreign armed deployments , previous rulings suggest that in cases of acute threat , the government may seek parliamentary approval after the fact .
The decision is unlikely to have any legal consequences for Schroeder or other members of his government but will influence the military policy - making of future administrations .
The German military currently has parliamentary mandates for missions around the world including deployments in Afghanistan , Bosnia , Kosovo and the Horn of Africa .
Germany does assist in training Iraqi security forces , although not on Iraqi territory .
Those who peer at children in public could find themselves on the wrong side of the law in Maine soon .
A bill that passed the House last month aims to strengthen the crime of visual sexual aggression against children , according to state Rep.
Dawn Hill , D - York .
Her involvement started when Ogunquit Police Lt. David Alexander was called to a local beach to deal with a man who appeared to be observing children entering the community bathrooms .
Because the state statute prevents arrests for visual sexual aggression of a child in a public place , Alexander said he and his fellow officer could only ask the man to move along .
" There was no violation of law that we could enforce .
There was nothing we could charge him with , " Alexander said .
He attended a talk with Hill a week later and brought the case to her attention .
Hill pledged to do what she could , Alexander said , and the result was a change through the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee in the House , which made the law applicable in both private and public places ....
Under the bill , if someone is arrested for viewing children in a public place , it would be a Class D felony if the child is between 12 to 14 years old and a Class C felony if the child is under 12 , according to Alexander .
Hill said she believes the move was necessary to correct what she called a " loophole " in the state 's criminal law statutes .
Helen ,
As indicated to me , the person could be arrested if they were found to be peering at a child in a public place ; i.e. , beach bathrooms .
In my interviews for this story , no one indicated to me that you would need to expose yourself .
I believe the aim of the change was to make it a crime to peer in public .
Thank you ,
Dave
Apparently , there are some politicians and police officers in Maine who think the answer is " yes " ( thanks to Peregrine John for pointing this potential law out ) : I have a lot of questions about such a law .
What does peering actually mean ?
Does staring at a teen who looks 25 when one is at the beach count ?
Does staring at some kids like I did a few years ago because they looked like they were trying to get into some trouble count or am I excluded from the law because I am a woman ?
A Class C Felony is a serious charge , will people ( mainly men , I assume ) be put in jail for the simple act of staring ?
How do you know the person had the intent of " visual sexual aggression " ?
How does one determine if staring or peering is aggressive or not ?
One person 's aggression is another 's peaceful gaze .
This law seems very vague and unfair .
Does anyone in Maine care ?
I have contacted and left messages and email for Representative Dawn Hill , who is sponsoring this bill , asking for clarification .
As soon as ( and if ) she responds , I will post an update .
I have also emailed the reporter of the article that I linked to above to see why there is a discrepancy between what this bill says and the story presented .
There appears to be an amendment to the bill here ( thanks to commenters , and to readers for emailing it ) and Dave Choate , the reporter of the article quoted above emails the following to me :
Looks like the news story is n't true , based on my conversation with Travis Kennedy of the Maine Legislature .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama said Thursday that the most important thing he could achieve as president would be to deal with Iraq and the threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan while improving " our influence around the world . "
Sen . Barack Obama , in his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , speaks with Wolf Blitzer .
In his first interview since the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , Obama said he thinks the United States ' influence around the world has been diminishing .
" The world wants to see the United States lead .
They 've been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven , eight years , " he told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer in an interview on " The Situation Room . "
" I think there is still a sense everywhere I go that if the United States regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals , that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world . "
Watch the full interview with Obama »
Obama said he thinks the way the war in Iraq has been handled has kept the United States from focusing on key issues like energy policy , global warming and the economy .
Americans want to succeed , he said , " but we 're going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the American people is released . "
" It 's very hard for us to do that when we 're spending close to $ 200 billion a year in other countries , rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong , " he said .
Obama downplayed headlines and stories , such as the cover of Time magazine , that have declared him the Democratic presidential nominee .
" I do n't want to be jinxed .
We 've still got some work to do , " he said .
Watch an analysis of some of Obama 's comments »
Obama predicted that he and Sen. Hillary Clinton would probably split the remaining contests and said Clinton would win the upcoming primary in West Virginia by a " big margin . "
Obama won North Carolina by a 14 - point margin Tuesday .
Clinton squeaked out a win in Indiana by 2 points .
In the days after those contests , some top Democrats have called on Clinton to step aside .
Obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the New York senator , saying it 's too early to start thinking about running mates .
" Sen. Clinton has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate .
She 's tireless , she 's smart , she 's capable , and so obviously she'd be on anybody 's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate , " he said .
" But it would be presumptuous of me at this point ... to somehow suggest that she should be my running mate . "
Watch viewer responses to question : Should Obama offer Clinton the No. 2 spot ? »
Terry McAuliffe , a former Democratic National Committee chairman and a co-chairman of Clinton 's campaign , commented Thursday on the possibility of a joint ticket .
" I think what she 's interested in being the nominee of the party .
...
We 're fighting hard for it .
This woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign .
...
Hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do . "
Obama said he 's ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee : a matchup against Sen .
John McCain , the presumptive GOP candidate .
Obama said he was offended when McCain said last month , " It 's very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president . "
" I think it 's disappointing because John McCain always says , ' Well , I 'm not going to run that kind of politics , ' and then to engage in that kind of smear I think is unfortunate , particularly since my policy on Hamas has been no different than his , " Obama said .
" And so for him to toss out comments like that , I think , is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination . "
When asked to respond to McCain supporters -- such as former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- who have said Obama is not ready to be commander in chief , the senator from Illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is " good judgment . "
" I think I 've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the American people are looking for in the next president , " he said .
Watch Obama say why he 's qualified to be president »
Romney responded later on " The Situation Room , " saying " The truth of the matter is just as I said , that he does n't have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector ... has n't pushed a major piece of legislation .
" He seems like a charming guy who 's very well - spoken .
But in terms of actually having led , actually having accomplished something , actually having a kind of leadership that America needs at a critical time with our economy ... he 's untested .
...
Frankly , Sen. McCain is someone who is tested and very proven , " he added .
All About U.S. Presidential Election • Democratic Party
The trump card Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton held in her faltering bid for president  her support among the superdelegates who can control the fate of the Democratic nomination  began slipping from her grasp on Friday as Senator Barack Obama moved into the lead on this front , with uncommitted delegates declaring their allegiance to him as others deserted her .
Mrs. Clinton publicly vowed to fight on for the nomination while campaigning on Friday in Oregon .
But a new , more conciliatory tone crept into her stump speeches , as she shied away from the more spirited attacks on Mr. Obama that characterized her recent primary battles , instead engaging him more gently on the issues while aiming her fire on Senator John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican nominee .
The superdelegate movement toward Mr. Obama , of Illinois  giving him a net gain of six on Friday alone , with more expected  increased the pressure on Mrs. Clinton , of New York , to at least refrain from divisive remarks , particularly after her comments on Wednesday that lower - income white voters would not support Mr. Obama if he became the Democratic nominee .
Aides now say she regrets the comments .
Democratic officials said what had been a trickle of superdelegates declaring for Mr. Obama was turning into a steady stream in the wake of Tuesday ’s primaries , when Mrs. Clinton lost by 14 percentage points in North Carolina and narrowly won Indiana .
Mr. Obama is just 166 delegates away from the 2,025 delegates needed to secure the nomination .
Hillary Clinton yesterday acknowledged she " misspoke " about the level of danger she was exposed to on a 1996 visit to Bosnia , leading the campaign of her rival , Barack Obama , to accuse her of exaggerating her foreign policy experience .
The Democratic presidential hopeful , who made the trip while she was first lady , said last week she had come under sniper fire when landing at Tuzla airport .
" I remember landing under sniper fire .
There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport , but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base , " she said in a speech last Monday .
But an American comedian who accompanied her on the trip and a contemporaneous news account both contradicted her claims .
The comedian , Sinbad , recently told the Washington Post he had felt no sense of danger .
" I think the only ' red - phone ' moment was : ' Do we eat here or at the next place ? ' " he said .
" I never felt I was in a dangerous position . "
The Associated Press reported at the time that Clinton " took no extraordinary risks on the trip " and did not mention gunfire .
Clinton yesterday acknowledged to the Philadelphia Daily News that there was what she called a " minor blip " in her account of the visit .
" I went to 80 countries , you know , " she told the paper 's editorial board .
" I gave contemporaneous accounts , I wrote about a lot of this in my book .
You know , I think that , a minor blip , you know , if I said something that , you know , I say a lot of things — millions of words a day — so if I misspoke , that was just a misstatement . "
The Obama campaign questioned whether she had made a verbal mistake , painting her statement as part of " a growing list of instances in which Senator Clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking " .
Clinton has branded herself the more experienced candidate in the Democratic race , laying claim to more than 30 years of work in the public sphere and saying she would be " ready on day one " .
But more than 11,000 pages of daily records from Clinton 's eight years as first lady show she was often far from the scene of presidential decision - making , remaining on holiday , for instance , when her husband , Bill Clinton , returned to Washington to handle a crisis .
She and Obama are battling fiercely in the state of Pennsylvania , where voters go to the polls on April 22 .
Obama leads in the delegate count , by 1,620 to 1,499 .
The number of delegates needed to clinch the presidential nomination is 2,024 .
Obama is also ahead in the popular vote , leading by about 711,000 votes , 2.6 % of ballots cast , according to an analysis by RealClearPolitics.com .
Selling gay rights
Obama 's rally in Beaumont today was the highest - energy of this Texas swing , with a crowd that was about three - quarters black cheering at almost every turn .
An interesting moment came when he was asked a question about LGBT rights and delivered an answer that seemed to suit the questioner , listing the various attributes — race , gender , etc. — that should n't trigger discrimination , to successive cheers .
When he came to saying that gays and lesbians deserve equality , though , the crowd fell silent .
So he took a different tack :
" Now I ’m a Christian , and I praise Jesus every Sunday , " he said , to a sudden wave of noisy applause and cheers .
" I hear people saying things that I do n’t think are very Christian with respect to people who are gay and lesbian , " he said , and the crowd seemed to come along with him this time .
The moment reminded me of a conversation I had recently with a senior figure in the national gay rights movement , who noted that Obama 's deference to some black Christian discomfort with homosexuality — his refusal to dump the " ex- gay " gospel singer Donnie McClurkin from a tour — angered some gays and lesbians ; but conversely , that his ability to sell gay rights in the black church is unique and appealing .

The outburst was spotted by the Swift space telescope Astronomers have been able to capture and record the first moments when a massive star blows itself apart .
After decades of searching , researchers have used the world 's top telescopes to observe the remarkable event .
Previously , scientists had only been able to study these " supernovas " several days after the event .
The results , published in the journal Nature , show that within two hours of the blast , a giant fireball scattered radioactive debris across space .
The phenomenon was detected by the Swift space telescope , a collaboration between the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the UK and Italy .
We were in the right place , at the right time
Alicia Soderberg , Princeton University Supernovas are some of the most spectacular events in the Universe , producing the same amount of energy as trillions of nuclear bombs detonating simultaneously .
Typically , they occur when a massive star - more than eight times the mass of the Sun - runs out of fuel and collapses to form a hot relic called a neutron star .
Their extreme brightness allows them to be seen in distant galaxies .
But observers cannot pick up this optical emission until several hours or days after the explosion , so a supernova 's first moments are shrouded in mystery .
Death of a star
The event in the constellation of Lynx was captured by pure chance .
Alicia Soderberg , from Princeton University in New Jersey , and her colleagues were using Swift to survey the spiral galaxy NGC2770 .
They saw an extremely luminous X - ray outburst in an area of sky that had shown nothing bright just two days earlier .
They attribute the outburst to the breaking out of the supernova shockwave , which ploughs its way through the star 's gaseous outer layers - blowing it to smithereens .
" We were in the right place , at the right time , with the right telescope , " Dr Soderberg explained .
Dr Kim Page , from the University of Leicester , who led the X - ray analysis , commented : " This observation is by far the best example of what happens when a star dies and a neutron star is born . "
Swift 's X - ray instrument was largely developed at Leicester by a team led by Professor Alan Wells .
He told the BBC that Swift had been designed from the outset to tackle issues such as the early behaviour of supernovas .
The initial observations were followed up by some of the world 's major telescopes .
They observed the blast for more than 30 days to rule out the possibility this event could be anything other than a supernova .
" We were able to observe the evolution of the explosion right from the start ,  said co-author Edo Berger , from the Carnegie Observatories in California .
" This eventually confirmed that the big X - ray blast marked the birth of a supernova . "
Astronomers say that supernovas are part of the story of how we came to be , because these tremendous explosions created many of the heavy elements from which planets are made .
The authors say the event will help astronomers fill in gaps about the properties of massive stars , the birth of neutron stars and black holes , and the impact of supernovas on their environments .

What are these ?
A few years ago some crazy religious fanatics crashed planes into buildings .
The authorities were quick to step in and step up security in airports .
Unluckily for us the authorities at the time happened to lead by this guy :
So what we ’ve gotten is a big mess of silly little rules and a mass of power - happy security screeners who can ruin your vacation with the flimsiest pretext .
It ’s not all bad , the shoe removal part makes us all a bit more humble and security theater makes most people feel safer .
But now it ’s time to celebrate the stupidest reasons to ban people from planes .
# 1 – 3.2 Ounces of Toothpaste .
This one has probably gotten a few of us in trouble , ever since government scientists discovered the formula : “> 3oz. toothpaste = bomb lol ” .
It even happened to everyone ’s favorite geek Wil Wheaton in 2006 .
… my deadly , deadly toothpaste was taken away from me , because it was “ way bigger ” than the three ounces our government protectors arbitrarily - designated as safe .
( For those of you scoring at home , “ way bigger ” is .2 ounces ) I did n’t mention that my relatively expensive ( to its size ) Crew hair goop was also taken away from me , because it was 3.4 ounces , even when I opened it up and showed them that it was less than 1 /2 full , and therefore well under the deadly 3 ounce threshold .
“ Well , we do n’t know what ’s really in there , ” the TSA lady said .
“ It ’s about1 ounce of hair goop , ” I said .
“ Would you like me to put it in my hair ? ”
They ’re lucky he did n’t reroute their main power through the deflector dish and reverse the magnetic couplers .
Damn it !
I really thought I could make it through a post involving Wil Wheaton without making a Star Trek joke .
# 2 – A MacBook Air .
I knew that Steve Jobs was up to something evil when he pulled that laptop out of the manila folder .
Michael Nygard made the mistake of owning one when he tried to get on a flight .
It completely baffled the airport security personnel because it looked slightly different from the usual Dells .
They finally called in a technology expert ( someone under the age of fifty ) to examine it .
A younger agent , joins the crew .
I must now be occupying ten , perhaps twenty , percent of the security force .
At this checkpoint anyway .
There are three score more at the other five checkpoints .
The new arrival looks at the printouts from x-ray , looks at my laptop sitting small and alone .
He tells the others that it is a real laptop , not a “ device ” .
That it has a solid - state drive instead of a hard disc .
They do n’t know what he means .
He tries again , “ Instead of a spinning disc , it keeps everything in flash memory . ”
Still no good .
“ Like the memory card in a digital camera . ”
He points to the x-ray , “ Here .
That ’s what it uses instead of a hard drive . ”
# 3 – Your Own Breast Milk .
Fighting terrorism is n’t a conventional war – we have to fight terrorists at home and abroad and keep them from infiltrating our society .
And our mammary glands .
That ’s why in 2002 airport security forced Elizabeth McGarry to drink her own breast milk before letting her on the plane .
McGarry and her daughter were pulled out of the boarding line for a random search .
Guards examined her shoes , searched her baby and went through her diaper bag , Kuby said .
“ None of that bothered her , ” Kuby said .
“ Only when she was ordered to drink the breast milk did she fail to see the connection to stopping terrorism . ”
# 4 – A Novell with Cartoon Dynamite on the Cover and / or Harry Potter .
Neil Godfrey should have known better than to try to sneak a work of fiction past the keen eyes of airport security .
They detained him from his flight .
When tried to fly the next day ( this time with the evil Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ) he was again detained .
When Godfrey arrived at the airport around 1:15 p.m. , his luggage was again searched .
But as Godfrey passed through the metal detector , a police officer recognized him from the commotion just a few hours earlier .
The cop pulled Godfrey aside and made a few phone calls .
Ultimately , he declared that everything checked out fine .
But a National Guardsman standing nearby vetoed that decision .
“ This time , they took my Harry Potter book and about four people studied it for 20 minutes , ” Godfrey says .
# 5 – A Blinky LED Pin .
This is not the first run in that Boston has had with “ bomb hoax devices ” that turn out to be more accurately described as “ obviously not a bomb you moron . ”
Last year an MIT student attempted to leave Logan airport while wearing a homemade LED pin in the shape of a star ( her name is Star Simpson , so it ’s kind of a nametag ) .
I ’m guessing that the TSA has really had their hands full since Walgreens has started selling those blinky angel and teddy bear pins near the checkout .
“ She said that it was a piece of art and she wanted to stand out on career day , ” Pare said at a news conference .
# 6 – A T - Shirt with Optimus Prime on it .
Here ’s a little shout out to Europe , since the U.S. has not yet cornered the market on stupidity .
I ’m not making this one up – this dude got in trouble for wearing a T - shirt with a 50 - foot - tall fictional robot that turns into a semi truck .
Why ?
Because his fictional , cartoon arm is a fictional , cartoon laser gun .

The secret plans of ancient architects
Blueprints for ancient Greek temples like the Parthenon have been under the archaeologists ' noses for thousands of years , writes Dr Karl Kruszelnicki .
For thousands of years , people have looked on the ancient Greek temples ( like the Parthenon ) in awe of their perfection in design and construction .
Architects have known for centuries that they were built with deliberate mistakes that somehow made them look more perfect .
At what stage in the building process did they decide to put in the subtle mistakes ?
We could find out , if only we could get hold of the original plans .
But everybody knew that there was no chance of ever finding them .
But everybody was wrong .
The blueprints have been under the archaeologists ' noses for thousands of years .
The secret was found at the ruined temple of Apollo at Didyma .
Apollo was the Greek god of light , art and prophecy .
The Greeks started building this magnificent temple shortly after Alexander the Great arrived in Asia Minor in 334 BC .
But work went on at a snail 's pace , and the temple was n't finished when work finally ground to a halt after about 6 centuries , around 300 AD .
There was no more work done on the half - finished shell of the temple until the 1500s , when an earthquake knocked over much of what had already been built .
But there 's enough left to show that the temple of Apollo is magnificent , even as a ruin .
There 's a huge platform , about 4 metres high , 120 metres long , and 60 metres wide .
It 's the size of eight Olympic Swimming Pools , stacked side - by - side .
Originally there were going to be 108 columns , each of them about 20 metres tall , but only three of them still stand .
But where were the blueprints or plans ?
The big breakthrough came in October 1979 , when Lothar Haselberger , an archaeologist from the Technical University of Munich , was wandering through the ruined temple , and found the original construction plans .
He happened to see dozens of very thin , very shallow lines that were scratched into the marble of some of the lower walls .
It was the first time he'd seen these lines , and yet he had walked past this point dozens of times .
He stopped in amazement , and as he watched , the Sun moved a tiny amount , and the lines faded back into the white marble and vanished .
These were the missing construction plans .
He came back day after day to look closely at the other walls of the temple , to catch the different light and shadows as the Sun moved through the sky .
He found more straight lines , and circles and quarter circles , and even more complicated shapes .
The lines were as thin as a pencil mark , and were cut about half a millimetre deep into the surface of the marble .
In some places they had been washed away by thousands of years of rainwater .
In other places , they were covered by sinter , a thin mineral deposit that is left behind when water evaporates away .
But surprisingly , most of the lines were still visible after thousands of years in the open .
Lothar began to copy the lines onto paper .
He found that they had been done so accurately , they could have been done only by experienced draftpersons .
He realised that the blueprint , from which the temple was built , was drawn into the very stone of the temple .
The surface area of the plans was huge , covering hundreds of square metres .
On the plans , you can still see where some of the designs were changed .
Most of the etchings are done full life - size .
Because the columns are about 20 metres tall , they were drawn lying on their side .
The designers drew only half of each column , because the other half was an exact mirror image .
He noticed something special about the drawings of the columns - the subtle and deliberate mistakes .
^ to top
Better than perfect
The columns did not have parallel sides .
Instead , they bulged out by exactly 4.65 cm , and then tapered in again near the top .
The giant platform ( 60 metres by 120 metres ) that the columns were to be mounted on was not dead flat either .
It bulged upwards in the middle by about 11 cm .
On the plans carved into the stone , we can still see how they incorporated these deliberate mistakes .
To make a complicated shape ( like the base of a column ) they drew various combinations of straight lines that they then divided into thirds .
And then they put circles of many different sizes together and combined them with the various cut lines .
This got them close to the final shape .
And then we can see how , right at the very end , they abandoned strict geometry , and added a bit of the personal human touch .
The unknown architect drew in freely , by hand , a slightly different curve .
So while the architects started off with the strict rules of geometry , they would go beyond them whenever they felt the aesthetics of the building needed it .
The Greeks called this slight imperfection " entasis " , or " tension " .
Once it was realised that the plans for these temples were inscribed into their bases , the archaeological world went looking .
They found similar plans inscribed on the temple of Athena ( in Priene ) and the temple of Artemis ( at Sardis ) .
Practically all of the plans on the floors were gone , because they had been built over and had vanished , as rocks were built on top of them .
And as for the plans on the walls - once the temple was finished , the final stage was to polish off about half a millimetre of rock .
However , the temple of Apollo was abandoned before they got around to this polishing .
This idea of inscribing the plans into the rocks of the buildings is a really neat idea .
It would take many lifetimes to build a temple .
If the plans were scratched into the marble , later workers could follow the original plan of someone who had been dead for many centuries .
But the Greeks were n't the first .
The archaeologists then found out that Egyptian architects had used the same techniques some 2,000 years before the Greeks .
And more recently , the Romans , and even more recently , the builders of the medieval cathedrals , used the same technique .
These construction plans have been found scratched into the walls and floors of Cathedrals at York , Chartres and Reims .
The mystery of the missing plans had been solved - they had been under their feet all the time .

Expensive Temple
From the book - keeping records that we have from other sources in Greek history , we know that each column cost about 40,000 drachmas , or over a million of today 's dollars .
There were more than 120 columns needed for the temple of Apollo .
So just the columns alone would have cost about half the cost of the Sydney Opera House , or about three F - 18 fighter planes .
It probably would have been as much again for the rest of the temple .
Such a temple was definitely a major undertaking .

To a large extent , the US crisis was actually made by the Fed ...
One main culprit was none other than Alan Greenspan , who left the current Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke , with a terrible situation .
But Bernanke was a Fed governor in the Greenspan years , and he , too , failed to diagnose correctly the growing problems with its policies .
The roots of crisis , by Jeffrey Sachs , Project Syndicate :
The US federal reserve 's desperate attempts to keep America 's economy from sinking ... do not seem to be effective .
Although interest rates have been slashed and the Fed has lavished liquidity on cash - strapped banks , the crisis is deepening .
Today 's financial crisis has its immediate roots in 2001 , amid the end of the Internet boom and the shock of the September 11 terrorist attacks .
It was at that point that the Fed turned on the monetary spigots to try to combat an economic slowdown .
The Fed pumped money into the US economy and slashed its main interest rate - the Federal Funds rate - from 3.5 % in August 2001 to a mere 1 % by mid-2003 .
The Fed held this rate too low for too long .
Monetary expansion generally makes it easier to borrow , and lowers the costs of doing so , throughout the economy .
It also tends to weaken the currency and increase inflation .
All of this began to happen in the US .
What was distinctive this time was that the new borrowing was concentrated in housing .
It is generally true that lower interest rates spur home buying , but this time , as is now well known , commercial and investment banks created new financial mechanisms to expand housing credit to borrowers with little creditworthiness .
The Fed declined to regulate these dubious practices .
Virtually anyone could borrow to buy a house , with little or even no down payment , and with interest charges pushed years into the future .
...
What was stunning was how the Fed , under Greenspan 's leadership , stood by as the credit boom gathered steam , barreling toward a subsequent crash .
There were a few naysayers , but not many in the financial sector itself .
...
With the housing collapse lowering spending , the Fed , in an effort to ward off recession and help banks with fragile balance sheets , has been cutting interest rates since the fall of 2007 .
But this time , credit expansion is not flowing into housing construction , but rather into commodity speculation and foreign currency .
The Fed 's easy money policy is now stoking US inflation rather than a recovery .
...
Yet the Fed , in its desperation to avoid a US recession , keeps pouring more money into the system , intensifying the inflationary pressures .
Having stoked a boom , now the Fed can't prevent at least a short - term decline in the US economy , and maybe worse .
If it pushes too hard on continued monetary expansion , it wo n't prevent a bust but instead could create stagflation ...
The Fed should take care to prevent any breakdown of liquidity while keeping inflation under control and avoiding an unjustified taxpayer - financed bailout of risky bank loans .
...
Recent data make inflation less of a worry , though not completely absent , and I am not as sure as Sachs is that the Fed 's unconventional policies steps , e.g. adjusting balance sheets , expanding lending facilities , etc. , have not had any effect .
We can't know for sure without rerunning the last several months absent the policy steps that have been taken to see how things would have been different , something we'd need a time machine to do , but I think it 's safe to say that the Fed 's actions have helped some financial firms avoid experiencing more severe problems , and the psychological effect - the perception that the Fed stands ready take action - is also important but hard to measure .
Going back to the question of who caused the crisis , Greenspan says , as usual , get off of it - it was n't my , or the Fed 's , fault :
Greenspan Stands His Ground , by Steven Mufson , Washington Post : ... The record of longtime Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan -- worshipped by business leaders and dubbed " Maestro " in a 2000 biography by The Post 's Bob Woodward -- is getting a critical look as his successor Ben S. Bernanke wrestles with problems that began on the Maestro 's watch .
Many economists blame Greenspan for lax bank supervision and for keeping interest rates too low , too long from mid-2003 to mid-2004 .
...
In an interview yesterday , Greenspan said the Fed was n't to blame .
He said that global forces beyond the control of the Federal Reserve had kept long - term interest rates low , fueling the housing bubble earlier this decade .
" Those who argue that you can incrementally increase interest rates to defuse bubbles ought to try it some time , " he said .
" I do n't know of a single example of when interest rate policy has been successful in suppressing gains in asset prices . "
Regarding the current turmoil , Greenspan said that a market crisis was inevitable .
" If it were n't the subprime crisis it would have been something else , " he said .
That is because an era was ending that had seen " disinflationary forces " from developing countries such as China and a " protracted period " in which there was an " underpricing of risk . "
Not all economists are ready to let the former Fed chairman off so easily .
Lee Hoskins , former president of the Cleveland Fed and Fed chairman from 1987 to 1991 , says that to find " partial causes " of the credit turmoil , " you have to go back to the Fed 's decision to push the federal funds rate down to 1 percent and leave it there for over a year . " ... Greenspan says that the Fed was worried about " corrosive deflation " at the time and that he saw that as a greater threat to the U.S. economy than a housing bubble .
" There was a real serious concern about deflation , " he said yesterday .
" If you look at the notes of the Open Market Committee , the pressures were to go lower than 1 percent .
There were no dissents . "
Bernanke , a member of the Fed board at the time , was also concerned about deflation .
Greenspan also argues that while the Fed has a lot of power over short - term rates , it has less influence over long - term rates , which he asserted were more important to housing prices .
...
He said that at the time " it became apparent that we lost control " of long - term interest rates " as did the Bank of England and all the central banks .
As a consequence , we had very little ability to put a brake on the rise in home prices . " ...
Others reviewing the Greenspan era at the Fed say there is a difference between the way Greenspan reacted during sharp sell - offs of stocks and the way he reacted to the technology and housing bubbles .
Kenneth Rogoff , a Harvard economics professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , says that " the important point . . . is the philosophy of monetary policy that says ' you do n't pay attention to asset prices when they are rising , only when they are falling . ' "
In reality , Rogoff adds , " if you cut interest rates when asset prices are in free fall , then when asset prices are rising while indebtedness is rising all over country , you need to raise rates .
He actively chose not to do that . "
Other economists fault Greenspan for his failure to closely regulate big banks .
Alan Blinder ... says that the delay in raising rates in 2003 - 04 was a " minor blemish " on Greenspan 's " stellar " record managing monetary policy .
But Blinder says that he would give the former chairman " poor marks " for bank supervision , another key role of the Fed .
... " Lending standards were being horribly relaxed , and the Fed should have done something about that , not to mention about deceptive and in some cases fraudulent practices , " Blinder said .
...
Greenspan said that most of the subprime mortgages were originated by firms regulated by other agencies , but he adds , " In retrospect it was clearly a mistake " not to examine bank lending more closely .
...
I 'm with Blinder .
It was n't the low interest rates , those were needed at the time , the lack of regulatory oversight was the much bigger problem .
En el segmento de los autos eléctricos no podía faltar la firma estadounidense General Motors , una empresa que siempre ha incursionado con éxito en cuanto modelo ha fabricado .
Ahora anuncia que para el 2010 nos traerá el auto eléctrico GM
Volt , y en estos momentos dio un paso importante al anunciar que acelero ’ las pruebas de longevidad de las baterías de litio-ion , un anuncio importante pues dice General Motors que se podrán enchufar en casa para recargarlas , y que darían una duración de 40 millas ( 64 kms ) por cada carga , y una velocidad máxima de 120MPH ( 190 kms - h ) .
El tiempo de carga de las baterías seria de 6 horas .
Según GM , el Volt funcionaria por medio de un paquete de baterías que puede recargarse con el pequeño motor a nafta de un litro y 3 cilindros ( viene con el auto ) , dicho motor solo seria una ayuda para el motor eléctrico , pero con toda certeza , dice GM , que no gastara ni una sola de nafta , lo haría únicamente si el enchufe no esta disponible .
El Volt cuenta con un paquete de baterías que se integran en un sistema de propulsión genérico , que van colocadas debajo de los asientos y en forma de T , miden 180 centrípetos y tienen un peso de 375 libras .

Honey , I Shrunk the CFLs : Crazy - Small New Bulb from SYLVANIA
May 23rd , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
The micro mini Twist CFL : Big light , small package .
When it comes to the advent of the compact fluorescent light bulb ( CFL ) , I am proud to say that I was an early adopter .
And while I instantly noticed a reduction in my monthly electric bill , I also noticed that the compact fluorescent was not without its flaws .
I found that the early compact fluorescents were often too bulky , preventing their use in certain fixtures ; that they took a while to ‘ warm up ’ to full their full brightness ; and that the light they put off could be a little harsh , especially as compared to the warm glow of the Edison - era incandescent light bulb .
But times have changed , and the new micro-mini Twist from SYLVANIA is evidence that CFLs do n’t need to be big , slow , and bright to be effective .
>> See also : European Union Bans Incandescent Light Bulbs
The micro-mini ’s size is one of its biggest appeals and is what jumped out at me right away .
Featuring an ultra-small ¼ inch tube diameter and a compact integral electronic ballast , the 13W micro-mini is the smallest CFL on today ’s market .
The bulb measures 3.7 inches long or over half an inch shorter than a standard incandescent lamp , a mere 4.4 inches .
As you can see by the picture , the Twist is significantly smaller than the other 13W CFL I had in my home - lighting arsenal .
The bulbs compact size makes it usable in virtually any lamp fixture , large or small – not a claim that can me bade about all CFLs .
The Soft White micro-mini compact fluorescent light bulb features a warm color temperature of 3000 Kelvin ( K ) and it boasts instant - on capabilities .
The micro-mini Twist compact fluorescent lamps are available in 13 - watt ( W ) , 20 W and 23W models .
The mini CFL is designed to replace 60 , 75 or 100W incandescent lamps and boasts an average rated lamp life of 12,000 hours .
Finally , I really enjoyed the ‘ instant - on ’ capabilities of the Twist .
I often find that when I go to the bathroom and flip on the light , a CFL wo n’t reach its full luminescence by the time I am done with my business ( thus cutting into valuable crossword puzzle and magazine time ) .
This bulb , however , had no delay and was instantly bright as soon as I flipped the switch .
The only downside I found to the bulbs were how they were packaged .
For a bulb that is claiming to be an energy saver , it seems that printing a picture of a tree on a useless cardboard tab is not exactly the best way to show consumers real concern for saving energy .
I hope SYLVANIA will recognize this inconsistency and adjust the packaging accordingly .
Considering that changing just one 60W incandescent bulb to a 13W CFL will save the average American about $ 56 dollars over the life of the bulb .
And that changing out all thirty - six bulbs ( the number in the average American home ) , will amount to a savings of more than $ 2,000 ** over the life of the bulbs , it seems that an investment of $ 4.99 is a small price to pay for substantial energy savings .
** Based on 11 years at 10 cents / KwH .

When , long ago , the gods created Earth
In Iove 's fair image Man was shaped at birth .
The beasts for lesser parts were next designed ;
Yet were they too remote from humankind .
To fill the gap , and join the rest to Man ,
Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan .
A beast they wrought , in semi-human figure ,
Filled it with vice , and called the thing a nigger .
H.P. Lovecraft
Personal Experience
On the Creation of Niggers is a bizarre and ( obviously ) racist poem written by famed American horror / science fiction / fantasy / etc. author Howard Philips Lovecraft ( 1890 - 1937 ) .
Lovecraft is of course most famous today for his development of the Cthulhu mythos , an invented pantheon of horrible deities from other dimensions who feature as motivating narrative factors in many of his stories .
Although he is best known for these works , Lovecraft wrote more poems and personal letters ( thousands of them ) than he did short stories , and indeed did not come to prose - writing until well after a long spell of writing poetry ( extending back to at least the age of 7 ) .
The poem in question here seems to have been written in either 1912 or 1913 , when Lovecraft would have been about 22 , about ten years before Lovecraft " professionally " published a piece of fiction .
I first got interested in Lovecraft and his works when I was about 14 years old and I heard the Metallica song The Call of Ktulu .
I had no idea who or what a " Ktulu " was and the song did n't help very much because it's an instrumental .
I did some research and found out about the Cthulhu Mythos and its creator , H.P. Lovecraft .
I bought a Lovecraft compilation book a few weeks later and read through it .
I did n't find any of the stories terrifying as such ( Lovecraft 's gratuitous verbosity takes some of the terror out of them ) , but I found them fairly disturbing on a metaphysical level .
I would reread select stories from the book until it , along with most of my room at the time , was destroyed during a hurricane in 2004 owing to water damage .
Later on , when I wanted to read the Call of Cthluhu for what must have been the eighth time , I looked it up online , and came across a fairly comprehensive list of Lovecraft 's known works , including On the Creation of Niggers .
I was really rather surprised and did n't think it was real , but after reading into it , I discovered that it was not only a legitimate Lovecraft piece but that its racist theme was hardly unique in Lovecraft 's oeuvre .
Analysis
On the face of it , there 's really not much to " analyze " in the poem : the gods decided that man and beast were too separate from one another , so they created Black people as an intermediary .
It 's tempting to dismiss this poem and Lovecraft 's general racial views as being typical of his time , but really , they 're not .
At the very least , Lovecraft 's racism was more pronounced than that of his contemporaries .
He believed very firmly in the concept of what we might now term " White Power , " whereas a more common view among his class would have been racial segregation : he promoted an active form of ethnic glorification at the expense of others , while many American Whites felt that , with the American Civil War still in living memory for many , physical separation and as little mutual antagonism as possible would have been preferable .
To understand Lovecraft 's racial views , though , necessitates an understanding of his broader socio-political beliefs .
It was his opinion that eighteenth century England was essentially the pinnacle of culture up to that point .
For Lovecraft , it was a more interesting and altogether decent time .
It was during that century , however , that one of Lovecraft 's most loathed events occurred : the American Revolution .
Believing that " pure " Anglo - Saxon culture was in every way preferable to others , he viewed the " melting pot " conception of America with extreme disdain .
He even took to backdating his letters by two hundred years as a sign of his contempt for modernity and reverence for those halcyon days .
In 1919 , Lovecraft wrote a really short story called the Street , which took place at some unspecified time in the future and reflected the collapse of the United States .
The cause for this collapse was immigration of non-whites , who at one point made a conscious decision to " tear down the laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted ; to stamp out the soul of the old America - the soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a half years of Anglo - Saxon freedom , justice and moderation ...{ in which} many millions of brainless , besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities , burning , slaying , and destroying till the land of our fathers should be no more . "
Before this plan can be enacted , however , the buildings on the hypothetical street simply collapse onto them of their own volition and these " besotted beasts " are destroyed .
A later story , the Horror at Red Hook , has a virtually identical ending .
The story itself was written as a result of a particularly bad experience Lovecraft had shortly after he bizarrely married Sonia Greene , a tradeswoman of Ukrainian and Jewish extraction .
The couple moved to New York and in fact lived in the Red Hook neighborhood , which was a hub for poor recent immigrants to the United States .
Separate correspondences from Lovecraft and Greene indicate the former 's extreme anxiety at living in this extremely multicultural area , a far cry from his relatively homogenous upper class Anglo - Saxon hometown of Providence , Rhode Island .
He apparently never found a job while in New York , and he largely blamed this on the immigrants there .
The Horror at Red Hook is about an investigator trying to track down a man in the neighborhood , and he is disgusted by the poor , multi-ethnic community .
The man he 's seeking is actually dead and is in the process of being transformed into a zombie when the buildings of the area collapse on the foreigners because , the narrator theorized , they are just too rotted from age and neglect .
The subtext is obvious : the more heterogenous a place becomes and the longer it stays that way , the weaker and more decrepit it becomes before ultimately imploding in on itself .
Accordingly , one of Lovecraft 's greatest fears was miscegenation , particularly between Whites and non-Whites ( as opposed to , say , Asians and Arabs ) .
He was of the eugenic opinion that such interbreeding led to racial degeneration , the reasons for which can be plainly seen in On the Creation of Niggers : Black people ( and by extension , all non-Whites ) are " missing links " between humans and animals .
The title character of his story Facts Concerning The Late Arthur Jermyn And His Family is the scion of a prominent , wealthy family with a history of bizarre and eccentric behavior .
In the course of his investigations into his own family history , he discovers that an ancestor of his had gone to the Congo and while there had married a female ape who had been deified by a local tribe .
Upon realizing that he is descended from an ape and that his was the cause of his family 's unnatural mental and physical condition , the man immolates himself to stamp out the last vestige of his cursed bloodline .
This brings up another common Lovecraftian theme : that people can never escape the sins of their ancestors ( one of these great sins being to mingle blood with one 's social and racial inferiors ) .
The Lurking Fear is another story that features both of these themes : the upper class Dutch inhabitants of a wealthy town in Colonial America refuse to be lorded over by the British and insulate their city from the outside world ; they interbreed with their non-White and white trash laborers until by the time of the story , the entire town is comprised of virtually subhuman dwarfs who resort to cannibalism , another huge no - no for Lovecraft .
In one of Lovecraft 's most famous stories , The Shadow Over Innsmouth , the inhabitants of another nonexistent town become wealthy and prosperous through their fishing trade as a result of a deal made with the Deep Ones , a race of fish creatures who live in the sea .
The deal , of course , is interbreeding between the human population and the nonhuman Deep Ones .
As people age , they themselves gradually physically transform into fish - like creatures and join their benefactors at the bottom of the ocean .
The narrator of the story eventually discovers that he too is distantly descended from the Deep Ones and that he is becoming one of them .
The implication of course is clear : if you intermarry with a person of another race , your progeny , no matter how remote , is racially degenerate .
There are legions of other examples of these sorts of things , but one interesting thing in particular is that the worshippers of the various gods invented by Lovecraft are almost always non-White .
Lovecraft ( and many other people of his time , and indeed , many people in our time ) believed that " primitive " peoples were always more in tune with nature than those who were " civilized . "
Nature is often a symbol for Cthulhu and his comrades and vice versa ; these " savages " are thus ( frequently unknowing ) instruments of strange and unimaginably horrible gods .
However , not all of these extraterrestrial ( or extradimensional ) beings are inherently bad ; indeed , in The Shadow Out of Time , the story 's " Great Race " is described as noble and enlightened , practicing a form of government that Lovecraft describes as a type of " fascistic socialism . "
This reflects Lovecraft 's own idiosyncratic later political views , where he showed a preference for the economic policies of the New Deal but retained a certain sense of admiration for the racially exclusionary laws of the Third Reich ( or at least the nonviolent ones ; Lovecraft evidently abhorred physical violence ) .
At the Mountains of Madness is another story centered around a noble , enlightened alien master race that ultimately is brought down by its racially inferior slave caste .
Conclusion
On the Creation of Niggers is one of the earliest examples of Lovecraft 's racist views .
He 's sometimes alleged to have undergone a conversion in later life where he abandoned them , but the evidence does n't really support this .
He supported Franklin Roosevelt in his elections because of the " genteel fascism " of the New Deal policies and because he felt that FDR represented the American Anglo - Saxon aristocracy of which Lovecraft felt himself a part ( in terms of his ancestry , this was true , but his family had lost its wealth by that time ) .
There 's really no way to tell for sure where Lovecraft 's racism actually came from , but one theory is that it was a byproduct of his highly sheltered upbringing .
After the death of his father at a young age , Lovecraft was raised by his overbearing and overindulgent female relatives , which arguably created a whole host of other issues ; Lovecraft 's views on women -- or perhaps more appropriately , the lack thereof -- were undoubtedly partially created by his coddled childhood .
In any case , he always felt ill at ease when out of his bubble of Providence , Rhode Island .
His views on race went hand in hand with his views on class , ironic because Lovecraft was not a member of the " upper class " after his childhood .
His experience in Red Hook only cemented his already established beliefs .
There are , however , two facts that in my opinion support the idea that Lovecraft 's racism was the result of his own racial insecurity : first , the fact that he married Sonia Greene ( who was decidedly non-Anglo - Saxon ) , and secondly , the fact that he discovered a distant female ancestor of his was Welsh , as opposed to the purely Nordic conception that he had previously had of himself .
Whether from his upbringing , economic disadvantage , or repressed self - loathing , however , Lovecraft 's racist tendencies are a demonstrable part of his writing and ought not be ignored .
None of this , however , diminishes the quality of his work or the very potent feelings of terror they inspire to this day .
A self - healing aircraft could be available in the near future , thanks to an epoxy resin developed by Bristol University aerospace engineers that ‘ bleeds ’ from embedded vessels near the holes or cracks and quickly seals them up , restoring structural integrity .
As well as the obvious safety benefits , this breakthrough could make it possible to design lighter aeroplanes in the future .
This would lead to fuel savings , cutting costs for airlines and passengers and reducing carbon emissions too .
By mixing dye into the resin , any ‘ self - mends ’ could be made to show as colored patches that could easily be pinpointed during subsequent ground inspections , and a full repair carried out if necessary .
The dye mixed with the resin would be ultra-violet fluorescent and so would not show up in normal lighting conditions .
This simple but ingenious technique also has potential to be applied wherever fibre - reinforced polymer ( FRP ) composites are used .
These lightweight , high - performance materials are proving increasingly popular not only in aircraft but also in car , wind turbine and even spacecraft manufacture .
The new self - repair system could therefore have an impact in all these fields .
In aircraft , FRP composites can be used in any part of the primary structure ( fuselage , nose , wings , tailfin ) .
The technique ’s innovative aspect involves filling the hollow glass fibers contained in FRP composites with resin and hardener .
If the fibres break , the resin and hardener ooze out , enabling the composite to recover up to 80 - 90 % of its original strength – comfortably allowing a plane to function at its normal operational load .
The resin used in the self - repair system is an off - the - shelf , Araldite - like substance .
The team are currently developing a custom - made resin optimised for use in the system .
“ This approach can deal with small - scale damage that ’s not obvious to the naked eye but which might lead to serious failures in structural integrity if it escapes attention , ” says Dr Ian Bond , who has led the project .
“ It ’s intended to complement rather than replace conventional inspection and maintenance routines , which can readily pick up larger - scale damage , caused by a bird strike , for example . ”
By further improving the already excellent safety characteristics of FRP composites , the self - healing system could encourage even more rapid uptake of these materials in the aerospace sector .
A key benefit would be that aircraft designs including more FRP composites would be significantly lighter than the primarily aluminium - based models currently in service .
Even a small reduction in weight equates to substantial fuel savings over an aircraft ’s lifetime .
“ This project represents just the first step , ” says Ian Bond .
“ We ’re also developing systems where the healing agent is n’t contained in individual glass fibres but actually moves around as part of a fully integrated vascular network , just like the circulatory systems found in animals and plants .
Such a system could have its healing agent refilled or replaced and could repeatedly heal a structure throughout its lifetime .
Furthermore , it offers potential for developing other biological - type functions in man-made structures , such as controlling temperature or distributing energy sources . ”
The new self - repair technique developed by the current EPSRC - funded project could be available for commercial use within around four years .
The 3 - year research project ‘ Bleeding Composites : Damage Detection and Repair Using a Biomimetic Approach ’ concluded at the end of April 2008 .
It has received total EPSRC funding of just under £ 171,000 .
The team is working with industrial partner Hexcel Composites Ltd , a manufacturer of composites for aerospace and other industrial applications .
A similar technique developed at the University of Illinois involves the addition of microcapsules containing dicyclopentadiene , rather than epoxy resin contained in the glass fibres themselves .
Such a system sees the rapid reaction of a liquid with a solid catalyst .
The resulting plastic gives similar properties to the epoxy .
However , the catalyst is based on ruthenium , an expensive and rare metal .
The even distribution of capsules and catalyst within an FRP has also proven to be difficult .
June 8 , 1967 will mark the 41st Anniversary of America 's Loss of the USS Liberty to the army , navy and air forces of the State of Israel .
This obscenity has never been acknowledged for what it actually was , but has instead been thoroughly covered - up by the governments of both The United States and Israel .
This horrific and treacherous act must finally be acknowledged publicly .
Will this finally happen this time , when it has not happened in any of the previous 41 years of this government 's treachery against the peoples of the United States , as well as against the officers and crew of the USS Liberty on that fateful day .
The truth revealed in this new film , must officially become part of the history of our relations with the enemy that the State of Israel has been throughout these past forty - one years .
( 1 ) As a memorial to the fallen we need to sever all ties and military support for Israel , and we must cut our treasonous ties with these back - stabbing people whose true purposes are not , and have not been , in the best interests of the United States for almost the last five decades .
In addition Lyndon Banes Johnson 's library , then the president , should be amended to include this aspect of his administration .
His Defense Secretary Robert M. McNamara should be formally charged with treason and murder , and arrested and tried for his part in this travesty - and no warrant of " National Security " should hinder these proceedings from taking place !
If we fail to demand that the United States acknowledge this attack upon the USS Liberty , as an act of treason against the people of the United States , then we no longer deserve to call ourselves a nation .
This outrage has been further compounded over the years by the trillions of dollars that we have lavished on Israel , risking the welfare of the people and the institutions of the USA in the process !
For nearly five decades we have been doing the bidding of the rogue state of Israel , and we continue to put the lives of our troops at risk every day , to accomplish the goals of the ' Greater State of Israel , ' over the national interests of the United States of America .
Nothing can undo this vile treachery : but we can at the very least demand that this nation honor the memory of these deaths by prosecuting all those who were involved in this attack , so that the truth can exist in world history as " a thoroughly investigated and concluded part of the written and recognized history . "
In today 's world a huge number of our elected and appointed officials are currently serving in this government with dual nationalities .
Those with Israeli dual citizenships should be removed immediately .
All others that profess to seek " the best interests of Israel " need to again publicly swear an oath to preserve , protect , and defend the US Constitution , against all enemies both foreign and domestic ; being conscious of the fact that Israel is a foreign nation - state , and not a part of the United States of America !
If we are ever again to be ' Americans , ' we must demand this of what passes for our government !

Oil at another record high … what two events pushed crude to $ 122
So where ’s the next stop for the black goo ?
Goldman says $ 200 , The 5 thinks $ 100
Gold showing small signs of strength …
Ed Bugos ’ short - and medium - term forecasts
Fannie Mae drives into the ditch … government buys ‘em a new car and a six - pack
Chris Mayer with the latest natural gas boom … right in our backyard
Oil struck another high note yesterday , this time above $ 122 .
The already jittery oil market snapped to just below its new high on escalating violence in Nigeria .
Recent output statistics show the strife there is having more of an impact than expected .
Nigerian production is now 1.8 million barrels a day — its lowest level since 1999 .
That news brought oil to $ 121 .
Then Goldman Sachs released this statement :
“ We believe the current energy crisis may be coming to a head … lack of adequate supply growth is becoming apparent and resulting in needed demand rationing in the OECD areas , in particular , the United States . ”
Oil at $ 122 followed soon after .
Goldman analysts say a possible “ super - spike ” might be in the cards , thrusting oil to $ 200 a barrel as the current energy rally crescendos .
Where will oil settle after that ?
Around $ 100 .
“ It ’s possible to attribute oil ’s meteoric rise since early 2007 to rampant financial speculation , ” writes Dan Denning , with an explanation , “ But frankly , the oil price is hostage to a number of variables , many of which are not quantifiable .
A fear premium definitely exists .
Then there is the declining U.S. dollar .
And there is the matter of investors treating oil as an asset class and as a ‘ safe haven ’ from inflation .
The creation of sector funds and ETFs correlated to the oil price has made this possible .
“ The increase in the oil price between 2001 - 2006 was a structural revaluation of oil ’s value to the global economy .
You had the Iraq war driving the geopolitical premium .
Since 2003 , you ’ve had production peaks / declines in large fields in Mexico and Russia , persistent disruptions to Nigerian production and gradually increasing demand from emerging markets .
“ And now ?
Well , like iron ore and coal , the oil price indicates that the emergence of China and India as productive industrial economies with emerging consumer classes is a lot more resource intensive than anyone imagined .
“ The chart suggests there ’s an oil bubble , ” Dan says , “ and that it has to correct soon .
But by ‘ correct , ’ we mean oil between $ 95 -105 .
“ In 2003 , $ 40 became the new $ 20 .
In 2005 , $ 60 became the new $ 40 .
And in 2008 … $ 100 becomes the new $ 60 . ”
Gold rallied as high as $ 882 yesterday , but has pulled back to around $ 870 in Asian trading this morning .
A quick look at the chart paints a challenging picture for gold investors :
“ Those of us holding out for gold to mount another attack at $ 1,000 before the summer are none the better for it today , ” says our gold adviser Ed Bugos .
“ The credibility of this short - term thesis is growing tired .
The gold market has discounted a dollar bounce and commodity correction — it has been worried about these things long enough and has already moved on them .
“ The medium - term gold price outlook hinges on evidence of low inflation and returning growth in the U.S.
However , it is not clear how the Fed ’s current policy might bring about a halt in those price pressures building up in the production pipeline .
“ The most likely case is that consumer price inflation accelerates around the world , eventually forcing a round of interest rate hikes , while cost inflation continues to shrink margins in the production pipeline .
“ When that happens , the price of gold will sharply rise . ”
“ There is a significant risk that higher inflation will become embedded in the economy , ” Kansas City Fed Governor Tom Hoenig confirmed yesterday , “ and require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it . ”
Hoenig went on to describe rising inflation as a “ troublesome … serious ” matter quickly approaching “ unacceptably high levels . ”
And admitted soaring consumer costs “ are beginning to generate an inflation psychology to an extent that … not seen since the 1970s and early 1980s . ”
“ Many of the steps public authorities have taken over the last year to stabilize the financial system , ” Hoenig warned , “ seem likely to weaken market discipline and extend moral hazard problems to a much wider financial marketplace . ”
Heh … you think ?
The dollar index edged up half a point on the Fed governor ’s words , but still scores a low 73 .
Pending homes sales fell to another all - time low in March , reports the National Association of Realtors today .
Hitting its second consecutive record low , the NAR ’s index dropped to 83 .
That ’s down 1 % from February … and an impressive 20 % decline year over year .
March ’s score is the worst of its kind since the NAR started keeping track in 2001 .
Fannie
Mae reported yesterday it lost $ 2.2 billion in the first quarter .
The government - sponsored mortgage buyer dropped truly hideous numbers on the Street .
Aside from its multibillion - dollar quarterly loss , Fannie said it would be cutting its dividend and taking other measures to raise $ 6 billion in emergency capital .
The firm expects home prices to decline 7 - 9 % this year .
And to post another $ 4 - 5 billion loss .
Naturally , in response , the congressional oversight committee charged with regulating Fannie decided to expand Fannie ’s ability to take more risks .
The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight repealed growth limits placed on Fannie in 2006 , when the company was caught manipulating its books … and lowered Fannie ’s required capital reserves .
In other words , after reporting massive losses and a wretched yearly forecast , Fannie can borrow more and save less .
Right … makes perfect sense .
For perspective , at the end of 2007 , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held $ 83 billion in cash reserves … to back up $ 5 trillion in debts and mortgages .
That ’s leverage of over 60 - to - 1 … and now Congress is suggesting they borrow more and keep even less in reserve .
Unbelievable .
Together , Fannie and Freddie hold 80 % of all American home loans .
Defying logic once again , “ investors ” bought up shares of Fannie on the news .
FNM jumped 9 % following the “ earnings ” announcement .
Wachovia unveiled a nasty earnings report of its own yesterday
.
The bank lost $ 708 million in the first quarter — double the losses Wachovia analysts predicted in preannouncement expectations .
Despite recently raising over $ 8 billion by selling WB shares , Wachovia said it would likely lose another billion or so in the second quarter .
So … traders bought Wachovia , too .
The stock finished up 1 % .
Baltimore ’s own Legg Mason reported its first quarterly loss in company history this morning .
The super - sized fund manager lost $ 255 million during the quarter .
Legg said it would soon sell 20 million preferred shares in a desperate attempt to raise about a billion bucks .
Still , the stock market rallied .
Never mind Fannie or the rancid earnings report from UBS … forget D.R. Horton … and Wachovia …. and Legg. Disregard record - high oil prices … and a sagging dollar .
Cisco and Disney had great quarters !
Buy !
For the day , the Dow finished up 0.4 % , while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq gained 0.7 % .
“ Appalachia is exciting and full of opportunities , ” writes Chris Mayer looking elsewhere than Wall Street for opportunities .
Recent estimates for natural gas reserves hidden in the Appalachian Basin , not too far from our offices here in Baltimore , have showed that the basin might contain 225 trillion cubic feet of natural gas .
That ’s about 15 % of the estimated recoverable unconventional resource base in the U.S .
“ The reserves lie in tight gas sands , shale and coal bed methane reservoirs .
Historically , these areas have been more difficult to reach .
But new technologies and higher natural gas prices — and the decline of the easy - to - get - at conventional wells — mean that it ’s open season in Appalachia .
Adding a natural gas play to your portfolio is probably a smart thing to do .
Chris suggests you check out Appalachia .
We recommend you read the latest Mayer ’s Special Situations .
U.S. gasoline prices held steady overnight despite run-ups elsewhere in the energy sector .
The national average gallon of the cheap stuff still costs $ 3.61 , a cent below its all - time high .
The national average for a gallon of gas will peak around $ 3.73 sometime in June , the Energy Department forecast yesterday .
That ’s the height of the “ summer driving season . ”
For the year , quants at the Energy Department expect gas to average $ 3.52 … 71 cents higher than 2007 .
“ Let ’s talk about the gas problem , ” writes a reader .
“ In my humble opinion , there is a simple solution that most of our population will not consider .
That is : PARK THE FAMILY VEHICLE /S and either walk , take public transportation or stay home .
Sounds pretty simple , but I guarantee you that upward of 75 % of our population would rather pay $ 4 or even $ 5 for gasoline than put their overweight bodies to the test of not driving ( where possible ) or staying home , when the commute makes walking impossible .
“ Heck , most of us ( and I include myself in this ) will drive all around the mall looking for the closest parking space , rather than parking more that 100 steps from the entrance .
We have become an overweight and lazy society . ”
The 5 responds : Heh .
History shows people do n’t change their behavior until they ’re forced to .
“ As I recall , ” responds another to our discussion of the Laffer curve , “ all eight Reagan budgets were submitted to Democrat - controlled Congresses .
They proclaimed each year that the budget was “ dead on arrival , ” and then proceeded to significantly increase spending .
It would be instructive to total up these increases in spending for these eight years and adjust the deficit totals by that total .
That would be a much more accurate way to assign blame for that period of deficit spending .
“ It bears out your point that spending must decrease , something completely lost on the Democrats in those years .
The increases in defense spending during those years was either completely or almost completely covered by the increased revenues , and the deficits were from domestic spending . ”
The 5 : If we do n’t move beyond “ assigning blame ” for deficits … the unborn will pay for our trespasses .
Following the Saturday evening screening of I.O.U.S.A. , a young gentleman approached me … and after a short conversation about the themes and aims of the movie , followed up with this comment by e-mail about stale political ideals :
“ The film , obviously , has the power to raise awareness and start a conversation .
By leaving out ( intentionally , I ’m assuming ) some details or not taking it one step further , the audience are allowed to search for solutions on their own .
Now , generally , this seems to be the aim of a documentary , but people are so uninformed and unimaginative on these issues that they will inevitably search for solutions through the same broken frameworks ( i.e. , the New New Dealers and Lafferites , as you mentioned ) because these are the only ones they are aware of .
“ I can understand that , but I think that there are some things that could be said , that really need to be said , without necessarily losing the audience , specifically regarding basic economics , taxes , and the Fed .
“ Not criticizing here , really just venting and seeking your thoughts , as I ’m sure you ’ve been over these issues countless times in producing this film .
It was difficult to sit in the theater and not comment while some audience members implied the obvious and singular solution is raising taxes , not to mention listening to Sarbanes and the politicophiles behind me whispering , ‘ That ’s SENATOR , not mister !
Do n’t you know who that is ?!?
That ’s a former senator !
That ’s Sen. Sarbanes !’ because Mr. Creadon ,
God forbid , did n’t instantly recognize a former senator .
“ Maybe that ’s part of the problem …we look at our elected officials as near royalty ; better and smarter than us , rather than representatives for us . ”
The 5 : You ’ve hit the nail on the head with respect to some of the frustrations of both making the movie and trying to engage a wider audience in a very important conversation .
People , even among the crew that made the movie , give in easily to the “ same broken frameworks . ”
At that point , rational thought seems to end … and then , mindless emotion carries the day .
But we ’re just getting started .
The film has been accepted into the Impact Film Festival , which will take place during the circus surrounding both the Republican and Democratic national conventions .
Then we ’ll see about broken frameworks .

Written by Claudio Carvalho , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil
I found Julie Rains article , Are Mothers Of Boys ( Only ) Considered Real Moms ( http://parentingsquad.com/are-mothers-of-boys-only-considered-real-moms ) , to be poignant , touching and thought - provoking .
So much so that it actually provoked me into thinking .
Now before I get too far I ’d just like to say that I do n’t believe Julie would ever question her value as a mother , for to do so would be ludicrous , to say the least .
I got a sense that perhaps she was simply pointing out that societies norms are sometimes insensitive to her situation , which is perfectly reasonable .
Whatever be the case , her story made me take a good look at the usual expectations that come with being a parent , most of which are based in long - standing traditions that dictate the respective roles of mothers and fathers , alike .
This , of course , led me to consider the stay - at - home - dad ( SAHD ) and the position that he occupies in the parental universe .
With this in mind , I ’d like to explain why I think SAHDs are good for promoting a happy , healthy and well - balanced family life .
While it goes without saying that both mothers and fathers love their children , a mother ’s maternal instinct makes her hard - wired to always consider her children ’s best interest .
Maybe not always first , but it is usually one of the top five things that occupy her thoughts .
So when mom heads off to work , leaving the children behind with good old dad , she feels enormous guilt .
There could be a little societal pressure in there talking , but it ’s still guilt , and like it or not , guilt motivates .
This same guilt is what inspires these mom to get home and spend quality time with her kids .
Also , if she has any sense of fairness , it ’s her turn to share in the parental duties , which because she ’s a mother , she ’s more than willing to do .
As a result , the kids benefit from having both mom and dad involved in their lives , with the key here being balance .
This same balance does not always exist in the traditional , working father household , where dad would come home after a long , hard day at work and understandably want some time to himself .
This would entail either watching a game or going out with his buddies for a drink or two .
Quality time with his kids is often reserved for the weekends , and even then it can be seen as a chore .
This is because fathers just do n’t seem to feel as guilty as mothers do .
Unfortunately , this lack of guilt gives some fathers license to miss important moments in their kid ’s lives , like recitals or school plays or the big game where his son or daughter might hit their first home run .
And unfortunately , it could even include birthdays .
Then , it ’s not unheard of for the career - working - dad , in the twilight of his life , to reflect on the past and , in what has become a cliché in our society , regret the time lost with his family .
Time that he can never have back , of course .
Though I ’m sure it happens , you just do n’t hear moms say this as often .
Which brings me back to the SAHD .
Now I ’m not hear to promote the idea that men should quit their jobs and stay at home with their kids .
Indeed , if I tried , I ’d get butt kicked .
I ’m also not saying that every mother has an unflagging devotion to her kids , for there are plenty of mothers and fathers alike who ca n’t get rid of their kids fast enough .
I know , I ’m around them every day .
I am saying , however , that two - parent families benefit from the involvement of both parents , and while most moms are probably more inclined to sacrifice their free time for their kids , sometimes a dad needs a little more encouragement .
With this in mind , SAHDs go a long way to promoting that balanced ideal .
Some of you out there are probably thinking that I ’m merely trying to validate my existence as a SAHD , and that is not an outrageous proposition .
Men , after all , are an insecure lot , especially when we operate outside of the traditional boundaries .
It ’s important to keep in mind , however , that you just never really know what ’s going on in the life of a SAHD .
Appearances can be deceiving .
Sure , we spend a majority of our time serving our kids while being surrounded by mothers .
Sure , we cruise around in the mini-van while mom jets off to work in the Porsche .
But some of us live secret lives .
While you ’d never know it by simply looking at us , some of us actually work part time or in the evenings .
A few of us stay at home and renovate the house ( real man ’s work ) while we watch the kids .
And some of us even go so far as to delude ourselves into thinking that we are freelance writers .
I know , I know .
It ’s hard to even imagine .
But stranger things have happened .
Pressure is mounting on Sudan over Darfur .
In January , a long - sought hybrid United Nations and African Union peacekeeping force began working in Darfur , but the Sudanese government ’s quibbling over which countries the troops will come from and bureaucratic delays have stalled the force ’s deployment .
Sudan ’s biggest trading partner and ally , China , has also come under pressure from advocates who have linked the Olympic Games in Beijing this summer to the fighting in Darfur .
China has been more publicly critical of the Sudanese government in recent weeks .
Sudan has also been trying to improve its relationship with the United States , and last week , President Bush ’s new special envoy to Sudan , Richard S. Williamson , visited Darfur and the Sudanese capital , Khartoum , meeting with President Omar al - Bashir .
Any improvement in relations , he said , would be contingent on tangible improvements in the humanitarian situation .
“ Since the first of the year another 75,000 people in Darfur have been displaced , ” Mr. Williamson said in a telephone interview .
“ That is more than a thousand a day .
There are not going to be any changes until that reverses . ”

Origins of a Conflict
Despite the pressure , the government seems determined to fight on , and the most powerful rebel groups  the biggest factions of the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Army  have refused to sit down for talks .
So the violence continues , tracing a familiar arc as it wears on .
It was five years ago last week that an attack by rebels from non-Arab tribes like the Fur , Masalit and Zaghawa , seeking greater wealth and autonomy for the neglected and impoverished region of Darfur , prompted the Arab - dominated government to marshal Arab militias in the region that ultimately evicted millions from their homes , burning , looting and raping along the way .
The campaign effectively pushed many non-Arab people off their land and into vast , squalid camps across Darfur and Chad .
In the first two years of the conflict , 2003 and 2004 , joint attacks by the Sudanese Army , janjaweed militiamen and the government ’s old Russian - made Antonov bombers terrorized Darfur , waging a brutal counterinsurgency against non-Arab rebel groups by attacking their fellow tribesmen in their villages .
At least 200,000 are believed to have died as a result of the violence or sickness and hunger caused by the crisis , according to international estimates , with the majority of violent deaths in that period .
( CNN ) --
More than 100 countries attending a conference in Dublin , Ireland formally adopted a treaty Friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict .
Ali Wansa , a 44 - year - old Lebanese national , lost his leg to a cluster bomb .
The countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain , and they also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions , according to the official treaty document .
The 111 countries attending the two - week meeting agreed to the treaty Wednesday but formally signed it Friday .
The countries said they are " deeply concerned " about civilians suffering the long - term effects of cluster bombs .
They are " concerned that cluster munition remnants kill or maim civilians , including women and children , obstruct economic and social development , including through the loss of livelihood , impede post - conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction , delay or prevent the return of refugees and internally displaced persons , can negatively impact on national and international peace - building and humanitarian assistance efforts , and have other severe consequences that can persist for many years after use , " the document said .
In addition to calling for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , the international accord calls for strong standards to protect those injured by them and to make sure that contaminated areas are cleaned up as quickly as possible and that the weapons are immediately destroyed , a spokesman for the Cluster Munition Coalition told CNN .
Some of the biggest makers and users of cluster bombs cited by human rights groups -- such the United States , Russia , China and Israel -- were not involved in the talks and did not sign the accord .
Organizers expressed hope that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance .
" Even though we all know that there are important states not present , I am also convinced that together we will have succeeded in stigmatizing any future use of cluster munitions , " said Micheal Martin , Ireland 's minister for foreign affairs .
Martin said he ultimately wants to see all U.N. member states ratify the treaty .
The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , said Thomas Nash , coordinator of the Cluster Munition Coalition .
Cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the International Committee of the Red Cross has called a " persistent humanitarian problem . "
Most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not .
Credible estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross .
That means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians .
Earlier this month , a U.S. State Department representative called it " an absolute moral obligation " to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle .
But Acting Assistant Secretary for Political - Military Affairs Stephen D. Mull said the United States was attempting to solve the problem through a disarmament body called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons , or the CCW , which meets in Geneva and comprises major military powers and military trade producers .
The CCW is to meet next in July .
The United States would not agree to any ban because the country considers cluster munitions an important part of its defense strategy , Mull said .
He urged regulation of the weapons to render them harmless after battle .
During the 34 - day war in Lebanon in 2006 , the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the ICRC .
More than 250 civilians and bomb - disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended .
Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo .
" Very quickly after the Kosovo conflict , the major killer of civilians ( was ) not antipersonnel mines or anti-vehicle mines or conventional munitions , but these munitions , " said Lt. Col.
Jim Burke , a military adviser to the Irish Defense Forces .
In more than 20 countries , according to the ICRC , cluster bombs have created lasting " no - go " areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields .
Laos is the most affected country .
Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later .
Still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape .
A single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles .

I just found out that Stephen Colbert 's father and two brothers died in a plane crash on September 11 , 1974 .
Maybe everybody knows this - I 'm not sure because I have n't watched TV in years , so I live in a sort of alternate reality .
My only exposure to TV are YouTube clips of Jon Stewart , Colbert , and lots of Dora The Explorer ( Jon Stewart is my favorite but Swiper The Fox is a close second , do n't tell my kids though ) .
Now , I may not have TV to keep me informed , but I do read aircraft accident reports and transcripts from cockpit voice recorders .
That does n't help in small talk with the neighbors , but you read some amazing stuff .
For example , in the accident that killed Colbert 's father the pilots were chatting about politics and used cars during the landing approach .
They ignored their altitude and eventually ran the plane into the ground about 3 miles away from the destination airport .
The report by the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) states that " both crew members [ first officer and captain ] expressed strong views and mild aggravation concerning the subjects discussed . "
Since the full CVR transcript is not available we 're free to imagine a democrat and a republican arguing amid altitude alerts .
Aviation accidents are both tragic and fascinating ; few accidents can be attributed to a single factor and there is usually , well , a series of unfortunate events leading to a crash .
The most interesting CVR transcript I 've read is Aeroperu 603 .
It covers an entire flight from the moment the airplane took off with its static ports taped over - causing airspeed , altitude , and vertical speed indicators to behave erratically and provide false data - until the airplane inverted into the Pacific Ocean after its left wing touched the sea , concluding a mad , slow descent in which crew members were bombarded with multiple , false , and often conflicting flight alerts .
The transcript captures the increasing levels of desperation , the various alerts , and the plentiful cussing throughout the flight ( there 's also audio with subtitles ) .
As you read it your brain hammers the question : how do we build stuff so things like this can't happen ?
Static ports covered by duct tape in Aeroperu 603
The immediate cause of the Aeroperu problem was a mistake by a ground maintenance worker who left duct tape over the airplane 's static ports .
But there were a number of failures along the way in maintenance procedures , pilot actions , air traffic control , and arguably aircraft design .
This is where agencies like the NTSB and their counterparts abroad do their brilliant and noble work .
They analyze the ultimate reason behind each error and failure and then issue recommendations to eradicate whole classes of problems .
It 's like the five whys of the Toyota Production System coupled with fixes and on steroids .
Fixes are deep and broad , never one - off band aids .
Take the Colbert plane crash .
You could define the problem as " chatter during landing " and prohibit that .
But the NTSB went beyond , they saw the problem as " lack of professionalism " and issued two recommendations to the FAA with a series of concrete steps towards boosting professionalism in all aspects of flight .
Further NTSB analysis and recommendations culminated a few years later in the Sterile Cockpit Rule , which lays down precise rules for critical phases of flight including take off , landing , and operations under 10,000 feet .
Each aviation accident , error , and causal factor spurs recommendations to prevent it , and anything like it , from ever happening again .
Because the solutions are deep , broad , and smart we have achieved remarkable safety in flight .
In other words , it 's the opposite of what we do in software development and computer security .
We programmers like our fixes quick and dirty , yes sirree , " patches " we call them .
It does n't matter how critical the software is .
Until 1997 Sendmail powered 70 % of the Internet 's reachable SMTP servers , qualifying it as critical by a reasonable measure ( its market share has since decreased ) .
What was the security track record ?
We had bug after bug after bug , many with disastrous security implications , and all of them fixed with a patch as specific as possible , thereby guaranteeing years of continued new bugs and exploits .
Of course this is not as serious as human life , but for software it was pretty damn serious : these were bugs allowing black hats to own thousands of servers remotely .
And what have we learned ?
If you fast forward a few years , replace " Sendmail " with " WordPress " and " buffer overflow " with " SQL injection / XSS " , cynics might say " nothing . "
We have different technologies but the same patch - and - run mindset .
I upgraded my blog to WordPress 2.5.1 the other day and boy I feel safe already !
Security problems are one type of bug , the same story happens for other problems .
It 's a habit we programmers have of not fixing things deeply enough , of blocking the sun with a sieve .
We should instead be fixing whole classes of problems so that certain bugs are hard or impossible to implement .
This is easier than it sounds .
Dan Bernstein wrote a replacement for Sendmail called qmail and in 1997 offered a $ 500 reward for anyone who found a security vulnerability in his software .
The prize went unclaimed and after 10 years he wrote a paper reviewing his approaches , what worked , and what could be better .
He identifies only three ways for us to make true progress :
Reduce the bug rate per line of code Reduce the amount of code Reduce trusted code ( which is different than least privilege )
This post deals only with 1 above , I hope to write about the other two later on .
Reducing the bug rate is a holy grail in programming and qmail was very successful in this area .
I 'm sure it did n't hurt that Bernstein is a genius , but his techniques are down to earth :
For many years I have been systematically identifying error - prone programming habits — by reviewing the literature , analyzing other people ’s mistakes , and analyzing my own mistakes — and redesigning my programming environment to eliminate those habits . (...)
Most programming environments are meta - engineered to make typical software easier to write .
They should instead be meta - engineered to make incorrect software harder to write .
In the 1993 book Writing Solid Code Steve Maguire gives similar advice :
The most critical requirement for writing bug - free code is to become attuned to what causes bugs .
All of the techniques in this book are the result of programmers asking themselves two questions over and over again , year after year , for every bug found in their code :
How could I have automatically detected this bug ?
detected this bug ?
How could I have prevented this bug ?
For a concrete example , look at SQL Injection .
How do you prevent it ?
If you prevent it by remembering to sanitize each bit of input that goes to the database , then you have not solved the problem , you are using a band aid with a failure rate - it 's Russian Roulette .
But you can truly solve the problem by using an architecture or tools such that SQL Injections are impossible to cause .
The Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord does this to some degree .
In C# 3.0 , a great language in many regards , SQL Injections are literally impossible to express in the language 's built - in query mechanism .
This is the kind of all - encompassing , solve - it - once - and - for - all solution we must seek .
It 's important to take a broad look at our programming environments to come up with solutions for preventing bugs .
This mindset matters more than specific techniques ; we 've got to be in the habit of going well beyond the first " why " .
Why have we wasted hundreds of thousands of man hours looking for memory leaks , buffer overflows , and dangling pointers in C / C++ code ?
It was n't just because you forgot to free ( ) or you kept a pointer improperly , no .
That was a symptom .
The reality is that for most projects using C/C++ was the bug , it did n't just facilitate bugs .
We can't tolerate environments that breed defects instead of preventing them .
Multi - threaded programming is another example of a perverse environment where things are opposite of what they should be : writing correct threading code is hard ( really hard ) , but writing threading bugs is natural and takes no effort .
Any design that expects widespread mastery of concurrency , ordering , and memory barriers as a condition for correctness is doomed from the start .
It needs to be fixed so that bug - free code is automatic rather than miraculous .
There are a number of layers that can prevent a bug from infecting your code : software process , tools , programming language , libraries , architecture , unit tests , your own habits , etc .
Troubleshooting this whole programming stack , not just code , is how we can add depth and breadth to our fixes and make progress .
The particulars depend on what kind of programming you do , but here are some questions that might be worth asking , in the spirit of the questions above , when you find a bug :
Are you using the right programming language ?
Does it handle memory for you ?
Does it help minimize lines of code and duplication ?
( Here 's a good overall comparison and an interesting empirical study )
Could a better library or framework have prevented the bug ( as in the SQL Injection example above ) ?
Can architecture changes prevent that class of bug or mitigate their impact ?
Why did your unit tests fail to catch the bug ?
Could compiler warnings , static analysis , or other tools have found this bug ?
Is it at all possible to avoid explicit threading ?
If so , shun threads because they 're a bad idea .
Otherwise , can you eliminate bugs by isolating the threads ( reduce shared state aggressively , use read - only data structures , use as few locks as possible ) .
Is your error - handling strategy simple and consistent ?
Can you centralize and minimize catch blocks for exceptions ?
Are your class interfaces bug prone ?
Can you change them to make correct usage obvious , or better yet , incorrect usage impossible ?
Could argument validation have prevented this bug ?
Assertions ?
Would you have caught this bug if you regularly stepped through newly written code in a debugger while thinking of ways to make the code fail ?
Could software process tools have prevented this bug ?
Continuous integration , code reviews , programming conventions and so on can help a lot .
Can you modify your processes to reduce bug rate ?
Have you read Code Complete and the Pragmatic Programmer ?
As airplanes still crash we 'll always have our bugs , but we could do a lot better by improving our programming ecosystem and habits rather than just fixing the problem of the hour .
The outstanding work of the NTSB is great inspiration .
I 'm still scared of flying though - think of all the software in those planes !

So there I was , listening to a few of the major " architects " of the war in Iraq -- Paul Wolfowitz , formerly No. 2 man at the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld ; Douglas J. Feith , formerly No. 3 man at the Pentagon under Rumsfeld ; Peter Rodman , another former senior adviser to Rumsfeld ; and Dan Senor , former senior adviser to Paul Bremer of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) .
They had assembled at the Hudson Institute in Washington , D.C. , for a discussion of Feith 's new book , " War and Decision : Inside the Pentagon at the Dawn of the War on Terrorism , " but what they were drawn to discuss was what went wrong with the war in Iraq .
A rather large topic .
Would it cover , perhaps , such grand themes as the multicultural Big Lie that insists Western ways may be grafted -- presto ! -- onto Islamic cultures ?
Or maybe the difficulties inherent in the Western - style , humane projection of power against seventh - century terrorist barbarians ?
No .
The main discussion I heard turned more or less on one extremely narrow point of historic contention .
It concerned the CPA rule of Iraq , which came to an end almost exactly four years ago .
Wolfowitz and Feith , and Rodman to a less explicit degree , agreed that this period of American governance -- that is , the interlude before Iraq officially became sovereign -- was the fatal flaw , the fly in the ointment , the monkey wrench , the skunk at the garden party , the bad penny and overall cause of all of America 's troubles in Iraq .
It was n't the overweening Bush administration plan for Jeffersonizing the Fertile Crescent , or our leaders ' misreading of the " democratic ally " potential therein .
It was the 14 - month - reign of the CPA that caused all our woes .
The CPA , the argument goes , in effect created the Sunni insurgency , which later gave rise to the Sunni - Shiite wars , and which ultimately required the added infusion of American troops known as the surge .
If I 'm following this theory correctly , there is absolutely nothing in Iraqi history , politics , religion , sectarianism or culture that manifested itself in the bloody insurgency that followed the removal of Saddam Hussein .
According to Feith & Co. , it was only the American face on ( and muscle behind ) initial efforts to bring order , civil society and air conditioning to Iraq that made the newly ejected - from - power Sunnis ( and others ) organize , shoot , stab , blow up , maim and make violence a fact of Iraqi life to this day , four years into Iraqi sovereignty .
This sounds a bit like the asinine theory that tells us U.S. foreign policy made 19 jihadists attack us on 9/11 .
But is n't there also something a little goofy about the notion that if only the United States had n't run an occupation government for a year , everything in Iraq would be hunky - dory ?
Not surprisingly , the CPA 's Senor did n't agree with the Feithian proposition , arguing that the lack of a U.S. counterinsurgency strategy was a bigger problem .
He did n't get much argument that this was a problem ; indeed , Wolfowitz agreed the United States was , as he put it a trifle breezily , " pretty much clueless on counterinsurgency . "
The classic clueless moment , however , came later in answer to a question from the floor :
Did the administration ever tell Syria , Iran and Saudi Arabia to bar combatants from crossing their borders into Iraq -- or else ?
And if not ( " not " is clearly the answer since these borders have been Grand Central Station for jihadists ) , why not ?
Wolfowitz owned up that the United States had said something or other at some point , but , overall , the consensus on the dais came down to a big , shrugging non-answer .
I got one of those answers myself , at least from Feith .
I asked :
What did these gentlemen think the United States would ultimately get out of Iraq in exchange for our massive investment of blood and treasure ?
And had they learned anything to make them doubt the president 's often - repeated promise that Iraq would become an " ally " in the " war on terror " ?
Shrug .
Not interested in answering .
Looking back , there was a narrowness in the scope of discussion that time constraints alone can't explain .
It was as though the men believed every clue to heartbreak in Iraq could be found in the chain of events as they had already occurred -- in papers already generated , debates already argued , rounds of infighting already waged , decisions already executed .
In other words , to these men , there would seem to be nothing new worth pondering -- like , for instance , the havoc Islamic ways wreak on Western - style nation - building .
Shrug .
The intensifying American banking crisis threatens the stability of its economy and the world ’s .
Where is it leading ?
Global financial stability has been shaken and America is facing a growing economic crisis that could make the 1930s look like “ good times . ”
The U.S. banking system is on the verge of disaster , as banks have recorded over $ 100 billion in losses , with hundreds of billions more forecasted .
Simply put , America ’s banks are staring into a financial abyss .
What started with subprime mortgage losses in 2007 is now growing into a full - blown financial crisis .
Consider just one example .
As of January 2008 , Stockton , Calif . ( pop. 280,000 ) , had 4,200 homes in default or foreclosure , with bad loans totaling a staggering $ 1.4 billion .
According to CBS News , Stockton has gone from being one of the hottest real estate markets to the foreclosure capital of America .
Prices of homes in the city have dropped as much as 70 % .
In many of the nation ’s cities , towns and smaller communities , Stockton - like scenarios are playing out .
Banks are busy auctioning off houses at “ fire sale ” prices .
And the news keeps growing worse .
Once proud banking titans Merrill Lynch and Citigroup had to look to investments from Asian and Middle Eastern governments ( through “ Sovereign - Wealth Funds ” ) to shore up their balance sheets .
They were rescued by life - saving injections of $ 6.6 billion and $ 14.5 billion , respectively .
European banks have also been affected , as Swiss , German , French and British banks have suffered billions of dollars in losses .
The losses are not confined to banks alone .
One of the world ’s largest insurance companies , American International Group , recently reported losses from the mortgage crisis of up to $ 5 billion — up from a previous estimate of $ 2 billion .
This may be a sign of coming reassessments by others as the crisis intensifies .
At a meeting of the G7 finance leaders , German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck stated that the G7 feared losses from the subprime mortgages could reach as high as $ 400 billion ( nearly as large as the entire economy of Holland , ranked 16th worldwide ) .
Highlighting the gravity of the economic situation , U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson described it as “ challenging and uncertain . ”
A deadly combination of the credit crunch , the collapsing housing market , increasing energy prices , and the threat of rising inflation are rapidly weakening America ’s economy .
The crisis threatens to engulf banks and other financial institutions , affecting pension funds , mutual funds and insurance companies .
The situation is so grave that President George W. Bush and the Federal Reserve ( the Fed ) have implemented unprecedented emergency measures , including stimulus plans , tax rebates and interest rate freezes , in an effort to prevent total collapse .
The stability of the global economy is at stake .
Traditional vs. Modern Banking
Banks traditionally operated by taking deposits from their customers and lending money to those seeking loans .
The difference between the interest rate paid on deposits and the higher one charged on loans ( the “ spread ” ) was their profit .
If customers defaulted on their loans , banks were liable to depositors for payment — the banks held the risk “ on the books , ” 100 % their responsibility .
It was therefore in a bank ’s best interest to carefully screen customers ’ ability to repay before providing loans .
The customer needed to have a good job , adequate assets , and was required to make a sizable down - payment .
This conservative approach to lending enabled banks to make tidy profits for decades , while staying financially sound .

However , the 1990s saw banks change their traditional way of operating .
Seeking higher and higher profits to satisfy shareholders and to secure executive performance - pay bonuses , banks decided they could make even higher profits if they loaned out more money .
To do this , they used other people ’s money through “ securitization , ” a process that allows banks to convert hundreds , even thousands , of mortgages into bonds and then sell the bonds to investors , such as pension funds , mutual funds , insurance companies and other banks .
Banks did not make a profit through the “ spread ” anymore , but instead made a fee for having put together ( “ originated ” ) the loan , now owned by other investors .
Further , the bonds were insured by specialized insurance companies ( so - called “ monoline ” insurers ) , and were rated as safe investments by the rating agencies ( i.e. , Standard & Poor ’s , Moody ’s , and Fitch ) .
Since the loans were now “ off the books ” and insured , the banks felt comfortable about “ originating ” even more loans .
Through their new fee - based income , banks made much higher profits than ever before .
Reckless Lending
In their quest for higher profits , banks no longer felt the need to carefully screen loan applicants , as they once did .
Customers who did not qualify for loans under the banks ’ standard lending procedures ( i.e. , “ subprime ” customers ) were now targeted as a lucrative source of income , and marketed aggressively to .
Loans were provided to people with no income , no job and no assets ( so - called NINJA loans ) .
Additional “ sweetener ” incentives were also provided , such as no down payment required and interest - only payments .
Those who initiated the loans and approved them were no longer attached to the risk , and were paid handsomely for their efforts .
The subprime mortgage market became a ticking bomb , ready to explode at any time .
Enter the Fed
MCT
Two developments have played a significant role in the development of modern banking and the current crisis .
The first was deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry with the 1999 repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , after years of lobbying by the banks .
Carefully crafted during the Great Depression to control speculation in the stock market , Glass - Steagall prevented retail banks , insurance companies and investment banks from owning each other .
With the repeal of Glass - Steagall , massive financial services conglomerates were suddenly formed , combining these three types of financial institutions .
Industry behemoths such as Citigroup and JP Morgan quickly came into being .
This meant that retail banks seeking higher and higher profits could now dive headlong into high - risk speculative ventures through ownership of ( or being owned by ) investment banks , which led to disastrous consequences during the Stock Market Crash of 1929 .
The second was the low interest rate policy pursued by the Federal Reserve .
Low interest rates encouraged banks to target subprime customers with variable rate mortgages .
Banks offered initially low interest rates ( “ teaser ” rates ) , to be increased two or three years later .
Because of rising house prices , customers took the bait believing they could refinance their homes at an affordable rate when the time for the reset arrived .
A Culture of Greed
In many cases , mortgage brokers misrepresented terms and conditions to eager customers who provided them with fraudulent information .
Sometimes banks did not even bother to check the information provided .
“ Predatory lending ” was compounded by “ predatory borrowing ” !
Banks sold risky bonds as safe investments to unsuspecting investors .
Rating agencies , paid by the banks , rated risky bonds ( those with subprime components ) as safe — even giving them the highest rating .
With substantial increases in real estate prices occurring every year , builders went on a building spree around the nation .
This created a sense of “ easy money ” — “ something for nothing . ”
In their greed , many were “ scamming the system . ”
At a meeting in Toronto , Canada , billionaire investor Warren Buffet commented , “ It ’s sort of a little poetic justice , in that the people that brewed this toxic Kool - Aid found themselves drinking a lot of it in the end ” ( Reuters ) .
Crisis Strikes
The crisis started in the summer of 2007 .
Due to the surplus of homes on the market , housing prices fell moderately — tipping the scales .
Also around this time , the first batch of interest rate resets came due .
Faced with exploding monthly payments , falling house prices , and an inability to refinance their mortgages , many customers defaulted on their loans .
Lenders call it “ jingle mail , ” as so many homeowners are just turning in their keys .
Confronted with higher monthly payments on mortgages that are greater than the value of their homes , homeowners are abandoning their mortgages .
Many feel no moral obligation to fulfill what they promised to repay , believing it is better to walk away from their homes .
They feel that while this hurts their credit rating , in the short - term it hurts less than the downward spiral toward bankruptcy .
This change in attitude is in stark contrast to years ago when borrowers felt a moral duty to pay off their loans .
With the morals and values of the nation disintegrating , many lack the character and fiscal responsibility of previous generations .
Crisis Spreads
As the crisis intensifies , mortgage defaults are multiplying .
And everyone is on the hook .
“ Monoline ” insurance companies have suddenly become liable for multiple billions of dollars of debt .
Investors have been left holding bonds that may never be repaid .
Banks are finding it difficult to sell additional bonds as investors have backed out of the market , leery of poor investments .
Thus , the banks ’ fee income has dried up — leaving them with massive deficiencies in capital .
As credit problems mount , banks have sharply reduced lending to each other and the public , fearful the loans will not be repaid ( the “ credit crunch ” ) .
Shockwaves from the crisis are also being felt in other sectors of the economy .
Evidence of this is clear , as liquidity dries up and less money is available to finance commercial loans .
Recently , a group of bankers were unable to back $ 14 billion of debt to finance an entertainment company .
Other major deals in the tens of billions are now in jeopardy .
Deutsche Bank had to repossess some Manhattan buildings because a well - known developer was unable to refinance $ 7 billion of debt .
The credit crunch has pushed beyond retail banking ; it is now affecting major business deals and even commercial real estate .
And municipal bonds ( used to fund cities , colleges and hospitals ) , which were once considered safe investments , can no longer readily find buyers .
As more and more loans arrive at interest rate resets , more defaults will occur , deepening the crisis .
A financial tsunami is rapidly approaching America ’s shores !
Kings Become Beggars
Increasingly , America ’s banks have been forced to look to other nations for capital .
Recently , U.S. banks received massive infusions of capital from Asian and Middle Eastern sources that are purchasing larger stakes in America ’s largest bank institutions .
During the G7 meeting mentioned earlier , Toshihiko Fukui , governor of the Bank of Japan , made a statement that could have serious ramifications , as the banking crisis further deteriorates : “ If everyone does the same thing it wo n’t be any more effective .
Each country needs to do what is best for its own particular situation . ”
In the near future , will countries that have so often supported America financially stop doing so , causing the crisis to spiral out of control ?
Recent news spotlighted a trend in New York that was unimaginable just a few years ago : Some shops are now accepting Euros for payment of merchandise .
While accepting foreign currency has been the norm along the Canadian and Mexican border , accepting it in the financial capital of the world is a sign of a weakening U.S. economy .
This distrust of American capital is just the tip of the iceberg , as people and nations are learning there are alternatives to the U.S. for security and investment .
Time will tell if the ongoing financial irresponsibility of America will cause the world “ to do what is best for its own particular situation . ”
If this happens , it will hasten the demise of the U.S. as the world ’s financial leader .
There are indications that this has already begun .
In its Jan. 15 issue , the Financial Times noted , “ The U.S. looks poised to lose its mantle as the world ’s dominant financial market because of a rapid rise in the depth and maturity of markets in Europe , a study suggests .
The change may have occurred already , not least because the U.S. markets are beset by credit woes , according to research by McKinsey Global Institute . ”
The American banking crisis shows the vulnerability of the global economic system .
The world is looking for an alternate , and America will be replaced as the financial engine of the world by a superpower soon to arise in Europe .
The good news is that a new — and far superior !— global economy will one day be established .
Instead of being rooted in greed and corruption , this future worldwide financial system — which will benefit every nation , small and great — will be based on outgoing concern for others .
From individuals to businesses to government bodies , all will practice fiscal responsibility during the soon - coming age the Bible refers to as “ the world to come ” ( Matt. 12:32 ; Mark 10:30 ) .
Until then , there are financial laws and principles found in God ’s Word that — if faithfully lived by — would bring a multitude of benefits here and now , in this current age .

Iron Maiden
Wednesday night was a good day to rock , as Iron Maiden rolled out hit after hit in front of a 12,500 strong crowd in Concord , CA .
“ I think there are a few new faces out there , ” was how Bruce Dickinson opened up one of the band ’s songs .
“ Some younger people who were n’t even born when we wrote some of these songs 25 years ago , ” he follows .
When I first heard this the first thing that came to mind was how true his words were ; after all I ’m just 20 , but even I know what the band ’s represents for metal and what they ’ve managed to achieve over the years .
I can only bow my head and wait for their next concert in August .
Anyway back to the concert .
Although they may seem wrinkled and rusty Iron Maiden still has it in them , as the band performed a two hour long gig , spiting hit , after hit , including extended versions of ‘ Wasted Years , ’ ‘ Run to the Hills , ’ ‘ Number of the Beast ’ and ‘ Powerslave . ’
Sadly or not , for the Maiden nostalgics , Bruce announced that many of their hits will go in retirement for a while , explaining that next time they ’ll be back ( in Concord , CA ) , they ’ll play some new songs from the upcoming album .
That ’s right folks a new album is in the works .
They ’re last album to date , the 2006 A Matter of Life And Death , was a huge success from all points of view .
Tobacco smokers who eat three servings of fruits and vegetables per day and drink green or black tea may be protecting themselves from lung cancer , according to a first - of - its - kind study by UCLA cancer researchers .
UCLA researchers found that smokers who ingested high levels of natural chemicals called flavonoids in their diet had a lower risk of developing lung cancer , an important finding since more than 90 percent of lung cancers are caused by tobacco smoking .
The study was published recently in the journal Cancer .
" What we found was extremely interesting , that several types of flavonoids are associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer among smokers , " said Dr. Zuo-Feng Zhang , a researcher at UCLA 's Jonsson Cancer Center and a professor of public health and epidemiology .
" The findings were especially interesting because tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer . "
Flavonoids are water - soluble plant pigments that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties , both of which can counteract damage to tissues .
For the UCLA study , researchers looked at 558 people with lung cancer and 837 people who did not have lung cancer and analyzed their dietary history .
Researchers found that study participants who ate foods containing certain flavonoids seemed to be protected from developing lung cancer .
Zhang said the flavonoids that appeared to be the most protective included catechin , found in strawberries and green and black teas , kaempferol , found in Brussels sprouts and apples , and quercetin , found in beans , onions and apples .

So should smokers run out and stock up on the teas , apples , beans and strawberries ?
Quitting smoking is the best course of action , Zhang said , but eating more fruits and vegetables and drinking more black and green teas wo n't hurt .
" Since this study is the first of its type , I would usually be hesitant to make any recommendations to people about their diet , " Zhang said .
" We really need to have several larger studies with similar results to confirm our finding .
However , it 's not a bad idea for everyone to eat more fruits and vegetables and drink more tea . "
Zhang said flavonoids protect against lung cancer by blocking the formation of blood vessels that tumors develop so they can grow and spread , a process called angiogenesis .
They also stop cancer cells from growing , allowing for naturally programmed cell death , or apoptosis , to occur .
The antioxidant properties found in the flavonoids also may work to counteract the DNA damaging effects of tobacco smoking , Zhang said , explaining why they affected the development of lung cancer in smokers but not in non-smokers .
" The naturally occurring chemicals may be working to reduce the damage caused by smoking , " Zhang said .
The next step , Zhang said , are laboratory - based studies of flavonoids on cell lines and animal models to determine how they are protecting smokers from developing lung cancer .
And in addition to larger studies to confirm these findings , other studies need to be done to see if the protective effects of flavonoids extend to other smoking - related cancers , such as bladder , head and neck and kidney cancers .
Zhang and his team also plan to study which types of fruits and vegetables have the highest levels of the flavonoids found to be helpful in this study and what the optimal number of servings per day might be to provide the greatest protection .

Volcanic Lightning
The cause of volcanic lightning is not completely understood .
Geologists assume that the cause is similar to the cause of lightning in thunderstorms .
From an electric universe point of view , the Earth is a small charged body moving in a large cell of plasma , and there is charge waiting for a connection to it .
More than 150 times in the past two centuries , volcanic eruptions have been accompanied by spectacular displays of lightning .
Sometimes broad bolts of lightning streak across the sky .
Other times St. Elmo's fire ( ball lightning ) cascades from above .
Sometimes volcanoes produce branching displays such as at Sakurajima ( see photo above . )
The 1981 eruption of Mt St Helens featured a spectacular display of sheet lightning , with truck - sized balls of St Elmo 's fire seen rolling along the ground 29 miles north of the mountain .
Other well - known volcanoes that produced lightning include Vesuvius ( 1944 ) , Krakatau ( 1990's ) , Surtsey , the new volcanic island in Iceland ( 1963 ) , and Paracutin , the cinder cone that grew out of a farmer 's field in Mexico ( 1940's . )
The cause of volcanic lightning is not completely understood .
Geologists assume that the cause is similar to the cause of lightning in thunderstorms , which is also not completely understood .
[ For discussion of lightning , see TPOD Sept 17 , 2004 , Weather : Fair , Foul and Electric ]
For years , geologists have talked about charge separation caused by volcanic dust particles colliding and building up static charges .
Recently a new theory has been proposed that relies on the water content of magma .
From an electric universe point of view , the Earth is a small charged body moving in a large cell of plasma .
Because of this , explanations of all physical phenomena in , on , and near the Earth must take the electrical behavior of plasma into account .
The Physics of the Plasma Universe by Anthony Peratt describes magma as a plasma , a medium containing moving charges .
So we should expect volcanoes not only to exhibit electrical behavior but to have that behavior connected with the larger plasma environment , that is , to be elements in a larger electrical circuit .
But why do some volcanoes produce lightning while others do n't ?
More curious , why do some volcanoes with large dusty plumes produce little or no lightning and others with small or mediocre plumes produce much lightning ?
The simple answer could be that all volcanoes are electric but that the lightning displays happen only when the resistance to the volcanic current is high .
You have a good example of this in your home .
The electric wires that carry the current from the wall socket to your lamp do n't produce heat or light .
But when that same current encounters the high resistance of a tungsten filament , it does produce heat and light .
By studying the electrical component of volcanoes on Earth , plasma geologists can gather clues about the mysteries of Earth 's volcanic geologic history .
For example , it may help to explain why volcanism in the past -- the great basalt floods -- was hotter and more voluminous than in the present .
And it may even help explain why Mars has volcanoes that are many times larger than any found on Earth today .
Were Earth and Mars subjected to more powerful plasma interactions in the past ?

What will it take for Congress to do something about Bush ?
The constant bald - faced lies , about , quite literally , everything .
The constant effort on the part of his administration to frighten the citizens of this country ( and elsewhere ) , to intimidate those who object to their policies , and to hunt down and destroy anyone who dares tell the truth about what is really going on behind the scenes .
The constant destruction of our country ’s good name overseas due to a foreign policy of “ Do what we say , or else . ”
And the constant deterioriation of our Constitution , the very framework for what makes our country so great not only in the eyes of the rest of the world , but historically as well .
But if you think the Constitution means nothing to Bush and Cheney , imagine how little it means to the members of Congress who raised their hands and took an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic .
They ’ve stood by and let him do it all with impunity .
Not only have they not done anything , but , collectively , they have n’t even tried .
Their excuse is that we did n’t send enough Democrats to Congress to impeach Bush and Cheney , so they did n’t bother to try .
They say they want to use Republican corruption as a campaign issue in ’08 .
This is a stupid and time - wasting ploy .
They would have an even better campaign issue if they got every Republican in Congress to stand up say that what Bush and Cheney have done to our Constitution was far less of a threat than what Bill Clinton did .
But no , they would n’t even try .
Here is a song called “ Bush In a Bubble ” , based on lead song of Paul Simon ’s fantastic Graceland album , “ The Boy in the Bubble ” .
I hope you enjoy it .

It was a slow day and the truth was fleeting
To reporters on the side of the show
There was a bright lie , a shattering of principles
The boss at the TV station was tired of talk radio
These are the days of presidents who plunder
This is a long wake - up call
The way the media follows it is so slow
The way it looks to us all
The way we look to a tattered Constitution
That ’s dying from accumulated lies
These are the days of presidents who plunder
But do n’t try , Congress , do n’t try , do n’t try
It was a lie , Friend , and it swept us through the desert
And unfurled into a circle of gloom
And the dead men falling by their children
The Sunni and the Shia and the systematic doom
These are the days of presidents who plunder
This is a long wake - up call
The way the media follows it is so slow
The way it looks to us all , oh yeah
The way we look to a tattered Constitution
That ’s dying from accumulated lies
These are the days of presidents who plunder
But do n’t try , Congress , do n’t try , do n’t try
It ’s a terrorist bomb plot , it ’s everybody ’s fears start ,
It ’s every dollar borrowed goes to zeroes up in Wal - Mart
Discipline is practical and practical is smart
But we got Bush in a bubble like a baby with a baboon heart
And I believe these are days of tasers in the suburbs ,
Tasers in the suburbs somewhere
Official memos with useless information
A tax - free celebration of millionaires and billionaires , and Congress ,
These are the days of presidents who plunder
This is a long wake - up call
The way the media follows it is so slow
The way it looks to us all , oh yeah
The way we look to a tattered Constitution
That ’s dying from accumulated lies
These are the days of presidents who plunder
But do n’t try , Congress , do n’t try , do n’t try
Hillary Wo n’t be Deposed in Campaign Fraud Case Until After the Election
I suppose this should n’t surprise me , and in fact it does n’t .
Hillary Clinton , who is being sued for campaign fraud by Peter Paul , is going to be deposed in the trial .
This trial has been ongoing for five years and it has been delayed until after the election .
Figures .
While Hillary has claimed that Obama has gotten a free ride in the press ( at least until the Reverend Wright controversy ) , this story has gone virtually unreported .
In case you have n’t heard about this , you can read my previous posts on this issue here , and here .
The second link contains a video which may show Hillary committing felony campaign fraud .
Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz of Los Angeles ruled Friday that Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) , vying for the Democratic presidential nomination , will not have to be deposed in the fraud lawsuit brought by Hollywood businessman Peter F. Paul against former President Bill Clinton until after the November 2008 elections the recent court ruling — barring appeal — could effectively remove any possibility that Sen .
Clinton would be deposed on the matter in the midst of a presidential campaign , were she to be the nominee .
Hillary Clinton admitted that she “ misremembered ” , I ’m sorry I meant “ under - reported ” how much money she raised at an event held by Peter Paul and had to pay a fine .
Now this story is going to be buried until after the election .
Perfect .
The Clinton ’s have been involved in so many campaign scandals that maybe the media is right , this is n’t news because it happens so often .
Everyone knows the Clinton ’s are crooked , so it is accepted .
It sounds like Hillary is getting a free ride in the press to me .
And in the judicial branch also .
In an order posted today on the its website , the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it will not be hearing the Murphy v. IRS appeal .
Although this is a disappointing turn of events , whistleblower and civil rights advocates should continue the fight for tax justice , both in other judicial venues , and in the halls of Congress .
In response to the news , the National Whistleblower Center put out the following press release :

U.S. Supreme Court Refuses to Hear Murphy v. IRS
Advocates To Continue Pressing for Changes in Civil Rights Tax Law
WASHINGTON , DC — Today , the United States Supreme Court announced its decision not to grant certiorari in the case of Murphy v. IRS .
The order , posted on the Court ’s website this morning , means that the IRS can continue to tax non-pecuniary compensatory damages awarded to victims of whistleblower retaliation and other civil rights violations .
These damage awards , which are intended to make the victim " whole " again , include payments for loss of reputation and emotional distress .
The case was brought by Marrita Murphy , an environmental whistleblower who won her case before Department of Labor , and was awarded compensatory damages to vindicate her rights under six federal environmental whistleblower statutes .
Murphy filed suit when the IRS demanded that she pay taxes on the " make - whole " award as if it were income .
After having her case dismissed , Murphy filed an appeal .
After full briefing and oral argument , the Appeals court initially held that Murphy ’s award was not income and the tax on her damages violated the U.S. Constitution .
Then , under pressure from the Bush Administration , the judges decided to rehear the case .
In this ruling , Murphy II , the D.C. Circuit reversed its own previous decision , declaring that non-physical compensatory damages are taxable as gross income .
National Whistleblower Center General Counsel David K Colapinto , who represents Ms. Murphy , released the following statements regarding the Court ’s decision
" The DC Circuit ’s decision was contradictory and wrong .
It will have a tragic impact on thousands of whistleblowers and victims of discrimination .
We are not surprised though , that the Supreme Court declined to hear the case , as there was not a traditional " split in the circuits , " as the DC Circuit was the first court to take this issue on .
Given the DC Circuit ’s difficulty in dealing with this issue , I expect that it will be taken up in other courts across the country . "
" It is unfair and unconstitutional to tax victims of discrimination and retaliation when the awards were simply compensation to make them whole again .
The money is to restore a loss for personal injury ; it is not income . "
Unfortunately , as a result of the Court ’s decision not to hear the Murphy case , whistleblowers and other civil rights victims whose make whole compensatory damages awards are taxed will have to continue to fight the IRS through the courts .
The only alternative to continued litigation is for Congress to change the tax code .
Currently pending before Congress is the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act of 2007 ( " CRTRA " ) , H.R. 1540 , which would end unfair taxation of noneconomic damages received by those who have suffered unlawful discrimination in the workplace or other violations of their employment rights .
The CRTRA was introduced in the House by Representative John Lewis ( D - GA ) , who was joined by a bipartisan group of original CRTRA cosponsors , including Representatives Deborah Pryce ( R- OH ) , Sander Levin ( D - MI ) , Jim Ramstad ( R- MN ) , Xavier Becerra ( D - CA ) , and Phil English ( R - PA ) .
The Senate companion bill was introduced by Senators Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) and Susan Collins ( R- ME ) .
The CRTRA has broad bi-partisan support .
It is supported by employer and employee advocacy groups alike because both business and employee organizations recognize that taxing non-economic make whole compensatory damages makes settlement more difficult and results in protracted litigation in employment disputes .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China warned foreign groups on Wednesday not to use the Summer Olympics to pressure Beijing , presenting the nation as a “ responsible ” but poor power eager to end rows over trade , pollution and human rights .

China has been buffeted ahead of the Games by worries over dirty air and international protests over human rights , Tibet , Sudan ’s Darfur and other controversies that often irk Chinese diplomats .
Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told critics to back off , accusing them of violating the Olympic Games charter keeping politics away from sports .
“ I do n’t believe that the international community wants to politicize the Beijing Olympics .
That ’s a handful of individuals and forces extremely unfriendly to China and bearing massive prejudices , ” Yang told reporters .
China welcomed “ well - intentioned ” criticism of the Games , he said .
“ But those who want to tarnish China -- and hear me , I said China -- wo n’t succeed . ”
The scholarly - looking diplomat made the comments in a news conference coinciding with the annual national parliament , and carefully answered questions on the United States , Japan and European Union , arguing that China wanted cooperation , not contention .
But his comments also came after a slew of news that underscored the headaches China faces in holding the huge , live - to - air sporting spectacle that starts on August 8 .
In February , Oscar - winning film director Steven Spielberg quit as an artistic adviser to the Games , claiming that China had failed to use enough sway in Sudan to seek an end to bloodshed in Darfur .
This week has seen protest marches against the Games by Tibetan refugees .
Ethiopia ’s marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie announced he will not race in Beijing because of health fears from pollution .
And Chinese officials announced a domestic flight from the restive western region of Xinjiang was grounded over fears of a terrorist attack , stirring concern about security around the Games .
But Yang said the Chinese capital would be safe and clean for visitors and the event would seal , not sour , friendly ties .
“ The international community and governments , leaders and the publics of countries across the world warmly support a successful Olympics , showing their deep friendly feeling for the Chinese people , ” Yang said .
“ China of course is one of the safest places in the world ” , ” he added .
Beijing ’s Games have been presented as a chance for China to brandish its growing prosperity and pride , with the government pouring billions into new subway lines and shining stadiums .
But in response to questions about Africa and climate change policy , Yang also said China was still a poor country , too focused on its own development to bear too much of an international burden , especially in cutting greenhouse gas pollution .
“ China is a responsible member of the international community , ” Yang said .
“ At the same time , as a developing country , frankly , China cannot assume international responsibilities beyond its own capacity to bear . ”
China is set to surpass the United States as the world ’s top emitter of carbon dioxide , but says it will not accept fixed caps on emissions and the burden in fighting climate change should fall on rich countries , who create much more pollution per head .
“ It ’s like there is one person who eats three slices of bread for breakfast , and there are three of them who eat only one slice .
Who should be on a diet ? ” , Yang said .
He also said “ transfer emissions ” -- the environmental costs of products produced in one country and then exported to -- should be considered in emissions calculations .
Asked about U.S. criticisms of China ’s strict leash on citizens ’ political activities , Yang accompanied a call for more friendly dialogue with a prickly warning .
“ We resolutely oppose clinging to a Cold War mentality and drawing an ideological line to engage in confrontation and double standards , ” he said .
US banks quietly borrow massive amounts from Federal Reserve Reuters

Print This Email This NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Banks in the United States have been quietly borrowing " massive amounts " from the U.S. Federal Reserve in recent weeks , using a new measure the Fed introduced two months ago to help ease the credit crunch , according to a report on the web site of The Financial Times .
The newspaper said the use of the Fed 's Term Auction Facility ( TAF ) , which allows banks to borrow at relatively attractive rates against a wide range of their assets , saw borrowing of nearly $ 50 billion of one - month funds from the Fed by mid-February .
The Financial Times said the move has sparked unease among some analysts about the stress developing in opaque corners of the U.S. banking system and the banks ' growing reliance on indirect forms of government support .
The Financial Times :
The use of the Feds Term Auction Facility , which allows banks to borrow at relatively attractive rates against a wider range of their assets than previously permitted , saw borrowing of nearly $ 50bn of one - month funds from the Fed by mid-February .
US officials say the trend shows that financial authorities have become far more adept at channelling liquidity into the banking system to alleviate financial stress , after failing to calm money markets last year .
However , the move has sparked unease among some analysts about the stress developing in opaque corners of the US banking system and the banks  growing reliance on indirect forms of government support .
 The TAF ... allows the banks to borrow money against all sort of dodgy collateral ,  says Christopher Wood , analyst at CLSA .
 The banks are increasingly giving the Fed the garbage collateral nobody else wants to take ... [ this ] suggests a perilous condition for Americas banking system . 

Debian , OpenSSL , and a lack of cooperation

A rather nasty security hole in the Debian OpenSSL package has generated a lot of interest — along with a fair amount of controversy — amongst Linux users .
The bug has been lurking for up to two years in Debian and other distributions , like Ubuntu , based on it .
There are a number of lessons to be learned here about distributions and projects working together or , as in this case , failing to work together .
Back in April 2006 , a Debian user reported a problem using the OpenSSL library with valgrind , a tool that can check programs for memory access problems .
It was reporting that OpenSSL was using uninitialized memory in parts of the random number generator ( RNG ) code .
Using memory before it is initialized to a known value is a well known way to create hard - to - find bugs , so it is not surprising that the valgrind report caused some consternation .
Debian hacker Kurt Roeckx tracked the problem down to what he thought were two offending lines of code and posted a question on the openssl - dev mailing list :
What I currently see as best option is to actually comment out those 2 lines of code .
But I have no idea what effect this really has on the RNG .
The only effect I see is that the pool might receive less entropy .
But on the other hand , I 'm not even sure how much entropy some unitialised data has .
What do you people think about removing those 2 lines of code ?
There were few responses , but they were not opposed to removing the lines , including one from Ulf Möeller using an openssl.org email address :
" If it helps with debugging , I 'm in favor of removing them . "
Unfortunately , as was discovered recently , removing one of the two lines was harmless , the other essentially crippled the RNG so that OpenSSL - generated cryptographic keys were easy to predict .
( For more technical details on the bug and what should be done to respond to it , see our article on this week 's Security page . )
It turns out , at least according to OpenSSL core team member Ben Laurie , that openssl - dev is not for discussing development of OpenSSL .
That may be true in practice , but the OpenSSL support web page describes it as : " Discussions on development of the OpenSSL library .
Not for application development questions ! "
In addition , the address suggested by Laurie ( openssl - team - AT - openssl.org ) does not appear in any of the OpenSSL documentation or web pages .
If it was n't the right place , it would seem that the OpenSSL developers could have provided a helpful pointer to the right address , but that did not occur .
It probably was not clear that Roeckx was asking the questions in an official Debian capacity , nor that he was planning to change the Debian package based on the answer to his questions .
As Laurie rightly points out , he should have submitted a patch , proposing that it be accepted into the upstream OpenSSL codebase .
That probably would have garnered more attention , even if it was only posted to openssl - dev .
It seems very unlikely that the patch in question would have ever made it into an OpenSSL release .
It is in the best interests of everyone , distributions , projects , and users , for changes made downstream to make their way back upstream .
In order for that to work , there must be a commitment by downstream entities — typically distributions , but sometimes users — to push their changes upstream .
By the same token , projects must actively encourage that kind of activity by helping patch proposals and proposers along .
First and foremost , of course , it must be absolutely clear where such communications should take place .
Another recently reported security vulnerability also came about because of a lack of cooperation between the project and distributions .
It is vital , especially for core system security packages like OpenSSH and OpenSSL , that upstream and downstream work very closely together .
Any changes made in these packages need to be scrutinized carefully by the project team before being released as part of a distribution 's package .
It is one thing to let some kind of ill - advised patch be made to a game or even an office application package that many use ; SSH and SSL form the basis for many of the tools used to protect systems from attackers , so they need to be held to a higher standard .
Another of Laurie 's points , which also bears out the need for a higher standard , is the timing of the check - in to a public repository when compared to that of the advisory .
Any alert attacker could have made very good use of the five or six day head start , they could have gotten by monitoring the repository , to exploit the vulnerability .
While it is certainly possible that some of malicious intent already knew about the flaw , though no exploits have been reported , alerting potential attackers to this kind of hole well in advance of alerting the vulnerable users is unbelievably bad security protocol .
This is the kind of problem that could have been handled quickly and quietly by all concerned .
All affected distributions — though it might be difficult to list all of the Debian - derived distributions out there — could have been contacted so that the advisory and updates to affected packages could have been coordinated .
One of these days , one of these problems is going to give Linux a security black eye unless the community can do a better job of working together .
LOS BAÑOS , Philippines 
The brown plant hopper , an insect no bigger than a gnat , is multiplying by the billions and chewing through rice paddies in East Asia , threatening the diets of many poor people .
The damage to rice crops , occurring at a time of scarcity and high prices , could have been prevented .
Researchers at the International Rice Research Institute here say that they know how to create rice varieties resistant to the insects but that budget cuts have prevented them from doing so .
This is a stark example of the many problems that are coming to light in the world ’s agricultural system .
Experts say that during the food surpluses of recent decades , governments and development agencies lost focus on the importance of helping poor countries improve their agriculture .
The budgets of institutions that delivered the world from famine in the 1970s , including the rice institute , have stagnated or fallen , even as the problems they were trying to solve became harder .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Jyoti is the Hindi word for light .
It 's something Pranav Mehta has never had to live without .
And he is lucky .
Near where he lives in Gujarat , one of the most prosperous states in India , thousands of rural villages lack electricity or struggle with an intermittent supply at best .
Massive solar satellites would beam power back to ground - based receivers on Earth .
more photos »
" We need to empower these villages , and for empowerment , energy is a must , " Mehta said .
" Rural India is suffering a lot because of a lack of energy . "
By 2030 , India 's Planning Commission estimates that the country will have to generate at least 700,000 megawatts of additional power to meet the demands of its expanding economy and growing population .
Much of that electricity will come from coal - fired power plants , like the $ 4 billion so - called ultra mega complex scheduled to be built south of Tunda Wand , a tiny village near the Gulf of Kutch , an inlet of the Arabian Sea on India 's west coast .
Dozens of other such projects are already or soon will be under way .
Yet Mehta has another solution for India 's chronic electricity shortage , one that does not involve power plants on the ground but instead massive sun-gathering satellites in geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles in the sky .
The satellites would electromagnetically beam gigawatts of solar energy back to ground - based receivers , where it would then be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids .
And because in high Earth orbit , satellites are unaffected by the earth 's shadow virtually 365 days a year , the floating power plants could provide round - the - clock clean , renewable electricity .
" This will be kind of a leap frog action instead of just crawling , " said Mehta , who is the director of India operations for Space Island Group , a California - based company working to develop solar satellites .
" It is a win -win situation . "
American scientist Peter Glaser introduced the idea of space solar power in 1968 .
NASA and the United States Department of Energy studied the concept throughout the 1970s , concluding that although the technology was feasible , the price of putting it all together and sending it to outer space was not .
" The estimated cost of all of the infrastructure to build them in space was about $ 1 trillion , " said John Mankins , a former NASA technologist and president of the Space Power Association .
" It was an unimaginable amount of money . "
NASA revisited space solar power with a so - called " Fresh Look " study in the mid-90s but the research lost momentum when the space agency decided it did not want to further pursue the technology , Mankins told CNN .
By around 2002 the project was indefinitely shelved -- or so it seemed .
" The conditions are ripe for something to happen on space solar power , " said Charles Miller , a director of the Space Frontier Foundation , a group promoting public access to space .
" The environment is perfect for a new start . "
Skyrocketing oil prices , a heightened awareness of climate change and worries about natural resource depletion have recently prompted a renewed interest in beaming extraterrestrial energy back to Earth , Miller explained .
And so has a 2007 report released by the Pentagon 's National Security Space Office , encouraging the U.S. government to spearhead the development of space power systems .
" A single kilometer - wide band of geosynchronous Earth orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on Earth today , " the report said .
The study also concluded that solar energy from satellites could provide power for global U.S. military operations and deliver energy to disaster areas and developing nations .
" The country that takes the lead on space solar power will be the energy - exporting country for the entire planet for the next few hundred years , " Miller said .
Russia , China , the European Union and India , according to the Pentagon report , are interested in the concept .
And Japan , which has been pouring millions of dollars into space power studies for decades , is working toward testing a small - scale demonstration in the near future .
But a number of obstacles still remain before solar satellites actually get off the ground , said Jeff Keuter , president of the George C. Marshall Institute , a Washington - based research organization .
" Like any activity in space , there are enormous engineering challenges , " he said .
One major barrier is a lack of cheap and reliable access to space , a necessity for launching hundreds of components to build what will be miles - long platforms .
Developing robotic technology to piece the structures together high above Earth will also be a challenge .
Then there is the issue of finding someone to foot what will be at least a billion - dollar bill .
" It will take a great deal of effort , a great deal of thought and unfortunately a great deal of money , " Keutersaid .
" But it is certainly possible . "
And Miller , of the Space Frontier Foundation , said he thinks it will be possible in the next 10 years .
" We could see the first operational power satellite in about the 2020 time frame if we act now , " he said .

Defense attorney John Cotrone stood before Broward Circuit Judge Ana Gardiner in her marble - laden courtroom and dropped in what seemed like a jab at her honor .
It came after Gardiner , the chief criminal judge for the 17th Judicial Circuit , asked for an amended file on Cotrone 's case .
The lawyer pointed out that she had asked for the file " every time I 'm in court on this . "
Gardiner , a petite woman whose dark hair is tinted an artificial red , might have been displeased at being shown up by Cotrone .
But instead she looked away and smiled .
" Is there a point to reminding me of that ? " she asked Cotrone in her slight Cuban accent .
Gardiner shuffled through some papers on the bench before smiling again and goading Cotrone : " I may not have as good a memory as you — even though you are older than me . "
It sounded almost like ... flirting .
And if you believe two sources close to Cotrone , who is indeed five months older than the 46 - year - old Gardiner , it was just that .
Two well - placed sources , both of whom asked for anonymity for fear of professional repercussions , claim to have personal knowledge that Gardiner has had a personal relationship with Cotrone going back years .
Gardiner visited Cotrone 's office , phoned him on a regular basis , and exchanged gifts with him , according to one of the sources with past ties to Cotrone .
At the same time , Gardiner showered Cotrone with taxpayers ' money in the form of special appointments to represent indigent defendants in her courtroom .
The allegations of a romance between Gardiner and John Cotrone are widely known in Broward 's criminal justice circles .
While the accusation has n't been reported in a newspaper , numerous comments from courthouse insiders on the Justice Advocacy Association of a Broward County website , JAABlog , have made the claim .
The blog chatter has gone unchallenged by the accused , says Bill Gelin , a defense attorney and JAAB member who writes for the site .
Both Gardiner and Cotrone were given many opportunities to comment for this article , and both refused .
Gardiner even went so far as to hire prominent defense attorney David Bogenschutz to order New Times to " cease and desist " from asking questions she found " insulting and embarrassing . "
The silence from Gardiner is especially troubling considering that she is one of the most powerful public officials in Broward County .
As Broward 's chief criminal court administrator , she is in charge of 18 judges and largely responsible for making sure the courthouse runs smoothly .
She has also taken a leading role in political matters , including the controversial effort to build a new Broward County courthouse .
The allegations of questionable social relationships involve not only Cotrone but two assistant state attorneys .
If proven true , the allegations could have drastic ramifications not only for Gardiner but for the courthouse , which has already been rocked by numerous scandals during the past year .
The revelations could result in some criminal cases getting overturned — including a first - degree homicide case tried last year .
Ana Gardiner was enjoying drinks with friends on a Friday night last spring when the conversation turned to murder .
Sunrise Commissioner Sheila
Alu was there that night .
She , Gardiner , and Assistant State Attorney Howard Scheinberg were among those who got together for the night at the swank Timpano Chophouse and Martini Bar on Las Olas Boulevard .
Alu remembers Gardiner and Scheinberg talking about a murder case .
They laughed about it , saying the people involved were gay .
They talked about how a juror had fainted at the trial after being shown a particularly gruesome photograph of the victim 's gaping neck wound .
The commissioner soon realized this was n't just courthouse gossip : Gardiner was the judge in this ongoing trial , and Scheinberg was the prosecutor who was trying to put the defendant on Death Row .
Alu , a third - year law student at the time , knew their banter was terribly wrong .
She recognized it as improper ex parte communication that was not only unfair to the defense but could cause a mistrial and prompt disciplinary action against both Gardiner and Scheinberg .
She says she was so disturbed by it that she walked away from the table .
The conversation allegedly occurred on the night of March 23 , 2007 .
Five days later , the Sun-Sentinel published an article headlined " Man Guilty In 2001 Murder . "
A jury had convicted a man named Omar Loureiro of first - degree murder in Gardiner 's courtroom , rejecting defense lawyers ' claims that he killed James Lentry in self - defense after receiving unwanted sexual advances .
" Prosecutor Howard Scheinberg said the slaying was too brutal — Lentry 's head was nearly severed and he was stabbed twice in the neck and six times in the face — to justify self - defense , " noted the article .
The newspaper did n't mention the fact that a photograph of Lentry 's neck wound was shown to the jury on March 22 — the day before the outing at Timpano — or that a juror was excused from the jury after fainting at the sight of it .
Loureiro's defense attorneys pleaded with Gardiner not to allow the photos of Lentry into evidence , arguing that they would unfairly prejudice the jury against the defendant .
" The judge denied the motion , " says Gawane Grant , one of Loureiro's two court - appointed attorneys .
" I think those pictures were very influential for the jury .
Those pictures were horrific .
Our argument basically was that it was way too prejudicial to the jury .
A juror who sees that is going to want the death penalty . "
The jury did recommend the ultimate punishment , and Judge Gardiner followed suit , sending Loureiro to Death Row .
When told of Alu 's description of the conversation between Gardiner and Scheinberg at Timpano , attorney Grant seemed stunned .
" If that 's true , if they had that conversation during the trial , that is in utter contravention of the rules of law and our judicial system , " says the lawyer , who stresses that he believed Gardiner was an excellent judge .
" If that 's the case , then the decision should be reversed immediately . "
The revelation about the judge 's apparent ex parte communication might be a defendant 's worst fear come true .
If one 's fortune , freedom , or life is on the line , the idea that the judge is partying with the opposing attorney and talking about the case is mortifying .
No matter what the nature of the relationship .
" You live in a town with a million people , find somebody else to socialize with , " says Broward Public Defender Howard Finkelstein , who has heard the rumors about Gardiner but says he has found no evidence they are true and has seen her to be a dedicated judge .
" It looks wrong .
It looks bad .
And I do n't think any defendant ever will believe it does n't affect their decisions . "
Scheinberg did n't respond to numerous phone messages and refused to answer e-mail questions .
He released only a brief statement through State Attorney 's Office spokesman Ron Ishoy : " I 've been prosecuting homicide cases for 11 years , " he wrote .
" During that time , I have never discussed a pending case outside of the court with a presiding judge , including this case with Judge Gardiner . "
If Gardiner was swayed by her social relationship with Scheinberg to allow the prosecutor to show the gruesome photographs at trial , it may cost Loureiro his life .
Not that Loureiro , a former ice cream truck driver , is a particularly sympathetic figure .
After killing Lentry in 2001 , he fled to Nicaragua , where he was jailed for shooting a woman during a scuffle on the street .
But the father of two young daughters certainly deserved an impartial judge who did n't talk about his case with the prosecutor whose goal was to have him executed by the state .
The ruling that attorney Grant says had the most profound impact on the jury was the exhibition of post mortem photographs of the 57 - year - old Lentry .
Scheinberg described Lentry 's injuries in court records , writing that he was " stabbed in his mouth and neck as well as a tortuous linear wound down the entire side of the face ...
" While James Lentry was disabled but conscious , " Scheinberg continued , " the defendant began to saw through the base of Mr. Lentry 's neck [ leaving him ] virtually decapitated . "
It 's not surprising that a juror fainted at the sight of the photographs .
As the case wound its way through the court system , Loureiro occasionally wrote letters to Gardiner in a neat hand .
One written on August 1 , 2006 , referred to his belief that Scheinberg had wronged him in court by referring to his deportation when in fact he was never officially deported .
" Dear Judge Gardiner , " he began the letter , " ... Mr. Howard Scheinberg mislead [ sic ] this Honorable Court that defendant was ' deported ' to the United States from Nicaragua . "
After his conviction , Loureiro 's daughters , 14 - year - old Lillian and 12 - year - old Jessica , wrote Gardiner letters asking her to send their father home .
" I will miss my daddy very much and I love him with all my heart , " Jessica wrote the judge this past June 10 .
They had no way to know that the judge had a personal relationship with the prosecutor and that the pair discussed the case at a bar during the trial .
Alu says that she even told the prosecutor later on the night of the ex parte discussion that she was appalled he would talk about an active case with the judge .
" He told me that if I had a problem with it that it was my obligation to go to the Florida Bar with the complaint , " she said .
Alu was n't a lawyer yet , so she had no such obligation .
And she knew how vindictive the power gaggle at the courthouse — of which Gardiner is firmly a part — could be .
For months , she did nothing .
But the commissioner says it has bothered her ever since .
She only went on record about it with New Times recently , and then only very reluctantly .
" I still believe in the process and the right to a fair trial , " she says .
" The defendant has a right to know , and the public has a right to know . "
Judge Gardiner 's career in Broward politics blossomed in part thanks to her close ties to a titan in the county 's justice system : State Attorney Michael Satz .
Satz is a longtime friend of Gardiner 's dating back to the days when she was married to William Gardiner , with whom she had a Fort Lauderdale law practice in the early 1990s .
When a slot came open on the highly political North Broward Hospital District in 1993 , Satz wrote a recommendation letter on Gardiner 's behalf to then - Gov. Lawton Chiles , who appointed her to the post , jump - starting her career in public office .
While serving on that board , Gardiner formed a political alliance with since - disgraced Broward Sheriff Ken Jenne , then a state senator and chief counsel for the public health system .
Both Jenne and Satz , two powerful friends , supported her appointment to the bench in 1998 , which was also made by the late Chiles .
Jenne , who is now serving prison time on federal corruption charges , participated in her robing ceremony .
Born Ana Villaescuesa in Cuba , Gardiner was the first Hispanic female circuit judge in Broward County history .
She was 36 .
Six months after that appointment , Gardiner , who has two children , divorced her husband and soon became a footnote in one of the more sordid public scandals to hit the courthouse .
Gardiner had long been good friends with fellow Broward Circuit Judge Joyce Julian ; both reportedly enjoyed the nightlife .
In 2001 , the pair flew together to a state judicial convention at a resort on north Florida 's Amelia Island , where they shared a room .
By 3 a.m. Julian was naked from the waist down in the hotel , trying to thwart security guards and police .
Julian told police she had been sexually assaulted by a man in a black leather coat — a story investigators determined was fabricated .
Julian was charged with public intoxication , but the case was dropped after she entered alcohol rehabilitation .
Voters turned her out of office in the next election .
Gardiner largely escaped public attention during the scandal , and Julian says she had no role in it .
About that same time , a young prosecutor named Peter Patanzo was assigned to her courtroom .
And it was n't long before fellow attorneys were talking about how close they seemed .
" People said you could feel it in the courtroom , " says Public Defender Finkelstein .
" They said you could tell there was a relationship , but it was nothing articulable . "
Finkelstein said he heard complaints from public defenders about it , but because there was no proof of an improper relationship , no action was taken .
Patanzo left the State Attorney 's Office in 2004 , writing to Satz at the time that " due to certain circumstances I have accepted a position in private practice . "
He now works as a defense attorney in Fort Lauderdale and did n't respond to several detailed attempts to interview him by phone .
It was n't until 2006 that an assistant public defender , Vivian Gariboldi , tried to file a motion to recuse Gardiner from a case because of the perceived relationship , according to records obtained from the Public Defender 's Office .
Gariboldi , who did n't respond to interview requests , had a source with knowledge of a romance between Gardiner and Patanzo , according to internal e-mails at the agency .
On November 2 , 2006 , Finkelstein e-mailed his chief assistants , Diane Cuddihy and Catherine Keuthan , to find out about the status of the affidavit .
" I spoke to Viviane [ sic ] last week and told her that with simply rumor there was not enough to go forward on this motion , " Keuthan wrote back to Finkelstein , " and that even with substantiation there still might not be enough to recuse , so that first she needed to see if she could prove this affair .
Therefore , nothing should have been filed at this time . "
The episode vividly reveals how the mere perception of a relationship affected Gardiner 's courtroom .
And that perception can be traced at least back to 2002 , when Gardiner made some questionable rulings in Patanzo 's favor .
One example is the case of Dario Thomas , an 18 - year - old charged in 2001 with two counts of armed robbery in Broward County .
Thomas ' prosecutor was Patanzo and his defense attorney , ironically , was Cotrone , who was appointed to the case by Gardiner .
A source says that at the time Gardiner was dating Patanzo and that Cotrone was aware of it and spoke of it .
When the case went to trial in Gardiner 's courtroom in 2003 , Patanzo tried to expel a Florida International University professor named Javier Gasana from the jury pool on the grounds that he sat silently in the courtroom through the selection process .
Because Gasana , like the defendant , was black , Cotrone argued that Patanzo was wrongfully trying to exclude an African - American from the jury because he was " silent . "
" I do n't think that is a race - neutral reason at all , " Cotrone remarked at trial .
" I mean if you asked him questions , he answered them .
I asked him a question , he answered my question .
It 's not his fault that nobody asked him anything . "
Despite that argument , Gardiner ruled in the prosecution 's favor , saying that she did n't believe Patanzo's " personal feeling " about Gasana had anything to do with race .
" Based on the court 's observation of Gasana 's demeanor and based on the fact that it has not been a systematic striking of minorities in the panel by Mr. Patanzo , I do not find it to be a pretext and find it to be a race - neutral reason , " she ruled .
Gardiner also allowed Patanzo to admit into evidence six previous robberies allegedly committed the same night in Miami - Dade County .
The teenager was convicted of both counts , and Gardiner handed down what seems a particularly harsh sentence : 30 years in state prison .
It did n't stick .
The Fourth District Court of Appeals reviewed trial records and found that Gardiner had ruled in Patanzo 's favor improperly on both issues .
The appellate judges determined that Gasana was n't silent ; on the contrary he answered all questions asked of him .
The court also found that Gardiner improperly admitted the six previous robberies into evidence .
The conviction was reversed , and Thomas pleaded the case down to a ten - year sentence , saving him 20 years .
He 's scheduled to be released in 2010 .
Though Gardiner 's work in the courtroom had its ups and downs , she managed to keep her personal life out of the news after the Julian incident .
Until this past Super Bowl Sunday .
It happened in a flash .
Judge Gardiner 's BMW plowed into the back of a new Mercedes Benz on NE 25th Way and sped off .
The accident occurred during a Super Bowl block party in an upscale Fort Lauderdale neighborhood on the Intracoastal .
By the time the Mercedes ' owner , a woman named My Warhaftig , got to her car , Gardiner had returned to the scene and was sitting silently in her BMW .
It was just before halftime in the Giants - Patriots game on February 3 .
While Gardiner stayed holed up in her car , a friend of hers , fellow lawyer Howard Friedman , showed up .
He lived across the street from where the accident occurred , and Warhaftig says she heard Friedman 's explanation of what had likely happened from neighbors .
A former boyfriend of Gardiner 's was visiting Friedman 's house , she was told , and Gardiner had likely driven by to check up on him .
When the boyfriend came out of the house , she likely sped off so as not to be seen , which caused her to collide with Warhaftig 's Mercedes .
Fort Lauderdale police charged Gardiner with failure to use due care .
The incident was reported in this newspaper and other media outlets , but Gardiner refused to speak publicly about it with anyone , a policy she has maintained with this story .
As has Cotrone .
When John Cotrone left Gardiner 's courtroom on April 11 , he was asked about his relationship with the judge .
Instead of addressing the issue , he repeatedly warded off the questioner .
" I do n't talk to the press , " said Cotrone , who was in Gardiner 's courtroom that day representing a man named Eric Lucas , who is facing charges of burglary and aggravated battery .
" I do n't talk about cases and I do n't talk about personal matters . "
Later that day , well - known defense attorney Fred Haddad , a longtime friend of Cotrone 's , contacted New Times in an attempt to dissuade the newspaper from publishing the story .
He claimed he was calling of his own volition .
" She 's one of the good ones , " he said of Gardiner .
" This is going to cause [ Judicial Qualifying Commission ] investigations , and nobody needs that . "
He did n't deny that his friend was involved in a romance with the judge .
Instead , he argued that judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys have been drinking together and having sex with one another for years in Broward County .
" What 's the big deal so long as it does n't affect their decisions ? " he asked .
An answer to Haddad 's rhetorical question comes in judicial rules , which dictate that judges strictly avoid so much as an appearance that their decisions on the bench might be influenced by personal matters .
Judges around the country have resigned , faced investigation , and been publicly reprimanded for as much .
For example , after it was discovered recently that Lee County Judge James R. Adams was romancing a defense attorney who had appeared before him , the state 's Supreme Court found that he 'd demeaned his office .
" A judge who enters into a romantic relationship with a lawyer who practices before the judge , and then continues to preside over matters in which the lawyer appears as counsel transgresses the Code of Judicial Conduct in both letter and spirit , " the court wrote in 2006 .
The allegations regarding Cotrone go a step further , however , since taxpayers ' money is involved .
Gardiner appointed him to many cases prior to 2004 , when the state legislature ended the often corrupt practice of judges personally appointing attorneys to represent indigent defendants .
Gardiner has also refused to answer the allegations involving Cotrone , Scheinberg , and Patanzo .
But she clearly understands their gravity .
After a reporter questioned her about those relationships in her courtroom on April 11 , Gardiner hired Bogenschutz to represent her .
Bogenschutz , who defended Gardiner 's old friend Ken Jenne in his federal criminal case and dozens of other public officials entangled in the criminal justice system , wrote a letter the same day to New Times , demanding that the newspaper stop asking questions that had caused Gardiner to " retain counsel , expend funds , and to be personally insulted and embarrassed . "
The Bogenschutz letter , which was signed by his partner Michael Dutko , also demanded that the newspaper " cease and desist " from contacting the judge .
And Judge Gardiner has remained publicly silent on the issue .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
About 100 people , including students majoring in homeland security and criminal justice , were arrested Tuesday in an undercover drug sting at San Diego State University , officials said .
Officials say the evidence seized includes 50 pounds of marijuana , four pounds of cocaine and 350 ecstasy pills .
Among those arrested , 75 were students , one of them a criminal justice major charged with possession of guns and cocaine , authorities said .
One student allegedly dealing cocaine was a month short of obtaining a master 's degree in homeland security at the California school and worked under campus police as a student community service officer .
Campus police initiated the investigation about a year ago , after a student 's fatal overdose in May 2007 , university President Steve Weber said .
About five months ago , as the investigation evolved , campus police sought and received help from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration .
There was a second overdose death in February at a fraternity house .
" If proven guilty , these individuals have preyed on students and have ruined hundreds of lives , " Weber said .
In addition to facing criminal charges , the students have been suspended from school and evicted from campus housing , he said .
Twenty - one people who are not students were arrested recently on a variety of drug charges , officials said .
Damon Mosler , chief of the narcotics division for the San Diego County District Attorney 's Office , was surprised by what he described as the dealers ' openness about what they were doing .
" They were n't picky about who they sold to , " he said , alleging that undercover officers would simply call them and say , " ' Hey , I heard you deal .
Will you sell to me ?'
" And they did . "
Officials say the evidence seized as part of Operation Sudden Fall includes four pounds of cocaine , 50 pounds of marijuana and 350 ecstasy pills .
Authorities also took one shotgun , three semiautomatic pistols and $ 60,000 .
In all , authorities confiscated more than $ 100,000 worth of drugs , Mosler said .
Bags of marijuana weighing four or five pounds would sell for $ 4,000 to $ 5,000 , he said , and a kilogram of cocaine would sell for about $ 17,000 .
Before going to Las Vegas for the weekend , fraternity members involved in the sale of drugs sent text messages to their customers saying , " We 're going to close out our inventory " and inviting them to " buy the cocaine at discounted prices , " Mosler said .
After the weekend , they sent another text message saying they were back and ready to do business , Mosler said .
Search warrants were carried out last week on suspects ' houses off campus , and search warrants were served Tuesday at on - campus housing .
Mosler described the students as " mid- level distributors " who were selling more than a person might buy for personal use .
He identified Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Chi as the two fraternities involved .
In the latter case , firearms were found in the house , he said .
The firearms included semiautomatic 9 mm or .40 - caliber handguns and a rifle , Mosler said .
He said the students face charges that include possession for sale and sale of cocaine , ecstasy and marijuana .
DEA agents infiltrated several student drug distribution cells and made more than 130 drug purchases and seizures , a news release said .
Authorities said they infiltrated seven campus fraternities and found that in some , most of the students were aware of drug dealing by fraternity brothers .

A Chicago pol 's wife gets a 200 grand salary bump ( almost tripling her compensation ) and a year later hubby seeks to channel a million bucks to the wife 's employer .
Good old time Chicago poltics , right ?
Apparently not , because the candidate in question is running on a platform of change , and he seems like such a nice fellow .
Leon H. Wolfe of Redstate is being awfully judgmental here is n't he ?
Barack Obama , allegedly decent guy and agent of " change " in Washington , requested an earmark in 2006 for $ 1 million taxpayer dollars for the hospital where his wife works .
Said hospital , by the way , gave Michelle Obama a huge raise ( nearly $ 200,000 , more than doubling her salary ) in 2005 after Barack got elected to the United States Senate .
Now , I know that there are lots of ways to talk about transactions like this involving public officials - quid pro quo , etc. , but I prefer to call a crook a crook and just say that we 're dealing with good , old fashioned , public corruption here .
I am sure that Barack Obama will be able to distinguish between his acts here and the actions that landed Randy Cunningham in jail .
But like Wolfe , I am curious about what he would have to say .
Of course that would require a media willing to ask tough questions , and probably be branded as a racist for their trouble .
We noted back in 2006 that her salary nearly tripling , oddly followed the election of her husband to the United States Senate :
How much is she scraping by on ?
According to a tax return released by the senator this week , the promotion nearly tripled her income from the hospitals to $ 316,962 in 2005 from $ 121,910 in 2004 .
Her income coincidentally jumped when her husband was elected to the United States Senate .
She handles " community outreach " for the University of Chicago Hospitals , which does indeed sound like vital work , right up there with open heart surgery .
Maybe we are all supposed to hope that Obama , who rose through the Chicago political machine , really is different .
After all , this could be just coincindence .
Game creator Peter Molyneux is well - known for making grandiose promises about his upcoming games , but he was on his best behavior at this week 's Microsoft media event , as he was about to begin demoing Fable 2 .
" I 'm being really careful , " he tells me .
" I will only talk about real tangible features of the game that I can show . "
But , when I ask him about his next game , we get a glimpse of classic Molyneux .
" I think it 's such a significant scientific achievement that it will be on the cover of Wired , " he says with a twinkle in his eye .
" My next game will not be Fable 3 .
It 's not a game I can talk to you about right now , but : AI , simulation , the way characters interact – we 've had smart people working on that stuff for over a decade with the Fable games and Black and White . "
His next game consolidates all of what they have learned , he says .
" All right , " says Molyneux 's PR wrangler , ready for situations like this .
" I think it 's time to move on to another topic now . "
On Game Design
The first Fable , released on the Xbox and PC , was a critical hit that sold 3.5 million units worldwide .
It 's the sort of success that many developers would have been delighted with .
" But I 'm essentially a very greedy person , " Molyneux says .
" I was disappointed with how the game was received . "
Molyneux blames himself for the game not doing better : " I did an awful job of promoting the game .
I would talk to journalists about the things I wanted to do , the stuff that was exciting me in design terms , and I ended up disappointing them . "
That rings true .
Game journos adore Molyneux because his enthusiasm is so palpable , and he 'll get so carried away that he talks to them about incredibly ambitious features he 's not yet implemented in the game .
Then , when he has to retreat from that , the same journos tend to downplay the very real innovations in his games , and rake him over the coals for whatever he was n't able to pull off .
Hence , Molyneux is on his best behavior today .
Fable 2 , he says , has " a whole bunch of simulation " and " a mess of AI "
" There 's so much that people can do playing it , so many things that they never anticipated , " he says .
In creating this complex world where other characters respond to you based on your past behavior and your appearance , Molyneux says his team is encountering " all sorts of bizarre , weird and wonderful bugs " that arise from this openness .
For instance , there was a problem where your canine companion got a strange reception from AI characters .
" All the towns you went to , people absolutely hated your dog , " he says .
" They would immediately go to it and try to beat it up . "
Hammering out all these bugs is incredibly stressful , according to Molyneux .
" We have a permanent group of testers on staff , " he says .
" But every week we 'll have four testers come in who 've not seen it before , and get their reactions . "
The team has ballooned in size for this game – from 60 to 150 .
" Creatively speaking , it 's a nightmare making sure that all 150 know what game they 're making .
I have to get them motivated , get them to believe .
I can't just say , ' I 've just had a wonderful idea !
Go do it . ' "
" There are huge fights that rage , " says Molyneux .
Fable 2 does n't have a mini-map that shows a player 's location .
Instead , what Molyneux calls a " breadcrumb trail " illustrates the player 's next path using a line drawn right on the game world , something that some of his team members insisted could n't be done .
Interactive cut scenes allow you to be in control at all times , by changing your character 's facial expression to get different reactions out of the NPCs .
" The cinematographer had to think in different ways , not use the sort of cuts and camera movements they might have , " Molyneux says .
I mention the recent release of Grand Theft Auto 4 , bringing up reports that the game cost $ 100 million to develop , with more than a thousand people working on it .
" The way games are made now is fundamentally flawed , " he responds .
" If I was a betting man , I ’d imagine that in the future , this business of getting more than a hundred people together for three , four years will look really odd .
It 's so incredibly expensive .
I predict that we 'll see a core of deeply talented people working on games beforehand , then a big team comes together for a brief period of time . "
So , I say – game design is moving toward something sort of like a movie , with years of preproduction by a small team , then a big production with set designers and key grips that only lasts a couple of months ?
" Yes , exactly . "
On Morality
One of the things that Molyneux hyped for years prior to Fable 's release was the game 's morality system , which would determine whether your character grew up good or evil .
" The tests were too obvious in the last game .
Save lives good , kill people bad .
This time , we know what we 're doing with the morality system .
If you want to be truly good , you have to sacrifice .
If I can make you stop and have to really think about what you 're about to do next , I 've succeeded , " he says .
Part of graying out the black - and - white morality system includes altering the spectrum itself .
It 's no longer just a measurement of good and evil .
" We 're measuring purity versus corruption , and cruelty versus kindness , " Molyneux says .
" That 's different from good versus evil .
I tell my son to go to bed and he thinks I ’m cruel , but I 'm really being kind . "
I ask about the scars that your character will gain over time , a feature he discussed at last year 's E3 .
Molyneux says he wanted to do something where a character can lose a fight and not die , but still suffer consequences :
All the bad guys gang up and beat the shit out of you after you 're bested , and your avatar gets scarred .
It was a very intriguing idea , but Molyneux says it 's gone now .
Testers were turning the game off and restarting from their last save rather than have their avatar be permanently scarred .
" I had to retreat on that , " he says .
" They emulated the very thing I was trying to avoid . "
But scarring is n't completely removed from the game .
At one point during Fable 2 , Molyneux says you will face a choice :
Be horribly scarred and have every character from then on notice your ruined appearance and respond differently to you , or choose to have an innocent character scarred instead of you .
" Are you willing for people , including your wife , to find you abhorrent for the rest of the game ? " he asks .
Molyneux says that through previous games like Fable and Black and White , he 's done extensive research of how people test the moral boundaries in a game , what they do if they 're given the choice to be good or evil .
" 70 percent of people will be good , " he says .
" 20 percent will dabble with evil , then be good .
Only 10 percent will choose to be evil all the way through .
What 's fascinating is that this is very regionally dependent .
It 's different from Germany to the U.K. to Asia . "
Also , what people are willing to do is totally age - dependent .
" When people reach age 12 - 14 , they become obsessed with evil , " he says .
" The percentage of people who are good versus evil becomes reversed .
It 's part of the way that teens ' minds are being reordered – it's just a developmental stage . "
On Letting His 5 - Year - Old Son Play * Half - Life 2 *
" I play computer games every day of my life , " Molyneux says emphatically .
He adds that he plays a lot with his 5 - year - old son these days .
" It 's a little bit wrong that his favorite game is by Valve , " he concedes .
Portal ?
No , Half - Life 2 .
The game is rated Mature in the United States , meaning its appropriate for ages
17 and up .
And it 's rated 15 by the British Board of Film
Classification , meaning it can't be sold or rented to children under 15 .
But parents can always let their kids play at their discretion .
I mention that Wired magazine 's Editor - in - Chief Chris Anderson applies the Lego rule of thumb for his kids – violent games set in the past or future are OK , just not from the present .
Anderson loves to bond with his son over a game of Halo .
Molyneux agrees .
" You do n't kill humans .
In Half - Life 2 , they 're monsters . "
" Boys love guns .
Games are chance for them to express their more boisterous side , " he says .
" What 's really interesting for me is what he cares about and does n't care about in a game .
What he finds engaging is very unexpected .
He hates to be made to look stupid .
And so many games do that , especially games that are ostensibly for children .
They do n't reward you , they just punish you .
They motivate you through failure .
In Half - Life 2 , the consequences for failure are small .
You can just try again . "

On Wednesday , we reported that AT&T had begun offering free Wi-Fi access to iPhone users at many of their national Wi-Fi hotspots , including Starbucks and Barnes & Noble locations .
No official announcement had been made , however , and AT&T representatives reportedly declined to comment .

This appears to be true at locations that were verified to offer the free Wi-Fi access just days before .
Based on the screenshot and wording of the login page ( " Free AT&T Wi- Fi for iPhone " ) , there can be no doubt that the service was intentional , but it appears it may have been launched prematurely .

The Obama campaign agrees with the Democratic National Committee , which pegs a winning majority at 2,025 pledged delegates and superdelegates — a figure that excludes the penalized Florida and Michigan delegations .
Obama plans to declare victory May 20
Not long after the polls close in the May 20 Kentucky and Oregon primaries , Barack Obama plans to declare victory in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination .
And , until at least May 31 and perhaps longer , Hillary Clinton ’s campaign plans to dispute it .
Advertisement
It ’s a train wreck waiting to happen , with one candidate claiming to be the nominee while the other vigorously denies it , all predicated on an argument over what exactly constitutes the finish line of the primary race .
The Obama campaign agrees with the Democratic National Committee , which pegs a winning majority at 2,025 pledged delegates and superdelegates — a figure that excludes the penalized Florida and Michigan delegations .
The Clinton campaign , on the other hand , insists the winner will need 2,209 to cinch the nomination — a tally that includes Florida and Michigan .
“ We do n’t accept 2,025 .
It is not the real number because that does not include Florida and Michigan , ” said Howard Wolfson , one of Clinton ’s two chief strategists .
“ It ’s a phony number . ”
Wolfson said they intend to contest the DNC ’s 2,025 number “ every day , ” as well as any declaration of victory made by Obama based upon that number , because it does not include Florida and Michigan .
In January , Clinton won both states by wide margins when Obama did not actively contest them .
The two states were stripped of their delegates for holding early primaries not sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee .
Obama will not reach the 2,025 magic number on May 20 .
Rather , on that date he is all but certain to hit a different threshold — 1,627 pledged delegates , which would constitute a winning majority among the 3,253 total pledged delegates if Florida and Michigan are not included .
“ On May 20 we ’re going to declare victory , ” said an Obama senior advisor who asked that his name be withheld to speak candidly , adding that after those contests they will be “ the ones with the most pledged delegates and the most popular votes . ”
While the nature of that declaration of victory is “ still developing , ” in the advisor ’s words , the Obama campaign contends that the winner of a majority of pledged delegates should be the party nominee .
“ Senator Obama , our campaign and our supporters believe pledged delegates is the most legitimate metric for determining how this race has unfolded , ” wrote Obama campaign manager David Plouffe Wednesday in a memo to superdelegates .
“ It is simply the ratification of the DNC rules - your rules - which we built this campaign and our strategy around . ”
But the Clinton campaign ’s insistence on counting Florida and Michigan would alter not only the overall delegate math , but the pledged delegate math as well .
Because if the two states are included in the count , the total number of pledged delegates would rise from 3,253 to 3,566 — which means the magic number for a majority rises to 1,784 , not 1,627 as the Obama campaign asserts .
By hewing to that interpretation , the Clinton campaign would thus be able to raise doubts about a May 20 declaration of victory by Obama .
Since the earliest possible resolution of the Florida / Michigan dispute is May 31 , when the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet in Washington to address petitions from Michigan and Florida DNC members , the 11 - day period between the May 20 primaries and the RBC meeting could produce a chaotic stretch where Obama claims to be the party nominee while Clinton argues otherwise .
Already , the two campaigns are gearing up for the battle .
“ With the Clinton path to the nomination getting even narrower , we expect new and wildly creative scenarios to emerge in the coming days , ” wrote Plouffe in his memo .
“ While those scenarios may be entertaining , they are not legitimate and will not be considered legitimate by this campaign or its millions of supporters , volunteers , and donors . ”
“ You can declare mission accomplished but that does n’t mean that the mission has actually been accomplished , ” Wolfson said .

The YouTube / Viacom $ 1 billion copyright infringement lawsuit has been bumping along for so long now that many consumers probably suspect the whole thing is about to wrap up .
Not so ; in fact , the case is only just beginning .
On Friday , YouTube at last submitted its reply to Viacom 's complaint , and while 90 percent of the document consists of the words " Defendants deny the allegations of paragraph xx , " the introduction is a hot one .
In it , YouTube claims that its service is exactly what Congress intended to shield when it passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998 , and it goes on to charge that Viacom 's lawsuit " threatens the way hundreds of millions of people legitimately exchange information , news , entertainment , and political and artistic expression . "
Viacom charges that YouTube profited for years ( before being acquired by Google ) from hosting large amounts of its content on the service .
The Daily Show and The Colbert Report used to be YouTube staples , and even though the site has taken down specific clips when notified by the copyright holder , Viacom sees a willful pattern of making money and growing the site on the back of its content .
YouTube has always argued that the DMCA 's " safe harbor " provisions protect it from this sort of lawsuit .
Those rules enable various " service providers " to avoid liability in copyright cases so long as they respond properly to DMCA takedown notices .
In the new filing , YouTube goes a bit further with this rhetoric .
Not only is it protected by the safe harbor rules , but it is exactly the type of service that Congress meant to cover .
" You Tube fulfills Congress 's vision for the DMCA , " says the filing .
For those used to thinking of the DMCA only as the source of overly - aggressive DRM anticircumvention rules , it might come as a surprise to find YouTube claiming that " there is not a question that Congress made the correct policy choice " with the DMCA .
The safe harbors in that law and in the Communications Decency
Act have likely prevented thousands of costly and damaging copyright and libel lawsuits against network operators , and have functioned as a spur to innovation .
What 's interesting about this particular case is that we have a large copyright owner ( Viacom ) seeking to attack a broad reading of the DMCA , at least in this particular area , while the opposite is usually true .
In our own conversations with Viacom execs , they have repeatedly made clear that YouTube , in their view , does not actually qualify as a DMCA " service provider " and is not entitled to safe harbor protection .
YouTube says that such a claim threatens to undermine the best part of the DMCA by chipping away at the certainty companies like YouTube have had so far had when posting user content .
Because the lawsuit seeks " to make carriers and hosting providers liable for Internet communications , " YouTube charges that Viacom could affect the way that millions of people communicate online .
If sites like YouTube or even Ars Technica — which allows " user - generated content " in the form of forum posts — can face liability for copyright infringement in user - provided material , such services could go out of business or might implement so many restrictions they are no longer be useful .
This is certainly an extreme scenario , and one that YouTube is trotting out in defense of its own position , but it does raise awareness of the importance of safe harbor rules in a general sense .
At the end of the complaint , YouTube announces the twelve defenses it plans to use in the case , and they include ( not surprisingly ) a DMCA safe harbor claim , a fair use claim , and a claim of copyright misuse on the part of Viacom .
Given the ridiculously high stakes in the case , one might expect the parties to simply settle and move on , but in this case both sides appear ready to fight to the bitter end .
While Viacom cannot seek punitive damages in the case , it remains intent on collecting huge statutory damages that do n't require it to show any actual losses .
We 've already outlined some of the ways that Viacom can work to fight piracy of its content , and it 's doing a solid job by putting all past Daily Show content online with easy streaming and searching , for instance .
But even as it moves quickly into the brave new streaming future , Viacom would like to deal a smackdown to the upstart copyright philistines over at YouTube ... and picking up one beeeeeellliion dollars can't hurt , either .

A Department of Corrections spokeswoman confirmed today that Jenkins was at the state 's Central Reception and Assignment Facility in Trenton .
The spokeswoman , Deirdre Fedkenheuer , said Jenkins will be evaluated for three to six weeks before he is permanently assigned to a state prison .
With no mandatory time , Jenkins will be eligible for parole consideration in 9 months .
Attorney Paul Uhlik , who represented Jenkins at the sentencing in Flemington , said Judge Roger F. Mahon was advised against recommending his client serve his time at the Hunterdon jail in Flemington .
" Correction officials contacted the judge and advised they did n't think it was a good idea , " said Uhlik .
Even if the judge had given the recommendation , the decision would still be up to the state , according to Uhlik .
" I think Marc understands that there is really no recourse , " the attorney said .
Another lawyer who represented Jenkins when he accepted a plea deal in March , said the former guard feared he was at risk in a state prison , because of his law enforcement background .
Under the terms of a plea deal , Jenkins was barred from ever working again in law enforcement in New Jersey .

Former music industry chief Hilary Rosen , whose deep unpopularity online once earned her a description in Wired as " the Unabomber in a pantsuit , " has been named political director at The Huffington Post .
Rosen is best known as the Recording Industry Association of America 's former chairman and chief executive officer .
She headed up the group just as file - sharing took off , and she subsequently became the ubiquitous face and voice of the recording industry 's aggressive and futile attempts to contain the explosion of online downloading of illegal music .
She stepped down from the RIAA in 2003 and became an interim director for the Human Rights Campaign .
She 's now a pundit on MSNBC as well as a media and technology consultant in Washington , DC .
But Rosen , 50 , has had a long career in politics that spans beyond her 17 years at the RIAA , and it's her network of contacts and know - how that Huffington wants to tap into as The Huffington Post grows .
" Hilary really knows Washington and its political players intimately , and everyone on [ The Huffington Post 's ] team in Washington loves her , " said Arianna Huffington in an interview .
Huffington says that Rosen 's deep network of contacts in DC should help to boost her publication 's political coverage .
She says that she also expects Rosen to help out with * The Huffington Post 's Off The Bus*citizen journalism reporting project , as well as plan this summer 's convention coverage .
In addition to being a pithy , long - time blogger at The Huffington Postand MSNBC political analyst , Rosen is the co-founder and board member of OurChart.com , a social networking site for lesbians .
During this election cycle , she 's announced her support for Hillary Clinton , and co-executive produced a Democratic presidential forum organized by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation and LOGO television .

The ( Christian ) Media Research Center ’s Culture and Media Institute thinks so .
They say that the news media ( in 2007 ) did not “ subject atheism or atheists to the same skepticism to which they subject Christians and Christianity . ”
According to their findings :
Eighty percent of feature stories about atheism or atheists had a positive tone , 20 percent were neutral .
No feature stories were negative .
Their “ research ” was limited to CBS , NBC , and ABC broadcast news ;
Time , Newsweek , and U.S. News and World Report ; and NPR shows Morning Edition , Weekend Edition , All Things Considered and Talk of the Nation .
Let ’s say their research is accurate .
I would n’t be surprised .
It ’s certainly not because the media is biased toward atheists .
They ’re not .
Most members of the media — like the population at large — are religious .
We atheists are going to be in the minority for a long time still .
But think about why atheists were in the news in 2007 .
Atheist books suggesting that we challenge religious claims were bestsellers .
Atheists challenged President Bush ’s faith - based initiatives .
Atheists created a Sunday school of their own .
For the first time in history , we learned that we have a non-theistic Congressperson .
A lot of good things happened for atheists this year .
We deserve some decent coverage .
That said , the research is not accurate .
Are we favored by the press ?
Of course not .
Newspapers and magazines love to feature stories about things you never hear about .
Those stories attract more readers .
Positive articles about atheism used to be a rarity , so it ’s not surprising that the media would try to feature more stories about atheists having summer camps or atheists standing up for their rights .
Let ’s go through this hilarious report ( PDF ) …
This report concludes that , whether deliberately or not , the news media did not subject atheism or atheists to the same skepticism to which they subject Christians and Christianity .
If so , that ’s only because there is much more to be skeptical about when it comes to Christianity !
In this day and age , it ’s remarkable that there are so many people who could be against proper sex education , gay marriage , scientific truths , or controversial books .
Yet , it ’s the numerous radical members of the Christian faith who fit that bill .
Everyone should be questioning what they do and who the followers are .
What are atheists advocating that merits such “ skepticism ” ?
Equal rights for everyone ?
A good education ?
Tolerance ?
Respect ?
Exposure to different points of view ?
A separation of church and state ( that would no doubt benefit religion ) ?
Let ’s get to the specifics .
The report ’s writer Kristen Fyfe said that Good Morning America covered the Atheist Alliance International convention back in September .
[ Liz ] Marlantes was reporting on an atheist convention , and [ Bill ]
Weir led into the story by saying , “ A large convention of atheists is gathering – men , women and children who all proclaim that God does not exist .
Still , of course , the minority view in this country , but it is a view that is becoming more and more vocal with more and more members every day . ”
Marlantes chimed in , “ Call it ‘ atheism unleashed . ’
Books denying the existence of God are topping the best seller lists .
Congress now has its first self - proclaimed atheists .
There are even atheist summer camps for kids . ”
She went on to speculate that the “ stigma ” of being an atheist “ may be fading . ”
The story aired on a Sunday morning , and no opposing point of view was offered in the piece .
After Marlantes ’ feature , Weir interviewed Christopher Hitchens in studio .
Such uncritical promotion of atheism was typical in the coverage CMI examined .
That ’s promotion of atheism ?
The report that said a convention took place and people are reading atheist books .
Those are facts .
( Though Good Morning America incorrectly thinks that there are atheists , plural , in Congress . )
Why would there be an opposing point of view ?
What is there to oppose ?
Do they want a Christian pastor to say , “ That convention did not take place ” ?
Also seen as media promotion of atheism was this sentence referring to Newsweek ‘s story about the Rational Response Squad ’s Blasphemy Challenge :
The story ranked high on Newsweek ’s Popularity Index , a measure of how many times a story gets viewed at Newsweek.com .
Let me get this straight … a lot of you read that story .
Therefore Newsweek is biased .
Right …
The report also cites Nightline ‘s airing of the debate between the Rational Response Squad and bananamen Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort .
Apparently , that was a “ victory ” for atheists ( but not a victory for Christians ) .
Personally , I do n’t think either side came out better as a result , as great as it was for Brian Sapient and Kelly O’Connor to get the exposure .
Similarly , the report cites the Newsweek debate between Sam Harris and Rick Warren as promotion of atheism ( but not Christianity ) .
How about atheists ’ critical responses to religious stories ?
Newsweek added to its pro-atheism story count by profiling Christopher Hitchens in the May 14 issue and then giving him two pages in the September 10 issue to critique a book about Mother Teresa ’s spiritual struggles .
That ’s pro-atheism ?
Christopher Hitchens wrote a book that was # 1 on the New York Times Bestsellers list .
He damn well better be profiled in a major publication .
He also wrote a book criticizing Mother Teresa several years ago .
He is more qualified to comment on her than just about anyone in the media .
So of course he was given an opportunity to critique a book written about her .
It ’s not promotion of atheism .
In 77 stories that dealt with Christian issues or themes , atheism or atheists were mentioned 71 percent of the time .
Also , journalists were far less likely to include religious views in stories on atheism .
Out of 21 stories focused on atheism , a religious counterpoint was offered in only 11 , or 54 percent of the time .
I do n’t understand this one .
If there is an issue that involves a Christian belief and it needs a counterpoint , it ’s not surprising that an atheist would give it .
What is a Hindu / Buddhist / Mormon person going to say ?
If the issue has to do with belief in God , you need someone who does n’t hold that belief to give a rebuttal .
It does n’t necessarily work the same way in the other direction .
As I mentioned , many of the articles about atheism were not the kind that needed a rebuttal .
When a reporter writes that an atheist convention took place , for example , you do n’t need a religious response .
This is my favorite bit :
Television reports also frequently favored atheists when reporting on Christian - themed stories .
In November , ABC , CBS and NBC all reported on the governor of drought - stricken Georgia ’s decision to hold a public prayer session asking God for rain .
Governor Sonny Perdue held the prayer session outside the capitol building , drawing protests from those who think praying on government property is inappropriate if not illegal .
In covering the story , ABC and CBS both included interviews with an atheist who raised the separation of church and state issue .
In his November 13 ABC Good Morning America story about Perdue ’s prayer session , reporter Steve Osunsami gave an atheist six times as much air time as Governor Perdue .
The governor got a three - second sound bite while the atheist had two sound bites and b- roll footage of him walking in town , for a total of 20 seconds .
CBS ’s story was more evenly weighted .
NBC ’s reporting of the story occurred on the Today show as an anchor - read by Ann Curry followed by a brief conversation between anchors Matt Lauer , Meredith Vieira and weatherman Al Roker .
It contained no atheist viewpoint .
ABC was the only network to follow up with a brief anchor mention that it rained a few hours after Gov. Perdue ’s prayer service concluded .
This non -story should n’t have been covered at all , but if it was , Perdue deserved nothing but complete mockery ( if not negative coverage ) for his thinking that prayer would bring rain .
The media needed someone of reason to counter his moronic thinking .
It did n’t have to be an atheist , but you need someone who can address separation of church and state issues along with someone who can comfortably point out the obvious : prayer has nothing to do with when it rains .
An atheist viewpoint seemed appropriate in this case .
But nowhere was an atheist viewpoint favored or supported .
On to politics :
… six out of seven news organizations considered in this study addressed the concerns and interests of atheists in the upcoming presidential election .
Only Republican candidates for President were asked how they would treat atheists .
… … Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney were asked specifically whether they would appoint atheists to government positions if they were elected .
No reporters asked Democratic candidates this question , even though Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards all described themselves openly as Christians , and the media had reported about the Democrats ’ plans to engage churchgoers .
Again , not surprising .
Huckabee and Romney made their faiths an issue in their campaigns .
It ’s important to question whether they would be open to seeking ( and taking ) the advice of someone outside their faiths — certainly this was important to ask of Huckabee .
So , yes , atheists were asked about .
This is not a promotion of atheism .
Just a question about whether a politician ’s faith would make him / her incapable of seeing someone ’s good judgment in lieu of their “ correct ” religious label .
( For what it ’s worth , Barack Obama ’s possibly being atheist has been used against him . )
CMI also seems to forget all the idiotic questions regarding candidates ’ favorite Bible verses .
And the idiotic answers from Republicans regarding whether or not they accepted evolution .
In other words , they would get approval points for proclaiming their literal - Bible - believing Christianity .
Is that not promotion of Christian beliefs over everyone else’s ?
Christianity ( fundamental or otherwise ) played a major role in this election season and it will continue to do so .
Atheism is a minor side issue .
But CMI wo n’t acknowledge that .
Fyfe writes about an ABC special that featured Nicole Smalkowski .
Fyfe is mad because “ atheism was portrayed sympathetically . ”
She ’s also upset because , in the same segment , Richard Dawkins is featured .
[ John ]
Stossel mentioned that Dawkins was touring the country to promote his book and speculated that he might be getting angry reactions because “ America is a very religious country . ”
Dawkins replied , “ I thought just the same , but people thanked me over and over again for saying what they themselves would like to say , but somehow feel they better not . ”
Stossel did not challenge that assertion .
Again , I ask : what is there to challenge ?
There were people who said this to Dawkins .
Not every Christian .
But some .
Perhaps CMI was looking for a Christian to respond by saying , “ NO ! CHRISTIANS DID NOT THANK DAWKINS FOR THAT !
THEY NEVER HAVE A NEED TO QUESTION FAITH ! ”
Ok , one last example of “ media bias in favor of atheism ” :
Time chose atheist Richard Dawkins as one of its 100 Most Influential People in the World for 2007 .
( They did n’t mention that hard - core Christians John Roberts and Tony Dungy were also on the list .
Not to mention the Pope . )

Three international hackers have been indicted for allegedly using " college - level knowledge of computer programming skills " to steal and sell credit card numbers from customers of Dave & Buster 's restaurant chain , the Justice Department said Monday .
One of the men arrested , Maksym Yastremskiy , of Ukraine , was found in possession of millions of stolen credit card numbers , unrelated to the restaurant , on his laptop when the Turkish National Police arrested him in July .
The indictments were unsealed Monday in the Eastern District of New York , and cover a 5 - month - long intrusion last year into the Dallas - based eatery .
The case is the latest in a string of retail capers in which hackers burrowed into a company 's network to intercept credit card transactions in real time .
A similar attack , on a larger scale , played out at shoe retailer DSW in 2005 , compromising 1.4 million customer records .
And a prolonged infiltration of retail giant T.J. Maxx revealed last year exposed at least 45 million customers .
The government said the Dave & Buster 's hackers illegally accessed 11 of the national chain 's servers and installed packet sniffers at each location .
The sniffers vacuumed up " Track 2 " data from the credit card magstripes as it traveled from the restaurant 's servers to Dave & Buster 's headquarters in Dallas , according to the indictment .
At some point , the restaurant detected the intrusions and alerted authorities .
The authorities said a defect in the hackers ' software program required them to regularly reactivate the packet sniffers when the restaurant 's computers rebooted .
Track 2 data does not include an account holder 's name but contains an account number , expiration date and security code contained in the second of two " tracks " inside a magnetic stripe on the back of a credit or debit card .
At one point , according to the indictment , the hackers scored 5,000 credit and debit card numbers from a Dave & Buster 's restaurant in Islandia , NY .
That information was allegedly sold to " others who , in turn , used the data to make fraudulent purchases at various retail locations and from various online merchants , causing losses of at least $ 600,000 to the financial institutions that issued the credit and debit cards . "
Albert Gonzalez , whose home country was not immediately available , was accused of " supplying " the custom packet sniffer used in the caper .
He was arrested in Miami days ago .
An arrest warrant for Gonzalez describes the sniffer program as " efficient , well designed , and uses some algorithms and data structures that reflect college - level knowledge of computer programming skills , whether acquired through self - study ... or formal training . "
A third defendant accused of the break - in , Aleksandr Suvorov , of Estonia , was arrested in March when he was in Germany .
The United States is seeking his and Yastremskiy 's extradition , the Justice Department said .

Wilson , Wyo .
FOR all its Old West mythology , Wyoming is and always will be a mining state , more roughneck than cowboy .
Frankly , in a land of long winters and high winds , there are n’t a lot of other economic choices .
And a powerful oil lobby reminds us with Orwellian regularity that we owe everything to oil and gas taxes , bullying those who disagree .
( In February , a committee of the Wyoming Legislature rejected a spending increase for the University of Wyoming ’s Ruckelshaus Institute of Environment and Natural Resources after institute scientists dared to raise concerns about water produced in coal - bed methane wells . )
Even so , the oilier side of our nature has never threatened to unhorse the cowboy entirely , not even now , when the pressure to develop every last seam of energy is end - of - administration intense .
Since 1996 , oil and gas companies have leased from the federal government the mineral rights to nearly 27 million acres of land in the Rocky Mountain West , and Wyoming has shouldered the greatest share of that development .
In the last decade , oil companies have leased a fifth to a quarter of the state ’s land  15.5 million acres administered by the Bureau of Land Management , as well of hundreds of thousands of acres of national forest and private land .
If Wyoming were a country , it would be one of the largest coal - producing nations in the world , and its output of natural gas is among the greatest in American history .
The argument has never been that we should n’t provide energy .
But is that all we ’re good for ?
And what , if anything , should we leave for future generations ?
These are global questions posed on a local level .
During his second term , President Bill Clinton , under pressure from a Republican Congress , leased out just as much of Wyoming ’s land as the current administration has to date .
The difference was that the Clinton administration enforced laws encouraging the Bureau of Land Management to “ manage , protect and improve ” our public lands while allowing for other values like recreation , grazing and wildlife habitat .
The Bush administration , on the other hand , has lifted every possible impediment to industry .
For example , oil and gas companies are exempt from provisions of the Clean Water
Act that require construction activities to reduce polluted runoff as well as from provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act that regulate underground injection of chemicals .
The industry is also generously permitted to drill on critical wildlife winter range ( close to 90 percent of all their requests to drill on winter range have been granted ) .
Oil rigs are drilling for natural gas on the banks of the New Fork River ( the headwaters of the Colorado ) and in the foothills of the Wyoming Range .
Well sites in many parts of the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are so closely spaced that , with roads , gas pipelines and compressor stations , the development is continuous .
WASHINGTON  An Energy Department report concludes that wind turbines can produce a fifth of the nation 's annual electricity needs within about two decades .
That is about the same share of electricity produced today by nuclear power .
Wind energy today accounts for only about 1 % of the nation 's electricity .
The government report to be released Monday said by 2030 wind energy could account for 300,000 megawatts of power , or about 20 % of the total electricity generated .
The report envisions more than 75,000 new wind turbines , many of them larger than what is in use today , and expansion of transmission systems to move power from high - wind areas to other parts of the country .

It 's hard to square that with the following hair - raising tale Dustin Brooks sent me via email :
I was looking for a way to back up my gmail account to a local drive .
I 've accumulated a mass of important information that I would rather not lose .
During my search I came across G - Archiver , I figured what the heck I 'll give it a try .
It did n't really have the functionality I was looking for , but being a programmer myself I used Reflector to take a peek at the source code .
What I came across was quite shocking .
John
Terry , the apparent creator , hard coded his username and password to his gmail account in source code .
All right , not the smartest thing in the world to do , but then I noticed that every time a user adds their account to the program to back up their data , it sends and email with their username and password to his personal email box !
Having just entered my own information I became concerned .
I opened up a browser and logged in to gmail using his account information .
It still worked .
Upon getting to the inbox I was greeted with 1,777 emails with account information for everyone who had ever used the software and right at the top was mine .
I decided to go ahead and blast every email to the deleted folder and then empty it .
I may have accidentally changed the password and security question to something I do n't remember as well , whoops , my bad .
I also contacted google to erase this account as I did n't see a way to delete it myself .
I generally try to give people the benefit of the doubt , but it 's difficult to imagine any scenario where this is n't a completely malicious violation of people 's trust .
This is every user 's greatest fear when giving out their login credentials , and to see it realized hurts the trust relationship between users and every other professional programmer working today .
I 've inadvertently posted my own login information to this very blog before .
Fortunately for me , an eagle - eyed reader by the name of Israel Orange did n't abuse that information for his own gain , but instead kindly pointed out my error to me in a private email .
I certainly hope there are more programmers out there like Israel Orange than John Terry .
Ethics matter for programmers , too .
@GOKOR :
With respect to your grandfathers and the several other " old people " , saying that the entirety of the German army was n't Nazi during the rule of the Nazi party is misleading .
After the rearmament of German forces , Wehrmacht pretty much was all Nazi after Hitler took dictatorship .
This is basic high school history .
If there were some who did n't agree with Nazi ideals and the policies in place , then sure - I 'd grant that they were n't Nazis .
However , undoubtedly - for the most part - the entire German Wehrmacht under Hitler was unquestionably a Nazi force .
I 'm sure the US has quite a few men and women serving in their armed forces who have opposing political views than the government they serve .
This does not make the US military any less a democratic republic .
The Texas State Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the removal of children from a polygamist religious group ’s ranch by child welfare authorities was unwarranted and that the children should be returned .
The court ’s ruling upheld a decision issued last week by the Third Court of Appeals in Austin finding that a state district court judge had not been justified in allowing the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to remove hundreds children from a ranch complex near Eldorado in April .
In Thursday ’s decision , the Supreme Court noted that while “ the district court must vacate the current temporary custody orders as directed by the court of appeals , ” the district court judge could impose conditions to protect the children including preventing their removal from beyond a geographical area .
Although the Supreme Court on Thursday instructed the district court to vacate its original order approving the children ’s removal , it did not set a timetable under which they should be returned .
Thursday ’s decision involved 126 of the children , but a lawyer for representing one of the children seized from the ranch has said previously that the decision would effectively apply to all of the children taken into state custody .
The Supreme Court said state child welfare officials must meet several legal standards concerning the safety of the children in order to justify removal  such as proving that state officials made a reasonable effort to enable the children to return home but that there was a substantial risk of continuing danger if the children were returned .
“ I still think the downside is lower than the upside is high , ” said Amy Gutmann , president of the University of Pennsylvania .
“ The risk is that we could n’t deliver the same quality education that we do here , and that it would mean diluting our faculty strength at home . ”
While universities with overseas branches insist that the education equals what is offered in the United States , much of the faculty is hired locally , on a short - term basis .
And certainly overseas branches raise fundamental questions :
Will the programs reflect American values and culture , or the host country ’s ?
Will American taxpayers end up footing part of the bill for overseas students ?
What happens if relations between the United States and the host country deteriorate ?
And will foreign branches that spread American know - how hurt American competitiveness ?
“ A lot of these educators are trying to present themselves as benevolent and altruistic , when in reality , their programs are aimed at making money , ” said Representative Dana Rohrabacher , a California Republican who has criticized the rush overseas .
David J. Skorton , the president of Cornell , on the other hand , said the global drive benefited the United States .
“ Higher education is the most important diplomatic asset we have , ” he said .
“ I believe these programs can actually reduce friction between countries and cultures . ”
Tempering Expectations
While the Persian Gulf campus of N.Y.U. is on the horizon , George Mason University is up and running  though not at full speed  in Ras al Khaymah , another one of the emirates .
George Mason , a public university in Fairfax , Va. , arrived in the gulf in 2005 with a tiny language program intended to help students achieve college - level English skills and meet the university ’s admission standards for the degree programs that were beginning the next year .
George Mason expected to have 200 undergraduates in 2006 , and grow from there .
But it enrolled nowhere near that many , then or now .
It had just 57 degree students  3 in biology , 27 in business and 27 in engineering  at the start of this academic year , joined by a few more students and programs this semester .
In 1962 a dose of 297 milligrams of LSD was administered to an elephant in an experiment .
The usual dose for a human is only about 0.1 milligram .
This experiment took place in a zoo , at Oklahoma City .
Two men from the University of Oklahoma , Chester M Pierce and Louis J West wanted to investigate the effects of LSD on a male elepant .
This was because male elephants suffer from a condition known as musth when ready to mate .
In this condition they appear mad , and rush around wildly attacking everything in their path .
The academics thought that by administering LSD to a male elephant they might be able to provoke a similar state .
The elephant which they procured to test out their theory was Tusko , a 14 year old weighing over 3 tons .
They figured out a dose of 297 milligrams would be appropriate , by taking into account both the mass of the elephant , and the reduced sensitivity to LSD that animals with less brain power than man appeared to have .
A dart containing the LSD was fired early on an August morning .
Nothing happened suddenly , but Tusko became distressed , and another elephant appeared to try and help him .
Only five minutes later Tusko collapsed while trumpeting madly .
He lost all bowel control and appeared to have a seizure , similar to an epileptic fit .
After another hour and a half Tusko was declared dead .
The conclusions drawn by this scientific folly were as follows :
It appears that the elephant is highly sensitive to the effects of LSD - a finding that may prove to be valuable in elephant - control work in Africa .
The Council of Nicea was the first worldwide gathering of the Church .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
When Constantine became the first Christian leader of the Roman Empire in the 4th century , his vast territory was populated by a hodgepodge of beliefs and religions .
Within his own young religion , there was also dissent , with one major question threatening to cleave the popular cult — as it was at the time — into warring factions :
Was Jesus divine , and how ?
It 's hard to imagine riots in the streets , pamphlet wars and vicious rhetoric spawned by such a question , but that was the nature of things in A.D. 325 , when Constantine was forced to take action to quell the controversy .
That summer , 318 bishops from across the empire were invited to the Turkish town of Nicea , where Constantine had a vacation house , in an attempt to find common ground on what historians now refer to as the Arian Controversy .
It was the first ever worldwide gathering of the Church .
The Christianity we know today is a result of what those men agreed upon over that sticky month , including the timing of the religion 's most important holiday , Easter , which celebrates Jesus rising from the dead .
Young religion
Christianity was young and still working out the kinks when Constantine took power over the Roman Empire in A.D. 306 .
Christian doctrine at the time was muddled and inconsistent , especially when it came to the central question of Jesus ' relationship to God .
Jesus was as eternally divine as the Father , said one camp led by the Archbishop Alexander of Alexandria .
Another group , named the Arians after their leader Arius the preacher , saw Jesus as a remarkable leader , but inferior to the Father and lacking in absolute divinity .
Supporters on both sides scrawled graffiti on town walls in defiance while bishops from across the empire entered into a war of words as the controversy simmered to a head in 324 .
Fearing unrest in his otherwise peaceful territory , Constantine summoned the bishops to his lake house in Nicea on June 19 , 325 .
Savvy move
In a savvy move that would put today 's shrewd politicians to shame , the compromise proffered by Constantine was vague , but blandly pleasing : Jesus and God were of the same " substance , " he suggested , without delving too much into the nature of that relationship .
A majority of the bishops agreed on the compromise and voted to pass the language into doctrine .
Their statement of compromise , which would come to be known as " The Nicene Creed , " formed the basis for Christian ideology .
The bishops also used the Council of Nicea to set in stone some church rules that needed clarification , and those canons were the reference point after which all future laws were modeled .
As a final order of business , the bishops decided upon a date for the holiest of Christian celebrations , Easter , which was being observed at different times around the empire .
Previously linked with the timing of Passover , the council settled on a moveable day that would never coincide again with the Jewish holiday — the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the vernal equinox .
Nicene legends still circulating
While the Council of Nicea had important consequences , its significance has been exaggerated into legend by a few conspiracy theorists , documentaries and books such as Dan Brown 's " The Da Vinci Code , " historians say .
Contrary to popular belief , the council had nothing to do with selecting which verses and gospels would be included in the Bible , nor whether Christianity agreed or disagreed with the concept of reincarnation .
Bishops did not burn books they deemed heretical there either , historians say .
Colombians in Cali demonstrate against the Farc
The protesters waved flags and wore T - shirts with the slogan : " No more kidnapping , no more lies , no more deaths , no more Farc . "
Some estimates put the number of people protesting in Bogota at between 500,000 and two million .
Thousands more protested elsewhere in Colombia , and in close to 100 other cities around the world .
I hope the Farc is listening
Clara Rojas
Former Farc captive
In pictures : Massive protests
Colombian president Alvaro Uribe told people in the north - eastern town of Valledupar : " To our fellow countrymen who live abroad , and who today have united with the rest of their compatriots , we extend our gratitude . "
On the streets of Bogota , the message was blunter .
" No more Farc , we do n't want any more Farc , young people have to say no to the Farc and tell them to stop their violence , " student Jaime Martinez said .
Former hostage Clara Rojas , who was freed last month after nearly six years as a captive , said : " I hope the Farc is listening . "
And a woman marching with her three children told the BBC : " I think this march will set a precedent in Colombia because for the first time all Colombians are going to protest as one body . "
Schools were closed in many big cities , and businesses closed , allowing workers to march .
Media take - up
The protest was started less than a month ago on the social networking website Facebook by a 33 - year - old engineer , Oscar Morales , from his home in Barranquilla on Colombia 's Caribbean coast .
Over 250,000 Facebook users signed on , and the movement was taken up by newspapers and radio and television stations across the country .
Some people , including relatives of kidnap victims , oppose it .
Paris was one of the cities hosting an anti-Farc demonstration
They fear the demonstrations may provoke Farc into treating more harshly the 700 captives it is believed to be holding .
It has been fighting the Colombian government for 44 years .
" Maybe neither the hostages nor the humanitarian exchange or peace will benefit , " the mother of Ingrid Betancourt , a high - profile hostage , is quoted as saying in Semana magazine .
But armed forces chief Gen Freddy Padilla says negative coverage coming from the ' No More ' movement was behind the Farc 's weekend announcement that it would release three more political captives .
The rebels said that former lawmakers Luis Eladio Perez , Gloria Polanco and Orlando Beltran , who have been held for over six years , were to be released on the grounds of their health .
No further details were given .
But letters from fellow captives , carried by freed hostages Clara Rojas and Consuelo Gonzales last month , describe harsh detention conditions and debilitating jungle illnesses including malaria and chronic diarrhoea .
Chavez role
A Farc statement said that the planned release sprang from mediation efforts by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in the long - running conflict .
The role of Mr Chavez has caused diplomatic tensions
The group offered to make the handover to Mr Chavez and a Colombian opposition senator " personally , or through representatives " .
The group released Ms Rojas and Ms Gonzales in January in a deal that Mr Chavez helped to broker .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott , reporting from Bogota , says the march has showed two things : the deep vein of outrage among ordinary Colombians over the Farc 's violence ; and the power of the internet to mobilise people across the world .
But he says it remains to be seen whether the Farc , which has traditionally been impervious to public opinion , will listen to the voices raised against it .

In an effort to improve electronics recycling in the United States , the U.S. Postal Service is developing a free national collection program for small electronic items .
The program , now in a pilot stage , provides courtesy envelopes with pre-paid postage for patrons to deposit their unwanted digital cameras , printer cartridges , MP3 players , cell phones , and PDAs .
International recycling company Clover Technologies Group processes the devices in its U.S. and Mexican facilities and then refurbishes and resells them if possible .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Now limited to select cities , including Chicago and Los Angeles , the program may expand nationwide in the fall , and it eventually may accept a wider range of devices .
" It does n't cost us anything because [ Clover ] is paying for postage on the envelope , " said Joanne Veto , a post office spokesperson .
" For us , it 's a really smart thing to do . "
The program would be a de facto national electronic recycling program , the first for the United States .
As the only industrialized nation not to ratify the 1989 Basel Convention , which requires its signatories to notify developing nations of incoming hazardous waste shipments , many environmentalists have criticized the country for its lack of action to reduce the international spread of electronic garbage , known as e-waste .
Americans discard at least 2 million tons of household electronics each year , according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Less than 20 percent of that e-waste is recycled , although state - led initiatives are beginning to improve this recycling rate .
Once recycled , however , e- waste is frequently sold to brokers who ship it to the developing world , where it is often dismantled with little regard for worker safety , then burned in the open air or dumped into bodies of water .
The postal service program made it a priority to avoid sending e-waste to developing countries .
" Are all these shipped to non-approved third world countries ?
No .
Not at all .
That was a big concern of the contract , " said Eric Martin , Clover 's vice president of sales .
The postal service hired environmental consulting firm MBDC , which is led by " cradle - to - cradle " visionary William McDonough , to oversee Clover 's procedures .
As part of an audit of the company 's environmental and occupational operations , MBDC made a pre-arranged visit to a Clover facility in Mexico where electronics are tested and dismantled .
" Lots of people are very concerned about [ e - waste ] , as we are .
Everything we saw exceeds traditional global practices for responsible recycling , " said Steve Bolton , an MBDC senior consultant .
" Worker exposure was not an issue . "
If a product is not recycled , it is shipped internationally to smelters that strip the item of its plastics and metals .
The remaining waste - in some facilities as little as half of 1 percent of the total collected waste ( by weight ) - is burned as fuel .
But even the best industry practices are incapable of removing all e-waste toxins .
A typical cell phone , for example , contains hazardous lead , beryllium , chromium , arsenic , and flame retardants .
While a national program that refurbishes electronics is necessary , Sarah Westervelt , e-waste coordinator with the Basel Action Network , a hazardous waste watchdog group , said she remains critical of a program that encourages guiltless consumption of more electronics .
" Consumers need to pay for hazardous waste to be managed , " Westervelt said .
" Free programs ... allow the U.S. to continue externalizing the impacts on human health and the environment by not solving the problem upstream where it has to be solved . "
But MBDC 's Bolton said that if more electronics are recycled and returned to manufacturers , less electronics would need to be produced .
" Ideally what we are trying to do is change design , " he said .
While the United States is among the leaders of e-waste production , it is not alone .
According to the United Nations Environment Programme , the world produces 50 million tons of e-waste each year .
But while the United States has encouraged manufacturers to reduce hazardous waste in their products on a voluntary basis , the European Union has made such reductions mandatory .

Yet with their party ’s political prospects looking bleak , 32 Republicans joined 224 Democrats in the vote , which was 256 to 166 , to approve the veterans benefits and the accompanying tax as well as extra unemployment benefits for idle workers , up to 26 weeks in especially hard - hit areas .
The package also included nearly $ 6 billion for Louisiana levees and $ 1.8 billion for international food and disaster aid .
Democrats have been reluctant to pursue income tax increases in recent years , but this year House leaders did push a tax increase on hedge fund managers earning huge paychecks , though it failed to survive the Senate .
The fate of the tax to pay for the veterans benefits was also uncertain in the Senate , where Republicans were opposed to it and some Democrats were registering initial reservations .
Senators have been more willing to add spending to legislation without finding ways to pay for it , while the House tax plan was developed to soothe conservative Democrats worried about the impact of the new G.I. benefit on the deficit .
The White House this week issued a veto threat against the overall measure , singling out the tax increase to pay for veterans benefits as a top reason .
“ The president has been clear that tax increases are unacceptable , ” the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement .
In the roll call on the $ 163 billion for the war operations , 132 Republicans withheld their votes in protest of Democratic handling of the measure .
At the same time , a large bloc of antiwar Democrats unwilling to provide new money for the conflict voted against the financing , causing it to fail on a 149 - to - 141 vote .
Leaders of both parties said the result had not put the war spending in real jeopardy , since it was expected to be restored in the Senate , where a December 2009 deadline to withdraw combat troops from Iraq and other war restrictions passed by the House were expected to be killed .
House members would then get another chance at the financing , and it was unlikely that Republicans would stand in the way a second time .
The defeat of the war money took House Democrats by surprise since Republicans in the past had been willing to provide the necessary votes to push through the financing despite the objections of most Democrats .
But Republicans have been complaining for weeks that the war spending measure was being assembled by Democrats with no Republican involvement or even the opportunity to offer amendments .
Democrats said the decision by so many Republicans to abstain was irresponsible since it was those lawmakers who have been so supportive of the war .
They said the action by Republicans appeared to be an effort to find some new approach in the wake of a series of election defeats capped this week by the loss of a highly conservative Republican district in Mississippi .

Adobe Air on Linux - A Security Nightmare
Adobe Air is an application platform / framework which received some buzz recently .
One of the most popular Twitter clients was written using Adobe Air .
Air seems to make it relatively simple to write nice looking cross platform applications .
Two weeks ago , Adobe Air was released for Linux and I gave it a try on my Debian Etch system .
The results were not very satisfying .
Installing Air
First you need to download the installer from the Air for Linux website .
then make it executable and run it . $> wget http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/air/linux/adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin $ > chmod +x adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin $ > ./adobeair_linux_a1_033108.bin
So far , so nice .
What 's not so nice is that the installer will ask you for your root password .
It wo n't tell you what it will do with your system , where it installs anything or what scripts will be run .
There seems to be no way to install with user permissions only .
I was brave and let it do its magic anyway .
It turned out that it installed itself as a Debian package called adobeair - enu .
That 's really nice – but why not giving me a Debian package from the start ?
Paths are not Debian - like though , everything is installed to / opt / Adobe AIR .
Yes , there 's a blank in that path .
Installing an Application
The next thing needed is an Air application to install of course .
I was most interested in the much praised FriendFeed client AlertThingy .
Installing Air applications is supposed to be very simple .
On Windows and Mac , Air integrates with Flash .
Application providers just need to put up some special flash file and user can enjoy a one - click install .
Of course the one - click installer did n't work for me .
So I had a look at the HTML source of the AlertThingy site and got the download URL from there : $> wget http://www.howardbaines.com/alertthingy/AlertThingy.air
Now how to run this ?
The Adobe Air installer is not added to the PATH so you need to give the full path your self : $ > /opt/Adobe\ AIR / Versions/1.0/airappinstaller
This will open a file browser where you can choose the just downloaded file .
Next : a scary warning .
Not helpful , eh ?
Just scary .
Click install if you dare .
Okay , the next dialog asks you where to install the application .
I did choose some place in my home directory and hit “ Continue ” .
Guess what came next .
I had to enter the root password to install the application .
Seriously , why on earth do I need to give the root password to install some application in my own home directory ?
Handling the Application
Yes , I continued installing the application .
AlertThingy started right after finishing the installation .
I configured my FriendFeed account and it works as promised .
The tool is nice but not exactly what I what I was hoping for - but that 's another story .
While it ran , I noticed that there is no icon for it in my XFCE icon box .
I do n't know if this is Air problem or an AlertThingy problem .
Then I hit the little X icon to close the application .
It vanished from my sight .
No window .
No icon in the icon box .
No icon in the system tray .
Until an alert popped up in the middle of my screen .
So AlertThingy was still running somewhere in the background .
But without any obvious way to bring it back into sight .
So I killed it and restarted it again .
Oh , did I mention the spaces in the installation path and binary name ?
$ > /home/andi/programs /Alert\
Thingy / Alert\ Thingy So AlertThingy does not integrate well in my desktop environment .
Additionally it felt very sluggish when scrolling or changing tabs – and my PC is quite powerful .
Summary
Adobe Air for Linux is still alpha and this shows .
Performance and desktop integration have to improved .
Unfortunately Adobe Air for Linux also shows a huge lack of understanding of the “ Unix way ” .
Forcing users to install applications as superuser might be a common practice on other operating systems , for a Linux system this is unacceptable !

Israel ’s Army Radio is reporting that President Bush intends to launch a military strike against Iran before the end of his term .
The Army Radio , a network operated by the Israeli Defense Forces , quoted a government source in Jerusalem .
The source disclosed that a senior official close to Bush said in a closed meeting that Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney believed military action against Iran was now called for .
Bush concluded a trip to Israel last week , where he said , “ The objective of the United States must be to . . . support our strongest ally and friend in the Middle East . ”
The Radio report , which was quoted by the Jerusalem Post , disclosed that the recent turmoil in Lebanon , where the Iranian - backed group Hezbollah had seized virtual control of the country , was encouraging an American attack .
Hezbollah ’s aggression in Lebanon is seen as evidence of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s growing influence , and the U.S. official said that in Bush ’s view , “ the disease must be treated , not its symptoms , ” according to the Post .
The White House on Tuesday denied the Army Radio report , saying in a statement : “ As the president has said , no president of the United States should ever take options off the table , but our preference and our actions for dealing with this matter remain through peaceful diplomatic means .
Nothing has changed in that regard . ”
However , numerous signs point to a U.S. strike on Iran in the near future :
A leading member of America ’s Jewish community told Newsmax in April that a military strike on Iran was likely and that Vice President Cheney ’s March trip through the Middle East came in preparation for the U.S. attack .
The Air Force recently declared the B - 2 bomber fleet — a critical weapons system in any U.S. attack on Iran — as airworthy again .
The Air Force had halted B - 2 flights after a February crash in Guam .
As Newsmax reported , the Air Force has refitted its stealth bombers to carry 30,000 - pound “ bunker buster ” bombs , needed to destroy Iran ’s hardened nuclear facilities .
A second U.S. aircraft carrier , the USS Abraham Lincoln , joined the carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the Persian Gulf in May , carrying far more weaponry and ammunition than on previous deployments .
Israel is gearing up for war .
In April , it conducted its largest homeland military exercises ever .
The Jewish - American source said Israel is “ preparing for heavy casualties , ” expecting to be the target of Iranian retribution following the U.S. attack .
Saudi Arabia is taking steps to prepare for possible radioactive contamination from U.S. destruction of Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The Saudi government reportedly approved nuclear fallout preparations a day after Cheney met with the kingdom ’s highest - ranking officials .
After years of delay , First Kuwaiti General Trading and Contracting completed the design and construction of the new U.S. embassy in Baghdad .
The project , plagued by faulty construction and scandal , was certified by the State Department and independent consultants .
" This is a remarkable accomplishment for our company and for the thousands of individuals whose hard work has made it possible , " First Kuwaiti managing director Wadih Al Absi said .
" We are proud of our record of achievement in Iraq and regard the completion of the new U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad as an absolute success . "
The company , which hired 23 U.S. subcontractors , said the project was completed nearly two years beyond schedule .
The project was said to have stayed within its original budget of $ 474 million .
Executives said prior to construction , First Kuwaiti cleared the embassy site of buildings , hidden tunnels and bunkers , landmines and unexploded ordnance .
They said supplies of 75,000 tons of cement and 28,000 tons of steel were hampered by military closure of the road to the embassy site .
The embassy construction site itself is at times the target of direct rocket and mortar attacks .
" First Kuwaiti completed this project under conditions that none of us anticipated , " Al Absi said .
Kuwait , which hosts about 15,000 U.S. troops , has been given the bulk of U.S. military in Iraq contracts to foreign firms .
Executives said the sheikdom facilitated the U.S. embassy contract by serving as a conduit for workers and material .

Ohio has effectively shut the door on payday lending .
The state legislature — a bunch of nanny do - gooders — recognized the seen : the closing of 1,600 payday stores and the loss of some 6,000 jobs .
But these same folks missed the unseen : the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars invested in these businesses ; with investment losses to be suffered by many unknown Ohioans .
Of course , these losses are bound to ripple through Ohio 's rust belt economy , creating unpredictable effects .
These types of state interventions in the market reduce future investment in capital .
An investor has to consider the consumer , the market , and the state .
Of those three , the state has become the most volatile , the greatest unknown .
Payday lending is gone in Ohio .
Current and future Investors in the state will have to wonder if the whims of the legislature have finally trumped property rights in the Buckeye State , with the state willing and able to alter ownership and control of property with the stroke of a pen .
Is Ohio any different from the troubled countries to our south ?
I am no longer certain that it is n't .
There are exceptions , when masturbation is also done by some one else i. e. , one engages one ’s own wife for this act and rather prefers it even to normal coitus .
This sort of device is found among those who are accustomed to hard friction and this habit is formed since childhood and therefore they cannot derive much thrill and pleasure from normal coitus .
The other common device is to lie down on the abdomen and rubbing the penis against the pillow or the bed as if performing the sexual intercourse and to discharge semen with thrill and pleasure .
There is haradly any young man who does not masturbate at one time or the other .
The self - abuse is the prime cause of various sexual disorders and it is one of the earliest abuses when a boy engages himself in this evil act .
Masturbation has serious consequences since it drains the young men of his vital forces and in many case it causes impotency , if it is over - indulged .
Therefore , parents are advised to keep a watch on their children against all possible factors which can tempt their children to masturbate .
Following are some of the causes which incites young men to undertake this evil practice :
Solar Thermal Electricity : Can it Replace Coal , Gas , and Oil ?
March 27th , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
One of the most common arguments against large - scale use of renewable energy is that it cannot produce a steady , reliable stream of energy , day and night .
Ausra Inc. does not agree .
They believe that solar thermal technology can supply over 90 % of grid power , while reducing carbon emissions .
“ The U.S. could nearly eliminate our dependence on coal , oil and gas for electricity and transportation , drastically slashing global warming pollution without increasing costs for energy , ” said David Mills , chief scientific officer and founder of Ausra .
You may be wondering , how will we have electricity at night or during cloudy weather ?
Will we use large banks of batteries or burn candles ?
The ability to utilize solar thermal technology after the sun sets is made possible by a storage system that is up to 93 % efficient , according to Ausra ’s executive vice president John O’Donnell .
High efficiency is achieved because solar thermal plants do not need to convert energy to another form in order to store it and do not rely on battery technology .
Flat moving recflectors or parabolic mirrors focus solar energy to generate heat .
This heat generates steam that turns turbines , thus generating an electric current .
If you want to generate electricity - at , say , 3 am - heat from the sun can be stored for later use .
This gives solar thermal technology the ability to not just produce peak power , but also generate base load electricity .
Peak Power : The First Wave of Solar Thermal Plants
The maximum amount of electricity demand on the power grid occurs during weekday afternoons and evenings in the summer months in most regions of the United States .
This is largely caused by air conditioning loads , which gobble up electricity .
Because the electric grid needs to be able to handle these peak loads , capacity is built to specifically handle these loads .
Natural gas and oil typically comes to the rescue to produce this electricity .
Although these plants are expensive to operate , they are cheaper to construct than most of the alternatives .
They are fast to start , producing power in 30 minutes or less .
Additional power plants are constructed just to generate electricity for the times when it is needed most .
This causes peak electricity to be more expensive .
A kilowatt hour of electricity at 3 pm and 3 am does not come with the same price tag to the utility company .
“ Adding solar plants that reliably generate until 10 pm displaces the highest cost alternative power , ” said John O’Donnell .
“ That is the first wave of solar thermal plants .
The daily and seasonal variation in grid load in the United States matches solar availability . ”
Base Load : Replacing Coal Power
Base load is the minimum amount of electricity demand placed on the power grid over a 24 hour period .
Coal and nuclear plants commonly supply this energy .
These plants can take hours or even days to heat up to operating temperatures and are run more continuously than peak power plants .
Due largely to the lower cost of fuel , these plants can produce electricity at a lower cost .
If a carbon tax is implemented in the future , this will increase the cost of electricity generated from coal .
Generating electricity around the clock with solar thermal technology relies on storage systems that run turbines long after the sun sets .
“ Ausra has a very active energy storage R & D group and we will be prototyping a couple of systems this year here in the US , ” said John O’Donnell .
Solar Energy Storage
This is not a new technology , having been used for plastic manufacturing and petroleum production for a long time .
Solar thermal plants have a cost advantage compared to photovoltaic technology because energy can be stored as heat without being converted to another form or relying on batteries .
“ My favorite example in comparing energy storage options is on your desktop , ” said John O’Donnell .
“ If you have a laptop computer and a thermos of coffee on your desk , the battery in your laptop and the thermos store about the same amount of energy .
One of them costs about $ 150 and the other one costs maybe $ 3 to $ 5 .
On the wholesale level , storing electric power is at least 100 times more expensive than storing heat . ”
The future certainly looks bright for solar thermal technology as concern over climate change increases .
Global demand for electricity is growing rapidly , requiring clean solutions .

A D.C. advocacy group called Women ’s Voices , Women Vote is being accused of waging a high - tech voter suppression campaign , after voters in predominantly black districts in North Carolina began receiving automated phone calls implying that they had n’t properly registered to vote in the upcoming Democratic primary .
The controversy underscores the mounting tension in the Democratic primary race .
Polling in North Carolina currently favors Barack Obama over rival Hillary Clinton for the May 6 Democratic presidential primary there .
Blacks , who overwhelmingly favored Obama in primaries in Virginia and Maryland , make up about 22 percent of the population in North Carolina , according to the U.S. Census .
Voters began complaining to The Raleigh News & Observer last week that they were receiving the automated calls , which the paper reported were primarily going to black households .
The calls play a 20 - second message voiced by a man who calls himself " Lamont Williams . "
" In the next few days , you will receive a voter - registration packet in the mail , " the Williams recording said .
" All you need to do is sign it , date it and return your application .
Then you will be able to vote and make your voice heard .
Please return the voter - registration form when it arrives .
Thank you . "
The recording does not identify the group behind the calls .
But what most concerned some recipients of the calls is that they had already registered to vote .
And , notwithstanding the message ’s promise , the calls were placed well after the deadline for submitting a new registration .
The Institute for Southern Studies , a Durham , North Carolina nonprofit , investigated the mysterious calls and traced them to Women ’s Voices , Women Vote , a nonpartisan group dedicated to " improving unmarried women ’s participation in the electorate and policy process , " according to the group ’s website .
The organization has not endorsed a candidate .
On Wednesday , the women ’s group acknowledged making the calls , but dismissed the charges of voter suppression .
President Page Gardner said the calls were an extension of a legitimate voter - registration drive that the group began in July 2007 .
In that effort , the group mailed out some 3 million authentic voter - registration cards , after placing automated calls telling residents to expect them .
" We understand North Carolina ’s primary - registration - effort deadline was April 11 , ( other than those participating in early voting who may register and vote at the same time this week ) , " Gardner wrote in a statement .
" We apologize for any confusion our calls may have caused . "
Gardner does not address why the phone campaign was conducted anonymously .
Nor does the statement explain the specific phrasing of the message , which implies that the voter must await , fill out and return a new registration packet in order to vote in the primary .
The Institute for Southern Studies notes that North Carolina is n’t the only state in which Women ’s Voices , Women Vote has caused a ruckus among voters and election officials , and that many of its officials have connections with Hillary Clinton , either by having worked in President Bill Clinton ’s administration or through campaign donations .
" Gardner , for example , contributed $ 2,500 to Clinton ’s HILLPAC on May 4 ,
2006 , and in March 2005 she donated a total of $ 4,200 to Clinton , according to the Center for Responsive Politics ’ OpenSecrets.org .
She has not contributed to the Obama campaign , according to the database , " wrote Executive Director Chris Kromm on the institute ’s blog .
A spokeswoman for Women ’s Voices , Women ’s Vote did not return repeated phone calls Wednesday .
The North Carolina Department of Justice is investigating the incident , said Jennifer Canada , a department spokeswoman .
North Carolina enacted asked campaigning politicos to voluntarily comply with a political " do - not - call " list last year , after its residents flooded the state attorney general ’s office with complaints about political robocalls during the 2006 election season .
Don Powell , who runs a political phone - calling company in Portland , Oregon , says the fact that the autodial campaign was performed anonymously suggests it was n’t an innocent mistake .
In general , he says , anonymous , automated campaigns are designed to suppress voter turnout .
" It does happen in North Carolina , " he said .
" It works , or they would n’t bother .
It ’s sleazy money , and it affects people like me who would never think about doing this . "
Update : Women ’s Voices Women Vote has agreed to North Carolina State Attorney General Roy Cooper ’s demand to stop the anonymous robocalls .
The AG ’s office notes that they ’re illegal because North Carolina ’s law requires such calls to identify their sponsors , and to offer recipients information a way to stop them .

I have been in meetings with the Clintons and their advisors where very clinical things were said in a very - detached tone about unwillingness of working class voters to trust government — and Bill Clinton — and about their unfortunate ( from a Clinton perspective ) proclivity to vote on life - style rather than economic issues .
To see Hillary going absolutely over the top to smash Obama for making clearly more humanly sympathetic observations in this vein , is just amazing .
Even more so to see her pretending to be a gun-toting non-elite .
Give us a break !
I wonder if she realizes that gaining a few days of lurid publicity that might reach a slice of voters is going to cost her a great deal in the regard of many Democrats , whose strong support she will need if she somehow claws her way to the nomination — and even more so if she does not clinch the nomination .
The distribution of “ we ’re not bitter ” stickers to her campaign rallies is the height of over - the - top crudity , and the reports are that very few audience members seem to have much enthusiasm for this nonsense .
Not surprisingly , people cannot see the reasons for so much fuss .
Yes , she wants a big break , she desperately wants the nomination she and Bill believe is hers by right .
We all know that .
But where is her authenticity and her dignity and her sense of any proportion ?
This has to be one of the few times in U.S. political history when a multi-millionaire has accused a much less wealthy fellow public servant , a person of the same party and views who made much less lucrative career choices , of “ elitism ” !
( I wo n’t say the only time , because U.S. political history is full of absurdities of this sort . )
In a way , it is funny — and it may not be long before the jokes start .
People handle large volumes of mail in different ways .
Keeping
everything in one mailbox can quickly become unmanageable because
messages you need to read get lost among messages you do n’t need to
read .
You can move mail manually by selecting them in the summary buffer and
typing B m ( gnus - summary - move - article ) .
Then type the name of the
group to which you would like to move the message .
The group will be
created if it does n’t exist .
To move multiple messages , mark them with #
( gnus - summary - mark - as - processable ) and then type B m
( gnus - summary - move - article ) .
To unmark a message , type M-#
( gnus - summary - unmark - as - processable ) .
To unmark all messages , type M P
U ( gnus - summary - unmark - all - processable ) .
Automatically filing mail
Moving messages by hand is tedious and time - consuming .
One way to deal
with this is to set up rules that automatically file mail into
different groups ( or folders , as they ’re called in other mail
clients ) .
Gnus calls this “ splitting ” mail , and you can split mail on
IMAP servers as well as mail downloaded from POP3 servers to your
computer .
For example , if you ’re using Gnus to read mail from an IMAP server ,
you can split your messages by adding this to your ~/.gnus :
If you use a different inbox , change the value of
nnimap - split- inbox ( 1 ) .
Any messages in the inbox will be split
according to nnimap - split - rule ( 2 ) , which is a list where each element
is a list containing the group ’s name and a regular expression
matching the header of messages that should be filed in the group .
In
this example , Gnus will move mail with subjects containing the word
“ emacs ” to INBOX.emacs , mail directed to [ email protected ] to the
INBOX .work group , mail directed to [ email protected ] to the
INBOX .personal group , and mail error messages to INBOX.errors .
All
other messages will be stored in INBOX .
If you ’re downloading your mail from a POP3 server and storing it in
nnml , add this to your ~/.gnus instead :
All other messages will be stored in mail .
misc .
Start M-x gnus again , and your mail will be split into the different
groups .
Where are my groups ?
If you do n’t see your new groups in the group buffer displayed by M-x
gnus , type A A ( gnus - group - list - active ) to see all the groups .
Go to
the group that you would like to add to the group buffer , then type u
( gnus - group - unsubscribe - current - group ) to toggle its subscription .
In
this example , INBOX.automated is not subscribed to , but INBOX is .
U 13 : INBOX.automated 76 : INBOX
When you type M-x gnus again , you ’ll see your subscribed groups if
they have unread messages .
nnimap - split - rule and nnmail - split - methods allow you to filter
interesting or uninteresting mail into different groups based on their
headers .
Gnus comes with an even more powerful mail splitting engine .
In fact , Gnus comes with “ fancy mail splitting . ”
Fancy mail splitting
With fancy mail splitting and some configuration , you can split mail
based on a combination of criteria .
You can even manually file a
message and have Gnus automatically file incoming replies in the same
group .
To configure an IMAP connection to use fancy mail splitting , add the
following to your ~/.gnus :
( setq nnimap - split- inbox " INBOX " ) ( setq nnimap - split - predicate " UNDELETED " ) ( setq nnmail - split - fancy ;; ( 1 ) '( | ;; ( 2 ) ( : gnus - registry - split - fancy - with - parent ) ;; ( 3 ) ;; splitting rules go here ;; ( 4 ) " INBOX " ;; ( 5 ) ) ) ( setq nnimap - split - rule ' nnmail - split- fancy ) ( setq nnmail - split - methods ' nnimap- split-fancy ) ;; ( 6 ) ( gnus - registry - initialize ) ;; ( 7 )
This configures IMAP to use the nnmail - split - fancy function to
determine the group for messages .
Note that we ’re setting the
nnmail - split - fancy variable here .
If you want to process your IMAP
mail separately from your other mail , you can set the
nnimap - split - fancy variable instead .
If so , also set nnimap - split-rule
to ‘ nnimap - split - fancy .
Using nnmail - split - fancy here makes the other
examples easier to understand , though .
The nnmail - split - fancy variable controls the splitting behavior ( 1 ) .
The
“ | ” symbol means that that the first matching rule is used ( 2 ) .
For
example , if the message being processed is a reply to a message that
Gnus knows about , then the gnus - registry - split - fancy - with - parent
function will return the name of the group , and nnmail - split - fancy
will file the message there ( 3 ) .
You can add other splitting rules as
well ( 4 ) .
If messages do n’t match any of these rules , the last rule
specifies that the messages will be filed in INBOX ( 5 ) .
Set
nnmail - split - methods to nnimap - split - fancy as well in order to work
around some assumptions in other parts of the code ( 6 ) .
After that ,
initialize the Gnus registry ( 7 ) , which is responsible for tracking
moved and deleted messages .
This allows you to automatically split
replies into the same folders as the original messages .
To configure fancy mail splitting with an nnml backend ( suggested
configuration for POP3 ) , add the following to your ~/.gnus instead :
( gnus - registry - initialize ) ( setq nnmail - split - fancy ' (| ( : gnus - registry - split - fancy - with - parent ) ;; splitting rules go here " mail.misc " ;; ( 1 ) ) ) ( setq nnmail - split - methods ' nnmail - split - fancy )
This code is similar to the IMAP example , except that the default
mailbox name for nnml is mail .misc ( 1 ) .
Here ’s how the previous rules in nnmail - split - methods would be
translated to nnmail - split - fancy rules for an IMAP configuration :
( setq nnmail - split - fancy ' (| ( : gnus - registry - split - fancy - with - parent ) ;; splitting rules go here ( from mail " INBOX.errors " ) ;; ( 1 ) ( any " [ email protected ] " " INBOX.work " ) ;; ( 2 ) ( any " [ email protected ] " " INBOX.personal " ) ; ; ( " subject " " emacs " " INBOX.emacs " ) ;; ( 3 ) " INBOX " ;; or " mail.misc " for nnml / POP3 ) )
The from keyword matches against the “ From ” , “ Sender ” , and
“ Resent - From ” fields , while the mail keyword matches common mail
system addresses ( 1 ) .
The corresponding to keyword matches against
the “ To ” , “ Cc ” , “ Apparently - To ” , “ Resent - To ” and “ Resent - Cc ” headers ,
while any matches the fields checked by the from and to
keywords ( 2 ) .
You can also compare against the subject
and other headers ( 3 ) .
You can use logic in splitting rules , too .
For example , if you like
reading the jokes on [ email protected ] , but you do n’t like
the ones sent by [ email protected ] ( he not only has a bad sense of
humor , but also likes picking on Emacs ! ) , you can use a rule like
this in your nnmail - split - fancy :
; ; ... other splitting rules go here ... ( any " [ email protected ] " ;; ( 1 ) ( | ( from " [ email protected ] " " INBOX.junk " ) ;; ( 2 ) " INBOX.jokes " ) ) ;; ( 3 ) ; ; ... other splitting rules go here
The first rule matches all messages with
“ [ email protected ] ” in from - or to - related headers .
Matching messages are processed with another split rule , which moves
messages from [ email protected ] to a separate group ( 2 ) and files the
other messages in INBOX. jokes ( 3 ) .
To learn more about creating complex
rules , read the Gnus Info manual for “ Fancy Mail Splitting ” .

The cost of the Iraq war has often been expressed in billions or trillions , numbers so big and abstract they remind us of Carl Sagan 's description of the universe ( " billions and billions of stars … " ) .
The candidates have cited alternative uses for the war money , saying it would have been better spent on health coverage for the uninsured ( Sen. Hillary Clinton ) or on more school teachers ( Sen. Barack Obama ) .
In a speech on March 20 , 2008 , Obama took a different approach and emphasized the personal cost of the war .
" When Iraq is costing each household about $ 100 a month , you 're paying a price for this war , " he said in the speech in Charleston , W.Va .
At $ 100 per month , the war cost to each U.S. household would be more than cable TV ( average bill : $ 58 ) , but less than a car payment ( average bill : $ 400-500 ) .
We asked the Obama campaign about the source of the $ 100 figure and were told it came from The Three Trillion Dollar War , a new book by Joseph E. Stiglitz , a Nobel Prize - winning economist , and Linda J. Bilmes , a former Commerce Department official from the Clinton administration who is now a professor at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government .
The book says the monthly operating cost of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is about $ 16 - billion .
" To think of it another way , " the book says , " roughly every American household is spending $ 138 per month on the current operating costs of the wars , with a little more than $ 100 per month going to Iraq alone . "
( Of course , Obama 's simplified analysis does not reflect the variations in income tax levels .
And you do n't have to write a check for the war each month .
The war costs are included in government spending that is paid for by taxes . )
There was no footnote for the $ 100 estimate , so we called Bilmes to ask how she had calculated it .
She said they took the Bush administration 's 2008 request for war funding – $ 196 - billion – and divided it by 12 to get a monthly cost .
That works out to $ 16 - billlion for both wars and about $ 12 - billion just for the Iraq portion .
Then , she and Stiglitz divided those figures by the number of U.S. households and came up with $ 138 for both wars and slightly more than $ 100 for Iraq alone , she said .
We double - checked the authors ' sources and math , and found they were right .
Indeed , the Bush administration request for 2008 was $ 196 - billion for both wars , with $ 159 - billion going to Iraq , according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service .
A recent Census Bureau report said there were 116 - million households .
So that works out to about $ 140 per month for both wars and about $ 114 for Iraq alone .
( Our numbers are slightly higher than Bilmes and Stiglitz because we used the latest estimates from CRS and a newer and slighter higher count for households . )
To verify the Bilmes and Stiglitz calculation , we checked with Steven Kosiak , vice president for budget studies with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments , a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on defense issues .
He said their methodology was correct and that the number " sounds about right . "
Bilmes , a Democrat who is neutral in the presidental race , said Obama could have used an even higher figure if he had included other war costs that are n't in the Pentagon 's $ 196 - billion tab .
These include disability payments , the cost of replacing war - fighting equipment and interest on the borrowed money .
By using the figure he did , Obama " really was being conservative on this , " Bilmes said .
" He 's not overstating it in any way . "
And so we find Obama is right about the war 's monthly cost .
We find his claim to be True .
Congressional Quarterly has just released an analysis predicting that Hillary will only win 3 delegates more than Obama in the Pennsylvania primary next week .
We ’ll be watching carefully to see which reporters try to spin Hillary ’s victory next week – a 20 - poin victory that the polls have predicted for 12 months now – as a “ stunning upset ” that “ changes everything . ”
We ’ll be memorializing those “ journalists ” by name on election day , next Tuesday .
Current delegate tally
Obama : 1,632
Clinton : 1,489
Pennsylvania may give Hillary a 3 delegate bump .
That ’s a 0.2 % increase in her number of delegates , meaning that rather than losing to Obama by 143 delegates , she ’ll be losing to Obama by 140 .
Yep , it ’s going to change EVERYTHING .
Stay tuned .
And for the Hillary spinmeisters out there , here are the actual polls from PA over the past 18 months .
Note that up until just recently , Hillary had a nearly 20 point lead .
If she wins by 20 points , then she meets expectations , she does n’t beat them .
We already know that Hillary is going to win PA , that is the conventional wisdom and has been the conventional wisdom since the beginning of 2007 .
Meeting that conventional wisdom is certainly a “ win ” for Hillary , but winning a state you ’re supposed to win does not an “ upset ” make .
The only “ news ” that may come from next Tuesday is whether Obama beats expectations by cutting into Hillary ’s 20 point lead that she held for a year .
The other real “ news ” is how Hillary has squandered her lead in PA over the past three to four months .
Look at those polls .
It ’s a disaster for her .
And more recently , not only has Obama been catching up to her , but her numbers are dropping .
Again , hanging on by the skin of your teeth is not an upset .

PHOENIX  President Bush “ convinces himself to believe what suits his needs at the moment , ” and has engaged in “ self - deception ” to justify his political ends , Scott McClellan , the former White House press secretary , writes in a critical new memoir about his years in the West Wing .
In addition , Mr. McClellan writes , the decision to invade Iraq was a “ serious strategic blunder , ” and yet , in his view , it was not the biggest mistake the Bush White House made .
That , he says , was “ a decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed . ”
Mr. McClellan ’s book , “ What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington ’s Culture of Deception , ” is the first negative account by a member of the tight circle of Texans around Mr. Bush .
Mr. McClellan , 40 , went to work for Mr. Bush when he was governor of Texas and was the White House press secretary from July 2003 to April 2006 .
The revelations in the book , to be published by PublicAffairs next Tuesday , were first reported Tuesday on Politico.com by Mike Allen .
Mr. Allen wrote that he bought the book at a Washington store .
The New York Times also obtained an advance copy .
Paul Krugman says if you follow the money , it will lead to the truth :
A Surge , and Then a Stab , by Paul Krugman , Commentary , NY Times :
To understand what ’s really happening in Iraq , follow the oil money , which already knows that the surge has failed .
Back in January , announcing his plan to send more troops to Iraq , President Bush declared that ... “... Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis . ” ...
Two - thirds of Iraq ’s GDP and almost all its government revenue come from the oil sector .
Without an agreed system for sharing oil revenues , there is no Iraq , just ... armed gangs fighting for control of resources .
Well , the legislation Mr. Bush promised never materialized , and on Wednesday attempts to arrive at a compromise oil law collapsed .
What ’s particularly revealing is the cause of the breakdown ... , a Kurdish ... provincial government ... production - sharing deal with the Hunt Oil Company of Dallas ... seems to have been the last straw .
Now here ’s the thing : Ray L. Hunt , the chief executive and president of Hunt Oil , is a close political ally of Mr. Bush .
More than that , Mr. Hunt is a member of the President ’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board , a key oversight body ...
By putting his money into a deal with the Kurds .. , he ’s essentially betting ... against the survival of Iraq ...
The smart money , then , knows ... that the war is lost , and that Iraq is going the way of Yugoslavia .
And I suspect that most people in the Bush administration — maybe even Mr. Bush himself — know this , too .
After all , if the administration had any real hope ... , officials would be making an all - out effort to get the government ... to start delivering on some of those benchmarks , perhaps using the threat that Congress would cut off funds otherwise .
Instead , the Bushies are making excuses , minimizing Iraqi failures , moving goal posts and , in general , giving the Maliki government no incentive to do anything differently .
And for that matter , if the administration had any real intention of turning public opinion around , as opposed to merely shoring up the base enough to keep Republican members of Congress on board , it would have sent Gen.
David Petraeus ... to as many news media outlets as possible — not granted an exclusive appearance to Fox News ...
All in all , Mr. Bush ’s actions have ... been what you ’d expect from a man whose plan is to keep up appearances for the next 16 months , never mind the cost in lives and money , then shift the blame for failure onto his successor .
In fact , that ’s my interpretation of something that startled many people : Mr. Bush ’s decision last month , after spending years denying that the Iraq war had anything in common with Vietnam , to suddenly embrace the parallel .
Here ’s how I see it :
At this point , Mr. Bush is looking forward to replaying the political aftermath of Vietnam , in which the right wing eventually achieved a rewriting of history that would have made George Orwell proud , convincing millions of Americans that our soldiers had victory in their grasp but were stabbed in the back by the peaceniks back home .
What all this means is that the next president , even as he or she tries to extricate us from Iraq — and prevent the country ’s breakup from turning into a regional war — will have to deal with constant sniping from the people who lied us into an unnecessary war , then lost the war they started , but will never , ever , take responsibility for their failures .
The U.S. military on Saturday announced the death of a Marine in Anbar province , as May ended with what could be the lowest monthly toll since American - led forces invaded five years ago .
If no additional deaths are reported , the U.S. military toll for the month will be 19 , according to the independent website icasualties.org .
The next - lowest toll was in February 2004 , when 20 service members were killed .
At least 4,084 U.S. personnel have died since the start of the war .
Two Georgian servicemen were also killed last month .
The number of Iraqi civilian deaths also fell last month , from 923 in April to 504 , according to Health Ministry figures .

The drop in casualties comes at a time when American and Iraqi officials are claiming major gains against the Sunni Muslim militant group Al Qaeda in Iraq , and a truce has curbed fighting with Shiite extremists .
The top U.S. commander in Iraq , Army Gen. David H. Petraeus , said in Washington last month that violence had hit a four - year low and he would probably recommend further troop cuts after most of the additional 28,500 forces deployed last year leave by the end of July .
But the improved security trends have not been matched on the political front , leaving unresolved the simmering tensions between Iraq ’s major ethnic and religious groups , which could erupt again into violence .
Talks aimed at bringing members of the main Sunni Muslim political alliance back into the Cabinet collapsed last week over who would occupy one of the seats .
Most Sunni representatives quit Prime Minister Nouri Maliki ’s government in August , accusing the country ’s majority Shiites and their ethnic Kurdish allies of refusing to share power .

U.S. officials hope that provincial elections scheduled for the fall will give Sunnis a bigger stake in the government .
But the vote could also become a trigger for violence , as the current power brokers are challenged by factions that boycotted the last vote , in 2005 .
The latest American death , on Friday , was not linked to combat , the military said in a statement .
It provided no further details about the incident .
Iraqi troops have taken the lead in the latest crackdowns in Basra , Mosul and the Baghdad district known as Sadr City , leaving U.S. - led forces in a support role , where they are less exposed to attack .
At least 27 Iraqi soldiers and 32 policemen were killed nationwide last month , according to government figures .
The number of attacks by Sunni insurgents has dropped significantly since the U.S. troop buildup reached its height last June , and tens of thousands of Sunni tribesmen joined the fight against the extremists in their midst .

The ongoing offensive in the northern city of Mosul , which U.S. officials have called the last urban stronghold of Al Qaeda in Iraq , has met little resistance , suggesting that most fighters had already fled the city or are lying low .
U.S. commanders caution , however , that Sunni extremists remain capable of inflicting lethal attacks .
Sheik Hikmat Ilgoud , mayor of the Anbar town of Hit , survived a suicide bombing Saturday that killed 10 people and injured 12 , the Interior Ministry said .
The assailant blew himself up at a police checkpoint minutes after the mayor ’s convoy left the site .
Such attacks are a trademark of Al Qaeda in Iraq , a mostly homegrown group that U.S. commanders say is foreign - led .
The government ’s late - March crackdown in Basra triggered an uprising by militiamen loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr that drew in U.S. - led forces and threatened to unravel the recent security gains .
More than 1,000 Iraqis were killed , many of them civilians , when the fighting spread to Sadr City and other Shiite areas of the capital .

The bloodshed in Sadr City has subsided since Shiite lawmakers loyal to Maliki signed a truce with Sadr ’s representatives May 12 .
But tensions between the main Shiite factions remain high , and sporadic clashes persist in other parts of the capital .

Brent Simmons of NewsGator gave
Ars the scoop about some interesting updates on the way for NetNewsWire , the company 's premiere RSS reader for Mac OS X .
In January NewsGator announced that all of its consumer products , including NetNewsWire , were going free .
NetNewsWire 3.1 was released that same month , but Brent is n't one to let a version sit for very long .
Citing NewsGator 's new focus on " [ taming ] the information overload problem , " Brent is working on NetNewsWire 3.2 and 4.0 almost in tandem , with a decent set of changes and new features already lined up for both .
In NetNewsWire 3.2 , Brent has rewritten the RSS parser he 's been using more or less since NetNewsWire 's debut in 2002 ( yep , NNW was slinging RSS before you learned the meaning of the phrase " feed syndication " ) .
This and other fixes should let NetNewsWire 3.2 consume one - third the memory , especially for heavy feed users who can't stop clicking " subscribe . "
Brent said he 's shooting for a July release date , possibly sooner , but we are n't allowed to hold him to that .
NetNewsWire 4.0 will bring new features and changes to fall in line with NewsGator 's aspirations for taming information .
At the top of the new features list will be integration with AideRSS and the company 's PostRank technology for automatically filtering newsfeeds for hot topics and headlines .
NewsGator is already using this technology in its web - based client for its top 1,000 feeds , but NetNewsWire 4.0 will bring AideRSS and PostRank to Mac OS X Leopard .
If you 're drowning in feeds and headlines that you constantly shrug off with the " mark all as read " command , this new PostRank technology should help you to at least catch the stuff that really matters .
Speaking of Apple 's latest cat , NetNewsWire 4.0 will be Leopard - only , as Brent is harnessing some of Apple 's newest technologies .
CoreData will improve scalability and performance ( again , especially for heavy users and those who want to hang onto feed items ) , and Leopard 's Core Animation will bring more UI feedback and general sexiness .
Do n't worry about feature or UI bloat , however ; I 've watched NetNewsWire 's development closely over the years and if there 's anything Brent hates , it 's adding extra features or needless bells and whistles .
He actually gets excited when he gets to tear out a feature or kill a preference checkbox .
As far as a release date for NetNewsWire 4.0 , Brent has a more general Fall - ish time in mind .
On top of 3.2 and 4.0 development , he 's also working on a native NetNewsWire app for the iPhone , but I can't share many of those details just yet .
Once all this Mac and iPhone - based NetNewsWire goodness lands , though , you can expect to pick each of these apps up for the low , low prices of free .
Vladimir Putin put the finishing touches to his postretirement formula for retaining power in Russia Tuesday by scooping up the leadership of the country 's dominant political party , a position he will hold in addition to being prime minister .
" I accept the invitation of the party .
I am ready to take on myself the additional responsibility and head the party , " Mr. Putin told delegates to the convention of the pro-Kremlin United Russia ( UR ) party , which controls 70 percent of the parliament 's 450 seats .
The 600 delegates , including many of Russia 's top politicians , responded with a lengthy standing ovation .
Russian observers are deeply divided over the consequences of Putin 's move , which will effectively leave Russia with two strong leaders after President - elect Dmitri Medvedev is inaugurated on May 7 .
Russia 's historical experience with divided power has been an unhappy one , but many experts believe the close personal ties and complementary skills of Putin and Mr. Medvedev may produce a stable political synergy that will enable much - needed economic reforms and anticorruption measures .
Others warn , however , that any future strife between the two men , who represent very different generations and backgrounds , could split Russia 's fractious bureaucracy and paralyze the work of government .
" This strengthens Putin 's political weight as national leader , " Sergei Markov , a United Russia Duma deputy , told journalists .
" Dmitry Medvedev is leader of the state and of the Russian Federation , but the political leader of the country remains Putin . "
' A new and dangerous situation '
Within a month , Putin will move from the Kremlin to Russia 's White House , the gleaming eggshell - like building by the Moscow River that serves as the seat of government , to take up the job of prime minister .
Under the country 's Constitution , the prime minister is a presidential appointee , and the job has typically been filled by an unambitious technocrat .
Although Putin 's long - term aspirations remain an enigma , experts say he is not likely to settle easily into the role of second fiddle to the new Kremlin chief .
" This is a completely new and very dangerous situation for Russia , " says Alexander Dugin , head of the nationalist Eurasia Movement .
" We have two strong politicians , but all of the legitimacy lies with Putin .
He has real charisma , huge popular support , his record of substantial achievements as president , and now the leadership of the main political party in the country .
He will not be just another prime minister . "
The new president , Medvedev , has no power base of his own and is entirely beholden to Putin 's sponsorship for his ascent to the Kremlin .
Yet Russia 's president enjoys supreme powers under the Constitution , written by former President Boris Yeltsin after he crushed a defiant parliament with military force in 1993 .
Under Putin 's eight - year leadership , the Kremlin greatly strengthened presidential powers by eliminating independently elected regional governors , subordinating the media , sidelining civil society groups , and ushering in a pro-Kremlin parliamentary majority .
" Everything Putin did while in power would seem to exclude the possibility of two power centers emerging now , " says Yury Korgunyuk , an expert with the InDem Foundation , an independent Moscow think tank .
" Putin is trying to cling to power by all possible means , but [ under Russia 's Constitution ] everything will depend on the president 's goodwill .
Medvedev can easily fire the prime minister . "
Medvedev and Putin have both publicly protested that problems will never arise between them .
" [ Putin ] is an effective leader and he 's ready and able to continue to work to advance the development of our country , to make sure our development continues in the way set out eight years ago , " Medvedev said in an interview with the Financial Times last month .
" I am confident that our tandem will prove to be absolutely effective . "
But Putin 's acquisition of United Russia 's leadership , unexpected by many , may change that outlook .
Putin was offered the party 's chairmanship , a special post created by the convention on Monday that does not require him to actually join the party .
At the convention , Putin was preceded to the rostrum by Medvedev , attending as a guest , who told the delegates it was a " logical " idea for Putin to take over the party 's reins .
That made Putin 's acceptance look almost like an act of obedience to Medvedev 's will .
" I am sure today 's convention was played out according to a carefully written and rehearsed script , " says Masha Lipman , an expert with the Carnegie Center in Moscow .
" The main intent was to ensure that no tensions between Putin and Medvedev would be on display . "
Though Putin is still not a member , the job now ties him formally to a party he was instrumental in creating , and whose candidate list he headed in last December 's parliamentary elections .
" Putin is now the hostage of United Russia , which will try to work through him to create a party - dominated government in a country where the president is supposed to form the cabinet , " says Alexei Mukhin , head of the independent Center for Political Information in Moscow .
" United Russia was created to support Putin when he ran the Kremlin and it seems he will continue running the party as prime minister .
But if Medvedev and Putin disagree , does that mean UR will become an opposition party ?
I foresee [ bureaucratic ] war . "
' A window of opportunity '
Other experts point to the smooth stage management of politics under Putin to suggest the two men may continue to cooperate successfully .
" There is a window of opportunity here , now that Russia has two strong and popular leaders , to pursue major reforms , " such as slashing the bureaucracy and curbing corruption , says Yaroslav Lissovolik , chief economist of Deutsche Bank in Russia .
" They both have a great deal of experience and a lot of accumulated political capital .
Now is the time to spend it . "
Sometimes kids say the funniest things .
If their parents do n’t know the answers to their questions , then they can always redirect their questions to God .
After all , God made the world , so he must understand it !
These funny and touching letters will make you smile from the heart , as you find out a few of the questions that are really plaguing our children .
This list will make you laugh , cry and smile , so read on for a rollercoaster of emotions .
I am here this morning in Cambridge , Mass . , at OLPC 's Global Country Workshop .
Opening the conference this morning was OLPC founder Nicholas Negroponte , who announced the second generation of the OLPC XO laptop , which will be called the XO - 2 .
Negroponte did n't share many details about the XO - 2's hardware , but the new system has two touch - sensitive displays .
As you can see from the video and the pictures , the XO - 2 will be much smaller than the original machine ( half the size , according to the press release ) and will have a foldable e-book form factor .
" The next generation laptop should be a book , ” Negroponte said .
The XO - 2 will employ the dual indoor - and - sunlight displays , which was pioneered by former OLPC CTO Mary Lou Jepsen .
The design will provide a right and left page in vertical format , a hinged laptop in horizontal format , and a flat , two - screen continuous surface for use in tablet mode .
" Younger children will be able to use simple keyboards to get going , and older children will be able to switch between keyboards customized for applications as well as for multiple languages , " the press release reads .
The XO - 2 will also reduce power consumption to 1 watt .
According to Negroponte , the XO - 2 is scheduled to be released in 2010 .
Negroponte ended his speech by announcing that the Give 1 , Get 1 program , which allows consumers to give one laptop to a child in the developing world and get a low - cost laptop for themselves , will start up again in August or September 2008 .

Experts say breech births can be handled safely Some babies are born bottom - first because of genetic traits inherited from either their mother or father , Norwegian researchers have said .
Fewer than one in 20 is delivered this way up , but a natural breech birth carries extra risks to the child .
A study of 387,000 births , in the British Medical Journal , found a baby had double the chance of being breech if their mother or father was too .
But midwives said parents should not worry too much .
We always tend to ask mothers if they know how they were delivered , and some midwives will ask the partners as well
Mervi Jokinen
Royal College of Midwives
As many as one in four babies are in the wrong position at the mid-point of pregnancy , but all but 3 % or 4 % are head - down by the time they are delivered .
The precise reasons why a baby might be in the breech position are not known , although the anatomy of the mother - in particular the shape of her womb - can play a strong role .
Babies are designed to be born head - first , and coming out the other way round increases the chance of breathing problems at the moment of delivery .
For this reason , many women with full - term breech babies opt for caesarean sections .

The researchers from the University of Bergen looked at the records of more than 387,000 parents and their first - born children born between 1967 and 2004 .
They found an identical increase in risk passed from both male and female parents born in breech position .
While a mother might be able to pass on the increased risk through inherited differences in her physical makeup , any risk passed from a father raises the possibility of a genetic trait carried by the baby rather than the mother .
However , other specialists say the picture is less clear .
Professor Janet Hardy , from the University of Massachusetts Medical School , said that there could be a separate , undetected factor that was increasing the chance of a breech birth in these families .
She said : " Clinicians should continue to gather information during early prenatal care on maternal and paternal birth presentation and other potential risk factors for breech delivery . "
Antenatal care Mervi Jokinen , from the Royal College of Midwives , said the findings were " intriguing " .
" We always tend to ask mothers if they know how they were delivered , and some midwives will ask the partners as well , just to record this in the notes .
" But on the whole , women should not be too concerned about the possibility of a breech baby , as long as she is receiving proper ante-natal care . "
Henry Annan , a spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists , said that having a breech delivery approximately doubled the risks of complications to the baby .
" Having a breech baby does increase the dangers , although , with proper management , the chances are that the baby will be born healthy .
" I think a lot of parents will be unaware of whether they were born breech or not , but this is still an interesting study . "

What are these ?
As Hillary Clinton 's rout in West Virginia underscores , Appalachia is not Obama country .
Of 410 counties in the region , which stretches from New York to Mississippi , Barack Obama has won only 48 ( 12 percent ) so far .
Of the counties he has lost , nearly 80 percent have been by a margin of more than 2 to 1 .
The region is whiter , poorer , older , more rural and less educated than the rest of the country , and seems to be voting like a bloc .
In fact , it has n't been Democratic country for the last two presidential elections .
Only 48 of the counties voted for John Kerry in 2004 , down from 66 counties ( or 16 percent ) that went for Al Gore in 2000 .
The only states with counties in the region that have consistently voted Democratic in the last four such elections have been New York , Pennsylvania and Maryland .
Part of Clinton 's win-while - losing argument is that her husband won more than half the region 's states in both elections , and so can she .
Unfortunately , she is not the Bill Clinton of 2008 .
Obama is , and his candidacy could energize enough young voters and African - Americans to shift the landscape of swing states .
Obama is unlikely to win the heart of Appalachia in the general election , but he may not need to if he can make up ground on its northern frontier .
If he wins New York and Pennsylvania ( he lost both in the primaries ) and flip - flopping Ohio ( another primary loss ) he will be in good position .
New Scientist :
Blood transfusion became a mainstay of medicine during the two world wars , where it was used as a last resort to save soldiers who had suffered massive blood loss .
But now , far from being restricted to catastrophic bleeding , transfusions are routinely used as an optional treatment , most commonly for patients in intensive care or undergoing major surgery .
…
The rationale behind such blood transfusions seems incontrovertible .
Red cells deliver vital oxygen to tissues , and seriously ill patients who are also anaemic fare less well , so a transfusion should help .
Those assumptions went untested for the better part of a century .
Things started to change in 1999 with a randomised controlled trial on 838 critical care patients in Canada that used haemoglobin levels to determine when a blood transfusion was given .
Normal levels of haemoglobin … range from 120 to 170 grams per litre .
A normal haematocrit – the proportion of red cells in the blood – ranges from 36 to 50 per cent .
Doctors decide whether to give a transfusion based on a number of factors , including haemoglobin levels and haematocrit , and the patient ’s overall robustness .
Many guidelines exist , and practice varies from one hospital or doctor to another , but it is common for patients to receive transfusions when their haemoglobin dips to between 70 and 100 g/l or their haematocrit to 21 to 30 per cent .
But the Canadian study found significantly fewer patients died in hospital , 22 versus 28 per cent , if they received transfusions only when their haemoglobin fell below 70 g/l rather than when it fell below 100 g/l .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Hedge fund manager John Paulson of Paulson & Co. took home $ 3.7 billion last year , making him the biggest earner in the industry , according to Alpha Magazine .
Alpha 's annual survey of hedge fund pay found that the top five fund managers - Paulson , George Soros of Soros Fund Management , James Simons of Renaissance Technologies Corp. , Philip Falcone of Harbinger Capital Partners and Kenneth Griffin of Citadel Investment Group - each made more than $ 1.2 billion .
That 's about the price JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) paid to acquire troubled Wall Street firm Bear Stearns ( BSC , Fortune 500 ) .
Alpha 's survey took into account each manager 's share of their firm 's performance and management fees , as well as personal capital gains , and did not include any benefit from the sale of a firm or an initial stock offering .
Fund managers are enjoying massive paydays at a time when financial markets are in turmoil and millions of homeowners face foreclosure .
As a result , hedge funds are likely to draw the ire of Congress and face more regulation in the future , the magazine said .
Kyaraben : Japanese Character Lunch Boxes
In the culinary arts , they say that presentation is as important as preparation .
In Japan , it ’s all about presentation when making character lunches .
It is called “ Kyaraben ” , or “ Charaben ”  , and goes beyond simply making the meal look appetizing .
Most Kyaraben are made by mothers , who want to make their children ’s lunches more appealing by arranging the contents of the Bento ( lunch box ) into their favorite cartoon characters or super heroes .
Kyaraben are also designed for family picnics and outings , and may use a theme such as a train ride or automobile trip to determine the picture . 
The history of bento in Japan goes back some 900 years although the first boxes made for bento were the wooden lacquered boxes made during the late 16th century .
Bento box lunches have been popular ever since , and there are thousands sold daily at train stations and aboard trains , but they are n’t nearly as artistic as Kyaraben .
There are several contests for Kyaraben artists and their entries are quite imaginative and most importantly , edible .
There is the Sanrio Kyaraben Contest and the Yokahama Kyaraben Contest , both won by the same person .
Unfortunately for me , the winner ’s blog is in Japanese and I ca n’t be sure I translated her name correctlyâ€ ¦I come up with Miho Chindonya .
Of course , if I were talented enough to create one of these masterpieces , I ’d probably smack the hand holding the hashi , ( chopsticks ) that was trying to steal a taste !

A young star is speeding away from the Milky Way so fast that astronomers have been puzzled by where it came from ; based on its young age it has traveled too far to have come from our galaxy .
Now by analyzing its velocity , light intensity , and for the first time its tell - tale elemental composition , Carnegie astronomers Alceste Bonanos and Mercedes López - Morales , and collaborators Ian Hunter and Robert Ryans from Queen 's University Belfast have determined that it came from our neighboring galaxy , the Large Magellanic Cloud ( LMC ) .
The result suggests that it was ejected from that galaxy by a yet - to - be - observed massive black hole .
The star , dubbed HE 0437 - 5439 , is an early - type star and one of ten so - called hypervelocity stars so far found speeding away from the Milky Way .
" But this one is different from the other nine , " commented López - Morales .
" Their type , speed , and age make them consistent with having been ejected from the center of our galaxy , where we know there is a super - massive black hole .
This star , discovered in 2005 * , initially appeared to have an elemental makeup like our Sun's , suggesting that it , too , came from the center of our galaxy .
But that did n't make sense because it would have taken 100 million years to get to its location , and HE 0437 - 5439 is only 35 million years old . "
To explain the enigma , or " paradox of youth , " the discoverers proposed that HE 0437 - 5439 was either a so - called blue straggler - - a relatively young , massive star resulting from the merger of two low - mass stars from the Milky Way , or it originated from the Large Magellanic Cloud .
" We were intrigued by the conundrum and decided to take up the challenge to solve this , " stated Bonanos .
" Stars in the LMC are known to have lower elemental abundances than most stars in our galaxy , so we could determine if its chemistry was more like that galaxy 's or our own . "
The team confirmed results of the previous study concerning the mass , age , and speed of the star .
It is about nine times the mass of our Sun , about 35 million years old , and it is zooming away from the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud into intergalactic space at 1.6 million miles per hour ( 2.6 million km / hour ) .
Although the previous study was able to roughly estimate the star 's elemental composition , the measurements were not detailed enough to determine if the elements match stars in our galaxy , or are characteristic of stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud .
These astronomers were able to measure the relative abundances of certain elements for the first time in any hypervelocity star .
The relative abundance of key elements tells them where a star originated .

" We 've ruled out that the star came from the Milky Way , " explained Bonanos .
" The concentration of elements in Large Magellanic Cloud stars are about half those in our Sun .
Like evidence from a crime scene , the fingerprints point to an origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud . "
Based on the speed of the star 's rotation measured by the discoverers , and confirmed by this team , the astronomers believe that the star was originally part of a binary system .
The binary could have passed close to a black hole 1,000 the mass of the Sun ** .
As one star was pulled into the black hole , the other was whipped into frenzy and flung out of the galaxy .
" This is the first observational clue that a massive black hole exists somewhere in the LMC .
We look forward to finding out where this black hole might be , " concluded Bonanos .
The research will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters .
* The astronomers who discovered HE 0437 - 5439 are Heinz Edelmann , Ralf Napiwotzki , Uli Heber , Norbert Christlieb , and Dieter Reimers .
The work was published in Astrophys .
J. 634 , L191 - L184 , 2005 .
** The work predicting that a 1,000 solar mass black hole is necessary to eject the star can be found in Alessia Gualandris and Simon Portegies Zwart , Mon.Not.Roy.Astron.Soc.Lett. 376 ( 2007 ) L29-L33 .

Mercedes López - Morales acknowledges support provided by NASA through Hubble Fellowship grant HF - 01210.01 - A awarded by the Space Telescope Science Institute , which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy , Inc. , for NASA , under contract NAS5 - 26555 .
The first clue surfaced in September 1998 , when fishermen off this Mediterranean port city dragged up a silver bracelet with their nets .
It bore the names of Saint - Exupéry and his New York publisher .
Further searches by divers turned up the badly damaged remains of his plane , though the body of the pilot was never found .
Image Saint - Exupéry was one of numerous French pilots who assisted the Allied war effort .

“ I had just seen ‘ Titanic ’ and after a few glasses of pastis I reflected , ‘ We ’ll make a movie , and the dollars will rain , ’ ” said Jean - Claude Bianco , 63 , on whose boat the bracelet was discovered .
The film , was never made but news of the bracelet prompted Luc Vanrell , 48 , a diving coach and marine archaeologist , to inspect more closely some marine wreckage he had noticed years before , buried in sand in 170 feet of water near the remains of Saint - Exupéry ’s plane .
An engine block serial number and a Skoda symbol , for the Czech company that was an unwilling German supplier , proved it to be a Daimler - Benz V - 12 aircraft engine .
In 2005 , after enduring numerous bureaucratic delays , Mr. Vanrell and another diver , Lino von Gartzen , lifted the motor and shipped it to Munich for study by German experts .
It turned out to be part of a series produced in early 1941  the oldest sparkplug was from March 1941 .
It had been modified in 1943 with the addition of a Bosch fuel injection pump .
The researchers deduced it had powered a Messerschmitt fighter plane , part of a training unit stationed in southern France from 1942 to 1944 .
It had been flown by Prince Alexis von Bentheim und Steinfurt , a 22 - year - old who was shot down by American planes in late 1943 , on his first and last solo flight .
The tale might have ended there , with the death of the prince and of the Little Prince ’s author .
Yet Mr. von Gartzen was not content .
Consulting archives and with the help of the staff of the Jägerblatt , a magazine for Luftwaffe veterans , he tracked down veterans who had flown in Prince von Bentheim ’s unit , the Jagdgruppe 200 .
He contacted hundreds of former pilots , most now in their 80s ; hundreds more had already died .

- Tama works nine to five and takes Sundays off
A loss -making Japanese railway company is back on track thanks to the popularity of a stray cat .
Wearing a black cap and posing for photos with passengers , Tama is credited with boosting Wakayama Electric Railway 's revenue by 10 % .
The firm had to axe all staff at Kishi station in western Japan two years ago .
But Tama stuck by her post and was rewarded with promotion to station manager .
The pet mascot even has her own office , a former ticket booth .
The feline , who was born and raised at the station in the city of Kinokawa , Wakayama prefecture , is living proof of the Japanese belief that cats are good luck .
" She never complains , even though passengers touch her all over the place .
She is an amazing cat .
She has patience and charisma .
She is the perfect station master , " said Yoshiko Yamaki , a spokeswoman for the rail company .
The nine - year - old - who receives cat food in lieu of a salary - won national stardom last year when the firm formally appointed her as " station master " .
Since then passengers have been gradually returning , recently rising 10 % to about 2.1 million a year .
The cat has spawned a range of popular merchandise , including a picture book called : " Diary of Tama , the Station Master . "

Former Roman Catholic bishop Fernando Lugo has won Paraguay 's presidential election , ending more than six decades of rule by the Colorado Party .
With results declared in most polling stations , Mr Lugo has 41 % of the vote .
His main rival , Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado Party , has 31 % and former army chief Lino Oviedo 22 % .
The BBC's Gary Duffy in the capital , Asuncion , says many wanted a leadership change to help confront the poverty and unemployment rife in the country .
Mr Lugo brought together leftist unions , indigenous people and poor farmers into a coalition to form the centre - left Patriotic Alliance for Change .
I invite Paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again
Fernando Lugo
Celebrating change
In pictures : Opposition win Observers say that the man often described as the " bishop for the poor " , is a virtual political novice , best known for his advocacy of land reform and calls to renegotiate an energy treaty with neighbouring Brazil .
Speaking to his supporters at his campaign headquarters , Mr Lugo said the result showed that little people could also win and that this was the Paraguay he had dreamt about - a country for everyone .
" I invite Paraguayans of all political types , even the ones who do n't share our ideals , to help this country that was once great be great again , " he told the cheering crowd .
Our correspondent says that jubilant supporters of Mr Lugo packed the streets of the capital , waving banners and singing songs , as it became clear not only that he had won , but that the victory would be respected .
Blanca Ovelar was the Colorado Party 's first female candidate Ms Ovelar , whose campaign to become the first woman president had suffered from internal party divisions , acknowledged defeat , and wished the country " a time of reconciliation " and " joint reconstruction " .
Sitting President Nicanor Duarte hailed the democratic process : " For the first time in our history , one party will transfer power to another without a coup , without bloodshed and without fighting among brothers , " he told a news conference .
Challenges ahead Mr Lugo 's victory brings to an end one of the longest periods of continuous rule by any party in the world - the Colorado Party has been in power since 1947 .
" This is the first time in my life that I have witnessed a power change in my country and so has my mother in her 60s , " Oliver , a resident of Asuncion , told the BBC news website .
" Sixty - one years is too many for any party to remain in power . "
The switch in power is also the latest in a series of election triumphs by leftist , or centre - left , leaders in South America .
But Mr Lugo has rejected accusations from Mr Duarte that he will follow the style of leftist leaders in Bolivia and Venezuela once in office .
Mr Duarte had warned that what he called agitators from Venezuela and Ecuador were trying to meddle in the poll .
Our correspondent says the celebrations will last well into the night in Asuncion , but there seems little doubt that the challenges facing the new president when he takes office in August will be enormous .
Inequality and corruption are persistent problems and poverty remains widespread , particularly in the rural areas , with many are forced to leave the country in search of work .

What are these ?
A young friend recently served fifteen months as a combat infantryman at an isolated patrol base in the nasty farmlands south of Baghdad .
One day , he was enjoying a hot meal in the chow hall at a nearby forwarding operating base , when Condoleezza Rice appeared on the TV screen saying that the violence in Iraq had n’t reached the point at which random bodies were turning up in the streets .
The noise of dozens of hungry soldiers eating came to a stop .
Some of them exchanged glances , but no one said a word .
Since my friend , while out on patrol , regularly came across the corpses of tortured and murdered Iraqi civilians , he wondered if the Secretary of State was dissembling or deluded .
It was , he let me know , a bad moment for him and his buddies .
I thought of this story when I read the transcript of an interview last Friday with President Bush by Martha Raddatz , of ABC .
Bush , under the kind of questioning he rarely gets , admitted that in 2006 , with violence soaring , he worried that the mission in Iraq might be headed for failure .
But , in order to keep up morale among the troops , he kept insisting at the time that we were “ winning . ”
Phillip Carter ( whose excellent blog Intel Dump has just been picked up by the Washington Post ) was serving as an Army adviser to the Iraqi courts during those grim months ; I spent a few days at his compound in downtown Baquba in early 2006 .
He writes that he is n’t cheered to learn of the President ’s solicitousness for his state of mind :
All through this period , I remember the President , his senior aides and senior military commanders toeing the party line that things were going swimmingly .
The dissonance between the rhetoric from Washington and our experience in Iraq was stark .
We knew the ground truth .
Being deceived by our senior political leaders certainly did n’t change that , nor did it help morale at all .
If anything , it hurt morale by undermining confidence in the chain of command .
Put bluntly , if you ca n’t trust your generals and political leaders to tell you and your families the truth , how can you trust them at all ?
I would argue that the morale - boosting the President now credits himself with did even more harm than that .
It was n’t as though the White House was feverishly correcting in private the problems that it refused to acknowledge publicly for fear of crushing the spirit of Captain Phillip Carter .
Instead , while Iraq descended into a death spiral , Bush continued for months , even years , to pursue the bankrupt strategy of handing over responsibility from an undermanned American military to an Iraqi army that was incapable of holding ground .
I ’ve been told by a former White House official that the President had misgivings but remained confident in the strategy ’s author , Donald Rumsfeld .
When I interviewed Rice in early 2006 and asked her whether the strategy might be headed for failure , she dismissed the possibility : “ Even though there is violence , there is a process that is moving , I think rather inexorably , actually , toward an outcome that will one day bring a stable Iraq . ”
This was n’t morale - boosting .
It was what the Administration calls strategic communications , otherwise known as political propaganda .
And , in the end , it became self - delusion .
You ca n’t keep lying to the troops and the public without eventually believing your own words .
This , in turn , makes it impossible to analyze and correct mistakes .
It ensures failure , and failure kills morale .
On my desk I have a copy of Douglas Feith ’s new book , “ War and Decision ” — the first memoir by a main architect of the war policy in Washington .
Once I ’ve read it , I ’ll let you know whether Feith shows any more evidence of self - critical thinking than he or anyone else in the Administration demonstrated throughout the years of the war .
Punitive damages have deep roots in American and English common law , but their nature has changed here over time .
“ Until well into the 19th century , ” Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court wrote in 2001 , “ punitive damages frequently operated to compensate for intangible injuries ” like pain and suffering or emotional distress .
These days , driven by the structure of the American civil justice system , entrepreneurial plaintiffs ’ lawyers and the populism they embrace , punitive damages are used to send messages to large corporations , to fill gaps in regulation and to reward successful plaintiffs with multiples of what they have lost .
Distinctive features of the American legal system  civil juries , class actions , contingency fees and the requirement that each side bear its own lawyers ’ fees  all play a role in amplifying punitive damages .
Punitive damages are so embedded in the American legal system that the rationale for them is rarely explored .
One of the best explanations came from a German Supreme Court decision in 1992 , which said the concept had four main purposes : to punish the offender for “ uncivilized conduct , ” to deter the offender and others from doing similar things , to reward the plaintiff for enforcing the law and so improve “ general law and order , ” and to supplement inadequate compensatory damages .
The case decided by the German court , like the one involving Kurt Parrott , was an effort to enforce a judgment from an American court against a defendant who had no assets in this country and refused to pay .
Ordinarily , it is a relatively routine matter to ask a foreign court to enforce an American court judgment .
Not so when punitive damages are involved , even where the conduct in question is shocking .
The German case , for instance , involved sexual abuse .
In 1985 , a state court in Stockton , Calif. , entered a $ 750,000 judgment , including $ 400,000 in punitive damages , against Eckhard Schmitz for abusing a 13 - year - old boy .
Mr. Schmitz would not pay , and he fled to Germany while he was appealing a 13 - year criminal sentence for engaging in sex with other teenage boys .
But the German court nonetheless said that the dangers of allowing punitive awards outweighed the benefits .
The plaintiff should not get a windfall , the court said , and should not be allowed to act as a “ ‘ private public prosecutor ’ infringing the German state ’s monopoly on punishment with its associated safeguards . ”
The German court did enforce the $ 350,000 compensatory award .
The Italian court , by contrast , refused to enforce any of the $ 1 million award to Kurt Parrott ’s mother because the Alabama judge had not said how much of it was for compensation and how much for punishment .
Who knew moths this big even existed ?
The Atlas moth ( Attacus Atlas ) is is a large moth found in the tropical and subtropical forests of Southeast Asia , southern China , common across the Malay archipelago , Thailand to Indonesia .
These moths are considered the largest in the world in terms of total wing surface area ( 65 square inches ) .
In Hong Kong the Cantonese name translates as “ snake ’s head moth “ , referring to apical extension of the forewing , which bears a passing resemblance to a snake ’s head .
Another interesting characteristic of the Atlas moth is that it does n’t have fully developed mouth - parts , so it ca n’t feed …ever .
It survives on the larval fat reserves , throughout their entire 1 - 2 weeks adult lives .

TOKYO - Police say a homeless woman who sneaked into a man 's house and lived undetected in his closet for a year was arrested in Japan after he became suspicious when food mysteriously began disappearing .
Police found the 58 - year - old woman Thursday hiding in the top compartment of the man 's closet and arrested her for trespassing .
The resident of the home installed security cameras that transmitted images to his mobile phone after becoming puzzled by food disappearing from his kitchen over the past several months .
One of the cameras captured someone moving inside his home Thursday after he had left , and he called police believing it was a burglar .
However , when they arrived they found the door locked and all windows closed .
The woman told police she had no place to live and first sneaked into the man 's house about a year ago when he left it unlocked .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - When CEO Takeo Fukui says he would spend $ 10 billion to rack up a Formula One victory for Honda , you get the sense that he really means it .
Honda Motor Co. President and Chief Executive Officer Takeo Fukui speaks during an interview in Tokyo May 22 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
Under Fukui's five - year leadership , Honda Motor 's 7267 .
T car sales have jumped by a third and profits by an even bigger margin to a record $ 5.8 billion last year .
But it ’s the lack of an F1 win that sticks in the craw of the 63 - year - old former engineer , who joined Honda precisely because it was the first Japanese automaker to enter the world ’s premier motor sport .
Fukui just does n’t like to lose .
“ When it comes to F1 , our score is zero .
It kills me , ” Fukui , once an amateur racer himself , told a small group of reporters last week .
“ If I could fix it with a trillion yen I would , but it ’s not a problem that money can solve . ”
The Tokyo native is taking that same fierce competitive streak to the battle against giant Toyota Motor 7203 .
T in gasoline - electric hybrid technology .
Toyota beat Honda to the hybrid market by two years with its Prius in 1997 .
The vastly improved second - generation Prius in 2003 became an instant hit , helping Japan ’s top automaker win a reputation overnight as the frontrunner in green technology .
Honda ’s own efforts have been stop - and - go .
After launching the Insight two - seater in 1999 , Japan ’s No.2 automaker discontinued sales of two underpowered hybrid models , leaving the gasoline - electric Civic and hybrid sales at a fraction of Toyota’s .
Honda detailed plans last week to change that .
Using technological advances that would make its hybrid system cheaper and more profitable , Honda will roll out three affordable hybrid cars over the next few years .
With gasoline prices going through the roof , Honda hopes to sell about 500,000 hybrids a year by 2015 -- nine times what it sold last year -- rivaling Toyota ’s own goal of boosting hybrid sales to a tenth of its total sales after 2010 .
“ We ’re losing the image game in Japan to Toyota , and that ’s tough to take , ” Fukui said , before adding that he believed Honda ’s environmental cachet was still superior to Toyota ’s in the United States , the world ’s biggest market .
Fukui knows what it feels like to persevere in the face of failure and end up winning big .
He got his first taste soon after joining in 1969 , when Honda was mainly an engine and motorcycle maker .
The first job assigned to Fukui was reducing toxic exhaust emissions from car engines -- a project that legendary founder Soichiro Honda had recently placed at the top of his priority list .
After Fukui failed several times , the late Honda , who headed R&D at the time , berated the young engineer , telling him to think out of the box , Fukui remembers .
It was sound advice .
In 1974 , Fukui flew to the United States for a government test that certified the vehicle based on the new CVCC engine as the first to clear the U.S. Clean Air Act based on engine performance alone .
Honda , which only started making cars in the 1960s , named the vehicle Civic , a runaway hit that helped put Honda on the global car industry map .
Occupying Honda ’s post decades later as head of R&D , Fukui , whom one engineer described as “ cool and smart , unlike Soichiro - san , who was prone to yelling ” , pushed the rank and file to raise its game .
On the same day in December 2002 , Honda and Toyota became the world ’s first automakers to put a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle on the road .
Fukui has also watched Toyota , with more than twice as many vehicle sales and nearly three times as much profit , follow Honda ’s lead in developing humanoid robots and airplanes .
So what about the elusive Formula One ?
“ We ’ve done what needs to be done to win , ” said Fukui .
“ I think now it ’s only a matter of waiting . ”

Amid mounting food crisis , governments fear revolution of the hungry
By Bill Van Auken
15 April 2008
Last week ’s meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the Group of Seven were convened in the shadow of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
While Wall Street ’s turmoil and the deepening credit crunch dominated discussions , leaders of the global financial institutions were forced to take note of the growing global food emergency , warning of the threat of widespread hunger and already emerging political instability .
The seven major capitalist powers in the G - 7 — the US , Japan , Germany , Britain , France , Italy and Canada — made virtually no mention of the global food crisis , referring in only one brief reference to the risk of “ high oil and commodity prices . ”
Instead , they focused on the stability of the financial markets , promising measures to shore up investor confidence .
The IMF and World Bank , however , felt compelled to acknowledge the emerging worldwide catastrophe , in part because while these agencies are instruments of the main imperialist powers , they must posture as responsive to the needs of all countries .
It would be too revealing for them to focus exclusively on the fate of major finance houses , while ignoring the fact that hundreds of millions across the planet are being threatened with starvation .
More decisive , however , is the realization that this crisis confronting the most impoverished countries and poorest sections of the world ’s population is threatening to unleash a revolution of the hungry that could topple governments across large parts of the world .
Even as the IMF and World Bank were meeting , the government of Haiti was forced out in a no-confidence vote passed in response to several days of demonstrations and protests against rising food prices and hunger that swept all the country ’s major cities .
Clashes between protesters and United Nations occupation troops left at least five people dead and scores wounded and saw crowds attempt to storm the presidential palace .
Food prices in Haiti had risen on average by 40 percent in less than a year , with the cost of staples such as rice doubling .
The same essential story has been repeated in country after country , from Africa to the Middle East , south Asia and Latin America .
* In Bangladesh , on Saturday , some 20,000 textile workers took to the streets to denounce soaring food prices and demand higher wages .
The price of rice in the country has doubled over the past year , threatening the workers , who earn a monthly salary of just $ 25 , with hunger .
Scores were injured in clashes with police , who used gunfire in an attempt to disperse the crowds .
* In Egypt , protests by workers over food prices rocked the textile center of Mahalla al - Kobra , north of Cairo , for two days last week , with two people shot dead by security forces .
Hundreds were arrested , and the government sent plainclothes police into the factories to force workers to work .
Food prices in Egypt have risen by 40 percent in the past year .
* Unions and shopkeepers staged a two - day general strike in the West African nation of Burkina Faso last week to protest high prices .
The strikers demanded a “ significant and effective ” cut in the price of rice and other staples .
* Several hundred demonstrators marched on parliament in Phnom Penh , Cambodia April 6 to protest food price hikes .
The cost of a kilogram of rice has risen to $ 1 in a country where the average income is barely 50 cents a day .
Police armed with cattle prods broke up the protest .
* Earlier this month , in the Ivory Coast , thousands marched on the home of President Laurent Gbagbo , chanting “ we are hungry ” and “ life is too expensive , you are going to kill us . ”
The country has seen food prices soar by between 30 percent and 60 percent from one week to the next .
Police broke up the protest with tear gas and batons , injuring over a dozen people .
Similar demonstrations , strikes and clashes have taken place in Bolivia , Peru , Mexico , Indonesia , the Philippines , Pakistan , Uzbekistan , Thailand , Yemen , Ethiopia , and throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa .
With terrifying rapidity , hundreds of millions of people all over the planet have been confronted with the inability to obtain the basic necessities of life .
The global capitalist market is dictating intolerable conditions for masses of people on every continent , provoking a worldwide eruption of class struggle .
It is the concern that this struggle will spin out of control that found expression in the statements of concern issued by the IMF and World Bank leaders together with finance ministers and central bank chiefs gathered in Washington .
“ If food prices go on as they are today , then the consequences on the population in a large set of countries , including Africa , but not only Africa , will be terrible .
Hundreds of thousands of people will be starving .
Children will suffer from malnutrition , with consequences all of their lives , ” Dominique Strauss - Kahn , the International Monetary Fund managing director , told an April 12 press conference in Washington .
He warned that governments “ will see what they have done totally destroyed and their legitimacy facing the population destroyed also . ”
Strauss - Kahn added : “ So it ’s not only a humanitarian question .
It is not only an economic question .
It is also a democratic question .
Those kind of questions sometimes end into war . ”
“ In just two months , ” World Bank President Robert Zoellick said in an opening speech to the meeting of finance ministers , “ rice prices have skyrocketed to near historical levels , rising by around 75 percent globally and more in some markets , with more likely to come .
“ In Bangladesh , a 2 - kilogram bag of rice , ” he said , holding up such a bag , “ now consumes about half of the daily income of a poor family . ”
He added that wheat prices had increased by 120 percent , more than doubling the cost of a loaf of bread .
“ If food prices go on as they are today , then the consequences on the population in a large set of countries ... will be terrible , ” said Zoellick .
The “ international community will also need to take urgent and concerted action in order to avoid the larger political and security implications of this growing crisis , ” United Nations Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon told international finance and trade officials at a UN meeting following the weekend talks in Washington .
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food Jean Ziegler offered among the bleakest prognoses for the continuing crisis .
“ We are heading for a very long period of rioting , conflicts ( and ) waves of uncontrollable regional instability marked by the despair of the most vulnerable populations , ” he told the French daily Liberation Monday .
He pointed out that , even before the present crisis , hunger claimed the life of a child under the age of 10 every 5 seconds , and 854 million people in the world were seriously undernourished .
What was now posed , Ziegler warned , is “ an imminent massacre . ”
While finance ministers from the US and Europe indicated agreement that the crisis was severe , there was no indication that the major capitalist powers have any plan to mount the kind of effort needed to stave off a humanitarian catastrophe .
The White House announced Monday that it is releasing $ 200 million in emergency food aid in response to a World Bank appeal for funding to make up for the shortfall in food assistance caused by soaring prices .
The amount — roughly what the US spends in half a day on its war to conquer Iraq — is less than a drop in the bucket in the face of the looming global catastrophe .
In the end , the crisis is a product of the capitalist market itself .
It is not a matter of too many mouths to feed or too little food to supply human needs .
Food is available , but the market has driven prices to a level out of reach for a growing portion of humanity in the most oppressed countries , and at the same effectively slashing the living standards of workers in the more advanced capitalist world .
This process is driven by a number of factors , including climatic ones , such as the impact of a drought in Australia on wheat production and a flood in Bangladesh on rice .
There is also the rise in demand , particularly from growing middle class layers in India and China .
But more fundamental is the effect of speculation in food as a commodity — like oil and precious metals .
It has become a haven for financial investors fleeing from paper assets tainted by subprime mortgages and other toxic credit products .
The influx of buyers drives prices and makes food unaffordable for the world ’s poor .
“ Fund money flowing into agriculture has boosted prices , ” Standard Chartered Bank food commodities analyst Abah Ofon told the media .
“ It ’s fashionable .
This is the year of agricultural commodities . ”
Speculation in food as a commodity has been sharply accelerated by the decline in the value of the dollar , soaring oil prices and the promotion of biofuel production in the US and elsewhere .
This attempt to generate a new investment “ bubble , ” based on the fraud that somehow turning corn into ethanol represents a “ green ” alternative to fossil fuels , has driven up the price not only of corn , but other grains , while diverting a major share of food production into a more profitable venture .
Subsidized by the US government , American farmers have diverted fully 30 percent of corn production into the ethanol scheme , driving up the cost of other , more expensive , grains that are being bought as substitutes for animal feed .
“ When a biofuel policy is launched in the United States , thanks to subsidies of $ 6 billion , of bio-fuels that drains 138 million tons of corn from the market , the foundation is laid for a crime against humanity to satisfy one ’s own thirst for fuel , ” the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food Jean Ziegler told Liberation .
This assessment was repeated by India ’s finance minister , Palaniappan Chidambaram , who declared , “ When millions of people are going hungry , it ’s a crime against humanity that food should be diverted to biofuels . ”
US officials dismissed the charges , insisting that biofuel production was only one factor among many and indicating that there is no plan to change Washington ’s policy .
Country after country has been left vulnerable to the global commodity price surge by “ free market ” policies implemented at the demands of Washington and the international financial agencies such as the IMF and World Bank over the past quarter century .
The closer integration of the economies of the oppressed countries into the world market has been accompanied by their increasing concentration on specialized export crops , while tariff barriers have been demolished , opening the way to subsidized agricultural staples from the more advanced countries capturing local markets .
Now , attempts by individual national governments to remedy the problem within their own borders — often taking the form of commodity producers erecting barriers on exports — have served to exacerbate the crisis internationally , driving food prices even higher , while triggering protests by farmers in countries stretching from India to Argentina .
According to a recent World Bank survey , at least 58 countries have implemented at least some form of food - trade protectionism .
What is emerging in the crisis over food prices is a tumultuous manifestation of a breakdown of the global capitalist order .
The catastrophe facing billions of people around the globe cannot be resolved within the confines of a system based on private profit and the nation state .
The revolutionary implications of this crisis are beginning to dawn on elements within the ruling establishment itself .
In an article published Monday , the influential US magazine Time noted : “ The idea of the starving masses driven by their desperation to take to the streets and overthrow the ancien regime has seemed impossibly quaint since capitalism triumphed so decisively in the Cold War ...
And yet , the headlines of the past month suggest that skyrocketing food prices are threatening the stability of a growing number of governments around the world . ”

( Fortune Magazine ) --
As president of Google , Larry Page has pushed his people to take risks that have led to hot new applications like Gmail and Google Maps .
Lately he has been thinking far outside the walls of his company .
Page sees a world of opportunity - in areas ranging from energy to safer cars .
But he also sees a world of timidity ; not enough people , he worries , are willing to place the big bets that could make a difference in meeting humanity 's biggest challenges .
In these edited excerpts from an interview with Fortune managing editor Andy Serwer at Google 's ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) headquarters in Mountain View , Calif . , Page offers his views on innovation , change , fear - and why he is , all things considered , an optimist .
What are you thinking about these days ?
If you ask an economist what 's driven economic growth , it 's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming , mass manufacturing , things like that .
The problem is , our society is not organized around doing that .
People are not working on things that could have that kind of influence .
We forget that it really does matter that we do n't have to carry our water ; it 's not that much fun to walk miles and miles to try to find water and then carry it back under human power .
And our ability to generate clean , accessible water is based on basic technologies :
Do we have energy ?
Can we make things ?
My argument is that people are n't thinking that way .
Instead , it 's sort of like " We are captives of the world , and whatever happens , happens . "
That 's not the case at all .
It really matters whether people are working on generating clean energy or improving transportation or making the Internet work better and all those things .
And small groups of people can have a really huge impact .
How can we increase the number of people doing such work ?
There are a number of barriers in place .
Let me give an example .
In our first founders ' letter in 2004 , we talked about the risk profile with respect to doing new innovations .
We said we would do some things that would have only a 10 % chance of making $ 1 billion over the long term .
But we do n't put many people on those things ; 90 % work on everything else .
So that 's not a big risk .
And if you look at where many of our new features come from , it 's from these riskier investments .
Even when we started Google , we thought , " Oh , we might fail , " and we almost did n't do it .
The reason we started is that Stanford said , " You guys can come back and finish your Ph.D.s if you do n't succeed . "
Probably that one decision caused Google to be created .
It 's not clear we would have done it otherwise .
We had all this internal risk we had just invented .
It 's not that we were going to starve or not get jobs or not have a good life or whatever , but you have this fear of failing and of doing something new , which is very natural .
In order to do stuff that matters , you need to overcome that .
Are there mechanisms that society , government , or companies can put into place ?
Absolutely - look at Silicon Valley , which has been the premier place in the world to do things like that .
There 's been a lot of money available and a lot of people encouraging other people to take risks .
I do n't know that we would have done it had we been in a different environment .
On the one hand you 're saying it 's a problem .
On the other , you 're saying it 's being done .
I do n't think it 's black - and - white like that .
The question is , How many people are working on things that can move the needle on the economy or on people 's quality of life ?
Look , 40,000 people a year are killed in the U.S. in auto accidents .
Who 's going to make that number zero or very , very small ?
There are people working on it .
A group of researchers has developed a novel way to view the world through the eyes of a common fly and partially decode the insect ’s reactions to changes in the world around it .
The research fundamentally alters earlier beliefs about how neural networks function and could provide the basis for intelligent computers that mimic biological processes .
In an article published in the Public Library of Science Computational Biology Journal , Los Alamos physicist Ilya Nemenman joins Geoffrey Lewen , William Bialek and Rob de Ruyter van Steveninck of the Hun School of Princeton , Princeton University and Indiana University , respectively , in describing the research .
The team used tiny electrodes to tap into motion - sensitive neurons in the visual system of a common blowfly .
Neurons are nerve cells that emit tiny electric spikes when stimulated .
The electrodes detected pulses from the motion - sensitive neurons in the fly .
The fly uses the neurons to estimate , and subsequently control , how it moves through the world .
The team harnessed the wired fly into an elaborate turntable - like mechanism that mimics the kind of acrobatic flight a fly might undergo while evading a predator or chasing another fly .
The mechanism can spin extremely fast and change velocities quickly .
A fly in the mechanism sees changes in the world around it and its motion - sensitive neurons react much in the same way as they would if the insect were actually flying .
Under complex flight scenarios , the fly ’s neurons fired very quickly .
The researchers looked at the firing patterns and mapped them with a binary code of ones and zeroes , much like computer instructions , or binary messages in digital phone communications .
The team found that the impulses were like a primitive , but very regular “ language ” — with the neuron firing at precise times depending on what the fly ’s visual sensors were trying to tell the rest of the fly about the visual stimulus .
When they examined this language , it spoke volumes about how the harnessed fly reacted to its world .
“ In this system , the motion - sensitive neurons emit spikes very often and very precisely , ” said Nemenman .
“ Historically , people have observed a lot more random spike intervals .
This research is a departure from the traditional understanding in that we see that the precision of spike timing that carries information about the fly ’s rotation is a factor of ten higher than even the most daring previous estimates . ”
Similar - though - much - simpler experiments on different subjects , including flies , and going back to the seminal work of E. D. Adrian and Yngve Zotterman in 1926 , seemed to show that sensory neurons would fire a certain number of impulses during a given period , but that the precise timing of the impulses was largely irrelevant .
Nemenman and his team believe the timing of the spikes was not as crucial during those early experiments largely because the artificial stimulation was in some sense unnatural , bordering on the monotonous and predictable .
“ Biological organisms have an interest in conserving energy , ” Nemenman said .
“ Fly eyes account for about one - tenth of the fly ’s energy consumption .
The fly wants to be very efficient , but it costs energy and molecular resources to emit many precise spikes in the neurons .
“ If you are presenting simple stimuli where little changes with time , then the most efficient way to encode them may be to generate few randomly positioned spikes , which would be sufficient to convey whatever small changes , if any , happened .
Similarly , if the stimulus is unnaturally fast , the neurons may not be able to encode it well .
“ However , if you put an organism in an environment with fast and naturally changing velocity profiles , the fly starts using all the bandwidth available to it , ” Nemenman said .
“ The motion - sensitive neuron adjusts its coding strategy and it uses the precise positioning of the spikes to tell the rest of the fly exactly what is happening . ”
In addition to the complex motions possible with the team ’s apparatus , they conducted their experiment in a wooded setting similar to the fly ’s natural environment , adding to the complexity and realism of the experiment .
Nemenman and his colleagues ’ research is significant because it re-examines fundamental assumptions that became the basis of neuromimetic approaches to artificial intelligence , such as artificial neural networks .
These assumptions have developed networks based on reacting to a number of impulses within a given time period rather than the precise timing of those impulses .
“ This may be one of the main reasons why artificial neural networks do not perform anywhere comparable to a mammalian visual brain , ” said Nemenman , who is a member of Los Alamos ’ Computer , Computational and Statistical Sciences Division .
“ In fact , the National Science Foundation has recognized the importance of this distinction and has recently funded a project , led by Garrett Kenyon of the Laboratory ’s Physics Division , to enable creation of large , next - generation neural networks . ”
New understanding of neural function in the design of computers could assist in analyses of satellite images and facial - pattern recognition in high - security environments , and could help solve other national and global security problems .
Now , we know that the MacBook Air is one thin laptop , but some Apple forum members in Germany are claiming that the edge of the laptop is not only sharp -- but downright dangerous .
According to " Apple Talk " reader Bajuware , his MBA went kill - crazy all over his elbow while he was cold - chillin ' on his couch .
The details are a little hard to suss out due to the language barrier ( and machine translation ) , but it would appear the Air 's bottom edge made nasty work of the human flesh like someone had insulted its mother .
Another MBA owner claims his computer is sharp enough to slice bread , though we assume it 's not used for buttering .
Honestly , we 're not sure what kind of danger an innocent MacBook Air could really pose besides causing you to throw out your back constantly plugging in the AC to charge that not - quite - as - advertised battery .
Dan Ariely is a behavioral economist at the Massachusetts Intitute of Technology and author of the best - selling book , Predictably Irrational ( HarperCollins , 2008 ) .
In recent years , he has demonstrated that random digits can influence bids in an auction , that sexual arousal leads to reckless decisions ( at least in college males ) and that brand - name aspirin is more effective at treating headaches than generic aspirin , even when the pills are identical .
Mind Matters editor Jonah Lehrer chats with Ariely about his research .
LEHRER : You are a cognitive psychologist by training .
What led you to become interested in behavioral economics ?
ARIELY : What motivates me the most is trying to take what we ’ve learned from cognitive psychology and apply it to real world problems in an attempt to improve the way we live .
The interesting thing about economics is that it has become the main guiding principle for policymakers , lawmakers and businesses .
My hope for the kind of work I do , and for behavioral economics in general , is that by augmenting standard economics it could help design better policies that actually work with what people can compute and the ways they reason .
In particular , I think that this approach in behavioral economics can have a substantial impact on savings , health care and a tendency to engage in risky behaviors .
LEHRER : Many of your experiments have direct connections to everyday decision - making .
Do you get the ideas for these experiments from your own life ?
ARIELY : Yes .
Most of my experiments begin as a way for me to investigate and gain a better understanding of my own behavior or the behavior that I observe around me .
I also get many ideas from talking to people and from current events .
For example my fascination with cheating began with Enron and my current research on mortgages started with the sub - prime mortgage crisis .
LEHRER : You 've documented many ways in which people are " predictably irrational . "
Are there certain irrational behaviors that have particularly surprised you ?
ARIELY : At this stage not much surprises me anymore .
But perhaps the most surprising is the fact that many people , particularly economists , believe that we are perfectly rational .
LEHRER : If you could only give someone a single piece of advice for dealing with his or her irrational brain , what would it be ?
ARIELY : To try to remain aware of our irrationality in situations where we have a strong tendency to act irrationally .
This is easier in situations where we have a history of acting irrationally .
For instance , since we are all realizing that we ’re not saving enough for retirement maybe it is time to take action and force ourselves to behave better .
One way to do this is by having money automatically transferred from our checking account into a retirement savings account at the beginning of each month — essentially taking the decision outside of our consideration so that we do n’t even give ourselves the opportunity to think about spending money that we know we should save .
As a result of putting such plans in action , our behaviors will coincide with our intentions .
LEHRER : What future research projects are you most excited about ?
ARIELY : The two big fields I want to apply my research to next are financial savings and health care .
In health care I am interested in figuring out how we can get people to eat better and take preventative health measures that will hopefully lead to early diagnoses .
In financial savings I want to find ways to get people to improve their reasoning about financial decision - making and create more habitual savings .

And he wants to run on the Bush Iraq plan ?
Iraqis do n't seem to be so enthralled by it , considering the upsurge in violence during McCain and Cheney 's concurrent visits .
Of course , to them , that 's progress .
WaPo :
Sen .
John McCain , traveling in the Middle East to promote his foreign policy expertise , misidentified in remarks Tuesday which broad category of Iraqi extremists are allegedly receiving support from Iran .
He said several times that Iran , a predominately Shiite country , was supplying the mostly Sunni militant group , al - Qaeda .
In fact , officials have said they believe Iran is helping Shiite extremists in Iraq .
Speaking to reporters in Amman , the Jordanian capital , McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives " taking al - Qaeda into Iran , training them and sending them back . "
Pressed to elaborate , McCain said it was " common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al - Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran , that 's well known .
And it 's unfortunate . "
A few moments later , Sen. Joseph Lieberman , standing just behind McCain , stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate 's ear .
McCain then said : " I 'm sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not al - Qaeda . "
The mistake threatened to undermine McCain 's argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists .
In recent days , McCain has repeatedly said his intimate knowledge of foreign policy make him the best equipped to answer a phone ringing in the White House late at night .
McCain was in Jordan leading a week - long Congressional delegation and has stressed that the trip was not political , despite the decision to hold a fundraiser in London later this week .

The Pentagon 's way - out researchers do n't just want to build an Internet simulator , to test out cyberwar tactics .
They want the range 's operators to " realistically replicate human behavior and frailties , " too .
Congress has ordered the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , or Darpa , to put together a National Cyber Range , as part of a massive ( and massively secret ) $ 30 billion , government - wide effort better prep for battle online .
The project is now considered a top priority for the Agency .
And to make sure the facility is as true - to - life as possible , Darpa wants the contractors running the Range to be able to " replicate realistic human behavior on nodes , " a request for proposals , released today , reveals .
Specifically , the Agency wants to have its contractors :
*• Provide robust technologies to emulate human behavior on all nodes of the range for testing all aspects of range behavior .
• Replicants will produce realistic chain of events between many users without explicit scripting behavior .
• Replicants must be capable of implementing multiple user roles similar to roles found on operational networks .
• Replicant behavior will change as the network environment changes , as the replicated “ outside environment ” ( i.e. DoD DefCon , InfoCon , execution of war plans , etc ) changes , and as network activity changes
( detected attacks , degradation of services , etc ) .
• Replicants will simulate physical interaction with device peripherals , such as keyboard and mice .
• Replicants will drive all common applications on a desktop environments .
• Replicants will interact with authenticate systems , including but not limited to DoD authentication systems ( common access cards – CAC ) , identity tokens . *
These mock people have to be able to " demonstrate human - level behavior on 80 percent of all events , " the Agency adds .
And mimicking us flesh - and - blood types is only one of a wide array of tasks Darpa wants to see operators of the National Cyber Range , or NCR , pull off .
The facility should also feature a
" realistic , sophisticated , nation - state quality offensive and defensive opposition forces " that can fight military info - warriors in mock combat .
Contractors have to be ready to create 10,000 - node tests from government - provided " network diagrams and configuration files " in less than two hours .
And those nodes can't just be computers tied into a faux Internet .
The NCR 's operators should be able to " integrate , replicate , or simulate " military satellite and digital radio communications , mobile ad - hoc networks , physical access control systems , U.S. and foreign " unmanned aerial vehicles , weapons , [ and ]
radar systems " – even " cyber cafes " and " personal digital assistances
[ sic ] . "
Darpa is moving fast on the project , its first since the dawn of the space age that comes from a direct order from Congress .
Although there 's no money in the Agency 's budget for the NCR – yet – Darpa has already begun reaching out to potential contractors .

A 2 - year - old cat is recovering after being dumped in a Baldwin Park parking lot with its mouth , eyes and paws bound in duct tape .
The cat was found in a cardboard box in the parking lot of Los Angeles County ’s Baldwin Park animal shelter , the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reported .

An employee rescued the feline , which has since been named “ Amigo , ” according to the shelter ’s Facebook page .
The cat was found “ gasping for air , ” the county ’s Department of Animal Care and Control told the Tribune in a statement .

“ He ’s just a little bit overwhelmed , ” department spokeswoman Evelina Villa said .
“ He was fearful at first , but he ’s opening up a little .
We ’re just happy he ’s OK . ”
Amigo was found with his two front paws and two rear paws taped together .
His face was also wrapped up .

“ I ca n’t imagine why someone would do this to a cat , ” animal control Director Marcia Mayeda told the Tribune .
“ Animal cruelty is heartbreaking , intolerable and usually a precursor to human violence . ”
The cat will first have to be rehabilitated before it ’s well enough to be adopted , she said .

As you may have noticed , things have not been going well , recently , for the American Hegemony .
That would be the global hegemony the wonderful folks who call themselves “ neo-conservatives ”  having been denied military victory in the Cold War by the internal collapse of the Soviet Union  have been determined to achieve any way they can .
But the neo-crazies are not totally to blame for the developing debacle .
In Bosnia , North Korea , Lebanon , Syria , Turkey , Iraq , Iran , Afghanistan , Pakistan , etc .
There is plenty of blame to spread around .
Scroll back to the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact in 1989 .
Both the Soviet Union and the United States began to withdraw from service the tens of thousands of nukes that had been specifically developed and deployed to fight NATO - Warsaw Pact battles .
Two years later , with the Soviet Union on the verge of economic collapse , Russian officials came to “ lobby ” the U.S. Congress .
By then , the vast majority of Soviet nukes had been returned to Russia .
The Russian delegation told Senator Sam Nunn et al that they wanted to dismantle the tens of thousands of Soviet nukes excess to Russian needs , recover the fissile material ( essentially pure U - 235 uranium and Pu-239 plutonium ) from those dismantled nukes , and then store it until they could eventually dispose of it as reactor fuel .
The problem was , the Russians didnt have the money to do all of that .
Would Congress help ?
Rarely has Congress responded so quickly to any request .
The “ Nunn - Lugar ” Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act was attached to the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Implementation Act of 1991 , which just happened to be pending before the Senate .
Nunn -Lugar began by noting “ that Soviet President Gorbachev has requested Western help in dismantling nuclear weapons and President Bush has proposed United States co-operation on the storage , transportation , dismantling , and destruction of Soviet nuclear weapons . ”
Nunn - Lugar then declared “ that it is in the national security interest of the United States to facilitate on a priority basis the transportation , storage , safeguarding , and destruction of nuclear and other weapons in the Soviet Union , its republics , and any successor entities , and to assist in the prevention of weapons proliferation . ”
President George H. W. Bush was immediately authorized to “ reprogram ” up to $ 400 million from funds already appropriated for that fiscal year to the Department of Defense to implement Nunn - Lugar .
Now , back in 1992 , Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense and Paul Wolfowitz was Undersecretary for Policy .
Periodically , the Undersecretary develops for the Secretary a top - secret document entitled Defense Planning Guidance .
The document is supposed to be “ threat - driven . ”
Once developed and approved , the Secretary issues it to the military Departments and to the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
It tells them what their “ force structure ” needs to be as well as the manpower , weapons , equipment , and logistical support that will be required to meet the “ threat . ”
So when the New York Times revealed in 1992 some contents of Wolfowitzs Defense Planning Guidance  which “ envisioned a future in which the United States could , and should , prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power ”  there was understandably quite a flap , here and abroad , in and out of government .
Those kind of statements belong  if anywhere  in National Security Strategy documents , developed by the National Security Council staff under the direction of the Presidents National Security Advisor .
National Security Strategy documents are supposed to inform Defense Planning Guidance , not the other way around .
But surely Cheney and the neocrazies shared the Bush - Baker and Nunn - Lugar view that nukes getting into the hands of terrorists was the Number One Threat to our national security ?
They were anxious to implement Nunn - Lugar as soon as possible , werent they ?
Apparently not .
Then or now .
In any event , for the anti-nuclear - everything entourage successor Bill Clinton brought to power , our national security was not as important as world peace .
For Greenpeace , the thousands of nukes  yea , even the hundreds of nuclear power plants  in our hands were apparently more of a threat to world peace than a few “ loose ” nukes in the hands of terrorists .
So , Clinton made it quite clear that he intended to pursue “ a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control ” as required by Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .
Whereas Cheneys neocrazies had essentially declined to implement Nunn - Lugar as intended , Clintons Greenpeace entourage actually hijacked Nunn - Lugar , transforming it from a nuke proliferation prevention program into a nuke disarmament program .
Also , perversely , taking a page from the Cheney - Wolfowitz 1992 grand strategy , Clinton began pushing the boundaries of NATO eastward , toward the walls of the Kremlin .
And , at the urging of human - rights activists and the neocrazies , Clinton bashed the Russians for their efforts to suppress Islamic terrorist activities in Chechnya .
Clinton then angered the Russians by attempting to achieve regime change in Bosnia and Kosovo from 20,000 feet , imperiling Russias Slavic brethren , the Serbs , on the ground .
Furthermore , in 1998 , after declaring he would never allow the Gulf War sanctions on Iraq to be lifted so long as Saddam Hussein was in power , Clinton sand - bagged the IAEA  which had certified Iraq to be nuke free  by bombing Saddams palaces in and around Baghdad .
Finally , on Clintons “ watch , ” there had been added the Pakistani “ loose ” nuke threat .
Pakistan had surprised everyone in 1998 by testing a half - dozen or so fairly sophisticated nukes just days after India  defying Clinton  had tested several of their own .
The prospect that the next India - Pakistani conflict would involve nukes was bad enough , but President Bush - II inherited a far worse problem .
Nuke - armed Pakistan openly supported the ruling Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan , and the Taliban openly provided refuge to Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda .
What to do ?
Well , obviously , the first thing for Bush - II to do upon taking office was to direct the Pentagon to develop plans for , first , invading Iraq and deposing Saddam Hussein , and , second , invading Iran and deposing the Mullahs .
Obviously .
What about those Pakistani nukes ?
Well , General Musharraf can handle that .
But what about all those human - rights activists  whose support was critical to Bush - II invading Iraq in 2003 , and attacking Iran next year  demanding “ democracy ” in Pakistan .
Okay , tell President Musharraf to resign his military position and work out some sort of power - sharing arrangement with former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
Thatll work .
Now , how are those plans for attacking Iran coming along ?
The French often buy a fresh loaf of bread every day France may be famed for its fabulous bread but a British baker has secured a surprising contract - to ship thousands of loaves across the channel .
It is not the first request from France for the baking firm , based in the South Yorkshire town of Barnsley .
" I nearly fell off my chair laughing , " said director John Foster .
" Asking a Brit to make French sticks ? "
They will ship some 7,000 soft white loaves for use in toasted sandwiches to France every few months .
Mr Foster , of Foster 's Bakery , said he thought that French bakers ' strict adherence to tradition was why suppliers seeking a different kind of bread had to turn further afield .
Question of culture " Perhaps the French bakers were n't willing to be flexible , whereas the good old Brits , we want to please our customers , " Mr Foster said .
He explained that he got his very first order from a French firm complaining that locally made baguettes went stale too quickly .
" We are selling a square brioche product for making croque - monsieur , " Mr Foster said .
The square - shaped loaves of bread , purchased by caterers and restaurants , will be used to make croque - monsieurs , a hot ham and cheese sandwich snack .
Sandrine Huguot , head of press for the traditional French baking chain , Paul , said there was no reason why British bakers could not make bread to the same enviable standard as their French counterparts .
" We have nothing against our English friends , if they respect the ingredients , use them in the same way , with the same culture , then why not ? " she said .
" But for us French consumers , bread that lasts two months simply does not exist , " she added .

They say dogs are like their owners .
Well if these pictures of the world 's fattest pets are anything to go by , there must be some obese dogs - lovers out there , as well as cat and guinea pig owners .
And while chihuahuas may win claim to being the world 's most expensive canines , costing almost £ 90,000 over its lifetime , we 're sure the food bill for these animals set their owners back a pound or two .
Sadly experts say overweight dogs are likely to die two years earlier than lean ones and have a much poorer quality of life , so let 's hope the diet commences soon .

The body is not even a corpse yet and the tug of war over UBS has begun .
First UBS gets a tepid upgrade from Morgan Stanley to “ equal - weight ” from “ underweight ” and a raised price target on the stock .
Morgan Stanley said much of the bad news that the investment bank had been concerned with regarding the stock “ is now on the table . ”
But that ’s like a doctor telling you they ’ve found all your malignant tumors and so ” you ’re better now ” .
Gotta luv ’em , but do n’t trust the upgrade .
Later , Lehman Brothers , which surely has different designs on the bleeding UBS , comes out and says :
UBS AG ’s 22 percent gain this month in Swiss trading may be unwarranted as profit estimates for the bank may disappoint and any breakup of the business would take as much as three years
In three years UBS may very well be gone , crushed under the subprime basement .
All this jostling is just an everyman - for - himself panic as the bank which made the biggest bet at the worst possible time — and saw almost $ 38 billion of write downs and 25 billion francs of losses ( the most by any bank ) as a result — sees its remains publicly sifted through :
Swiss sustainable investment foundation Ethos has offered its qualified support for activist shareholder Olivant Advisers Limited ’s proposal to break - up UBS AG .
And just in case you ’re wondering , in this dog - eat - dog every - man - for - himself world , who is looking out for departing chairman Marcel Ospel ?
Do n’t worry a pensioner has been collecting sympathy money for UBS AG on a village square , local press reported — but secured just 5 cents from passers - by .
Now that ’s an opinion poll we can get behind .
Forget a room with a view -- or even much room .

Obama fills in for Kennedy at Wesleyan
MIDDLETOWN , Conn . ( AP ) — Instead of getting their commencement address Sunday from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , graduates at Connecticut 's Wesleyan University will be hearing from a stand - in , Sen. Barack Obama .
The Democratic presidential front - runner is substituting for his ailing Senate colleague .
Kennedy bowed out after being diagnosed last week with a malignant brain tumor and asked Obama to speak instead .

Kennedy 's stepdaughter is a member of this year 's graduating class at Wesleyan .
His son graduated from the school 25 years ago .
The Massachusetts Democrat has endorsed Obama and has been campaigning for him .
Wesleyan has closed the ceremony to the public , allowing only the grads and a limited number of guests .
The school is also banning any campaign material from the event , along with such items as glass bottles and fireworks .

It 's the constitutional duty of the Congress to impeach when there is proof that the administration has been committing crimes .
This is n't a matter that is left up to anyone 's discretion or convenience !
Mondale should just shut up if he does n't want to follow the system of checks and balances that the founding fathers devised to ensure that the government does not succumb to corruption .
The entire Democratic leadership should be forced to resign in disgrace , and the entire administration should be renditioned to The Hague , forthwith !

I totally agree with both Carol & Czaragorn .
It is long past time for Pitch forks and Torches IMO , same with War Crimes trials at the Hague .
In my lifetime I want to see Bush and Cheney swinging from a rope .
I think its quite obvious to anyone not brain dead that the Democrats are equally as guilty at this point , they are without any question flatly refusing to Impeach 2 war criminals that have committed no less than at least 20 Impeachable offenses each and counting .
War crimes , Crimes against humanity , TREASON just to name a couple .
There can be no doubt that the Democrats are complicit in these crimes as their actions speak volumes .
Impeachment proceedings should have begun in Nov 2007 , both Bush & Cheney have committed no less than 20 Impeachable offenses each and virtually none of those are minor offenses like lying about a BJ or spying on the opposing party and erasing a few mins of tape .
We are talking the virtual destruction of the country and as long as they are still in power the very real likelihood of WWIII based on lies & false flag attacks .
ALL of these lying bastards need to be run out of Washington on a rail tarred and feathered and I mean ALL OF THEM !

We no longer speak softly but carry a big stick .
Now we speak loudly but carry no stick .
If Cheney were to respond to Mondale he would likely say " So ? " and that would be the end of it .
We could select a good running mate for the Democrat but that is not worth the time it would take .
In the end the only running mate that will matter will be that of the GOP .
Their secret software still secretly " counts " most of the " votes " .
It 's all over but the " counting " and they have taken control of most of the " counting " .

Migraines can be debilitating
A French team observed activation in the hypothalamus region of the brain as sufferers had a migraine attack .
The hypothalamus has long been suspected as it regulates physiological responses to factors known to trigger headaches , such as hunger .
It is hoped the discovery , featured in the journal Headache , could lead to new treatments .
It 's easy to think that migraine is a specific brain disorder , but it is a series of systems that go wrong
Professor Peter Goadsby
Insitute of Neurology
The researchers , from Rangueil Hospital , used a technique called Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , which contrasts functional activity within the brain , on seven patients with migraine without aura , the most common type of migraine .
Previously , activation in the brain stem and midbrain , and a thickening in some areas of the cortex were seen in migraine sufferers .
The present study may have seen a more detailed pathogenesis of the condition for two reasons .
First , timing was crucial : to capture an attack as it happened , patients rushed to hospital without self - medicating , arriving on average around three hours after the onset of the migraine .
Second , the observed headaches were spontaneous , and not chemically induced as in other laboratory studies .
Lead researcher Dr Marie Denuelle said : " When you induce the attack you miss the hypothalamic activation .
" We suspect the hypothalamus may play a role in the start of the migraine attack .
" But to prove it we would need to do similar study before the start of an attack . "
Dr Andrew Dowson , director of headache services at Kings College Hospital , London , said : " It has been suggested for many years that the hypothalamus is involved in the early stages of migraine attacks .
" But there are other factors involved in the early generation of headache . "
Suicide headaches
Activation of the hypothalamus had previously only been seen in cluster headache , a different and altogether more crippling condition .
Cluster headache sufferers experience headaches on a regular basis : for certain months of the year in the episodic form , or every day at regular intervals in the chronic form .
So debilitating can the attacks be that they have been dubbed " suicide headaches " because some sufferers have taken their own lives .
The new evidence for hypothalamic activation in migraine may explain why some migraine drugs , particularly the triptans , can sometimes be effective at aborting a cluster headache attack .
However , Professor Peter Goadsby , of the Insitute of Neurology at University College London , said there were distinct clinical and physiological differences between cluster headache and migraine .
He said : " The area [ of the hypothalamus ] reported as activated in migraine is about 10 mm more anterior than the cluster headache area .
" The hypothalamus is not one thing but a collection of discrete neurons . "
Professor Goadsby said a cascade of changes in the brain seemed to cause the migraine problem .
" It 's easy to think that migraine is a specific brain disorder , but it is a series of systems that go wrong - a system disorder .
" There is no single holy grail .
Multiple structures are involved . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A survey examining sexual practices of U.S. teens has undercut the notion that many engage in oral sex rather than intercourse to stay “ technically ” virgins , researchers said on Tuesday .
Teen girls are seen in a file photo .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
The findings , published in the Journal of Adolescent Health , were based on answers by 2,271 females and males age 15 to 19 in 2002 in response to a government survey .
The researchers found about 55 percent of the teens said they had engaged in oral sex but that this practice was far more common among those who also had engaged in vaginal sex .
Teens said they began vaginal and oral sex at roughly the same time -- by six months after first vaginal intercourse , 82 percent had also engaged in oral sex , according to the study .
“ There is a widespread belief that teens engage in nonvaginal forms of sex , especially oral sex , as a way to be sexually active while still claiming that , technically , they are virgins , ” Laura Lindberg of the Guttmacher Institute in New York , who led the study , said in a statement .
“ However , our research shows that this supposed substitution of oral sex for vaginal sex is largely a myth .
There is no good evidence that teens who have not had intercourse engage in oral sex with a series of partners . ”
The Guttmacher Institute studies sexual and reproductive health issues .
About one in 10 of the teens said they had engaged in anal sex .
These teens were far more likely to have also engaged in vaginal sex .
“ Teens of white ethnicity and higher socioeconomic status were more likely than their peers to have ever had oral or anal sex , ” the researchers wrote .
Lindberg said the new findings illustrate that the Bush administration ’s emphasis on school programs teaching sexual abstinence until marriage “ does not give teens the skills and information they need to be safe . ”
Statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March showed that more than one in four U.S. teen girls was infected with at least one sexually transmitted disease .
The CDC said in December the birth rate for U.S. teens rose in 2006 for the first time since 1991 .
Lindberg said the Guttmacher Institute ’s findings have health policy implications .
“ While oral and anal sex carry no risk of pregnancy , engaging in these behaviors can nevertheless put teens at risk of sexually transmitted infections , ” she said .
“ Counseling and education should take into account total STI risk by addressing the full range of behaviors that teens engage in , including oral and anal sex . ”
Grocery bills are rising through the roof .
Food banks are running short of donations .
And food shortages are causing sporadic riots in poor countries through the world .
You ’d never know it if you saw what was ending up in your landfill .
As it turns out , Americans waste an astounding amount of food  an estimated 27 percent of the food available for consumption , according to a government study  and it happens at the supermarket , in restaurants and cafeterias and in your very own kitchen .
It works out to about a pound of food every day for every American .
Grocery stores discard products because of spoilage or minor cosmetic blemishes .
Restaurants throw away what they do n’t use .
And consumers toss out everything from bananas that have turned brown to last week ’s Chinese leftovers .
In 1997 , in one of the few studies of food waste , the Department of Agriculture estimated that two years before , 96.4 billion pounds of the 356 billion pounds of edible food in the United States was never eaten .
Fresh produce , milk , grain products and sweeteners made up two - thirds of the waste .
An update is under way .
The study did n’t account for the explosion of ready - to - eat foods now available at supermarkets , from rotisserie chickens to sandwiches and soups .

in response to Priyanshu Goyal From my experience on a number of agile projects I tend to agree with all of the anti-patterns above .
I have come across a number of cases where organisations decide to adopt ' agile ' but then try to fit it into existing practices and hit one of more of these issues .
I would also like to suggest one more : Micro - manage developer work : I have found a number of cases where an organisation adopts an agile process but rather than trusting the agile team to complete the iteration they try to assign a project manager to micro-manage the tasks of each developer working on the iteration .
This always results in loss of team cohesion and in the worst cases each developer working on a slice of the iteration in isolation from the rest of the team .

in response to Priyanshu Goyal
We are doing continuous integration so we are already agile : Agile is something which you either do or you do not .
There is no partial way of doing it and doing it partially will not take us anywhere .
Agile is more about doing development in iterations , working code , customer feedback , adapting to changes rather then picking and choosing few practices and calling yourself agile .
I agree with everything you said , but this statement bothers me .
I agree that only doing CI is not " agile " , but I disagree that someone can prescribe an exact set of requirements for being " agile " , and if you do n't follow every one of those prescriptions , you are not " agile " .
Being agile means building a process composed of agile principles that works for the organization .

Write test cases for everything

in response to Priyanshu Goyal Somewhere near 500 test cases , you 'll realize that " Unit testing the complex pieces is enough " is n't such an anti-pattern .
Of course , there are extremes to both sides of this argument that everybody will agree with .
500 test cases is not an extreme .
The bottom line is that test cases need to be designed and thought through so that they 're efficient and effective .
If a test case costs a lot to maintain but never finds any real bugs then redesign it or delete it .
Do n't write test cases that eat up your nights in maintenance costs .
They are n't worth it .

Don't write test cases that eat up your nights in maintenance costs .

Completely agreed .
Test driven development is not about coverage alone .
It is about letting the tests help you focus on solving the problem .
Generating tests for getters is not going to help you in any way , it is just going to slow you down ( which is precisely the thing we should be avoiding ) .
This is not an excuse not to write tests though .
If you have low coverage it is a symptom of using a flawed method of producing working software .
You should fix the method , not write tests afterward .
Completely agreed .
Test driven development is not about coverage alone .
It is about letting the tests help you focus on solving the problem .

But what if there never is a maintenance cycle ?
I think that 's a much more important question than people realize .
A fair number a applications just die during or relatively soon after initial development , and even more become zombies that are used at levels significantly below the original intent and therefore not maintained .
The users just live with the problems .

If the app is so small there is never a maintenance cycle one should not be worried about process , design and all the rest .
Do a one off script in Perl , PHP , or any other of the hundreds of special purpose scripting languages out there .
If the app is only slightly bigger and may need limited enhancement and limited maintenance use Ruby on Rails in an ad -hoc manner without the software engineering .
If the app is expected to expand over several release cycles with a growing user base and / or is released to the wild ( public internet ) , that is the time to worry about setting up a rigorous development process , focus on design over individual features , do exhaustive unit and integration testing and all the rest .
I 've done long running projects with very large user bases both ways and prefer to follow the advice of this article because it is actually easier / cheaper to satisfy business needs and make the consumers of the application happy by using good software engineering than not using it .

For the most part , I agree ; a couple of points , however .
1 ) Agile is not the only approach that accomplishes " good software engineering " .
2 ) If you have a dedicated team that is willing to embrace agile , I believe your statement about it being " cheaper " is true .
However , if you are doing a fixed bid custom solution using matrixed resources where every hour counts against your margin , and the customer does not have the budget to support your approach , then your assertion that it is " cheaper " is not true .
It goes back to my assertion that Agile is a great tool for certain problem sets , but no approach can be applied universally in the technology space - there 's just too many permutations in the real world to be that inflexible .

in response to Wille Faler " Quality of design and code is as important ( if not more ) as the implementation of the functionality . "
The customer who is paying you to implement that functionality would disagree with you .
Maybe so , but they 'll be wrong once the maintenance cycle has kicked in and change requests start pouring in .
That does n't change the fact that the customer is not willing to pay for it initially .
Developers do n't get to set the terms of the sale in the services industry .
They can provide estimates , but if the biz dev folks want the business , the service provider has to adapt to what the customer will buy .
Once the service provider has locked the customer in with the initial application build , the balance of power shifts towards the service provider and then you can start factoring in more Agile methods if you like .

That being so they wont want to spend too much money on abstract quality .
Also remember better is the enemy of good .

I disagree .
There is n't a customer around that does n't consider the quality of what they are getting as important as the functionality .
If you deliver something that manages to do the bare promised functionality , but every action outside of that tightly described scenario results in a crash , or corrupt data , you 'll see how quickly fireworks go off .
The customer does n't care about your methodology or your internal processes , but they do care that what they get not only does what they asked , but that it does it well and safely .

Agile is a tool in the toolbox for us to use .
It fits quite well in certain situations .
IMO , it is a better fit for product development than for custom solution builds if you can convince product management and the executive team to buy into the approach .
I also think it is a better fit for new development than for maintaining an existing application .
The time - boxed cycles are not a good fit when you are coordinating roll outs of changes across an enterprise that have to be synchronized based on external dependencies over which the development team has no control .
Where the issue arises is when an Agile evangelist takes his " hammer " - aka the Agile approach - and treats every technology opportunity as if it were a nail .

You can " be " Agile just by preferring four thing over other traditional four things .

Nobody is forcing us to even use ONE of those ideas .
Now , if we need a Agile tag to sell ourselves , probably we will need to paid to Agile certifiers .

Not necessarilly , but in practice yes .
The rigidity with which " agile " is usually implemented makes it so .
CI is one example .
When a project grows and your test cases become larger and more complex to cope , the build process WILL start to take so long that doing more than a few builds a day ( or even more than one ) becomes impractical if not impossible .
Case in point : a project I used to work on had CI in place .
Problem was that the full test suite took several hours to run , the build without the tests maybe 15 minutes .
A full build including all tests could therefore not be done more than maybe twice a day at most , and would seriously tax the build server which was also needed to build other systems .
So there are only 2 options left : strip the tests out of the automated build , or run a build only at night .
We elected to do both .
A full build with tests was run overnight , a build without tests scheduled in CC at 30 minute intervals .
That way people would get feedback on compiler errors twice an hour , and still get feedback on failed tests at least once a day .
The test suite was also tweaked to allow parts of it to be run standalone , so we could run part of the tests before committing code .
One has to be pragmatic when doing agile development , but as already noted many of the " Agile " crowd are far from pragmatic .
They 've become as entrenched in their own ivory towers as the RUP advocates and every other pressure group , believing the full adoption of their ideal world is the only way things can work , and often with no clear idea about whether that ideal world in any way reflects the reality of the systems people in the real world ( which is n't ideal ) have to work with .

in response to Jeroen Wenting I 've found this thread fascinating , as I ( and all of your , I 'm sure ) , have begun to be bewildered by the way the " Agile " ( and , for that matter , " XP " and " Scrum " ) labels are used and abused by software development teams throughout my own and other organisations .
The first way this is done is defensivley : A team ( or team member ) , desperate to tick the " Agile " box , pick upon some bit of process extant ( ' We use RUP ' , ' Our requirements artefacts are living documnets ' , ' We do n't have a seperate design phase ' ) , link it up to some Agile buzzword and claim to be an agile project .
This can be because directions have come down from on high to ' be agile ' or an attempt to justify a lack of a proper process .
The second big abuse of the Agile label I 've seen is that which Jeroen and the OP speak of :
Some agile expert or consultancy tries to sell or mandate some Agile process toolkit lock , stock and barrell onto a project team that is n't ready yet .
Generally , these people ignore the people and technology part of the PPT triangle , and a focus on Agile box - ticking and do - things - this - way - because - the - [ SEI|RUP|Scrum| .*] - says - so .
What both of these approaches miss is that Agile development is not a series of disparete process and is not a box ticking excersize , it is an interconnected series of desirable behaviours .
Agile teams can respons to changing requirements , deliver guaranteed quality soloutions in an incremental fashion , allow the business to engage with and drive development and so forth .
You cannot achieve all these outcomes simply from implementing a few processes in isolation , just as you cannot achieve these outcomes simply be imposing a process regieme on a non-agile team without having the requisite skills and technology in place first .
The descision to move to an Agile development model is often a positive one , but descision makers should be aware that succesfull Agile development must be supported by vertical process change throughout the SE structure , and with the appropriate technology and people in place .
This can not be achieved by development teams alone .

in response to Priyanshu Goyal Management Control : Management selects which users stories go in the iteration , the due date , and who should work in which task .
This is the opposite of agile , and does break the rules of team work , specially lack of team responsibility about the work done .
Epic Stories : The User stories are Epic Stories .
The whole system functionality is intended to be solve with one or few stories .
The users stories span among all the iterations in the project .
No sense of achieving any objective at all , but the opposite , things are always late and passed to the next iteration .
No prioritized / well thought backlog :
On each planning meeting , the team loose a lot of time defining what 's next reviewing the whole backlog .
This is a big management fault , there should be a responsible to know what 's next , and how important it is , and deal with the team in the planning meeting .
Implement anything :
We need to finish this iteration , the user stories are bad , just finish them , and then " Refactor " later .
That 's the worst assertion ever !.
That reveals to the team that they have no idea where to go , and use the word " Refactor " to really mean , " redo - it " later .
Implement logic partially with an end goal in mind , helps the team to make better design decisions while developing .
Implement things just to show progress and then throw away is a waste of everybody 's time .
Create Mocks and validate them quickly , you are trying to help the business , not to just show progress .
" Refactor " should be done as soon as possible , you cannot refactor the whole project at the end .
Refactoring adds quality to the code , nobody does everything good the first time , and nobody remembers anything at the end of the project .
Robot coders instead of developers : A robot coder is the one that just codes what he / she is told to do .
You need developers that think what they are doing and develop a solution , and not excuse behind the known : " That was not in the Specs " .
You are building the specs with the users .

in response to Ramiro Rinaudo I have recently joined a company where developers have been ' trained ' for years to be like ' robot coders ' .
This goes to extremes like : 1 . asking permission for every small change ( e.g. directory rename ) .
2 . not daring to do any refactoring and working around problems .
Yes , even complaining about problems but not fixing them .
On top of this , the company is extremely process - oriented and agile was introduced and embraced as the ' new process ' .
Now all of a sudden agile itself is a formal process , where they are even considering to use finished user stories as the formal description of the system .
In addition , we are working with a tight delivery schedule were functionality must be in place at a certain time .
In a way , agile is being used as a tool for micromanaging developers where , of course , the robot - mentality of the developers strengthens this approach .
This is typically a case where agile was adopted without thought about the consequences and requirements for this .
Instead of introducing agile , the first step should have been to use the existing process , then manage people differently to make sure the robot mentality gradually disappears ( difficult ! ) , and relentlessly focus on process optimization ( by the workforce not by management ) following the basic agile principles such as eliminate waste and stop - the - line .

in response to Priyanshu Goyal I 'm surprised by so many folks getting caught up in this latest and greatest without really understanding it 's benefits .
My problem is this : I see Agile methodology borrowing pieces from XP , from feature - driven development ( and possibly others I 'm not familiar with ) .
I see some concepts that map very well to older terms but were renamed for some reason .
What I do n't see is an explanation : if Agile resembles XP so much why pieces A and B were thrown out , if it borrows from feature - driven development , why these and not other pieces were adopted ?
My conviction is that unless you learned some lessons , you are bound to repeat the mistakes .
I think evangelists of this ( and any other ) new methodology owe an explanation to us all , what is it that they learned before they set to impose their world view upon us .

in response to Priyanshu Goyal Let us keep the refactoring tasks for later : true , continuous refactoring is a reality , and it 's something that 's ideal .
I still schedule explicit iterations where the team does nothing but refactor , kind of like timeouts for the team to catch up , usually only a weeklong .
It 's an excellent mechanism and I will always use it on my projects when I can get away with it .
We are doing continuous integration so we are already agile true , continuous integration does not make an agile team .
But it 's an excellent start , especially if you 're in an environment that will simply not allow you to do some of the other things .
Agile is definitely not a " do / not do " , it 's a set of best practices that have an exponential effect when used in a complementary fashion .
Unit testing the complex pieces is enough again , while I agree with the title of your pattern , simply stating that you have to unit test everything is not feasible .
Just as much , or more , care needs to be taken in designing reusable pieces of your unit tests , deciding what your unit testing strategy will be , and how much the test .
On extremely large projects , 100 % coverage is just not feasible .
I would rather have 200 % coverage on critical pieces covering multiple scenarios , and on integration points between teams than try to do a blanket coverage of the entire code base .
Again , opinions differ , but one is n't more agile than the other .
Overall the post has some good stuff in it , but some of the languages to gear towards preaching and prescribing , practices and recommendations always work better .

You seem to be listing all these patterns in a " you must do it this way or else you are not agile ... " .
This type of approach is what alienates practitioners in the IT community both at the business and senior level .
IE : a lot of agile people come across as religious zealots .
A lot of these patterns are certainly something I agree with you in principle , but they 're not requirements for agility .
My feedback on your specific patterns as follows .

User Account Control is easily one of the most hated features of Windows Vista , according to readers .
The seemingly endless stream of UAC pop-ups , asking you to confirm this action or that action , just get in the way ( and are n't particularly zippy , given the screen redraw ) .
Others do n't mind UAC , but there 's no doubt it 's a controversial " feature " of the OS .
At the RSA 2008 confab in San Francisco , Microsoft admitted that UAC was designed , in fact , to annoy .
Microsoft 's David Cross came out and said so : " The reason we put UAC into the platform was to annoy users .
I 'm serious , " said Cross .
This is n't a total revelation .
UAC was designed to get in your face ; it 's all about that " hey , you sure about that bauddy ? " , second - guessing thing .
It 's a less intimidating , less entertaining version of Clint Eastwood saying , " do you feel lucky , punk ? "
All this because you wanted to do something unimpressive like view all running processes on your system or install GAIM .
What makes UAC annoying is that it 's a half - breed of sorts .
UAC is not a security barrier , which is one of the reasons why users hate it : they do n't see the point in a process elevation alert box that asks you to click " OK , " as opposed to inputting a password when you 're an admin .
UAC 's real purpose is quite simple : it 's meant to trip whenever a routine attempts to elevate security privileges , and get in your face .
As we have reported before , this has two goals : a ) it give users a chance to approve of the elevation in the off chance that something wrong is happening , and b ) it encourages developers to design their software such that privilege elevations are n't needed in the first place .
The latter is really the point of UAC , since users have absolutely zero control over the privilege requests their applications make ( other than to chose not to install said apps ) .
Peter Watson , Microsoft Australia 's chief security advisor , explained it all last year .
" Various application providers in the market are coming to terms ... recognizing that it 's much more effective to run applications and have actual users running on systems as standard users as opposed to system administrator , " he said .
" Why should I be letting my normal user be running as system administrator ? " he asked .
Microsoft 's approach to UAC is a carrot - and - stick way to get developers to adopt Microsoft 's latest views on secure application installation and setup , but it does come at the expense of the user experience .
It 's hardly no surprise , then , that one of the most popular post - Vista install activities is disabling UAC .
I still have n't disabled it myself , but I 've come close .
Microsoft claims that 88 % of Vista users leave UAC enabled , and that application developers are already greatly enhancing their setup routines to avoid process elevation .
One could argue that this approach is incredibly flawed , since the people best in position to make the changes needed are developers , not the end users who are stuck with a cavalcade of UAC prompts .
For more on what makes UAC a bit of a head scratcher , see : Microsoft 's guru : malware and viruses will evolve on Vista
Further reading :
In my last post I tried to show that new solutions take time , more time than I believe that we have available .
And because of this , if we are going to get through this evolving period we are largely going to be stuck with the solutions that are already either being introduced or are close to large - scale implementation .
Though that is one of the things I tried to allude to in the earlier post about Camry mileage .
The scale of the difference between likely supply and demand at a decent price is going to get quite large .
If a solution does not provide supply levels that measure in millions of barrels a day ( or significant fractions thereof ) then it is not going to have enough impact to make much difference in the medium term .
“ Alright ! ” says the Actress , “ You ’ve convinced me we have a problem with oil .
So what ’s the answer ? ”
Well , actually I did n’t .
Eloquent and persuasive though I might like to think that I am , what really convinced her was the price she had to pay to fill the gas tank in her car .
And it is that way with most of the world .
We can talk about the causes , and explain why the situation wo n’t get better , with graphs and projections and calculations , and most folk will , under the cynical guidance of most of the press , merely look for someone to blame .
Oh , and there had better be an answer , pretty quick .
That does n’t mean that we should stop work on fusion , after all , even to the next generation to be born , it is likely to be “ a potential solution with the greatest promise . ”
But rather that we have to put more of an emphasis on finding ways to do more with what we have , in the way of solutions and resources .
And that includes finding better and more efficient ways of getting oil out of the ground .
It is where part of the immediate problem is most evident , and though it will not provide a long term solution , it can perhaps ease the pain over the next decade .
But even here there is likely not enough research being done on innovative ideas .
I have , in a much earlier post quoted Michael Economides and Ronald Oligney from The Color of Oil in which they point out that the petroleum industry has been sadly lacking in funding research .
Many unique features distinguish the technology of the petroleum industry .
First , there is little doubt that technology is crucial , and that deployment and integration of technology is essential to the industry 's success .
Yet , this technology is highly diversified and applied to industry segments with different needs .
The scope is wide .
Seismic exploration and processing , enhanced oil recovery and the construction of deepwater production facilities have little in common .
Why is it , then that the petroleum industry , so technically dependent , is the industry with the smallest R & D spending ?
The healthcare sector leads all industries , with 11 % of sales going into R&D ; the electrical and electronics industry spends 5.5 % , and the chemical industry spends 4.1 % .
In this light , the petroleum industry 's R & D spending of less than 0.5 % of sales is striking .
It is not just the petroleum industry , the mining industry is equally lacking in funding research into innovative , and more effective ways of producing the minerals , including coal , that we need .
If there is one thing that Congress could perhaps ask , it is why there is this lack of investment .
So far it seems that there has been little investment other than in public relations .
Now , to be fair to them , I did partially answer that question in a comment I appended to that original post .
Grin - a history lesson ( because I was there ) - Scene Park City , Utah .
On the front row , representatives of all the big oil companies .
We are meeting to talk about drilling research .
Says the rep of a European oil company – “ Why are the Feds doing research into drilling technology - do n't they know that we are working on this ? ”
Says the rep of an oil company located in Houston – “ What is your drilling R & D budget ? ”
European " $x million . "
Houston guy " This new Administration that they are forming has a budget in the billions . "
European " Oh , I guess if they are going to fund it there is no reason for us to . "
And so they largely stopped , but ERDA went on to fund other things instead of drilling research and , in time , became the Department of Energy .
Sic transit . . .
And then , in time , the Department of Energy reduced their programs , more and more , and less and less got done . . . .
And , as for the research in mining , well that was carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Mines .
Among other things they pioneered coal bed methane ( CBM ) technology – this from 1978
The Bureau of Mines is conducting research to determine the effectiveness of long holes in degasifying an area of the Upper Split of the Lower Sunnyside coalbed at Kaiser Steel Co. 's Sunnyside No. 1 mine .
These holes were drilled from the two outside entries of a section that was closed to mining because of excessive methane emissions .
Two holes drilled to 430 and 450 feet produced initial gas flows of 160,000 and 127,000 cfd , respectively .
Sixteen days after the completion of the second hole , the total gas production declined to just over 144,000 cfd .
In 9 months of degasification , over 35 MMcf of commercial - quality gas has been removed from the coalbed .
The combined gas flows declined to 106,000 cfd in the 9 - month period .
The two holes have reduced face emissions by about 40 % .
They also did some of the early work on horizontal wells , developed from a vertical bore , but those reports ( such as USBM RI 8640 ) do n’t appear available electronically .
What happened to them ?
In March 1996 the Bureau of Mines was closed .
It seems as though there is more than one dropped ball rolling around the floor .
As I mentioned in my last post I am an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy , as well as books on energy and related matters – sometimes it is hard to tell which is which ( grin ) .
But I remember a story ( though not title or author ) in which the protagonist noted , about a new breakthrough , that of the scientists that investigated it , at least half would be trying to prove that it did n’t work .
I bring that up because , as ideas develop towards being solutions to the fuel supply needs that we face , they invariably encounter problems .
Ethanol from corn is likely one such , there are high energy input requirements and water demands that are raising voices of concern .
But among the 2007 highest yields ( pdf ) was Sam Santini , who raised 313 bu / acre without irrigation .
Some of the problems that are given as road - stoppers to application may only be hurdles that have to be crossed , and in such cases an overly negative climate really does n’t help .
At the moment it still seems to me that each of us has his / her favorite solution , and in seeking to push its charms , feels it is still necessary to denigrate the chances of the others .
( And yes , in that regard I will admit to a personal preference for algae ) .
The reality is that we are going to need all the help that we can get , and no solution is going to be universal – there is no silver bullet .
It is hard to see solar being very useful , for example , in Alaska in December .
But , as I think Matt Simmons said , there are lots of silver bb ’s out there .
We need to be encouraging them all , because we will need them all .
The scale of the problem that is developing , and the speed with which it will arrive , is largely not comprehended .
And , unfortunately , at present , I do n’t see that we have enough grasp on the questions that must be asked , if we are to find those answers , let alone knowing what those answers are .

At his peak , the worker was looking at almost 10,000 pages a day A council employee in Japan has been punished after officials discovered he had logged more than 780,000 hits on porn websites at work in nine months .
His superiors were only alerted to the problem when his computer became infected with a virus .
The 57 - year - old man , who has not been named , works for the city of Kinokawa in southern Japan .
He held on to his job , but has been demoted and his wages have been cut by about 20,000 yen ( $ 190 ; £ 80 ) a month .
Productivity question Each day he would turn up to work , but once in his office it seems unlikely he got much done .
A council investigation found that he visited porn websites almost every day , often spending hours looking at them , a city official said .
His habit reached its peak last July when he surfed for porn more than 177,000 times during office hours .
A council official , trying to explain why no - one had noticed , said that each employee 's desk was set apart from the others .
The man was discovered only when his computer became infected with a virus , prompting officials to look at his web - browser history .
He has not been sacked but he has been demoted and his pay cut by about $ 200 a month .
No doubt he is also proving to be a little more productive now .

What are these ?
Boys are not innately better at maths than girls , and any difference in test scores is due to nurture rather than nature , researchers suggested today .
According to new research published in the journal Science , the " gender gap " in maths , long perceived to exist between girls and boys , disappears in societies that treat both sexes equally .
When girls have equal access to education and other opportunities they do just as well as boys in maths tests .
The research , led by Prof Paola Sapienza of Northwestern University in the US , investigated whether a global gender gap exists and whether it was the result of social engineering rather than intrinsic aptitude for the subject .
" The so - called gender gap in math skills seems to be at least partially correlated to environmental factors , " Sapienza said .
" The gap does n't exist in countries in which men and women have access to similar resources and opportunities . "
Researchers analysed data from more than 276,000 children in 40 countries who took the 2003 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Programme for International Student Assessment ( Pisa ) - the internationally standardised test of maths , reading , science and problem - solving ability .
Globally , boys tend to outperform girls in maths ( on average girls score 10.5 points lower than boys ) but in more " gender equal societies " such as Iceland , Sweden and Norway , girls scored as well as boys or better .
For example , the maths gender gap almost disappeared in Sweden , while in Turkey girls scored 23 points below boys in maths .
Average girls ' scores improved as equality improved and the number of girls reaching the highest levels of performance also increased , the researchers found .
In Britain , girls fared only slightly less well than male classmates , with female pupils scoring an average of 0.7 % less .
The research also found a striking gender gap in reading skills .
In every country girls perform better than boys in reading but in countries that treat both sexes equally , girls do even better .
On average , girls have reading scores that are 32.7 points higher than those of boys ( 6.6 % higher than the mean average score for boys ) .
In Turkey , this amounts to 25.1 points higher , and in Iceland , girls score 61.0 points higher .
Sapienza said : " Our research indicates that in more gender equal societies , girls will gain an absolute advantage relative to boys . "
The Republicans are breaking the military .
Wonder what another 50 years in Iraq under Hillary ( she said she ’s fine with that ) , or 100 years in Iraq under McCain ( he said he ’s fine with that ) , would do ?
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are making such heavy use of the nation ’s Green Berets and other elite warriors that they cannot fulfill their roles in other parts of the world , the military ’s top commando told The Associated Press on Monday .
“ We ’re going to fewer countries , staying for shorter periods of time , with smaller numbers of people than historically we have done , ” Adm. Eric T. Olson said in his first interview since becoming commander of U.S. Special Operations Command last July .
Olson , himself a combat veteran , saw little chance that the demand for his special operations forces in Iraq will decline anytime soon .
Even as the overall American force there shrinks — from about 158,000 now to about 140,000 by the end of July — the number of special operations forces in the war zone is likely to increase , he said .
A future Conservative government will bring in " boot camps " for unemployed young people aged between 18 and 21 who refuse to take a job , Chris Grayling , the party 's welfare spokesman , will say tomorrow .
In a significant hardening of Conservative policy towards welfare claimants , he will announce the abolition of benefit payments for any able - bodied person under 21 who is out of work for more than three months and who refuses to go on a compulsory community service programme or a " boot camp " training course aimed at improving their work discipline and giving them basic skills to get a job .
Grayling plans to ask private sector companies and voluntary organisations to run the intensive training centres - with the £ 5,000 it costs to support a single person on the dole being offered to the company or voluntary group once the person has been in work for one year .
Individuals will be expected to report to the centre every day for an intensive training programme .
Some private companies - notably the Australian firm Work Directions - have successfully bid for business from Labour on a " bonus basis " to get the disabled back to work .
Grayling will say : " We plan to introduce much tougher rules for young people under the age of 21 claiming jobseeker 's allowance .
For this group , the welfare to work process will start much earlier .
There will be employment ' boot camps ' and community work programmes for those who do n't find a job .
Staying at home doing nothing will be a thing of the past . "
Under the Tory proposals , unemployed young people who do not find a job within three months will be referred automatically to a specialist employment provider , where they will be expected to take part in an intensive programme of work - related activity .
If they spend 12 months out of work , they will then be moved on to a full - time community work programme lasting a further year .
The hardening of Tory attitudes towards the unemployed will be combined with much tougher polices than Labour to get single parents and the disabled back to work , and a big move to privatise provision to help the unemployed .
Ultimately the move could see the end of state - funded Jobcentres and a big reduction in size of the Department for Work and Pensions , which has already lost 30,000 jobs under Labour .
Grayling will also announce a clampdown on those who misuse government training programmes .
This follows disclosures that government claims to have retrained three million people on the New Deal were false after 750,000 people were found to have been on the training programme twice , and a few dozen as many as six times .
Some people also avoid going on the programme by signing off benefits for a week when they are due to go on the programme , only to sign on again a short time later .
Grayling will say : " Under our proposals , there will be no room for that kind of manoeuvre .
In that situation , the clock will simply be frozen .
It wo n't be reset to zero again .
With this approach , for those who are struggling there will be real help .
For those who are not , there will be no opt-outs .
We will end the street - corner benefit culture among young people which this government has left to fester for the past 11 years . "
The measures should cut crime because people would not be hanging around with nothing to do , Grayling will say .
For those who decided to embark on a life of crime because they would not work and could not get benefit , there would be " zero tolerance from the criminal justice system " .
It takes just 15 generations under these conditions for the flies to become genetically programmed to learn better .
At the beginning of the experiment , the flies take many hours to learn the difference between the normal and quinine - spiked jellies .
The fast - learning strain of flies needs less than an hour .
But the flies pay a price for fast learning .
Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues pitted smart fly larvae against a different strain of flies , mixing the insects and giving them a meager supply of yeast to see who would survive .
The scientists then ran the same experiment , but with the ordinary relatives of the smart flies competing against the new strain .
About half the smart flies survived ; 80 percent of the ordinary flies did .
Reversing the experiment showed that being smart does not ensure survival .
“ We took some population of flies and kept them over 30 generations on really poor food so they adapted so they could develop better on it , ” Dr. Kawecki said .
“ And then we asked what happened to the learning ability .
It went down . ”
The ability to learn does not just harm the flies in their youth , though .
In a paper to be published in the journal Evolution , Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues report that their fast - learning flies live on average 15 percent shorter lives than flies that had not experienced selection on the quinine - spiked jelly .
Flies that have undergone selection for long life were up to 40 percent worse at learning than ordinary flies .
“ We do n’t know what the mechanism of this is , ” Dr. Kawecki said .
One clue comes from another experiment , in which he and his colleagues found that the very act of learning takes a toll .
The scientists trained some fast - learning flies to associate an odor with powerful vibrations .
“ These flies died about 20 percent faster than flies with the same genes , but which were not forced to learn , ” he said .
Forming neuron connections may cause harmful side effects .
It is also possible that genes that allow learning to develop faster and last longer may cause other changes .
“ We use computers with memory that ’s almost free , but biological information is costly , ” Dr. Dukas said .
He added that the costs Dr. Kawecki documented were not smart animals ’ only penalties .
“ It means you start out in life being inexperienced , ” Dr. Dukas said .
__1992 : __Id Software releases Wolfenstein 3 - D , and it launches a huge computer - game category .
Wolfenstein 3 - D may not have been the very first " first - person shooter , " as the genre came to be known , but it was by far the most successful .
Technically the genre goes back to the ' 70s , but no one really paid any attention to it .
Even id released an earlier FPS called Catacombs 3D , but again , it was n't nearly as good as Wolfenstein .
But through massive online dissemination of the game 's shareware version , Wolfenstein 3D ( the hyphen was later dropped from the name ) introduced millions to an immersive world in which the action seemed to be happening from the player 's perspective .
" It was an incredible sensation , really unlike anything gamers had seen before , " said Jamie Madigan , who helps operate the GameSpy Network 's 3D Action website .
" You could move smoothly in 360 degrees .
You felt like you were there . "
" Everything that 's followed in [ its ] footsteps has just been a modification of that basic style , " id Software CEO Todd Hollenshead said in 2001 .
Players in the game assume the role of an American commando battling Nazis and their supernatural servants .
It was banned in Germany because of its use of Nazi symbols , like the swastika , and music , like the " Horst Wessel Lied . "
Wolfenstein 3D did more than define a genre .
It also launched a company , id Software of Mesquite , Texas , which leveraged Wolfenstein 3D 's success into a franchise of wildly successful first - person shooters , including the seminal Doom and Quake series .
These games , in turn , begat a slew of sequels , imitators and adaptations , from Half - Life to Max Payne .
Wired.com Game|Life blogger Earnest Cavalli added , " The key to the whole Wolfenstein thing is that its success – which was massive – paved the way for ... thousands of games that mimicked them , transforming the PC into a gaming system best known for FPS titles .
Plus , who does n't like killing Nazis ? "

The Oods appeared in Doctor Who last month A Doctor Who fan is embroiled in a row with the BBC after she published knitting patterns for the sci - fi drama 's monsters on the internet .
The patterns of Ood and Adipose were removed from her website after the BBC 's commercial arm complained that they breached its trademark .
But the woman said the corporation was " making an example of her " .
BBC Worldwide said it acted because finished figures were being sold by others on auction website eBay .
It also denied threatening legal action and said it had offered to consider marketing the designs itself .
' Ordinary fan '
The 26 - year - old , who does not want to be identified other than as her online moniker of Mazzmatazz , said : " All I want is the BBC to be fair . "
" I 'm just an ordinary fan , who happens to like knitting and sci-fi , and everything has just gone a bit crazy , " she said on her website .
Her case is being publicised by the Open Rights Group , a lobbying organisation which specialises in digital rights issues .
Executive director Becky Hogge told BBC
News : " She does n't feel she 's doing anything wrong yet she 's being threatened with legal action . "
" In the offline world , what she'd be doing would be fine .
But because she 's doing it online , which is a public space , it causes a problem .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" The law is a blunt instrument - it does n't recognise the difference between someone hawking fake Louis Vuitton handbags , and someone doing what Mazzmatazz is doing .
She 's not really infringing on the commercial interests of the BBC in any way .
" I imagine the BBC 's brand protection team are looking out all over the web for people infringing its trademarks and the e-mail they sent to Mazzmatazz was a stock one .
" The ripple effect of that e-mail was quite upsetting . "
' Unscrupulous people ' A BBC Worldwide spokesman said it was not " heavy - handed " with " genuine fans of the show " , but that it had to act in the interest of licence - fee payers by protecting the Doctor Who trademark .
" If you do n't protect your trademark , it 's taken away from you .
And Doctor Who is massive for the BBC .
It 's up to us to earn money from it so we can re-invest it in the BBC , " he said .
He added : " It 's not that we do n't admire creativity from fans - most of the time , we take the view that if it 's small - scale and not for profit , then we turn a blind eye .
" This lady , with the best will in the world , wanted to share with friends , family and fans .
" But there were some unscrupulous people taking these patterns and using them on eBay to make profit for themselves .
Unfortunately , we had to get to the source of the patterns - and that was her website . "
Flexibility
He said that Mazzmatazz was still welcome to get in touch with BBC Worldwide to discuss the issue .
" We were offering to take her ideas to our licensing team .
While we do n't have any plans to offer any knitted toys , in the future , who knows ? "
Ms Hogge said the case raised wider issues of intellectual property law , which is currently being reviewed by the government .
" The BBC have got a difficult situation here - the fans are a very important part of Doctor Who , " she said .
" This situation shows there should be some flexibility in the law - both for fans and for the BBC . "

What are these ?
March 21 , 2008
In this first installment in a series on the classics of the socialist tradition , Todd Chretien offers you a bet about the Communist Manifesto you should n't refuse .
I'LL MAKE you a bet .
If you 've never read the Communist Manifesto , take two hours and read it -- it 's just a 50 - page pamphlet .
You can buy it at most bookstores for a couple bucks , or read it online at www.marxists.org--or better yet , order Phil Gasper 's annotated version from HaymarketBooks.org .
My bet is that you will find at least 10 things that make you say , " That is exactly what I 've always thought ! "
More than that , when you finish reading it , you 'll think , " Sure , some things have changed , but my God -- the Communist Manifesto is more relevant , truthful and inspiring than anything I 've ever read by an American politician .
No wonder they do n't assign this as reading in high school history class ! "
Then you 'll understand why South African coal miners , the unemployed of Indonesia , South Korean teachers , French railroad workers , Indian trade unionists and Cuban radicals have all looked to Karl Marx for inspiration .
Why in 1920 , 1 million Americans -- from New England textile workers to Oklahoman small farmers -- voted for Eugene V. Debs , the most famous Marxist in America .
Why thousands of Pennsylvania coal miners joined the Communist Party in the 1920s and ' 30s .
Why Paul Robeson and W.E.B. DuBois urged people to study Karl Marx .
Why the Black Panther Party made the Communist Manifesto required reading for members .
Series
Ten socialist classics SocialistWorker.org writers introduce 10 of the most important writings by leading thinkers in the revolutionary socialist tradition .
The Communist Manifesto
Socialism : Utopian and Scientific
Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State
The Civil War in France
The Mass Strike
Reform or Revolution
State and Revolution
What Is To Be Done ?
Imperialism : The Highest Stage of Capitalism
Permanent Revolution
And why Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez told a cheering crowd of 15,000 people at the World Social Forum in Caracas in January 2006 : " Karl Marx is more relevant today than ever before , so the question is : socialism or death -- but death of the human race , the death of the planet , because capitalism ... is destroying the ecology of the planet .
We must raise up a new banner of socialism -- a new way for the 21st century , the building of a firm movement of real socialism on the planet . "
If I win the bet , all you have to do is find some way to actively participate in changing the world for the better .
If I lose ( which I wo n't ) , then I 'll read anything you send me that you think is better than Marx , and start a dialogue with you about it ( unless you 're a right - wing crank , and then , I really do n't care what you think ) .
Why am I so confident ?
Because Karl Marx and Frederick Engels do two things in the Communist Manifesto :
They first identify many of the issues facing working - class people living under capitalism , and they then provide a theory to tie it all together -- to understand where human society has come from , how it got to this point , and how it can be changed .
Not bad in 50 pages .
CONSIDER HOW relevant the Communist Manifesto reads on issues in the headlines today :
Sexism
Seventy years before women were even allowed to vote in the U.S. , the Manifesto took up the idea of freeing women from sexual abuse perpetrated against them by wealthy and powerful men .
Marx and Engels called for equality -- and to " do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production . "
In later works , Marx , and especially Engels , blazed new trails in understanding the " historic defeat of the female sex , " as Engels put it , as a consequence of the rise of a class society divided between rich and poor -- and arguing that only socialist equality could ever fully end sexism .
More than a century and a half later , women in the U.S. still earn only 70 cents on the dollar compared to men , and the corporate media treats even a woman as powerful as Hillary Clinton with a disgusting , paternalistic double standard .
Nationalism , Racism and War
In the mid-19th century , the European powers were expanding their control over the rest of the world and preparing the ground for increasingly bloody wars .
They stoked nationalist prejudice and fostered racism to justify their actions .
The Manifesto took these ideas head on :
In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to , the exploitation of one nation by another is put an end to .
In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes , the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end .
In the coming years , Marx and Engels sharpened their critique of national oppression .
In Capital , Marx explained how capitalism 's most cherished myth , " the free market , " was really based on slavery , colonialism and the naked robbery of the wealth of Africa , Asia and Latin America .
The market was only " free " from the point of view of the capitalists and slave masters .
Today , the American government is whipping up an anti-Arab and Muslim racism to justify occupying two countries , the politicians scapegoat Latino and Asian immigrants for layoffs and budget cuts , and the descendents of the millions of slaves who built up America 's wealth suffer imprisonment at rates many times greater than that of whites .
The Rich Get Richer ... and Meaner
The Internet and instant cable news have made the world a very small place , and we take for granted the power of monster global corporations .
In Marx and Engel 's day , capitalism was just taking root , but they could see where the system was going .
As they put it in this prophetic passage in the Manifesto :
The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production ...
All fixed , fast - frozen relations ... are swept away , all new - formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify .
All that is solid melts into air , all that is holy is profaned ... The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe .
It must nestle everywhere , settle everywhere , establish connections everywhere .
Marx and Engels saw that aspects of this rapid industrial and technological progress were positive , but warned that ordinary people in society would pay a heavy price :
Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to the division of labor , the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character , and , consequently , all charm for the workman .
He becomes an appendage of the machine ...
In proportion , therefore , as the repulsiveness of the work increases , the wage decreases .
That certainly describes most people 's jobs today .
Whether you work for $ 9 an hour at Starbucks or $ 22 an hour in an auto plant or $ 30 an hour as a nurse , you know that the biggest part of any technological innovation goes to the boss .
No matter how much the economy grows , there 's never enough money for health care , education or decent wages .
Of course , they always find a way to pay for war and tax cuts for the rich .
And this is all in " good times " -- we all know what happens when capitalism goes into to one of its regular slumps .
NOW YOU see why I 'm going to win the bet .
But Marx and Engel 's eloquent denunciations of capitalism 's crimes are not the most important part of the Manifesto .
Like the song says , " You do n't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows . "
However , you do need a meteorologist to tell you when a storm is coming , what conditions make create that storm , and what you should do to prepare for it .
What Ben Franklin did for thunderstorms , Marx and Engels did for economics and politics .
Karl Marx and Frederick Engels provided an overall theory to help explain history , how to fight for justice today , and the possibility of a better future .
Liberal and conservative historians want you to believe that society has always been divided between the rich and the poor , the weak and the strong , men and women , etc. -- division based on money , race , nationality is built into our human nature .
The Manifesto takes a radically different view : Humans lived for thousands of years in what Marx and Engels called " primitive communism " -- by which they meant societies that existed in every part of the world where cooperation and mutual reliance , and not competition , formed the basis of survival .
At the time , this was based on cutting - edge anthropological research that was very controversial , but today , all but a few right - wing cranks accept that this is the truth about pre-class human society .
This is more than just an interesting observation .
Marx and Engels based their whole view of the possibility of social change on it .
If humans lived for tens of thousands of years without war and cutthroat competition , then we can do it again .
Simple , huh ?
Many famous people have agreed with this as a hope or a wish or a dream -- Jesus , Buddha , Mohammad , Moses , Spartacus , Ghandi and Martin Luther King to name a few .
However , Marx and Engels make a very specific case about how to make this vision of a different kind of world concrete :
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles .
Freeman and slave , patrician and plebian , lord and serf ... in a word , oppressor and oppressed , stood in constant opposition to one another , carried on an uninterrupted , now hidden , now open fight , a fight that each time ended , either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large , or in the common ruin of the contending classes .
So once primitive communism is replaced by the haves and have - nots , two things happen :
The rich fight like hell to get richer , while the poor resist their exploitation to the best of their ability .
Human history is about our capacity as a species to innovate , and then about the fight over who will benefit from our collective efforts -- everyone equally or a domineering minority .
The rich usually manage to keep control because they can pay other people to carry arms to enforce their will , and they have the leisure time to dedicate to politics .
But any given ruling class always has to watch out for a challenge from two sources : either foreign competitors abroad and newly emerging wealthy classes at home , or the solidarity of the lower classes banding together to try to upend the status quo .
It is very common in history for one ruling class to be replaced by another : the Greeks beat the Persians , the Romans beat the Germans , the Chinese beat the Vietnamese , the Moguls beat the Hindus , the Aztecs beat the Tepanecs .
More recently , European and American imperialism has seized control of most parts of the world .
Many mainstream historians choose their favorite conquering nation , and then write history based on defending that conquest .
Marx and Engels certainly recognized that this happened , but they were interested in a different fight : namely , could the oppressed people in any given country work together to get rid of their rulers and get back to running society cooperatively , like primitive communism , but with better technology ?
And if they could , was it possible to spread that revolution internationally ?
Their affirmative answer is as radical today as it was back then .
Contrary to myth , the Communist Manifesto never said that socialism was inevitable .
In fact , Marx and Engels pointed out that the " common ruin of the contending classes " was very common in history and a real danger .
Today , we have to ask ourselves what will happen to the planet if we cannot successfully challenge the power of the imperialists and the corporations .
Every year , 6 million children die from malnourishment and lack of cheap medicines .
Wars are killing millions more , and , sooner or later , some president or premier will decide that nuclear warfare is " reasonable . "
Global warming endangers thousands of species , and the drinking water and farmland upon which hundreds of millions of people rely .
The disasters that modern capitalism has in store for us make the collapse of Rome look like a picnic .
But socialism , a society based on democratic planning of the economy in order to eradicate poverty and oppression , is not a pipe dream .
It is one of our possible futures .
Of course , Marx and Engels - - and countless millions of working - class socialist activists -- fought and died without achieving their goals .
And today , they seem even farther away .
Marx and Engels would be the last people to tell you that simply reading the Communist Manifesto would change the world .
But it just might change you .
How about that bet ?
Experts are warning that the risk of a human bird flu pandemic remains just as real and is in fact probably growing .
They say as the bird flu virus becomes further entrenched in poultry in more countries , the risk of a pandemic remains and is probably expanding .
At a meeting of 150 experts organised by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , in order to update its guidance to countries on how to boost their defences against a deadly global epidemic , it has been revealed that the H5N1 avian flu virus has now infected flocks in much of Asia , Africa and parts of Europe .
Health experts are concerned that the virus will mutate into a form that passes easily from person to person , triggering a pandemic which could kill millions .
Dr. Supamit Chunsuttiwat , a disease control expert at Thailand 's health ministry says the risk of a pandemic remains and the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus persists on three continents and had also caused human cases in Indonesia , Egypt and China this year .
Dr. Supamit says there are concerns that the spread through migratory birds has not stopped and once the virus is established in birds , it is difficult to eliminate the risk to humans if countries do not have good control of transmission in birds .
According to the WHO , even though the avian flu virus rarely infects people , there have nevertheless been 382 human cases worldwide since 2003 , and 241 have been fatal .
The coordinator of WHO 's global influenza program , Keiji Fukuda says the threat of pandemic influenza has not diminished and the timing remains a matter of speculation .
Although most countries have drawn up pandemic plans , the level of preparedness varies which is a concern , as a pandemic could overwhelm healthcare systems , particularly in poor countries .
The WHO says the risk of international spread through asymptomatic air travellers is a very real concern and the organisation acknowledges that it will need to improve its guidance to give people and countries better tools to deal with such an event .
The WHO aims to revise its 2005 guidance to its 193 member states by the end of the year and has set up two global stockpiles of the antiviral Tamiflu , containing 5 million treatment courses donated by the Swiss drugmaker Roche , for use in the event of a pandemic .
The WHO is also developing a vaccine stockpile which , when a vaccine has been produced should initially contain 150 million doses .
As many as 16 companies are currently working on vaccines to prevent bird flu infection in people and some are said to be close to regulatory approval ; these newer generation vaccines need less antigen and contain adjuvant but can still stimulate an immune response .
Experts say until a pandemic virus has emerged large - scale commercial production of a vaccine will not start because the vaccine must closely match the strain .
The WHO currently uses six phases of pandemic alert to gauge levels of threat and the world is currently in phase 3 , meaning that a new influenza virus sub - type is causing disease in humans but is not yet spreading efficiently .
The H5N1 strain of bird flu virus currently circulating first appeared in Asian poultry in late 2003 and to date almost all human cases have been linked to contact with infected birds .
Indonesia has been the worse hit with 108 deaths so far and is seen by many experts as a potential source for a pandemic .
The WHO says health regulations which came into effect in 2007 oblige countries to report new disease threats with global public health significance , such as new flu subtypes ; they also allow the WHO to act on credible information sources , rather than just being reliant on official government channels .
The health regulations countries are designed to curb the spread of a pandemic and include assuring access to medical centers , control of airports and other points of entry and preparations to isolate sick people and quarantine contacts .
According to the acceptance speeches at this year 's Oscars , there is a war going on .
It should therefore be the duty of every man , woman and dog to prepare for battle .
Thankfully , our forum goons created a few animated instructions on how to best prepare for the harsh realities that come with living in times of war , based on this boring guide .
Use the following images to motivate yourself until you feel ready to cause unspeakable harm to anyone who dares hail from a country other than your own .

According to this Kiplinger 's tax tip video , only 1 in 150 personal tax returns get audited .
Realistically speaking , your odds of getting audited are probably even lower than that .
In fact , it 's virtually zero .
The Kiplinger editor calls the taxpayer 's fear of audits " very stupid . "
He explains that you will not get audited as long as you do n't claim any insane tax deductions .
Therefore , everyone should be aggressive and take advantage of all the available deductions within reason .
Our irrational fear of audits
One recent survey conducted by a CPA at Louisiana State University shows that the average taxpayer believes 1 in 7 people gets audited by the IRS .
Over 80 % of the people surveyed had unrealistically high expectations of getting audited .
When the survey takes into consideration the likely income bracket of the participants , the results get even more ridiculous :
Taxpayers with the least revenue perceived their audit potential at greater than 25 percent .
[ In reality , your chance of getting audited is 0.6 % . ]
Conversely , taxpayers with the greatest revenue potential perceived less of an audit potential ( 15 percent ) .
Source : Dissertation of William VanDenburgh 59 ( PDF ) .
In other words , people with the least money to report actually worry the most about getting caught .
Putting it in perspective
Instead of worrying about the IRS , you might think about these other more pressing problems :
Chances of dying from heart disease : 1 in 5
Chances of dying from cancer : 1 in 7
Chances of dying from a stroke : 1 in 24
Chances of dying from a vehicle accident : 1 in 84
Chances of getting audited : 1 in 150
So relax .
Go out .
Get some excercise .
Stroke the kitty .
Play some Warcraft .
The taxman is not coming for you .
But if you insist on getting in your taxes on time , here 's a 35 % off TurboTax online deal you can check out .
Even if you can't pay the IRS it is not the end of the world .

Those that know Rahul Sood , founder of Voodoo PC and CTO of HP 's global gaming business , might not be so surprised to hear he used a working MacBook Air to cut his thick , rich , chocolatey birthday cake .

Good luck , Rahul -- we 're totally sure the Apple fanboys of the world are going to give you a pass on this one .
“ Every time you go through localization you then have to put it through a test , which involves making sure that you recorded the proper voice , and that the proper voice is being activated with the proper trigger , at the proper time …
So it ’s not just a case of swapping over some words , it requires some proper extra development processes .
And so it takes time .
I realize that from time to time we have still been disappointing some people , but in general we have also been able to bring to them games which would have never been available before in a European market , and the time frame is slowly decreasing , so I ’m positive for the future .
We know that we are still not reaching the expectations of all the people , but we ’re really doing our best to resolve this . ”
– Laurent Fischer , Nintendo of Europe
Knowing that Nintendo of Europe is not completely satisfied with the delay in game releases might give people some hope .
Having to wait four months for such an anticipated game is definitely difficult .
However , could localization really have delayed the game four months ?

In a recent post , my colleague Jennifer Lance asked whether Hillary Clinton can take on big oil .
Among other things , Jennifer concluded that despite the good intentions of Senator Clinton , ” A gas tax holiday will not solve the problem of peak oil . ”
And that is exactly the same message the Obama campaign wants to deliver in an ad now running in North Carolina ahead of next Tuesday ’s primary .
The commercial denounces the proposed gas - tax cut , a proposal which Senators Clinton and McCain both support , as the type of quick - fix policy solution that is emblematic of Washington politics .
Running time : 1 min .

Filling up his wife 's dark blue SUV at a convenience store pump in northern Paris , Didier Marchand almost laughs when he hears about the cost of a tank of gas now nosing up to the $ 4 mark across the Atlantic .
But he is polite .
" If we had that price - it 's about half of ours - we'd be delighted , " said Marchand .
The prices posted at the station where he is getting his gas reflect French reality : 1.35 euros a liter for normal gas going up to 1.50 euros for premium - or between roughly $ 8 and nearly $ 9 a gallon .
" What shocks me is not the price of gas , but the taxes the government adds on to it .
They 're really , really high , " Marchand said .
" It 's scandalous . "
The sticker shock at the pump that is now sending Americans reeling has long been a fact of life in Europe , where many countries like France and Britain add on hefty government tariffs .
And while the recent hike in oil prices has been felt here as well , many Europeans have long been able to adapt , opting for public transportation and bikes and for smaller , more fuel - efficient cars than their U.S. counterparts , experts say .
" Better cars , less intensive use of cars has meant overall consumption of fuel in Europe has been going down steadily over the last three years , " said Pierre Noel , an energy researcher at Cambridge University in England .
" We are much better equipped than the U.S. to deal with higher prices and a more volatile market because we are so much less oil intensive than you are , " said Noel , who bikes to work .
Europe generally has far better public transportation than the United States , with workers in countries like Britain , Belgium and France packing morning commuter trains and subways .
Transportation planning increasingly factors in bike lanes , and more innovative mayors like those in Paris and London are designing schemes to facilitate alternative transport - and to make driving an ever more arduous option .
All of this helps soften the bite of soaring oil prices for commuters - but not for those who depend on their vehicles like architect Christopher Assan , who said he cannot work without his motorcycle .
" I 'm really feeling the increase , " said Assan as he carefully poured gas from a plastic bottle into his tank .
" I fill my bike up about three times a week .
That 's about 60 euros ( $ 94 ) .
Two years ago , I spent about half that . "
Taxi drivers are also hurting .
" We 're having a very hard time because fuel is a big expense , " said Bertrand Casagrande , vice president of the Chambre Artisanal des Taxi , representing two - thirds of the 50,000 independent taxi drivers in France .
But because most French taxi drivers own their business , few are considering quitting , he says .
Gas is even more expensive in Britain , where top prices hover at almost 5 pounds - or nearly $ 10 - a gallon .
In Scotland , the local government development agency recently warned that nearly half the region 's gas stations might close over the next five years as price - conscious commuters drive less .
" I 'm lucky .
I do n't use an awful lot of petrol , and it does n't bother me too much because I can afford it , " said Edinburgh resident Erica Donald , 79 .
" But I worry that oil prices are going up so high that it affects businesses , it affects transport .
It affects food prices . "
In Paris , Mayor Bertrand Delanoe is not making life easy for drivers .
During his six years in City Hall , he has pushed through a virtual revolution in the city 's transportation landscape .
New bike lanes crisscross the city - narrowing car lanes and increasing traffic congestion .
Major arteries hugging the Seine River are closed to drivers on Sundays to make way for bikers and in - line skaters .
Last year , Delanoe introduced a popular bicycle - for - hire scheme known as " Velib " - a combination of velo or bicycle and liberté or freedom - which parked some 15,000 bikes in pickup stations across the city to be rented for about $ 1.60 a ride .
This year , the city has added a car - for - hire program called ALS ( Automobiles - en - Libre - Service ) to the mix , with plans to put 2,000 electric cars on the streets over the next two years .
The Velib scheme has been replicated in many European cities , including Barcelona , Spain ; Brussels ; Oslo , Norway ; and Vienna .
And it is just one of a raft of green measures being tested in Europe so the continent can become less oil dependent .
Sweden put its first bio - gas train into service in 2005 .
The British government is drafting plans to build 15 new " eco towns , " with homes located near shops and public transportation , central areas closed to drivers and 15 mph speed limits on major arteries .
For its part , London plans to more than triple its daily " congestion tax " on car commuters to nearly $ 50 by the end of October .
Still , critics like Franziska Achterberg , transportation campaigner for Greenpeace in Brussels , say Europe could do a lot more to wean itself from petroleum .
" People are driving more all the time , despite the high prices , " she said .
" People just get used to them . "
Anti-car efforts in Paris and London may backfire , some experts warn , as drivers simply go farther to get around the hurdles .
A recent study by King 's College in London , for example , found carbon dioxide emissions would actually rise with a congestion tax hike as people drive farther to avoid congestion - charging zones .
And despite better rail and bus links than in the United States , the car continues to rule the road in European suburbs and small towns .
Efforts to reduce car dependency - or design green alternatives - do not factor heavily into European Union plans to slash CO{ - 2} emissions by 2020 , Noel noted .
" Cutting carbon emissions in the transportation sectors is just much more difficult and more costly than in other sectors , " he said .
" Because emissions are decentralized , they 're hard to track . "
Not that it 's a slow news day or anything , but Bill Oddie is in trouble with viewers for providing unnecessarily racy commentary on Springwatch .
According to reports , the former Goodie backed footage of two sparrows mating with the words : " The female is asking for it - and getting it , basically ...
She 's doing that wing - fluttering thing as if to say : ' I am a baby , feed me now ' ... and is getting quite the opposite ...
That 's a wing - trembler she 's just had there . "
Later , while watching two beetles having sex , he proclaimed : " One thing 's for sure - this boy is horny , " before going on to role - play the part of the female : " Come on big boy , come and get it ...
Oh , be gentle with me ! "
Now this is bloody sexy stuff .
No one could hear that without getting dangerously turned on .
In fact , according to the state - of - the - art Raunch Gauge based at Wookey Hole in Somerset ( founded in 1978 to monitor fluctuating levels of steaminess in network broadcasts ) , that particular edition of Springwatch was the second most arousing broadcast since records began - eclipsed only by the notorious 1984 edition of News at Ten in which a trouserless Sandy Gall vaulted the desk and violently rubbed his crotch against the lens for 10 whole minutes in a desperate bid to perk up a report on Sealink ferries .*
Gall 's shenanigans took place 24 years ago - a long time in broadcasting , where memories are so short that even top TV executives regularly forget where their own mouths are while eating , which is why The Ivy is full of grown men and women smearing food all over their faces like babies and slapping the table in a panic .
The horror had long since faded .
Consequently Oddie 's XXX - rated outburst caught the population unawares .
Within minutes , millions of viewers nationwide found themselves driven into an uncontrollable frenzy of slavering lust , grinding themselves against the nearest person or object in a desperate bid to satiate their desires .
The carnage was indescribable , hence the glaring lack of newspaper reports about it .
Once they 'd finished mopping up , viewers picked up the phone to complain .
Stop making animals sexy , they screamed .
It 's freaking us right out .
And they 're right .
Animals are n't sexy , especially when they 're having sex .
Let 's list the reasons why .
Reason One : the lack of experimentation .
It 's all rut , rut , rut as far as the animal kingdom 's concerned .
You never see goats giving blow jobs or a pair of foxes trying out the reverse cowgirl position .
Two dogs banging away in a shop doorway wo n't even look round to check out their own reflections .
They 'll sniff each other 's bums , but that 's about as warped as they get .
There 's a crushing lack of imagination in animals ' sex lives ... which might go some way to explaining reason two ...
Reason
Two : the lack of facial expressions .
Human beings perform all manner of crazy facial distortions during intercourse - Peter Sissons one minute , Marty Feldman the next .
It 's all part of the fun .
Sometimes it 's tempting to break off in the middle just to point and laugh , especially when your partner pulls a face like someone who 's recently dropped a piano on their foot but is trying to conceal their agony .
Animals , on the other hand , do n't pull any expression at all - or at least nothing we humans can interpret .
They look the same as always , ie glazed and bored and impossibly dumb .
Concentrate on their faces and it's like watching furry handymen changing a plug .
There 's no passion there .
Not even any kissing .
Reason
Three : their genitals are all over the shop .
Animal penises , in particular , are the stuff of nightmares .
Kangaroos have a bifurcated penis - and " bifurcated " , for those of you watching in plain English , means " forked " .
The echidna pushes the envelope even further : its penis has four distinct heads .
Dolphins have retractable prehensile schlongs which can snake about like monkey 's tails , grabbing passing objects and throwing them into the air .
Fun at parties ?
Yes .
But sexy ?
No .
Anyway , while it 's legal for humans to watch animals having sex , it 's illegal if we decide to join in .
God knows why , because the act of bestiality itself is surely punishment enough .
It certainly does n't look like a barrel of laughs .
Years ago , while I was working in a second - hand record shop on a quiet day , a fellow staff member surreptitiously passed me a gaudy A5 magazine called something like Zoo Fun or Farmyard Hunger , filled with depressing photographs of humans and animals locked in congress .
One image , in particular , burned itself into my mind : a man standing on a tree stump having sex with a cow .
Both he and the cow appeared bored out of their minds ; two colleagues begrudgingly completing a chore on a cold , cloudy day in Denmark .
That 's not sexy .
That 's a bad day at work .
In summary then : animals are rubbish in bed , and you should n't have wayward thoughts about them .
No matter what Bill Oddie says .
* This is absolutely not true .
· This week Charlie had the fifth series of The Wire slightly spoiled for him when someone blabbed about an important plot detail within earshot : " In any sane world , I 'd be able to sue them . "

Committee members voted after three hours of talks Hillary Clinton 's efforts to secure the Democratic Party 's nomination for president have suffered a setback .
The party took a compromise decision to allow delegates from Florida and Michigan - previously debarred from taking part - to attend its convention .
However , although this increases Mrs Clinton 's support , the delegates will only have half a vote each .
She is still trailing Barack Obama , who remains the clear leader in the race for the nomination .
Clinton adviser Harold Ickes , a member of the committee which took the votes on Florida and Michigan , said she reserved the right to appeal against the decisions .
But , barring appeals , Mr Obama 's victory looks more certain than ever , says the BBC's Jamie Coomarasamy in Washington .
Rules broken
The votes by the party 's rules and bylaws committee took place amid heated exchanges between Clinton and Obama supporters .
I am told the big push is to get enough super - delegates to endorse Obama within the next few hours so that the actual victory is delivered by the electors in Montana and South Dakota on Tuesday
North America Editor , Justin Webb
Read Justin Webb 's thoughts in full Equal split masks Obama victory Mrs Clinton wanted the committee , meeting in the ballroom of a Washington hotel , to overturn a previous decision and allow delegates from Florida and Michigan to vote at the Democratic National Convention in August .
Delegates to that convention , chosen in votes in each state , will decide which politician becomes the Democratic Party candidate in November 's presidential election .
Officially , Mrs Clinton won both states , but both were initially discounted because they held their primaries in January , in contravention of party rules .
Neither candidate campaigned in the contests , and in Michigan , Mr Obama 's name was not even on the ballot .
Hillary Clinton was campaigning in Puerto Rico on Saturday
The compromise gives Mrs Clinton 69 delegates in Michigan , compared to Mr Obama 's 59 .
And in Florida , she gains 105 delegates to Mr Obama 's 67 .
This reduces Mr Obama 's lead - previously 202 - by 48 , but the delegates from Michigan and Florida will only have half a vote each , so her gains are reduced .
The 27 - member committee unanimously accepted the compromise decision for Florida , after earlier rejecting by 15 - 12 a plan which would give all delegates full voting rights at the convention .
In the case of Michigan , the committee approved the compromise by 19 - 8 .
Overall , Mrs Clinton gains only 24 delegate votes , far short of the total she needs to catch Mr Obama .
' Denver , Denver ' Mrs Clinton is still hoping to persuade undecided " super - delegates " that she should be the party 's nominee .

Her adviser Mr Ickes accused the committee of " hijacking " votes for Mrs Clinton .
" Mrs Clinton has instructed me to reserve her rights to take this to the credentials committee , " he added .
The Obama campaign greeted Saturday 's votes as a " fair solution that will allow Michigan and Florida to participate " in the party convention in Denver in August .
During the day 's voting , Clinton supporters chanted " Denver , Denver " - implying the Clinton - Obama contest will drag on until the convention - and " Madame President , Madame President " .
Two women could be heard shouting at each other to " shut up " .
An appeal for party unity was jeered by one heckler with the words " Lipstick on a pig ! " Puerto Rico votes on Sunday , followed by Montana and South Dakota on Tuesday - the last three Democrat primaries of the season .

Cheney : History will show Bush created a ' more hopeful world '
John Byrne
Published : Saturday May 3 , 2008
|
Print This Email This George W. Bush has made the world a more hopeful place .
This from Vice President Dick Cheney , who spoke to a crowd of Oklahoma Republicans Friday evening .
" When the history is written , it will be said this is a safer country and more hopeful world because George Bush was president , " Cheney said , according to Oklahoma 's Tulsa World .
Of Iraq , Cheney quipped : " Our strategy is the right strategy .
The only way we can lose is to quit . "
If the US departs , he said , it would show America " does n't have the stomach for a fight . "
Cheney himself received five draft deferments to avoid service in the Vietnam war .
To justify a US presence in the wartorn region , Cheney cited the Russian experience in Afghanistan .
" We were engaged in that country , lending support to the mujahadeen against Soviet forces , " he said .
" Afterwards , everybody walked away and forgot about Afghanistan .
What followed was a civil war and the emergence of the Taliban .
In 1996 , Osama Bin Laden was invited into Afghanistan .
He trained thousands of terrorists , some of whom were part of the attacks here on the United States . "
He did n't mention the the US pulled out of Afghanistan as well , after the defeat of the Soviets , or that US business , including those in Texas during George W. Bush 's term as governor , engaged in business with the Taliban regime .
" His remarks did not cover any new ground , " the Tulsa paper noted .
" He plugged Oklahoma 's Republican congressional delegation and presumptive GOP presidential nominee John McCain , advocated more oil wells and refineries as the solution to rising gasoline prices and predicted dire economic consequences if current temporary tax cuts and incentives are not made permanent . "
Slams Democrats for bill Bush vetoed Cheney called the Democratic Congress " irresponsible " for allowing domestic surveillance authorization to lapse .
Congress actually passed the authorization but President Bush vetoed the bill because it did not include the liability protection for telecommunications companies that the administration wanted .
" Cheney blamed Democrats for blocking domestic oil and gas production , including exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , " the paper adds .
He called Democrats in Congress " irresponsible " for allowing the president 's warrantless wiretapping program to lapse , but did n't mention that Congress actually passed the bill , containing a provision to block immunity for telecommunications companies that participated .
The economy ?
Just " a rough patch " which " some in Washington view as an excuse to expand the size and scope of government . "
Thirty five protesters gathered a block from the hotel entrance and chanted " impeach Cheney , " according to the paper .
No one was arrested , though some received citations .
The arrival of Europeans changed more than just the landscape European colonisation of Latin America resulted in a dramatic shift from a native American population to a largely mixed one , a genetic study has shown .
It suggests male European settlers mated with native and African women , and slaughtered the men .
But it adds that areas like Mexico City " still preserve the genetic heritage " because these areas had a high number of natives at the time of colonisation .
The findings appear in the journal Public Library of Science Genetics .
The international team of researchers wrote : " The history of Latin America has entailed a complex process of population mixture between natives and recent immigrants across a vast geographic region .
" Few details are known about this process or about how it shaped the genetic make - up of Latin American populations . "
' Clear signature '
The study examined 249 unrelated individuals from 13 Mestizo populations ( people from a mixed European / native American origin ) in seven countries , ranging from Chile in the south to Mexico in the north .
Not only did the European settlers take away land and property , they also took away the women
Dr Andres Ruiz - Linares ,
University College London
" There is a clear genetic signature , " explained lead author Andres Ruiz - Linares from University College London .
" The initial mixing occurred predominately between immigrant and European men and native and African women . "
He said that the study showed that it was a pattern that was uniform across Latin America .
" We see it in all the populations we examined , so it is clearly a historical fact that the ancestors of these populations can be traced to matings between immigrant men and native and African women . "
The researchers found that within the genetic landscape of Latin America , there were variations .
" The Mestizo with the highest native ancestry are in areas which historically have had relatively large native populations , " they reported .
This included Andean regions and cities such as Mexico City , where major civilisations were already established by the time Europeans reached the continent in the late 15th Century .
" By contrast , the Mestizo with the highest European ancestry are from areas with relatively low pre-Columbian native population density and where the current native population is sparse , " they added .
Bloody past Explaining the fate of native males when the Europeans arrived , Professor Ruiz - Linares said : " It is a very sad and terrible historical fact , they were basically annihilated .
" Not only did the European settlers take away land and property , they also took away the women and , as much as possible , they exterminated the men . "
He said the findings could help people change their perception of Latin American history .
" It is very important in terms of rescuing the past and recognising the roots of the population , and the living presence of natives within the current population , " Professor Ruiz - Linares explained .
As well as providing an insight into the past , the team hopes that the findings will also help shape studies aimed at identifying and analysing diseases .

The number of miles your food travels from farm to plate makes a difference in your personal climate - change footprint .
But not as much as eating red meat and dairy , which are responsible for nearly half of all food - related greenhouse gas emissions for an average U.S. household .
New research published in Environmental Science & Technology finds it ’s how food is produced , not how far it ’s transported , that matters most for global warming .
Christopher Weber and Scott Matthews of Carnegie Mellon University conducted a life - cycle assessment of greenhouse gases emitted during all stages of growing and transporting food .
They found transportation creates only 11 % of the 8.1 metric tons of greenhouse gases that an average U.S. household generates annually from food consumption .
The agricultural and industrial practices that go into growing and harvesting food create 83 % .
Switching to a totally local diet is equivalent to driving about 1000 miles less per year .
Yet a relatively small dietary shift can accomplish about the same .
Replacing red meat and dairy with chicken , fish , or eggs for one day per week reduces emissions equal to 760 miles per year of driving , say the study ’s authors .
And switching to vegetables one day per week cuts the equivalent of driving 1160 miles per year .
Why not all of the above ?
Though there are other factors to consider when we choose our foods , everything from the ecological costs of hunting wildlife ( fish ) , to fertilizer runoff and oceanic dead zones ( dairy ) , to cruelty issues ( eggs ) .
As always , and as your mama said , veggies rule .

Al Gore Claims Global Warming is to Blame for Myanmar Cyclone
It was only a matter of time before we heard this from Al Gore .
Al Gore is now claiming that global warming is responsible for the cyclone in Myanmar .
Al Gore should be ashamed of himself for trying to politicize a tragedy like this cyclone for his own personal benefit .
At least people are starting to realize Al Gore for who and what he is , as can be seen in the first paragraph of the above linked article .
Using tragedy to advance an agenda has been a strategy for many global warming activists , and it was just a matter of time before someone found a way to tie the recent Myanmar cyclone to global warming .
Former Vice President Al Gore in an interview on NPR ’s May 6 “ Fresh Air ” broadcast did just that .
That is precisely what Al Gore is doing here , using a tragedy to push his agenda .
An agenda that puts millions of dollars in his pocket by the way .
Here is how he tried to spin a natural tragedy into a human caused event :
And as we ’re talking today , Terry , the death count in Myanmar from the cyclone that hit there yesterday has been rising from 15,000 to way on up there to much higher numbers now being speculated , ” Gore said .
“ And last year a catastrophic storm from last fall hit Bangladesh .
The year before , the strongest cyclone in more than 50 years hit China – and we ’re seeing consequences that scientists have long predicted might be associated with continued global warming .
Gore claimed global warming is forcing ocean temperatures to rise , which is causing storms , including cyclones and hurricanes , to intensify .
But ih his next breath he seemed to try to cover his tracks .
It ’s also important to note that the emerging consensus among the climate scientists is although any individual storm ca n’t be linked singularly to global warming – we ’ve always had hurricanes , ” Gore said .
“ Nevertheless , the trend toward more Category 5 storms – the larger ones and trend toward stronger and more destructive storms appears to be linked to global warming and specifically to the impact of global warming on higher ocean temperatures in the top couple of hundred feet of the ocean , which drives convection energy and moisture into these storms and makes them more powerful . ”
He is hedging his bets there .
While he claims that this storm is linked to global warming , he is admitting that individual storms ca n’t be directly linked to global warming .
He is sitting on both sides of the fence .
You ca n’t have it both ways Al .
He seems to be starting to back off because of more and more scientists who are voicing their global warming scepticism even as he is blaming global warming for the storm .
Cyclones are an act of nature , they are not a political issue .
But Al Gore and other global warming alarmists are trying to turn this into a political issue for their own gain .
It is time to wake up and stop this scam before we are taxed to the gills on this bogus hoax .
SAN FRANCISCO  Counterfeit products are a routine threat for the electronics industry .
However , the more sinister specter of an electronic Trojan horse , lurking in the circuitry of a computer or a network router and allowing attackers clandestine access or control , was raised again recently by the F.B.I. and the Pentagon .
The new law enforcement and national security concerns were prompted by Operation Cisco Raider , which has led to 15 criminal cases involving counterfeit products bought in part by military agencies , military contractors and electric power companies in the United States .
Over the two - year operation , 36 search warrants have been executed , resulting in the discovery of 3,500 counterfeit Cisco network components with an estimated retail value of more than $ 3.5 million , the F.B.I. said in a statement .
The F.B.I. is still not certain whether the ring ’s actions were for profit or part of a state - sponsored intelligence effort .
The potential threat , according to the F.B.I. agents who gave a briefing at the Office of Management and Budget on Jan. 11 , includes the remote jamming of supposedly secure computer networks and gaining access to supposedly highly secure systems .
Contents of the briefing were contained in a PowerPoint presentation leaked to a Web site , Above Top Secret .
A Cisco spokesman said that the company had investigated the counterfeit gear seized by law enforcement agencies and had not found any secret back door .
The blast damaged the embassy and nearby vehicles
At least six people have been killed and 30 injured in a car bomb attack near the Danish embassy in the Pakistani capital Islamabad .
An embassy worker was among the dead and three were hurt but no Danish citizens were killed or injured .
Danish PM Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the act " cowardly " and said it would not change Danish policies .
It was not clear who carried out the attack , as Pakistan 's main militant group recently declared a ceasefire .
Pakistan 's top Taleban warlord Baitullah Mehsud is in peace talks with the authorities in an attempt to end fighting in the country 's north - west .
Other militant factions - accused of being involved in similar attacks in the past - have also recently engaged in talks with the government and the number of bombings in the country has reduced since the induction of a new government in March .
It was like I was stuck between two speeding cars or between two moving trains - my door which was half - open slammed shut , everything moved
Asim Mukhtar , witness
Eyewitness : ' Screams all over ' Some Danish embassies around the world have been threatened since a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad was reprinted in Danish newspapers in February .
The cartoons , deemed offensive to Islam , led to worldwide protests when they were first printed in September 2005 .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says suspicion for the attack has fallen on al - Qaeda , as the network 's number two Ayman al - Zawahri denounced the cartoons in a recent video .
Denmark also has 700 troops fighting the Taleban in neighbouring Afghanistan .
Mr Rasmussen said the bombing was an " attack against Denmark " .
He added : " Denmark will not alter its [ foreign ] policy because of a terror attack . "
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir said : " The president , the prime minister , as well as the foreign minister , have all very strongly condemned this terrorist attack ... and our hearts go out to the families of the victims . "
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Pakistan says that while the embassy attack may have an obvious motive - the cartoons - the Danish embassy was an easy target because it is located in a residential area outside of the high - security diplomatic enclave .
Our correspondent says that the attack has added to the sense of insecurity among Islamabad residents , who were not exposed to militant attacks until last year , when a violent siege of the city 's red mosque took place .
The last attack in the city took place on 15 March when an Italian restaurant was targeted , killing a Turkish woman and injuring 10 other foreigners .
There are a number of militant groups with bases in Pakistan which are linked to insurgencies in Afghanistan and in Indian - administered - Kashmir - our correspondent says - and many have a history of carrying out sectarian attacks directed at Western missions and diplomats .
' Immense pressure '
Most foreign staff have been moved out of the Danish embassy since the cartoon row erupted .

Denmark advised its citizens against all travel to Pakistan , and Norway closed its embassy following the blast .
Our correspondent says it is alarming for many that the bomber got so close to the Danish embassy .
The attacker drove onto a small patch of road between the embassy and an office building at around midday local time ( 0600 GMT ) .
The car 's engine was found a few metres from the crater .
A Pakistani cleaner was killed , a handyman seriously injured and two office workers also hurt , Mr Moeller said .
All the other casualties are thought to be outside the embassy .
Part of the embassy wall was damaged , as was a building housing offices of a UN - funded non-governmental organisation .
Asim Mukhtar , who works near the site of the blast , told the BBC that the air pressure there was " immense " .
" It was like I was stuck between two speeding cars or between two moving trains .
My door which was half - open slammed shut .
Everything moved , " he said .
" We ran to the roof and saw some black smoke rising .
After one minute we heard the sounds of ambulances . "

Since this latest round of Obama / Wright mania on the part of the mainstream media was sparked by Rev. Wright 's appearance on Bill Moyers Journal ( followed by his speech in front of the National Press Club ) , it is perhaps not surprising to hear Moyers add his perspective on the media circus .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Wright 's offensive opinions and inflammatory appearances are judged differently ( than John Hagee , Pat Robertson and Billy Graham ) .
He does n't fire a shot in anger , put a noose around anyone 's neck , call for insurrection , or plant a bomb in a church with children in Sunday school .
What he does is to speak his mind in a language and style that unsettle some people , and says some things so outlandish and ill - advised that he finally leaves Obama no choice but to end their friendship .
We are often exposed us to the corroding acid of the politics of personal destruction , but I 've never seen anything like this -- this wrenching break between pastor and parishioner - - before our very eyes .
Both men no doubt will carry the grief to their graves .
All the rest of us should hang our heads in shame for letting it come to this in America , where the gluttony of the non -stop media grinder consumes us all and prevents an honest conversation on race .
It is the price we are paying for failing to heed the great historian Jacob Burckhardt , who said " beware the terrible simplifiers " .
It is possible that some of the changes were the unintended consequences of the rushed legislative process just before this month ’s Congressional recess , rather than a purposeful effort by the administration to enhance its ability to spy on Americans .
“ We did not cover ourselves in glory , ” said one Democratic aide , referring to how the bill was compiled .
But a senior intelligence official who has been involved in the discussions on behalf of the administration said that the legislation was seen solely as a way to speed access to the communications of foreign targets , not to sweep up the communications of Americans by claiming to focus on foreigners .
“ I do n’t think it ’s a fair reading , ” the official said .
“ The intent here was pure : if you ’re targeting someone outside the country , the fact that you ’re doing the collection inside the country , that should n’t matter . ”
Democratic leaders have said they plan to push for a revision of the legislation as soon as September .
“ It was a legislative over - reach , limited in time , ” said one Congressional Democratic aide .
“ But Democrats feel like they can regroup . ”
Some civil rights advocates said they suspected that the administration made the language of the bill intentionally vague to allow it even broader discretion over wiretapping decisions .
Whether intentional or not , the end result — according to top Democratic aides and other experts on national security law — is that the legislation may grant the government the right to collect a range of information on American citizens inside the United States without warrants , as long as the administration asserts that the spying concerns the monitoring of a person believed to be overseas .
In effect , they say , the legislation significantly relaxes the restrictions on how the government can conduct spying operations aimed at foreigners at the same time that it allows authorities to sweep up information about Americans .
These new powers are considered overly broad and troubling by some Congressional Democrats who raised their concerns with administration officials in private meetings this week .

Americans do n’t have to wait for the statistics to know these are very hard times .
For the fourth month in a row , the economy lost jobs in April .
The economists said the contraction was not as bad as expected  20,000 jobs were shed versus an anticipated loss of 75,000 .
Not as bad as expected is cold comfort .
The latest employment report shows other deepening problems for American workers , including slower wage growth , cutbacks in hours , a sharp increase in the number of part - timers who would prefer full - time work and lengthening spells of unemployment .
The White House response to the pain is to wait and see if things get even worse before calling for help for the unemployed .
On Friday President Bush said that his administration had anticipated the slump and would combat it with tax rebates that were passed last February as part of the economic stimulus package .
There is no guarantee , however , that the rebates  which are just now being distributed  will spur the economy as hoped .
Rather than spend the money , many indebted consumers are likely to use it to pay down debt , and some people , justifiably fearful of job loss , are likely to save it .

Nuclear fission is the process in which a nucleus decays into two fragments .
For large nucleii , this process is a complicated one in which the nucleus undergoes several stages of deformation before tearing itself apart .
In recent years , physicists have predicted that fission ought to be affected by the presence of electrons in orbit about the nucleus .
That ’s because any change in the shape of the nucleus naturally affects the electrons which tend to absorb energy making fission less likely .
And the more electrons there are , the more energy they absorb .
But the effect has never been observed because ordinary , naturally ocurring elements simply do n’t have enough electrons to make this effect significant .
Today , Vlad Dzuba and Vic Flambuam at the University of New South Wales in Australia have calculated the strength of this effect for superheavy elements which would have more electrons .
They say that although the effect is tiny for naturally ocurring nuclei with fewer than 100 or so protons , it would be hugely significant for these larger nuclei .
In fact , they calculate that an atom with 160 protons would have double the expected half life because of this effect .
That could have significant implications for how much of this stuff we ’re likely to find because elements that decay quickly tend to be rarer ) .
Last week , arxivblog reported on the potential discovery of element 122 ( with 122 protons ) .
Perhaps the groups looking for superheavies should be setting their sights much , much higher .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices touched another record Wednesday , spiking after an initial decline on a government report that said crude and gasoline supplies were stronger than expected last week .
Light sweet crude for June delivery settled at a record high of $ 123.53 a barrel , up $ 1.69 from the previous record of $ 121.84 a barrel set Tuesday .
The contract reached a record trading high of $ 123.80 at one point during the session .
Just before the Energy Information Administration released its report , oil was up 21 cents at $ 122.05 , then retreated as low as $ 120.54 before rebounding .
Crude prices for the June contract dropped off as investors reacted to the positive supply report .
However , they spiked back up again as the " market realized that the numbers are not as bullish as people thought and they bought back really quickly , " said Stephen Schork , publisher of the industry newsletter The Schork Report .
After any event or report , the markets need at least 20 minutes to digest the information , according to Schork .
The numbers
Crude oil inventories climbed by 5.7 million barrels from the week ended May 2 .
Analysts forecast a gain of 1.5 million barrels , according to a survey from Platts , an energy research firm .
At 325.6 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are in the middle of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories rose by 800,000 barrels last week , and are in the upper half of the average range .
Gasoline inventories were expected to fall 500,000 barrels .
Distillate fuel - used to make heating oil and diesel fuel - dropped by 100,000 barrels last week , and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of year .
The research firm reported that distillates were expected to rise by 1.3 million barrels .
Refineries functioned at 85 % of their operational capacity in the week ended May 2 , a slight decline from the previous week .
This is less than the usual 90 % capacity for this time of year .
Crude oil so high , there is no incentive to make gas
Crude oil prices have been running up on supply disruptions in Nigeria , a key supplier of oil for the United States .
Royal Dutch Shell PLC ( RDS.A ) said militants struck a facility owned by one of the company 's joint ventures in Nigeria .
Another reason that crude oil prices have been so high is the volatile weather in the Gulf of Mexico .
" We have had a very odd season with the Gulf of Mexico , and we have had off - and - on - again shipping , " said Schork .
He said oil supply levels are dependent on imports reaching their destination , and that has been hampered by thick fog in the Gulf of Mexico .
The weakening dollar has also been pushing up the price of oil .
As the value of the dollar falls , oil becomes more expensive because it is traded in U.S. dollars all over the world .
According to auto group AAA 's Web site Wednesday , the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline rose Wednesday to $ 3.618 , up eight - tenths of a cent from the previous day .
It is just a half - cent below the record high of $ 3.623 set May 1 .
Even though retail gas prices are at close to record levels , the tremendously high price of crude oil has given refineries little motivation to make gasoline out of crude oil .
With wholesale gasoline prices at about $ 128 a barrel , that is $ 8 or $ 9 a barrel premium after paying for crude at recent prices , according to Schork .
He compared that yield to the same time last year , when crude was roughly $ 65 a barrel and gas was $ 100 a barrel , yielding a $ 35 premium .
" That is a very small yield , " said Schork .
" The incentive is not there . "
Gas is not profitable , and the machines that refine crude oil into retail gasoline are fatiguing , said Schork .
Even if a refiner had economic incentive to make gasoline , refineries simply can't maximize output .
Looking forward
On Tuesday , the Energy Information Administration - in its monthly short - term energy outlook - said it expects higher crude prices , which will lead to higher prices for gasoline and diesel fuel .
The report said " the oil supply system continues to operate at near capacity and remains vulnerable to both actual and perceived supply disruptions . "
The EIA also indicated that while world oil consumption is projected to grow in 2008 , U.S. consumption will decline " as a result of the economic slowdown and high petroleum prices . "

U.S. consumers can add chicken to the list of foods that will cost more this year .
Prices on everything from soup to nuts have moved higher as food companies pass on to consumers sharply higher costs for grain , meat , and fuel .

Prices on everything from soup to nuts have moved higher as food companies pass on to consumers sharply higher costs for grain , meat , and fuel .
Chief executives at the two largest U.S. chicken companies said on Thursday that chicken prices must go higher to offset the industry ’s higher production costs .
A swift rise in the price of corn , a major feed stock , has been particularly troublesome .
Chicken companies have been unable to raise chicken prices fast enough to offset the higher feed costs , Richard Bond , chief executive at Tyson Foods Inc , said on Thursday .
“ We have attained some ( higher ) pricing but not at the same pace as our inputs have increased , especially in chicken .
The lag of higher priced corn is just now coming through the products that we are taking to market , ” Bond said during his webcast presentation at the BMO Capital Markets agriculture and protein conference in New York City .
Tyson is the largest U.S. meat company and the second largest U.S. chicken producer .
Feed costs for the company should be $ 600 million higher this fiscal year than the previous year , said Bond .
Corn prices have soared to a record $ 6.50 per bushel this year amid strong demand from exporters , livestock and chicken producers , and the makers of the biofuel ethanol .
SUPPLY REDUCED , CONTRACTS CHANGED
In order to raise chicken prices enough to offset these higher costs , Pilgrim ’s Pride Corp , the largest U.S. chicken producer , has cut production 5 percent and shortened contract terms with customers .
“ Prices of grain have escalated so quickly this last fall and into the first part of the year that we have been unable to efficiently pass those prices along as quickly as they have gone up , ” Pilgrim ’s Chief Executive Clint Rivers told the BMO conference .
To more quickly pass on the higher costs , Pilgrims just recently shortened contract terms with customers to 90 to 180 days from previous year - long terms .
While Pilgrim ’s has reduced production 5 percent , Rivers said the industry , as a whole , needs to cut production 3 to 4 percent to generate the higher prices needed to cover costs .
Recently the industry has reduced by 2 to 3 percent the number of eggs and young chicks placed in the production cycle , but it will be early this summer before that reduced supply reaches grocery stores .
“ In the summertime we usually have our strongest demand for chicken , so typically you would not expect to be seeing egg sets drop this time of year .
So I think it is pretty significant , ” said Rivers .
“ We should begin to see some supply affected by this ( drop in egg sets ) in June , ” he said .

Move over ugly American , make room for the ugly Chinese .
In Seoul on Sunday , groups of Chinese students accosted protesters demonstrating against China 's treatment of North Korean refugees and Beijing 's policies in Tibet .
The attacks by the Chinese occurred as the Olympic torch wended its way on its seemingly never - ending journey around the world .
The South Korean government was justifiably angry .
China , after initially denying the events occurred , has now taken steps to still the waters .
But the damage has been done .
China 's angry youth - called " fen qing " in Chinese - are ruining their country 's reputation around the world and spelling the end of a decade - long honeymoon that the world has had with China .
The flare - up was the latest deeply troubling and profoundly weird event to mar the globe - trotting journey of the torch , which the Beijing government has dubbed " the sacred flame . "
( Remember , these dudes are officially atheists . )
Before Seoul , we had Chinese cops in blue and white tracksuits manhandling demonstrators in Paris and London ; we had a Chinese woman in the United States who participated in a pro-Tibet protest being identified on a listserv run by Chinese students ; now her parents are on the run in China and her high school in Qingdao has revoked her diploma ; and we 've witnessed the incessant hounding of Tibetan and other speakers on US campuses by Chinese students .
In cities around the world , the Chinese embassy has fanned the passions of the " angry youth " by encouraging them to demonstrate , handing out T - shirts and flags .
While I have no problem with displays of patriotic feeling , the only thing these " angry youth " are accomplishing is turning the world away from China .
And they are not alone in this ill - fated effort to get China 's point across .
China 's propaganda machine is also seriously in need of repairs .
For a few years there , the tone adopted by spokespeople of China 's government was downright suave .
Background briefings .
Check .
A quiet drink with journalists .
Check .
Even a bowling event without a government minder .
Check .
But these days , it seems like someone has disinterred Cultural Revolution propagandist and Gang of Four member Zhang Chunqiao and put him at the helm .
After the March riots in Tibet , the Tibetan government proclaimed a " people 's war " against " splittism " ( somebody should really tell them to lose that word ) and the party boss there called the Dalai Lama " a jackal clothed in a monk 's robes , and a vicious devil who is a beast in human form . "
A few days later the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi " disgusting . "
And the amazing thing was the Chinese expected to be taken seriously .
Finally , there 's China 's " ship of shame " - packed with arms for the government of Zimbabwe 's president Robert Mugabe - on its own troubled journey to first South Africa and now Angola .
In both places , dock workers refused to unload the weapons .
It 's a coincidence but also a bad one because China has been focusing a lot of diplomatic capital on improving its ties to Africa and the rest of the Third World .
What does this all mean for China ?
To me , it means the end of an era of China 's " soft power . "
Europe ’s new Jules Verne cargo ship made a nearly flawless first docking at the International Space Station on Thursday , carrying tons of needed supplies and expanding Europe ’s role in space .
The robotic spacecraft , gingerly approaching the station at one - tenth of a foot per second , docked with the space station at 10:45 a.m.
Eastern time while the two vehicles flew more than 200 miles above the Atlantic Ocean .
Seven minutes later , a series of clamps firmly secured the vehicles .
“ We have contact , ” the Russian astronaut Col. Yuri I. Malenchenko said from inside the space station , where he and the American commander of the station , Peggy A. Whitson , were monitoring the operation .
The comment brought applause and cheers from the cargo craft ’s European control center in Toulouse , France .
The Jules Verne , named after the visionary French science fiction author , is the first of a new class of station supply ships called Automatic Transfer Vehicles .
The craft was built by the nations of the European Space Agency as one of Europe ’s major contributions to the international station .
There are more than 352,000 CTOs — also known as chief technology officers — working in the U.S. right now .
This is a fast - growing field , and lots of businesses are bringing CTOs onto their teams as key decision - makers .
Have you been considering doing the same ?
If you ’ve been asking yourself questions like “ what ’s a CTO ? ” and “ does my business need a CTO ? ” keep reading .
You ’ll find answers to these and all your other most pressing CTO - related questions .
What ’s a CTO ?
A chief technology officer is a type of computer and information systems manager .
They are responsible for making all kinds of decisions related to the technological system a business uses and / or sells .
CTOs have a lot of responsibility .
The following are some of the primary tasks they ’re expected to carry out :
Think of and develop technical strategies and principles for all of the company ’s operations
Facilitate all aspects of a company ’s new technological concepts , from conception and progression to growth and implementation
Consults with heads of various departments to ensure everyone is working together and utilizing tech in the proper way
Carry out research on new technologies the company can use
Present information on this technology in a way that other members of the company can understand
Most CTOs have degrees and ample amounts of experience in fields like Information Technology ( IT ) or computer programming .
Does My Business Need a CTO ?
You now know more about what a CTO does and how they can help you make decisions on important business matters like what kind of software to use and what new developments are taking place in the tech sector .
However , you might still be on the fence about whether or not you need one for your business .
There are a lot of reasons why you may want to hire a CTO , including the following :
Stay Informed
As a business owner , you likely do n’t have a ton of time to spend researching and learning about the latest technological advances and finding ways to implement them .
A CTO will have more time to handle this and help you stay informed on the most important pieces of information .
Stay Competitive

The first such query came in the Cleveland suburb of Parma Heights Saturday night at the very end of a lengthy town hall meeting : “ My question is about immigration and gay marriage , ” stated one young woman .
“ What are you going to do about it ? ”
before deciding that there really is a connection , that it ’s not pretty , and that the Bush administration is to blame .
“ Part of what has happened in our politics over the last several years , and this administration has been an expert in it , is making you afraid of each other , ” he said to loud cheers .
“ So they make you afraid of people who do n’t look like you or do n’t talk like you or do n’t live in the same neighborhoods as you , ” he continued .
“ That kind of divisiveness in politics has to come to an end .
We ca n’t solve our problems with that kind of politics . ”
On Sunday in the Appalachian town of Nelsonville , Ohio , where plant closures and the mortgage crisis are rippling through the economy , Pastor Leon Forte aimed his own double barrels at Obama , asking the candidate to explain ( a ) what he would do about the foreclosure crisis and ( b ) his faith .
“ Your campaign sets a quandary for most evangelical Christians , ” Forte , who heads up Grace Christian Center in Athens , Ohio , told Obama .
“ They believe in the social agenda that you have .
They have a problem with what the conservatives have laid out as the moral litmus test about who is worthy and who is not . ”
Obama tackled the easy part first -– how to clean up after the burst housing bubble and help struggling Americans keep their homes .
Then he talked about Jesus Christ and his own controversial minister , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. ( who has praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan ) , along with same - sex marriage and abortion .
“ I am a Christian , ” Obama responded in low tones .
“ I am a devout Christian .
I ’ve been a member of the same church for 20 years .
I pray to Jesus every night and try to go to church as much as I can . ”
OK , so these days those hard pews have dug into his back a lot less than usual , considering “ I have n’t been home on Sunday for several months now . ”
Still , he said , “ my faith is important to me .
It ’s not something that I try to push on other people .
But it ’s something that helps to guide my life and my values . ”
While Obama said he does not believe in same - sex marriage , he argued strongly for civil unions that allow same - sex couples to visit each other in the hospital , let them transfer property to each other and protect them from discrimination .
“ If people find that controversial , then I would just refer them to the Sermon on the Mount , which , I think , is , in my mind , more central than an obscure passage in Romans , ” Obama said .
That likely would be “ Blessed are the merciful for they shall receive mercy ” over “ Men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves due penalty for their perversion . ”
Obama described abortion Sunday as “ always a tragic and painful issue ” and said that those who support a woman ’s right to choose have “ made some mistakes … by not focusing on the fact that there is a real moral element to this . ”
But he also emphasized that women do not make decisions about their bodies casually and that it is important to make sure “ that young people are engaging in responsible behavior and that we are encouraging the kinds of good decisions that prevent unwanted pregnancies . ”
In the end , though , he said “ women in consultation with their pastors and their doctors and their family are in a better position to make these decisions than some bureaucrat in Washington . “
Sure , there are those who would disagree , and Obama said he respects their opinions -- “ but I certainly do n’t think it makes me less Christian . ”

February 01 , 2008 at 17:36 Tags Articles , Perl , Ruby
The goal of this article is to examine whether it 's worth for me to switch to Ruby as my main programming language , a position currently taken by Perl .
As the title states , it is subjective – in that it presents my personal opinions and targets my specific needs .
Introduction
First , some background .
For many years now , Perl is my main go - to guy for programming tasks .
As a hardware engineer , my " programming tasks " are not enterprise - level apps distributed for the use of thousands of customers , but rather support programs and scripts whose main customers are myself and my colleagues .
Sometimes these programs have GUIs , sometimes they 're even web - based , a lot of times they interact with other ( mainly C++ for performance ) programs , but most of them are scripts .
Whenever some script has to be written for text manipulation , or a simple program for controlling some piece of embedded hardware , I turn to Perl .
In size , these programs range from one - liners to several thousand lines of code ( KLOCs ) .
Also , I must add that my platform at the time being is 100 % MS Windows .
In my previous job , I worked on UNIXes ( Linux , AIX , Solaris ) , where Perl blends much better in the environment .
But now I have to work with what I 've got , and Windows is the platform .
This means that I use ActiveState as the Perl distribution and have a keen interest in GUIs .
I 'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to learn .
Around two years ago , I decided to give Ruby a try , since I began hearing more and more about how cool it is .
As I 'm constantly lurking in the Perl community , so what gave me the push was seeing how several Perl hackers whom I respect recommend Ruby as a good future direction .
Anyway , in my last attempt , after a brief flirtation Ruby I decided to go back to Perl , as I found Ruby still not mature enough to be my go - to guy , mainly because of the lack of documentation , suitable libraries and the much smaller community .
Today , I decided to examine Ruby again , by first publishing a thorough comparison between it and Perl , in order to help myself make a learned choice .
First things first – the language core
In my opinion , Ruby 's core is superior to Perl .
Not much to think of here .
And I 'm definitely not one to be called a " Perl basher " .
I like Perl , I like its syntax , I like programming in Perl .
But Ruby is better .
Ruby is everything Perl is , and more .
You can write any Perl code in Ruby , in a very similar way , but Ruby offers several definite improvements .
Here are a few I deem most important :
Object - orientation from the ground - up .
Personally , I feel that while OOP is not the silver bullet , it helps in keeping large bodies of code maintainable .
Writing OO code in Perl is painful , in Ruby a pleasure .
Convenient , built - in exception handling .
The support for functional features is better than in Perl .
Blocks , procs , lambdas , and all that .
I feel very grateful to Ruby for providing convenient means of replacing several of the things I previously thought require the power of Lisp macros .
Metaprogramming , better support for code generation and embedded DSLs .
So there 's no question here , at least for me .
Had everything else been equal , I would certainly pick Ruby .
Alas , things are never so simple .
Performance
According to the shootout , Ruby is 4 - 5 x slower than Perl on average .
This is not a major difference – I would n't use Perl for heavy number crunching anyway .
Besides , Ruby has an alternative virtual machine named YARV that should enter service any time now™ , and is expected to improve the performance by at least a few 10s of %s .
When you need high performance , you 'll have to resort to C/ C++ , and both Perl and Ruby have good bindings for these languages .
Documentation and libraries
I place these two together , because I think they 're very much related .
The sample people who spare the time to write useful modules , also write good documentation for their and others ' modules .
In this section , Perl wins big .
Perl 's library of code , the mighty CPAN , is incomparable .
Maybe Ruby is not far from Perl in popularity today , but this is a recent event .
For many years ,
Perl was more popular by orders of magnitude , and accumulated a huge library of shared knowledge .
Documentation in the Perl world is also better .
Funny , because I find the RDoc to be much better than POD .
Documenting Ruby code in a standard way is far simpler and more pleasant than with Perl – where embedding POD feels like programming in the 80s .
But yet again , Perl 's huge lead over a long time ensured that most of the libraries are quite well documented and there are tons of examples and snippets to be found online .
Ruby is catching up , but this will take time .
Just one example : XML handling .
Ruby 's canonical solution is REXML – a slow , unconvenient API with appalling error handling .
I was so disgusted by REXML when writing a Ruby app a year ago that I switched my data format to YAML .
Perl has numerous excellent solutions for XML parsing and generation , right in the standard distribution .
Rubyists ported XML :: Simple , but it 's based on REXML , which leaves it with all the deficiencies .
A disclaimer must be made here , which also applies to the " community " section .
I 'm concerned mainly with the English - speaking community .
For Perl , there is no other .
But for Ruby , there is .
Ruby is an immigrant from Japan , and has a large and vibrant Japanese community behind it .
It means that there are a lot of Ruby modules without any English documentation , which is a real pity .
Even if these modules are terrific , there 's no way for those of us who do n't understand Japanese to enjoy them .
Community
A community is extremely important in our connected age .
A large , smart community means quicker answers to questions , more libraries and documentation , and just a place to share wisdom and learn new tricks .
The Perl community is just amazing .
In football1 , it is often said that the home crowd is the team 's 12th player .
The Perl community is something like that .
Perlmonks is the best programming language community on the Internet , period .
Any question you have will be promptly answered by super - smart Perl hackers , some of whom seem to have little other interest in life than in providing detailed , well researched answers on Perlmonks .
It 's also one of the best places I know of to discuss general " meaning of life " questions in relation to programming , i.e. comparing paradigms , discussing future directions , and so on .
Ruby does n't have anything of the kind .
What it does have is a mailing list / forum / Google group2 .
When I tried Ruby the previous time , the situation was worse – the group was less active and the connection between the various channels was n't working well , creating fragmentation .
Now , however , things seem to be better .
The folks in the list are friendly and questions get answered quite quickly .
And still , Perl wins here .
Someone should really create a Rubymonks – I think it would give a great boost to the community .
Momentum and future directions
This issue is difficult to define exactly , and hence I will digress to a little philosophizing .
A metaphor might help .
Consider two employees .
One is 45 , very smart , been - there done - that kind of guy .
Everything he 's ever done , he can do again easily , quickly and soundly .
However , he 's reluctant to learn new technologies , and sometime hints that he might retire early .
Another is a whizzy 25 year - old .
He does n't have so much knowledge accumulated , but he 's an excellent hacker and can learn very quickly .
He 's eager to enter any new area and signals that he 'll stay in the company for a long time .
Lately , I feel that Perl is the old guy and Ruby the young guy .
I will try to defend my point :
Ruby seems to be having much more momentum behind it now than Perl .
New technologies are more likely to be implemented in Ruby than in Perl .
New books on programming are more likely to be written with Ruby than with Perl , and most importantly , fresh hackers are much more likely to join the world of Ruby than the world of Perl .
The last point is crucial .
Perl has several excellent people working with it , who are well known throughout the community .
The problem is , it 's pretty much the same people of years ago .
In Ruby , on the other hand , names of prolific and talented hackers constantly pop up – they push the language , with its libraries and community fast forward .
For example , take the Textile markup language3 .
It 's quite new , and it does n't surprise me that Ruby has a better library for translating it than Perl .
RedCloth , written by the amazingly prolific Ruby hacker _why supports Textile better than the best Perl library out there , and no one seems to be fixing the situation in the Perl world .
The same can be said for YAML – the parser for which was also written by _why , first for Ruby , and only later ported to Perl .
Take the bindings to Wx and Qt – the two most popular cross- platform native - looks GUI frameworks .
Ruby has the better bindings for both .
True , Perl 's integration with Tk is unrivaled in the Ruby world , but this only proves my point – Perl is excellent in everything old , but Ruby is quickly gaining in the newer technologies .
While for a GUI I 'd still use Perl / Tk , I 'm watching wxRuby , drooling at its pretty native widgets and controls .
I can only mention Ruby 's strongest card – the Rails framework , in passing , because I have never used it .
Take alternative implementations as another example .
Ruby has Rubinius , JRuby , IronRuby , Ruby .
NET , what does Perl have ?
JRuby and IronRuby are particularly interesting ventures , since they are backed by the enterprise .
JRuby 's developers were hired by Sun to create a natural binding to Java on the JVM , and IronRuby is being deveoped by , no less , Microsoft 's Dynamic Language Runtime team , to bind it to the .NET framework .
At last , the big two enterprise solutions – Java and .NET realized the importance of dynamic scripting languages , and did they choose Perl ?
No , they chose Ruby4 .
So why does this happen ?
Why is Perl stagnant while Ruby is stronly moving forward5 .
Is it only because Ruby 's core is better ?
Is it because of Rails ?
IMHO there 's another reason , and that is Perl 6 .
With it hovering around , no one really wants to improve Perl 5 any more .
Perl 5.5 was released one year after 5.4 , 5.6 was released 20 months after that , 5.8 took 28 months , 5.10 – more than 5 years .
Do you notice the tendency ?
Recall the old vs. new employee metaphor .
Is Perl 6 the reason for Perl 5's stagnation – I doubt it is , but it is definitely a factor .
Just how much motivation would you have working hard on somethinig you know will be thrown out soon .
And now imagine this soon lasts for years and years6 .
Conclusion
It 's about time to conclude this rant .
Which should I choose ?
Should I replace Perl as my go - to guy with Ruby ?
The answer to this question is still no , but this time with a reservation .
I enjoy writing Ruby code more than writing Perl code , at least until I ran into a piece of horrible documentation or a missing library which Perl has since 1995 .
But at the core , Ruby is better .
And while the core is practically impossible to change ( see how long Perl 6 is taking ) all the peripherials are easier .
In the past two years , Ruby has closed many gaps on Perl in terms of documentation , libraries and community .
I think that with the current trends continuing for another two or three years , Ruby will overtake Perl in popularity and will become an all around better solution .
1 Real football ( i.e. soccer in the US ) .
2 They 're all linked .
I use the Google Group interface because I find it the most convenient .
3 The one I 'm using for writing this article .
4 Well , there 's also Jython ( not backed by Sun , AFAIK ) and IronPython ( backed by MS ) .
But this article compares Perl and Ruby , which IMHO have a somewhat similar philosophy that is a bit different from Python .
5 According to the TIOBE index , Perl is currently at 5.4 % , down from 8 % 5 years ago , while Ruby is 2.3 % , up from 0.25 % 5 years ago .

Myanmar struggled Monday to recover from a cyclone that killed more than 3,900 people and perhaps as many as 15,000 .
Foreign Minister Noppadol Pattama of Thailand met with Myanmar 's ambassador on Tuesday , according to Reuters .
After the meeting , Mr. Noppadol said that 15,000 people had been killed and another 30,000 were missing .
If those numbers are accurate , the death toll would be the highest from a natural disaster in Asia since the tsunami of December 2004 , which devastated coastlines in South Asia and claimed 181,000 lives .
On Monday , three cabinet ministers told diplomats the death toll could reach 10,000 people in the delta region , an area that is home to nearly half of Myanmar ’s 48 million people , according to Richard Horsey , a spokesman for the United Nations disaster response office in Bangkok .

Bahrain Appoints Jewish Ambassador , Plans to Offer Full Citizenship Rights to Jewish Returnees

The Arab world has its first Jewish Envoy .
It 's a woman no less .
Thank the tiny state of Bahrain :
The selection of Houda Nonoo was made by decree on Wednesday and reported by local media in the Gulf Arab kingdom on Friday .
The decree , published by the official Bahraini News Agency , did not state which nation Nonoo would be appointed to but media reports have said that the US is her likely destination .
Nonoo , 43 , said she would undertake the role " first of all as a Bahraini " and that she was not chosen because of her religion .
Bahraini media had speculated over Nonoo 's selection for the past few months .
Nonoo , a businesswoman and mother of two children , has served as a legislator in Bahrain 's all - appointed 40 - member Shura Council for three years .
More on that at Al - Jazeera English , and if you follow the link , there is mention of a synagogue for the country 's 40 Jews .
There is also mention that Bahrain is planning on giving full citizenship rights to Jewish returnees .
The idea of " full - citizenship " in the Gulf states is an important one because these countries are extremely reluctant to let immigrants come in and acquire citizenship — kind of like Switzerland , but worse .
The fact that Jews who have presumably been gone for decades will be welcomed back as full citizens is a sign that Bahrain is open to recognizing the historical connection that Jews had to the land , which is interesting because even Muslims who do n't have a connection to the land can't just come in and become citizens .
I do not think that this in any way means a thawing of relationship with Israel , as last year Bahrain stripped one of its athletes of citizenship after he participated in a race in Israel .
There is , however , an attempt by the Arab states to begin engaging with Jews .
Kuwait is planning on building a " 1001 Tower " — yes , like the Arabian Nights — the top of which will house a mosque , synagogue and church .
Saudi Arabia 's ruler recently called for inter - faith dialogue inclusive of Jews which was welcomed by Israel 's Chief Rabbi .
Qatar , another tiny state , home of Al - Jazeera and Yusuf al - Qardawi , held another inter - faith meeting at which rabbis from Israel were present .
This piece of news comes at the heels of the grim article in the NYTimes about the last Jews in Babylon .

April 26 , 2008  --
One is a viral illness responsible for an estimated 35,000 deaths every year .
The other is a potentially deadly superbug , a horrifying legacy of antibiotic overuse that is now resistant to almost every treatment today 's doctors can throw at it .
Even on their own , infection with either influenza or methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) can lead to a grave situation .
But now , health officials are keeping an eye out for an even more harrowing threat -- simultaneous infection with both diseases .
And they say that , in children at least , these cases of co-incident infection appear to be on the rise .
So far , what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has learned about the potential link between flu and MRSA in young patients is disturbing .
According to an official health advisory issued Jan. 30 , between Oct. 1 , 2006 , and Sept. 30 , 2007 , the agency received a total of 73 reports of child deaths due to influenza .
In 22 of these cases , the children were also infected with some form of the staph bug , mostly MRSA .
This compares with only three such cases of co-infection during the same period in 2005 and 2006 , and just one such case identified in 2004 - 2005 .
And on Friday , the Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts health officials have linked MRSA to two recent deaths in children from the flu , renewing concerns over such a surge .
It is not the first time that viral and bacterial infections have gone hand - in - hand , notes Dr. Jonathan C. Weissler , chief of medicine at University of Texas Southwestern University Hospitals in Dallas .
" It is well known that community - acquired staph pneumonia is much more common in patients who have influenza , " he says .
" This has not changed . "
But when it does happen , the results can be disastrous .
Infectious disease experts say spikes in this kind of co-incidence of influenza and drug - resistant bugs have happened in the past , with devastating results even for many healthy individuals .
" The association of influenza viral infection disrupting the mucosa to permit secondary bacterial infection is not new , " says Dr. Jerome Klein , professor of pediatrics at Boston University School of Medicine .
" This is what happened in the influenza pandemic in 1957 , which was co-incident with a pandemic of multidrug resistant staphylococcal infections .
Not only were the elderly and immunocompromised prone to the combination , but otherwise healthy individuals were felled with substantial morbidity and mortality . "
" Thus , now when children -- and maybe adults also -- get influenza that is complicated by pneumonia , the bacterial cause of the pneumonia will likely be MRSA , " says Dr. William Schaffner , professor and chairman of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine .
" Thus , we have a new phenomenon that can cause serious , life - threatening disease and is more difficult to treat . "
Ganging Up on the Body's Defenses
Contracting both the flu and MRSA at the same time is far more than simple coincidence , scientists believe .
Rather , they suspect that the damage inflicted on the lungs and airways by the flu virus allows MRSA germs to sneak into vulnerable tissues and gain a foothold .
The timing of concerns over the links between flu and MRSA come at a time when pandemic fears are growing and reports of nonhospital superbug infections are on the rise .
" The public health groups in the state and the CDC are concerned about a confluence as ' the perfect storm , ' a virulent influenzal pandemic -- for example , bird flu , SARS or [ another viral illness ] occurring at the same time as the increasing incidence of MRSA , " says Klein .
Beating the Bugs
Schaffner says the key to heading off the dangerous partnership between influenza and MRSA is to go on the attack against the flu with increased vaccination rates .
It is a task that is easier said than done .
Schaffner notes that only about one - third of children actually receive the flu vaccine during a given season .
Part of the reason behind this low turnout could be the number of groups that actively discourage parents from having their children vaccinated against the flu .
These groups claim that these vaccines -- primarily , the forms of the vaccine that contain thimerosal -- are a primary cause of autism in children .
One group , known as SafeMinds , provides a printable brochure on its Web site titled " Help Spread the Word About the Flu Vaccine . "
The group encourages supporters to leave the brochure in their doctors ' offices and other locations .
On the other side of the vaccination equation , current CDC recommendations do little to bolster flu vaccination among kids , as they urge vaccination primarily of children 6 months to 5 years old , and others " if feasible . "
But this could change soon .
Schaffner says that by the 2008 - 2009 flu season , the agency will change its guidelines to recommend that everyone under the age of 19 receive the flu vaccine .
Additionally , he hopes that parents and pediatricians will take immunization recommendations more seriously as additional information about MRSA and influenza become public .
" This strengthens even more the rationale for vaccinating all children against influenza each year , " he says .
" If you prevent the initial influenza infection , you also prevent the dire complication of MRSA pneumonia .
Thus , vaccinating all children against influenza is a public health program with a double benefit -- what could be better than that ? "
Dr. Diane Kang contributed to this report .
1873 : Blue jeans assume their distinctive form when a patent is issued for the rivet process used to strengthen the pockets on what were then called " waist overalls . "
Jacob Youphes , a Latvian immigrant who changed his name to Jacob Davis ( .pdf ) after coming to the United States in 1854 , was working as a tailor in Reno , Nevada , when he hit on the idea of using copper rivets to reinforce denim working pants ( .pdf ) .
Since he obtained his denim from Levi Strauss & Co. in San Francisco , Davis approached Strauss with an offer to file for a joint patent .
Strauss – knowing a good thing when he saw it – accepted , and the modern " blue jean " was born .
Levi Strauss ( .pdf ) – himself an immigrant from Bavaria – arrived in San Francisco 20 years earlier , at the height of the California gold rush , to establish a wholesale dry - goods business .
From various locations along the San Francisco waterfront , Strauss sold clothing , fabrics and other sundries all over the West , including to miners headed for the gold fields .
The business flourished , but the real turning point in company fortunes came when Davis , a regular customer , approached Strauss with his proposal to form a partnership selling these button - fly , riveted pants , which commanded the then - princely sum of $ 3 a pair ( about 50 bucks in today 's moolah ) .
Davis ' decision to approach Strauss was a case of simple economics :
He did n't have the money to apply for a patent .
Nevertheless , it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
Blue jeans ( a misnomer , since the pants were made of denim and not the lighter cotton textile known as jean ) were an immediate success .
So impressed was Strauss that he brought Davis to San Francisco to establish and supervise a factory when the demand for blue jeans outstripped the ability of individual seamstresses to make them .
Davis remained at his post until his death in 1908 , having sold his interest in the patent to Levi Strauss & Co. the year before he died .

Media requires JavaScript to play .
US President George W Bush poked fun at his potential successors during his last White House Correspondents ' Association dinner .
The president said he was surprised they were not in the audience before making jokes at their expense .
Referring to Republican candidate John McCain 's absence , he said : " He probably wanted to distance himself from me . "
The annual dinner dates back to 1924 and is attended by media personalities , celebrities and politicians .
President Bush also put forward mock excuses on behalf of the Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Taking a jibe at controversies which have dogged their campaigns , he said : " Hillary Clinton could n't get in because of sniper fire and Senator Obama 's at church . "
He was referring to Mrs Clinton 's " mis-speak " when she erroneously claimed she faced sniper fire on a trip to Bosnia in the 1990s ; and Mr Obama 's pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright , who criticised America in fiery sermons .
The president admitted to being a " little wistful " at his final dinner , and video clips of his previous performances were broadcast .
He finished by conducting the US Marine band in a medley of patriotic marches .
Retirement plans
Mr Bush was followed by Craig Ferguson , host of US television 's the Late Late Show .
Scottish - born Mr Ferguson asked Mr Bush what he was planning to do after leaving office , suggesting : " You could look for a job with more vacation time . "
The president has been criticised for the amount of time he has spent away from the White House during his presidency .
Vice - President Dick Cheney , Mr Ferguson said , " is already moving out of his residence .
It takes longer than you think to pack up an entire dungeon " .
The White House Correspondents '
Association presented its annual awards during the dinner on Saturday in front of a crowd of VIPs , including author Salman Rushdie , singer Ashlee Simpson and actors Ben Affleck and Pamela Anderson .
Mr Bush 's appearance at the event continues a tradition begun by US President Calvin Coolidge in 1924 .
Note : Development of Mash has now moved to Hashie , a generic Hash toolkit .
There are a number of times when I need something like an OpenStruct with a little more power .
Often times this is for API - esque calls that do n’t merit a full on ActiveResource .
I wrote a small class for use with my ruby - github library and wanted to make it a separate gem because I think it ’s pretty useful to have around .
Usage
Basically a Mash is a Hash that acts a little more like a full - fledged object when it comes to the keyed values .
Using Ruby ’s method punctuation idioms , you can easily create pseudo - objects that store information in a clean , easy way .
At a basic level this just means writing and reading arbitrary attributes , like so :
author = Mash.new author.name # => nil author.name = " Michael Bleigh " author.name # => " Michael Bleigh " author.email = " michael@intridea.com " author.inspect # => < Mock name = " Michael Bleigh " email=" michael@intridea.com " > 1 author = Mash .

name # => nil author.name = " Michael Bleigh " author.name # => " Michael Bleigh " author.email = " michael@intridea.com " author.inspect # => < Mock name = " Michael Bleigh " email=" michael@intridea.com " >
So far that ’s pretty much how an OpenStruct behaves .
And , like an OpenStruct , you can pass in a hash and it will convert it .
Unlike an OpenStruct , however , Mash will recursively descend , converting Hashes into Mashes so you can assign multiple levels from a single source hash .
Take this as an example :
hash = { : author => {: name => " Michael Bleigh " , : email => " michael@intridea.com "} , : gems => [ { :name => " ruby - github " , :id => 1} , {: name => " mash " , :id => 2} ] } mash = Mash.new ( hash ) mash.author.name # => " Michael Bleigh " mash.gems.first.name # => " ruby - github " 1 hash = { : author =& gt ; { : name =& gt ; " Michael Bleigh " , : email =& gt ; " michael@intridea.com " } , : gems =& gt ; [ { : name =& gt ; " ruby - github " , : id =& gt ; 1 } , { : name =& gt ; " mash " , : id =& gt ; 2 } ] } mash =
Mash .
new ( hash ) mash .
author .
name # => " Michael Bleigh " mash.gems.first.name # => " ruby - github "
This can be really useful if you have just parsed out XML or JSON into a hash and just want to dump it into a richer format .
It ’s just that easy !
You can use the ?
operator at the end to check for whether or not an attribute has already been assigned :
mash = Mash.new mash.name ?
# => false mash .name = " Michael Bleigh " mash .name ?
# => true 1 mash = Mash .
new mash .
name ?
# => false mash .name = " Michael Bleigh " mash .name ?
# => true
A final , and a little more difficult to understand , method modifier is a bang (! ) at the end of the method .
This essentially forces the Mash to initialize that value as a Mash if it is n’t already initialized ( it will return the existing value if one does exist ) .
Using this method , you can set ‘ deep ’ values without the hassle of going through many lines of code .
Example :
mash = Mash.new mash.author!.name = " Michael Bleigh " mash.author.info!.url = " http://www.mbleigh.com/ " mash.inspect # => < Mash author= < Mash name = " Michael Bleigh " info= < Mash url= " http://www.mbleigh.com/ " >>> mash.author.info.url # => " http://www.mbleigh.com/ "
1 mash = Mash .
new mash .
author ! . name = " Michael Bleigh " mash .
author .
info ! . url = " http://www.mbleigh.com/ " mash .
inspect # => < Mash author= < Mash name = " Michael Bleigh " info= < Mash url= " http://www.mbleigh.com/ " >>> mash.author.info.url # => " http://www.mbleigh.com/ "
One final useful way to use the Mash library is by extending it !
Subclassing Mash can give you some nice easy ways to create simple record - like objects :
class Person < Mash def full_name " #{first_name} #{ " " if first_name ? & & last_name?}#{last_name} " end end bob = Person.new ( : first_name => " Bob " , : last_name => " Bobson " ) bob.full_name # => " Michael Bleigh " 1 class Person & lt ; Mash def full _ name " #{first_name} # { " " if first_name ? & & last_name?}#{last_name} " end end bob = Person .
new ( : first_name =& gt ; " Bob " , : last_name =& gt ; " Bobson " ) bob .
full_name # => " Michael Bleigh "
For advanced usage that I ’m not quite ready to tackle in a blog post , you can override assignment methods ( such as name= and this behavior will be picked up even when the Mash is being initialized by cloning a Hash .
Installation
It ’s available as a gem on Rubyforge , so your easiest method will be :
sudo gem install mash 1 sudo gem install mash
If you prefer to clone the GitHub source directly :
git clone git://github.com/mbleigh/mash.git 1 git clone git : //github.com/mbleigh/mash.git
This is all very simple but also very powerful .
I have a number of projects that will be getting some Mashes now that I ’ve written the library , and maybe you ’ll find a use for it as well .

LONDON ( AFP ) – More than two - thirds of Iraqis believe US - led coalition forces should leave , according to a poll conducted for British television ahead of the fifth anniversary of the Iraq invasion .
The ORB / Channel 4
News survey suggested that 70 percent thought multinational forces should withdraw .
Yet some 40 percent of the 4,000 people surveyed said they wanted the United States to play a bigger role in rebuilding Iraq and 36 percent wanted more British involvement .
Overall , the wide - ranging poll painted a mixed picture of Iraqi attitudes , contrasting their bleak daily existence with a surprisingly positive attitude about the future .
It threw up stark statistics on the human cost of war , which began on March 20 , 2003 , its effect on infrastructure and daily life , plus the bloody sectarian violence that erupted in the aftermath of the invasion .
A quarter of those surveyed said they had lost a family member to murder .
In Baghdad , that figure rose to nearly half ( 45 percent ) .
Some 81 percent had suffered power cuts and 43 percent had experienced drinking water shortages .
In the last month , more than a quarter ( 28 percent ) had been short of food .
Opinions varied on progress towards democracy .

Google is spearheading a volunteer workforce it hopes will become the centralized authority for responding to security issues in open source software .
oCERT , short for the open source computer emergency response team , will aim to remediate security vulnerabilities and exploits in a wide range of open source programs by coordinating communication among publishers .
According to Google 's security blog , the group " will strive to contact software authors with all security reports and aid in debugging and patching , especially in cases where the author , or the reporter , does n't have a background in security . "
Of course , the world is already awash in computer emergency response teams , begging the question : do we really need another one ?
Johannes Ullrich , CTO for SANS Internet Storm Center , says there could be some overlap with the current US CERT , but he also believes there 's room for a group that has a more extensive rolodex of players in the deeply splintered world of open source .
Imagine , if you will , a crucial update being made available in an open source program such as PHP or the GCC Compiler , which are sandwiched into countless other larger programs .
Right now , it 's sometimes difficult to reach trusted contacts at each of the myriad organizations that use these components .
" Putting some manpower behind that , I think , is helpful , " Ullrich says .
oCERT is also a good way for Google to give back to an open source community that sometimes feels it does n't get enough Google love .
The Googleplex thrives on customized versions of Linux and MySQL , many of the company 's desktops and laptops run a modified version of Ubuntu called Goobuntu and , of course , engineers are busy developing the open source Android for mobile devices .
Despite all the benefits , Google submits relatively few changes back into the ecosystem that spawned all these packages , since most licensing agreements generally do n't require derivatives to be published if they 're not being distributed .
Google 's blog post was sparse on details about when the oCERT would go live , who was running it and a contact for people interested in volunteering .
We 're hoping this is n't the open source equivalent of vaporware .
Update
OK , after that last paragraph , it 's fair to say we have egg on our face .
We failed to spy this link in the Google post that seems to establish that oCERT is already up and running and , indeed has already issued four advisories .
Our thanks to Andrea Barisani , for setting us straight . ®
Some of the issues that Republicans are beginning to raise paint a picture of what the fall election strategy against Mr. Obama might look like .
Some are traditional , using Mr. Obama ’s support for withdrawing the troops from Iraq to portray him as weak on national security and his opposition to suspending the federal gas tax this summer to show him as a tax - and - spend Democrat .
A rotating banner at the top of the Republican Party home page asks , “ Why does Barack Obama want to increase taxes again and drive up the cost of gasoline on Americans ? ”
It also ties him to the liberal group MoveOn.org , and features an advertisement called “ Barack Obama ’s Gas Tax Hypocrisy , ” noting that while he now opposes suspending the gas tax , he once supported a similar measure when he was an Illinois lawmaker .
“ Barack Obama just does n’t get it , ” a narrator intones .
“ Does he understand our economy , and what American families and businesses need ?
Barack Obama .
Out of touch .
Not ready to be president . ”
Another line of attack seems to be squarely directed at independent and swing voters , whom both the McCain and Obama campaigns have been courting .
The McCain campaign has argued that Mr. Obama lacks a record of bipartisan achievement to back up his calls for healing partisan rifts in Washington and getting things done .
That issue was underscored this week when , in a speech on the judiciary , Mr. McCain contrasted his own willingness to vote for President Bill Clinton ’s judicial nominees with Mr. Obama ’s votes against President Bush ’s judicial nominees , including Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.

“ Senator Obama in particular likes to talk up his background as a lecturer on law , and also as someone who can work across the aisle to get things done , ” Mr. McCain said .
“ But when Judge Roberts was nominated , it seemed to bring out more the lecturer in Senator Obama than it did the guy who can get things done .
He went right along with the partisan crowd , and was among the 22 senators to vote against this highly qualified nominee . ”
No one churns out the healings like Benny Hinn .
His This Is Your Day ! show is one of the most - watched Christian TV programs , with viewers in 190 countries .
In the US , it runs on paid - for air time more than 200 times a week on 80 stations .
It is translated into Spanish , Romanian , Norwegian , Italian , Hindi and Tamil .
No one knows how much Hinn makes personally .
In 1997 he said it was somewhere between $ US500,000 and a million .
More recently some documents stolen from his rubbish pointed to a salary close to $ US2 million .
His lawyers deny this .
The " parsonage " built for him cost $ US3.5 million .
It has seven bedrooms , eight baths , a view of the Pacific and room for 10 cars including the odd BMW and his favourite Mercedes - Benz G500 .
Last November the US Senate Committee on Finance asked for audited financial statements .
It wanted detailed explanations of all compensation to Hinn , housing allowances , clothing , jewellery , personal grooming , loans , credit card statements , and a list of all vehicles and aircraft , including a $ US36 million Gulfstream jet that Hinn no doubt used to fly to Australia .
Hinn is outraged by these demands and sees the hand of Satan behind them .
He claims to have prayed to the Lord repeatedly : " Before I injure Your name , take me out .
Before I harm Your kingdom , kill me . "
We arrived at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre two hours early .
Already a press of people was streaming out of the car parks , many like Toohey in wheelchairs .
The air buzzed with expectancy .
Some walked past offering encouragements .
An elderly woman put her hand on Toohey 's shoulder and said : " I have faith that the Lord will be here for you tonight .
Do you ? "
Toohey replied : " Yes I do . "
We followed the signs to the " wheelchair entrance " , which took us directly to the floor of the centre and our place with the sick , behind 15 rows for VIPs .
Next to us was a young man with his profoundly retarded son of three or four years .
His boy showed no reaction to the world around him .
With infinite and loving patience this young father tended his son , rarely taking his eyes off him , adjusting his bed in the stroller , lifting and cuddling him , putting in a dummy , offering a bottle of juice .
This was a life without respite for him .
Behind us a man struggled to assemble a camp bed .
Since 2.30 that afternoon he had been working to get his friend to the centre .
It was a painful sight .
His friend in a wheelchair was desperately sick .
He was dishevelled and dirty .
He had on wide - legged shorts displaying pathetically thin legs .
A colostomy bag balanced on his lap .
An inflatable mattress was produced and after an agonising effort it was in place .
He was laid on it and his friend tenderly put a pillow under his head and laid a coat over him .
Within minutes he was asleep and did n't wake until it was time to go home .
Hinn brings a large group of operators with him , veterans of a hundred events like this .
A Brisbane crowd of 8000 is small stuff .
They have meetings of more than a million in Kenya , Latin America and Indonesia .
A couple of men I recognised from Hinn 's TV show cruised the rows of the sick like sharks , looking for prospects for healing .
They were not interested in the profoundly ill .
The man and his boy , the poor fellow asleep on his bed , were of no use to Pastor Benny .
One of them saw Toohey and came over , sleek expensive suit , suntanned face shining , reeking of expensive perfume .
" What happened , brother ? " he asked .
We had rehearsed this answer .
It was osteoarthritis with an infection in the synovial tissue which had deteriorated to the point that he had been confined to the chair for five years .
Toohey began : " It was while I was rock climbing … I fell off a mountain . "
He laughed nervously .
The Hinn man laughed with him , but I was worried .
I said : " This man has n't walked for five years .
That 's why I brought him tonight . "
He looked at me : " Who are you ? "
" We 're brothers , where ever he goes I go … " He seemed reassured and bent over Toohey and put his mouth beside his ear and whispered .
Toohey nodded and bent his head .
I put my hand on Toohey 's shoulder and also bent my head .
For two minutes we were locked together in prayer .
Toohey shifted in his chair , and began tentatively straining his left leg .
The man stood up : " Do you feel anything ? "
Toohey stared at his leg : " I feel a sort of tingling ? "
The man smiled and moved back : " Brother , the Lord is going to heal you tonight … praise God … praise God . "
Toohey nodded and muttered : " Praise God . "
Hinn preached a sermon straight out of Elmer Gantry - 1950s hellfire and damnation from fundamentalist Southern American Protestant Christianity .
Several hundred people surged to the front to pray the sinner 's prayer and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as saviour .
They were given a booklet by Pastor Benny and an invitation to attend a list of churches that sponsored the crusade .
Then Hinn moved to money .
For 20 minutes he cajoled , prophesied , pleaded , shouted and demanded .
This is the engine room of the crusade .
No one does this better than Hinn .
His white Nehru suit glistened like a halo in the spotlight .
He moved urgently around the stage .
" I 'm going to tell you something .
This is a prophecy .
You are about to see the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of the world .
You are going to see prosperity like you never dreamed of .
Money is being transferred from sinners to the righteous . "
His voice boomed out : " Are you righteous ? " " Yes , " we cried .
" Are you righteous ? " " Yes , " we cried a little louder .
" This is money you never dreamed of .
Are you righteous ? "
" Yes , " we thundered .
Hinn believes the great cosmic drama of the end of the world is around the corner .
Because of these unusual times , when evil will abound and God will call forth extraordinary men to great things , special things are in store .
God gives money to people who use it to preach the Gospel and show the world how wonderful it is to be a prosperous Christian .
Just as the children of Israel plundered the gold of the Egyptians when they were led out by Moses , the righteous with the right faith in God will plunder the wealth of this world 's sinners .
That was money argument one .
Argument two : " The Jews were taught by God how to give .
When they brought their gifts to the Lord , it was only the best .
We have lost the gift of giving .
God deserves the best .
You give God the best and you 'll get the best from him .
Are you here for God 's blessing ?
What are you going to give the Lord tonight ? "
Money argument three is used universally in charismatic churches around Australia .
It is called " sowing the seed " .
God rewards those who sow seeds of faith .
As a grain of wheat is sown in the ground and comes up multiplied by 10 , even by 100 .
" God will multiply your gift to him .
You give him a little he will multiply a little . "
The close : " The Lord is going to speak to you tonight .
He is not asking you to give to Benny Hinn .
This is a gift to the Lord .
To some of you he will say $ 1000 , to others $ 2000 or $ 5000 , to some it may be $ 10,000 .
Do n't turn your back on the Lord … "
With a 250 - voice choir singing about the joys of faith , and Hinn warning us not to miss the opportunity , the envelopes were distributed around the centre .
Visa , MasterCard or bank account details .
He is not interested in $ 20 and $ 50 notes .
Cash is small time .
He needs big licks to keep his machine going .
I have no idea how much he was collecting that night , but I cannot see how it would be worth it for him to come to Australia without clearing $ 200,000 a night .
One report said his three Brisbane shows raised about $ 800,000 .
Then came the healing time .
Hinn gave us another 15 - minute talk about the healing power of Jesus .
His argument went like this : Jesus healed people in the Gospels .
Jesus is alive today and Jesus is the same yesterday , today and forever .
So he is healing today .
" I do n't care what your pastor says .
I do n't care what your doctor says .
I can tell you what the Bible says .
Jesus is here tonight and is waiting to heal you .
DO YOU HAVE THE FAITH ? "
Toohey struggled out of the chair and unsteadily took the handles at the back and began to move forward .
I whispered : " We 've got to get down the side to the front . "
We found ourselves in a strange melee of people , a sad crowd urging towards the stage .
If you made it , Hinn would slay you in the spirit : the final confirmation of divine intervention .
Toohey and I were stopped by a large Pacific Islander , who said kindly : " You need to stay back there . "
He was pointing to white tape on the floor .
Why were we stopped when others were moving over ?
Then I overheard one of the Hinn veterans speak to another volunteer : " I told you .
No one over here who is not 100 per cent healed .
Do n't just point … move them out . "
I whispered to Toohey : " We 've got to lose the chair . "
In a couple of minutes we were in with the 100 per centers .
The Hinn man grabbed Toohey and pulled him into the open .
He put his arm behind him and pushed : " Come on brother , praise the Lord , come on . "
Toohey responded until he was almost running .
The man stopped and put him at the front of the line .
He directed a volunteer to get the wheelchair and park it at the bottom of the stage .
I took my place beside Toohey and waited .
By this stage he had perfected a stunned wide - eyed look , and was holding his hands in the air .
I whispered : " Have you got a follow - up question if you get the chance ? "
He said : " Yes , the one about Jesus . "
We had in mind : " Pastor Benny , why do you live in a multimillion - dollar house and drive around in a Mercedes when Jesus lived like a poor person ? "
Over the next 15 minutes people struggled over the 100 per cent line and joined us along the wall .
Suddenly , a huge black security guard came over and said : " You 're up first . "
He looked at me : " You can go up with him . "
We were herded to the stairs and started up .
I looked at Toohey and something worried me .
I grabbed him hard on the arm and whispered : " Do n't you bloody fall over , Toohey . "
We burst into the dazzling light and there was Pastor Benny .
Up close he looked soft , almost feminine .
His skin is smooth but flabby .
His hands were small and the nails were highly manicured and polished .
He walked towards Toohey and asked : " What has the Lord done for you ? "
Toohey began muttering about falling off a mountain again .
Hinn looked annoyed : " What has happened ? "
Toohey returned to his story about the mountain .
I was muttering to myself : " The question , the bloody question . "
Hinn reached out and with thumb and first finger pushed on Toohey 's neck .
The minders behind him reached forward and pulled him back , and Toohey collapsed .
Hinn moved up stage to reveal a more obvious miracle of healing .
Toohey was dragged to his feet and we left the stage , collected the chair and returned silently to our seat .
So what happened ?
Hinn and his handlers are seasoned professionals at the miracle game .
Toohey was too contained .
They needed the trembling ecstasy of a person overwhelmed by spiritual power .
So in a second they had him on his back .
Could it be that my scepticism blinded me to the possibility that God was in that place ?
Were we mocking God 's work and , despite the excesses , Hinn is an instrument of healing ?
It is possible that a very few were healed ?
But I say that is despite Hinn .
I judge him by the measure of the one he claims to be following .
Jesus never promised people wealth , or instant healing .
He did n't promise his disciples houses on the coast .
Pastor Benny has recast Jesus in his own image .
He has forgotten that his Lord died , humiliated , tortured , alone and penniless .
But how do you sell that ?

Legislation aims to jack soldiers ' ' off time ' reading materials Nick Langewis
Published : Saturday April 26 , 2008

Print This Email This " Pro-family " organizations and members of Congress are continuing the push to limit the range of reading materials available to members of the military .
House Rep. Paul Broun ( GA - 10 ) , with 15 co-sponsors and the support of organizations such as the Alliance Defense Fund and the American Family Association , recently introduced a bill that would strengthen the ban on sales of adult - themed publications on U.S. military installations .
While the National Defense Authorization
Act of 1997 bans the sale of " sexually explicit material " on property under Department of Defense jurisdiction , the Pentagon does n't consider certain items explicit enough to take off of base store shelves ; a certain percentage of a film or magazine 's content would have to be considered " sexually explicit " for sale or rental to be barred .
Rep. Broun has introduced H.R. 5821 , also known as the Military Honor and Decency Act , which would close what he calls a loophole that allows the continued distribution of pornography to soldiers , to their moral detriment , with the help of taxpayer funds .
" As a Marine , I am deeply concerned for the welfare of our troops and their mission , " Broun said on April 17 .
" Allowing the sale of pornography on military bases has harmed military men and women by : escalating the number of violent , sexual crimes ; feeding a base addiction ; eroding the family as the primary building block of society ; and denigrating the moral standing of our troops both here and abroad .
Our troops should not see their honor sullied so that the moguls behind magazines like Playboy and Penthouse can profit .
The  Military Honor and Decency Act will right a bureaucratic -- and moral -- wrong . "
" We 're asking these people to risk their lives to defend our Constitution 's principles , " said law school professor and ACLU head Nadine Strossen to USA Today last November , " and they 're being denied their own First Amendment rights to choose what they read . "
" Let me get this straight , " The Carpetbagger Report 's Steve Benen added .
" U.S. troops are fighting two wars , neither of which are going well , and the American Family Associations biggest concern is what kind of magazines the troops can purchase on base ?
" Heres a radical idea : maybe those who wear the uniform and put their lives on the line for their country should be able to read whatever they want . "

A current phenomenon in hiking trips is the availability of hiking trails really close to urban centers .
Lots of cities have a big push to bring hiking and other recreational opportunities closer to where people live .
For many city - dwellers , a stroll through a nearby park will do just fine .
But for those who have discovered the well - earned pleasures of climbing mountains , crossing rivers , traversing canyons , hopping boulders and dodging bears , en route to a particularly spectacular view or awe - inspiring natural wonder , hiking adventure counts as a sacred pastime [ Tips for hiking ] .
And the journey is every bit as important as the destination .
According to the Outdoor Industry Association , more than 29 million Americans day - hiked in 2006 ; that ’s nearly 11 percent of population .
The following hiking trails will satisfy any hiker who appreciates the physical , mental and spiritual benefits of a challenging trail .
Mt. Katahdin , Baxter State Park , Maine
Baxter State Park , a wilderness and forest area of 209,501 acres , has 10 campgrounds , located throughout the Park and available for camping from May 15 - October 15 .
There are 46 mountain peaks and ridges , 18 of which exceed an elevation of 3,000 feet , the highest being Baxter Peak at 5,267 feet .
The views are nothing short of spectacular .
Hike in September and October to gaze at brilliant fall foliage .
Coyote Gulch , Escalante Subdistrict , Glen Canyon National Recreation Area , Utah
Glen Canyon National Recreation Area offers unparalleled opportunities for water - based and backcountry recreation in & around Lake Powell .
Glen Canyon stretches for hundreds of miles from Page , AZ up to the Moab area near Canyonlands National Park .
Hike 8.4 miles into an ecological orgy where the reservoir once ruled and now slot canyons open with new energy .
Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary , Naples , Florida
( Photo by ~ sage ~ )
A 2.25 - mile raised boardwalk takes visitors through several distinct habitats found within the 11,000 - acre Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary , including the largest remaining virgin bald cypress forest in North America .
There is tons of wildlife here to see so enjoy !
Grayson Highlands State Park , Virginia
With elevations up to 5,089 feet , Grayson Highlands is the loftiest state park in Virginia .
From the Pinnacles , Grayson Highlands ’ highest point , you ’ll find breathtaking views of surrounding mountains , including Mount Rogers ( 5,729 feet ) , the tallest peak in Virginia .
The park has nine hiking trails averaging a mile in length .
These trails lead to panoramic vistas , scenic waterfalls and a 200 year old pioneer cabin .
The park also offers access to the Appalachian Trail and trails in the surrounding Jefferson National Forest .
Lost Coast , King Range National Conservation Area , Northern California
A spectacular meeting of land and sea is certainly the dominant feature of the King Range National Conservation Area .
The King Range contains over 70 miles of hiking trails spanning from the beach to the highest peaks .
Most of the upland trails are strenuous due to the steep rugged nature of the area .
From scrambling along wet beach rocks while fighting pelting wind and rain , to climbing , descending , then re-climbing a cumulative 8,000 feet , the daunting 25 - mile north Lost Coast Trail will motivate any hiker .
Maroon Bells Snowmass Wilderness , White River National Forest , Colorado
The 181,000 acres of Maroon Bells comprise Colorado ’s fourth - largest wilderness area and include more than 100 miles of trails and six peaks over 14,000 feet .
These mountain peaks , two of the most photographed in North America .
Valleys in the Maroon Bells–Snowmass Wilderness offer an exhilarating mix of aspen groves , flower - speckled meadows , and dark forests of spruce and fir .
Mount St. Helens , Washington
There are many trails in Mount Saint Helens National Volcanic Monument ; leading hikers into a variety of diverse landscapes .
Crater views , new lakes , ancient lava flows , blown down trees , mud flows and old - growth forest can all be discovered here .
Trails vary in difficulty from short , accessible interpretive loops to longer , steep narrow trails that challenge even experienced hikers .
Have fun exploring places like Lava Canyon , the Plains of Abraham , Spirit Lake , Ape Caves , Johnson Ridge , and the Loowit Trail which goes all the way around Mt. St. Helens on 34 miles of backpacking trails .
Na Pali Coast State Wilderness Park , Kauai , Hawaii
The Na Pali Coast is a very special place .
The pali , or cliffs , provide a rugged grandeur of deep , narrow valleys ending abruptly at the sea .
Waterfalls and swift ﬂowing streams continue to cut these narrow valleys while the sea carves cliffs at their mouths .
It has 45 miles of trails that can take hikers deep into the park ’s rain forests or take them out to the precipitous ridgelines above Waimea Canyon and the Na Pali Coast .
Wrangell St Elias National Park , Kennecott District , Alaska
Yearning to go even deeper into the wild ?
Wrangell - St. Elias National Park is the largest in the United States – by far .
One frequently quoted statistic is that it ’s 6 times the size of Yellowstone National Park .
Giant glaciers , abandoned mining sites , icy rivers , waterfalls , spectacular mountain vistas , grizzly bears , 9 of the 16 highest U.S. peaks , and maybe even some auroral displays await .
These hikes range from short nature walks of less than a mile , to strenuous , all - day adventures .
Most hikes begin from trail heads on the McCarthy or Nabesna Roads or else from the towns of McCarthy and Kennicott .
Half Dome , Yosemite National Park , California
This is one of the most popular , but strenuous day hiking trail in Yosemite .
The first four miles the trail climbs out of Yosemite Valley and up past Vernal and Nevada Falls towards Little Yosemite Valley Campground .
There are a few different routes to choose from and both will provide stunning views of waterfalls and spectacular views from Yosemite ’s most famous landmark .
Water is fairly plentiful along the trail , with the last source being a spring along the trail , 1.5 miles from Half Dome .

Israel and Syria remain technically at war over the Golan Heights Israel and Syria have said they are holding indirect talks to reach a comprehensive peace agreement .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's office said both sides were talking " in good faith and openly " .
The Syrian foreign ministry also confirmed the Turkish - mediated talks , the first since 2000 .
The last round of negotiations broke down because of disagreement over the extent of Israel 's possible withdrawal from the Golan Heights .
Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war .
The two countries are still technically at war .
It was reported in April that Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was mediating in talks between the two sides .
New momentum
In a statement , Syria 's foreign ministry said both sides had " expressed their desire to conduct the talks in goodwill and decided to continue dialogue with seriousness to achieve comprehensive peace " .
Push for Israel - Syria peace Golan Heights facts Mr Olmert 's spokesman Mark Regev said the two countries had indicated " they want to lead these negotiations in a serious spirit so as to achieve complete peace " .
The Syrian foreign minister , Walid Muallem , said Israel had agreed to withdraw from the Golan up to the armistice line of 1967 .
Israel has refused to comment on the claim , although a spokesman for Mr Olmert said the current talks were being carried out with the failure of the previous ones in mind , and that the talks had recently gathered momentum .
The US and the EU have welcomed news of the talks , and both have praised Turkey 's role as facilitator .
Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said he hoped the two parties " will reach a peaceful solution " .
Analysts suggest that , in return for any withdrawal , Israel would demand Syria sever its ties with Iran and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon .
However , they add that withdrawal from the Golan would not be popular with Israelis .
The reports of talks in April sparked outrage in the Israeli parliament , where several MPs said they would try to accelerate the passage of a bill requiring any withdrawal from the Golan to be backed by a referendum .
Mr Olmert is currently battling corruption allegations , and the BBC's Katya Adler in Jerusalem says the prime minister 's critics believe the confirmation of peace talks may be an attempt to divert some attention from that .

What are these ?
No Veep Slot for Hillary
It would be an act of terminal insanity for Barack Obama to name Hillary Clinton as his vice presidential candidate .
It would not help him get elected , it would drag all the Clinton controversies into the general election , and having her down the hall in the West Wing would be a recipe for disaster , dissension and civil war .
Other than that , it 's a hell of an idea !
Start with the election .
There are two kinds of people who backed Hillary in the primaries : her original supporters and those who joined her later in the game .
Her original backers are all solid Democrats whose arms would fall off before they would back anyone who is pro-life .
They are true believers , feminists , pro-choice advocates , older party loyalists who would prefer Hillary , may have doubts about Obama , but will always fall in line and vote Democratic .
The more recent converts are people who are turned off by Obama 's connection to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and who worry that he might be a closet black radical .
Their latent racial fears were heightened by the revelations about Obama 's links with Wright , and they voted for Hillary as the lesser of two evils .
Putting Mrs. Clinton on the ticket will do nothing to assuage these fears .
One wonders if these blue - collar , downscale , racially motivated voters would actually support Hillary against John McCain if she were to win the nomination .
They certainly would n't follow her into Obama 's camp just because she was on the ticket .
Obama 's key need in the election is to demonstrate his experience and ability to do the job despite only minimal federal experience .
Running with someone whose experience he , himself , derided will hardly solve this problem .
Voters only credit Hillary with having experience when her record is compared with Obama 's almost total lack of a record .
Against McCain , she would do nothing to close the experience gap .
Better for Obama to choose a senator with long tenure -- a Chris Dodd ( Conn. ) or Joseph Biden ( Del. ) -- just as Dukakis chose Bentsen , Bush chose Cheney , and Kennedy chose Johnson .
If Obama put Hillary on the ticket , it would re-raise all of the questions about Bill 's income sources , what he did for Dubai , what he did for Frank Guistra -- the Canadian mining executive who gave millions to the Clinton library and whom Bill introduced to the president of Kazakhstan -- and whether he will make public his library donors .
Who needs those issues , especially when Obama is trying to wage an anti-Washington - influence - peddling campaign ?
Finally , having Hillary in the West Wing would be a nightmare .
There is no way that Obama could trust her .
She would be a throwback to the old days when the president did not consult the vice president on anything , a situation which led Vice President John Nance Garner , FDR 's VP during his first two terms , to call the office " not worth a pitcher of warm piss . "
If Obama got into trouble , he would have to look over his shoulder at Hillary and he would always have both Bill and Hillary around to show him up , hog the limelight , generate controversy with ill - considered remarks , and make life difficult .
Would Bill stop giving speeches and making money ?
Would his ties with Arab nations and questionable American and Canadian businessmen end ?
Or would Obama have to explain his VP 's husband 's business dealings over and over again .
And , the ultimate question : Can Bill Clinton be put back into the bottle ?
Is this recent spate of angry , finger - wagging bursts of inappropriate outrage a permanent fixture of his public persona ?
Does Obama want to take the risk of having him on the team and having to account for his conduct ?
Hillary would add no votes to Obama , she would dog his campaign with scandal , she would be disloyal in office , and her husband would be , at best , a huge distraction .
Case closed .
The Japanese Rush Hour Train Experience
In Japan , millions of people rely on the subway to get to work since the trains always run on time .
The number of people that ride them during rush hour is incredible , and the crowd is heaviest in the mornings .
To make things work , riders waste no time getting aboard , they fill the cars to capacity and even a little bit more .
It ’s the â€œlittle bit moreâ€ that could cause problems .
If the doors ca n’t close , the train ca n’t leave on time .
To ensure the cars are full and the doors are closed , uniformed attendants cram the last few riders into the cars .
Think about an overstuffed suitcase you have to sit on to close and you ’re just about ready to be a subway attendant .

What is an " animated photograph " ?
Photoshopped ?
I am simulataneously attracted by this , and repelled .
I think the images are as fake as my first GFs boobs .
( we were 11 and they were tissues ) .
Cable giant Comcast was the victim of a DNS hijacking beginning late Wednesday and into early Thursday , in which its internet homepage , Comcast.net , was redirected to a page boasting of the attack .
Hackers " Defiant " and " EBK " – members of the hacker group Kryogeniks – claimed credit for the stunt , which blocked Comcast customers from the company 's webmail service .
While the attack could theoretically have been used to trap passwords or intercept e-mail , a spokesman for the Philadelphia - based cable concern said there was " no evidence " that it was anything but a defacement .
Most of Comcast 's 14 million customers are now able to access their webmail accounts from the homepage , which had read :
KRYOGENIKS
Defiant and EBK RoXed Comcast sHouTz to VIRUS Warlock elul21 coll1er seven
The shout out to " Virus " refers to another Kryogeniks member , 18 - year - old Mike Nieves , who was charged as a minor last year for a hacking spree at AOL .
Defiant and EBK apparently acquired the username and password for Comcast 's domain management account with Network Solutions , the cable company 's registrar .
Using that , they changed Comcast 's server settings .
There was no broad penetration of Network Solutions , said a spokeswoman for the Herndon , Virginia - based registrar , which has some seven million domains .
" Somebody was able to log into the account using the username and password .
It was an unauthorized access , " said spokeswoman Susan Wade .
" It was n't like somebody hacked into it .
The Network Solutions account was not hacked . "
But it was unclear how the hijackers obtained the user name and password to redirect to servers in Germany .
Wade did n't rule out the possibility that Network Solutions may have released the information in a social engineering attack .
" They ping us and say this is my domain and say , ' I 'd like to reset my password , ' " Wade said .
" It could have been compromised through e-mail .
They could have gotten it if they acted as the customer .
We 're not clear . "
Wade added that , " Somebody could have come in and requested it .
All of the authorizations checked out . "
Wade said engineers were working to find the location of the online account that accessed Network Solutions to change Comcast 's settings .
For its part , Comcast said it was working with law enforcement authorities in a bid to find out how the security breach occurred .
" We are doing all kinds of forensic analysis of the records to see what exactly happened , " said Charlie Douglas , a Comcast spokesman .
" Somebody logged into the account at Network Solutions and made alterations to our settings and account information and redirected Comcast . net to another site .
Whoever did it was not authorized to do that . "

How to Take Beautiful Photos of Your Kids
I ’ve been asked by parents of children to photograph their birthday parties numerous occasions and each time it has been a lot of fun .
Photographing children is n’t always easy – and photographing ‘ the birthday party ’ presents it ’s own unique opportunities and challenges as a photographer .
Birthday Parties present us with a lot of emotion , interaction , color and energy in a child ’s party – the highs and a few lows of life are all present .
On the challenging side of things – children ’s parties can be chaotic places with moving subjects , lots of clutter and often little time for those organizing them to pick up a camera and take a shot .
Here are a few tips on Photographing Children ’s Parties that come to mind :
1. Designate a Party Photographer
There ’s nothing worse than getting to the end of a party and realizing that while the camera was out that no one bothered ( or had time ) to pick it up and take some shots .
Give someone the job and release that person from other party duties to just take photos .
This way you ’re guaranteed to get some shots and will have something to remember the day with .
It is also good because it means others are able to relax and enjoy the party and that parents can rest assured that the photos will only be used responsibly .

2. Get a Child ’s Perspective
One of the most important tips I can share is to get down low when taking photos of children .
The biggest mistake I see in party photos is adults taking shots from a standing position looking down onto a scene .
While you might take a few shots from this perspective the majority of your photos should be taken at eye level of the subjects you ’re shooting .
3. Mix up Your Shooting Angles and Focal Lengths
Having said this – it can inject a lot of life into party shots if you do mix up your shooting angles and focal lengths at a party .
Try some shots from standing up high ( get on a chair even to accentuate it – this can be great for group shots ) but also get down really low and shoot looking up at kids .
Also try a range of focal lengths ranging from wide angle shots that take in the whole party scene through to zoomed shots of kids and party elements .
Mixing it up like this will mean you end up with a more dynamic and playful series of shots at the end of the day .
4. Adjust White Balance Settings
Most children ’s birthday parties happen inside ( at least in part ) where lighting can be tricky .
In most cases there will be some artificial light which can leave your photos with different types of tinges .
The easiest way to overcome this and ensure your shots are true in color is to learn to use your white balance controls .
This is the subject for another post but most modern digital cameras have a variety of automatic settings that will give you some easy settings for different lighting situations .
Before the party experiment with white balance and get your setting right .
Keep in mind that there are some moments in a party where you do want the temperature of your light to be nice and warm !
5. Look for the Party Details
Another way to add interest to the shots is to focus in on the details of the party .
I find that many of these shots are best taken before the guests arrive and might include shots of the cake , photos of balloons and other decorations , photos of presents stacked , shots of a set party table .
Often it ’s good to get in nice and close to these elements – fill the frame with them ( to the point where they even become a little abstract ) .
You ’ll find that these types of shots look great scattered through an album between shots of people .
6. Use Bounce Flash or a Diffuser
You ’ll probably need some sort of extra lighting if your party is inside .
You can help to eliminate the need for this by increasing your ISO setting a little but unless you have a lot of natural light or an extremely fast lens you ’ll probably need to use a flash .
If you have a flash hot - shoe you ’ll probably get the best results if you bounce the flash off the room or walls or if you use a flash diffuser of some kind so that the flash is not as harsh on your subjects ( a common problem with many party photos ) .
Take things to a whole new level by setting up a photo booth or area that you ’ve lit with some studio lights for some fun portraits .
7. Know the Party Plan
In order to capture all of the important moments in the party you should know how it is planned to run .
Know when everyone will be sitting down , when the blowing out of candles will happen , when presents will be opened etc .
This will mean you can be well positioned for each event just ahead of them happening .
8. Shoot Candidly
Most of your party photos will end up being candid ones of children and adults interacting with one another around the different party activities .
I ’ve written on candid photography previously but you ’ll probably want to take a couple of types of candid photos during the party .
I tend to take quite a few shots from the edge of the party using a longer zoom lens .
These shots are largely of kids interacting with each other , playing , eating etc .
The other thing to do as the party ‘ warms up ’ is to actually get into the party and shoot from within it .
In these instances you will find a wide angle lens more appropriate and you actually join in the circle of activity ( ie sit with the kids , play the games , eat the food ) and photograph the children as you do this .
At times it might even be appropriate to make taking the photos a game of sorts – getting them to pose and then show them the results on your LCD .
9 . Shoot out of Relationship
Photographing from ‘ within ’ the party is fun but it does n’t just happen straight away with many children .
I find that the best shots come as the children warm up to you and their surrounds .
So make an effort to meet the children as they come into the party and to be friendly and fun .
This might even mean putting your camera away for a little towards the start of proceedings .
Also in this I ’d highly recommend that you need to be aware of personal boundaries when photographing children .
Unfortunately we live in a time where the topic of photographing kids is something that makes many of us think about ways that doing so can be misused and abused .
Always get permission of the parents hosting the party before photographing proceedings , always stay with the main group and do n’t get into one to one shooting situations , be aware of giving those you ’re photographing personal space and being appropriate .
10 . Planned Shots
While the majority of your shots will probably be candid shots you should also think ahead about what type of ‘ must have ’ sort of shots you want from the party .
Consult with parents ( if you ’re not one of them ) about what type of shots they want .
These might include some group shots , cake shots , blowing out candles , opening presents , party games or even some posed shots of the birthday boy or girl etc
11 . Take Before and After Shots of the Party
It ’s amazing to see how a room ( and people ) can be transformed in just an hour or two when you have a group of children in it .
For this reason you might want to consider what type of shots you ’ll want to take before the party actually starts .
This might include some of those shots that focus in on different elements of the party but also shots of the birthday boy or girl when they are dressed up and looking ( and behaving ) at their best .
Also take a few shots at the end of the party – they could make a humorous comparison series with your before shots and of course if something gets messy … be ready to capture that too to show how the ‘ after shot ’ was created .
12 . Shoot in Burst Mode
One of the most effective ways to capture parties is to learn how to shoot in continuous shooting ( or burst ) mode when your camera fires a series of shots in quick succession .
This is particularly useful when shooting children as they rarely sit still but is also a good strategy for key moments in the party like blowing out the candles ( which you only get a couple of seconds of opportunity to capture ) .
13 . Include Adults in your Photos
The focus of children ’s parties is generally the children – but the adults attending the party can actually present you with some fascinating shots as they watch on .
Sometimes their reactions to what the children are doing can be quite fascinating and its worth including them in shots – particularly those adults in the immediate family of the child having the birthday .
