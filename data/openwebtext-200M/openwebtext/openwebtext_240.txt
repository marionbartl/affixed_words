SOME OLD LADY'S HOUSE
An OLD LADY lays in her death bed , talking to KEVIN SPACEY .
OLD LADY
I 'm leaving you everything I own , Kevin .
KEVIN SPACEY
Because I 've provided you with love and affection during your final days ?
OLD LADY
No , because I watched " Beyond The Sea " and now I think you 're Bobby Darin .
Do n't get me wrong , though .
The sex was great .
KEVIN SPACEY
Gross .
OLD LADY
I just want to make sure we 're all on the same page , and there is n't anything subtle or ambiguous about this scene .
I 'm like 90 years old , my pussy hangs down to my knees , and your limp dick was inside it .
You , the self - proclaimed greatest criminal mastermind of our generation , has gone from evil schemes like " launch two nuclear missiles at once " to " eat out old , wrinkled bitches . "
KEVIN SPACEY
Yep .
We all get it .
This is actually how the first Superman movie in 19 years is starting .
OLD LADY
Damn , this movie sucks already .

EVA MARIE SAINT'S FARMHOUSE
EVA MARIE SAINT -- who apparently interrupted a game of scrabble that she was playing by herself in order to wash some dishes -- looks out her window to see a spaceship hit the ground .
BRANDON ROUTH exits .
EVA MARIE SAINT
Son , you 've returned !
And you 're somehow younger and skinnier than when you left .
How was Krypton ?
BRANDON ROUTH
Sucked .
Pretty much stayed in the hotel the entire time .
I brought you back a kryptonite shot glass , though .
BRANDON decides to stick around the farm for a while for no reason before returning to METROPOLIS as SUPER - BRANDON ROUTH .

ANTARCTICA
KEVIN SPACEY , his idiot girlfriend PARKER POSEY , and his gang of moronic henchmen enter SUPER - BRANDON'S famous FORTRESS OF GODDAMN -IT'S -FUCKING -COLD .
MARLON BRANDO ( V.O. )
Hello son .
KEVIN SPACEY
Fantastic .
The security system thinks I'm Superman .
Now it will tell me everything I want to know .
PARKER POSEY
Kryptonians have the technology to grow crystal houses out of nothing , but lack even basic biometric identification ?
No voice recognition , no retinal scanning , nothing ?
MARLON BRANDO ( V.O. )
Not even a password , random woman who I will assume must be Lois Lane .
Now , did you need something , son ?
KEVIN SPACEY
Tell me everything about these crystals .
MARLON BRANDO ( V.O. )
I heard : " Tell me ever sing , a boot .
Three cry stalls . "
Is this correct ?
KEVIN SPACEY
( muttering )
Fuck , I hate these things .
( loudly )
No .
Tell me about the crystals .
MARLON BRANDO ( V.O. )
I heard : " Take me out to fast tails . "
Is this correct ?
KEVIN SPACEY
NO !
Fuck this , everyone grab a crystal and let 's get out of here .
MARLON BRANDO ( V.O. )

EVA MARIE SAINT'S FARMHOUSE
BRANDON ROUTH flashes back to a bunch of pointless scenes where YOUNG BRANDON ROUTH learns that he has powers .
BRANDON ROUTH
Mom ... why am I thinking about my own origin story ?
EVA MARIE
Because Bryan Singer really just wanted to make a brand new Superman movie , complete with origin story and all .
He was worried that ignoring the previous Superman movies would somehow be disrespectful to Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve , so he just went through the screenplay and replaced all instances of " arrives " with " returns " .
BRANDON ROUTH
Oh .
So that 's why I " left " long enough for the world to " forget " about me .
Well , I guess I 'll go to Metropolis and get a job at the Daily Planet .
EVA MARIE
I think you mean go BACK to Metropolis and get YOUR OLD JOB BACK at the Daily Planet .
BRANDON ROUTH
Yeah .
That .
INT .
DAILY PLANET - METROPOLIS
BRANDON returns to the office and is accosted by SAM HUNTINGTON .
SAM HUNTINGTON
You 're back !
Well let me fill you in on what 's happened since the last movie .
Kevin Spacey is out of jail , Kate Bosworth is married to Cyclops , and the world has adjusted to a lack of Superman .
BRANDON ROUTH
I see .
Well , did Nuclear Man ever get himself off the moon ?
SAM HUNTINGTON
Nuclear Man ?
Oh , I see .
No , when I say " last movie " I mean Superman II .
And when I say " Superman II " , I mean the Richard Donner version , which was never completed or released to theaters in the United States .
Heh .
We 're pretending the third and fourth movies did n't happen because they sucked .
BRANDON ROUTH
As opposed to the first movie , in which Superman flies around the world backwards to turn back time ?
And the second one , where Superman suddenly has the power to create holograms of himself to trick other Kryptonians ?
Those two are so awesome that we dare not disrespect them by pretending they did n't happen , but the other two are dog shit ?
SAM HUNTINGTON
Exactly .
The other two are unworthy to be considered canon .
BRANDON ROUTH
Yet this movie is supposed to be canon even though it sucks worse than the Superman 64 video game ?
Suddenly , a plane that KATE BOSWORTH is on loses power and begins plummeting to the ground .
SAM HUNTINGTON
Oh no !
If only Superman were to suddenly pick today to return to Earth and rescue Kate from mortal peril .
BRANDON ROUTH
Good lord , how has this woman survived without me for five years ?
EXT .
METROPOLIS
BRANDON ROUTH transforms into SUPER - BRANDON and just barely stops the plane from hitting the ground in the middle of a crowded baseball field .
KATE BOSWORTH
Oh ... my ...
God ...
SUPER -BRANDON
I know , you 're amazed that you 're still alive and excited to see that I 've returned .
KATE BOSWORTH
What ?
No .
I 'm shocked by how terrible your costume is .
Seriously , it looks like a set of child 's pajamas .
Did you get that at K - Mart ?
SUPER -BRANDON
Oh .

NORMAL BRANDON ROUTH returns to The Daily Planet and runs into KATE BOSWORTH .
BRANDON ROUTH
Oh , hey Kate .
I heard you ran into Superman .
Coincidentally , I happened to return today as well .
KATE BOSWORTH
Oh , great .
Well , I should introduce you to my husband and kid .
BRANDON ROUTH
That 's it ?
You do n't think it 's at all suspicious that I happen to return from a five - year absence on the exact same day as Superman ?
KATE BOSWORTH
Nope .
BRANDON ROUTH
Seriously ?
KATE BOSWORTH
Dude , your disguise is a set of glasses .
We 're fucking idiots , relax .
FRANK LANGELLA
Alright everyone !
Superman is back , which means you all need to make up a bunch of news stories about him !
Get to work !
BRANDON ROUTH
Sounds good !
And thanks for giving me my old job back , chief !
FRANK LANGELLA
Do n't thank me , thank the ridiculously godawful writing of this movie !
Meanwhile , KEVIN SPACEY steals some KRYPTONITE and SUPER - BRANDON stops a GENERIC BANK ROBBERY and rescues people who fall off of things .
SUPER -BRANDON
So Kate , I was thinking maybe you could dump Cyclops and have dinner with me .
I 'd love to get to know you again .
KATE BOSWORTH
Sorry , but I 'm afraid this movie can't bother wasting time fleshing out my character .
This is a sequel , so there 's really no need for character establishment .
SUPER -BRANDON ROUTH
But you are n't playing the character even remotely like Margot Kidder did .
I 'm just doing a Christopher Reeve impression for the duration of the film , but do n't you think we should spend some time re-establishing you since you 're basically a new character ?
KATE BOSWORTH
Meh , the whole movie already feels like it 's just a bunch of kids playing comic book dress - up .
The only person not sleepwalking through this thing is Kevin Spacey , who seems to think he 's playing The Joker .
SUPER -BRANDON flies into the skies and listens to everyone 's prayers , thinks about the time his father told him he sent his only son to earth to show humanity the light , and tells KATE that the world needs a savior and he 's it .

Hmmm ... there 's something so familiar about these story elements ...

KATE BOSWORTH
Well , I guess you may as well tell me your evil scheme .
KEVIN SPACEY
Gladly .
Basically , I stole some crystals from Super - Brandon 's castle .
When put underwater , they grow into hideous , cold , miserable hunks of crystal land .
I 'm going to make a big crystal island and then sell the land .
KATE BOSWORTH
Oh my God , that 's insane .
KEVIN SPACEY
What , the fact that it will bury the United States underwater , killing millions ?
KATE BOSWORTH
No , the fact that this is almost the exact same stupid scheme you had in the first movie .
You were going to kill a whole bunch of people to drive up the value of land you owned then , too .
I can't figure out if this movie is a sequel , a reboot of the franchise , or a remake of the original .
KEVIN SPACEY
But this time , nobody can stop me !
No military will be any match for me , now that I have this advanced alien technology .
KATE BOSWORTH
You mean the crystals ?
The things that can grow into land ?
That 's your secret weapon ?
They are crystals , right ?
Not nuclear weapons ?
You 're a fucking idiot .
KEVIN SPACEY
( forgetting how to act )
WRROOONNNGGG !!!
KEVIN throws a crystal wrapped in KRYPTONITE into the water and creates A STUPID - LOOKING ISLAND while CYCLOPS tries to rescue KATE and sucks at it .
Eventually , SUPER - BRANDON rescues them instead and sends them in a plane back to METROPOLIS .
Then he faces off against the only creature alive who 's any kind of physical match for him : KEVIN SPACEY .
KEVIN SPACEY
You 've met your match , Super - Brandon .
You may have super - strength , flight , heat vision , x- ray vision , super - hearing , super - breath , and -- if I remember correctly -- the ability to throw your shield at someone and have it wrap a thin layer of plastic around them before disappearing after two seconds ... but I have two Oscars .
SUPER -BRANDON
Then what are you doing hamming it up in this uninspired piece of garbage ?
KEVIN stabs SUPER - BRANDON with a shard of GREEN PLASTIC and throws him into the water .
KEVIN SPACEY
Surely , there 's no reason to bother shooting him in the head or anything .
I 'm sure he 's dead now .
Let 's hurry up and get back to doing nothing .
KAL PENN
Seriously , what is it exactly we 're supposedly doing ?
We 're just sitting around on this land mass , playing cards and smoking cigars .
Are we trying to accomplish something ?
What are we waiting for ?
KEVIN SPACEY
We 're waiting until the excruciatingly plot - driven story requires us again .
Suddenly , KATE BOSWORTH tells CYCLOPS to turn their plane around .
She rescues SUPER - BRANDON and removes the PLASTIC PROP .
SUPER -BRANDON
Thank you for putting your five - year - old child in danger in order to help me .
Are you sure you 're supposed to win a Pulitzer , rather than a Mother of the Year award ?
KATE BOSWORTH
So what 's your plan for stopping Kevin Spacey ?
SUPER -BRANDON
Well , I 'm going to dive into the ocean floor and lift the entire crystal island into space , then throw it into orbit .
Then I 'm going to put a locking fucking door in my fortress .
KATE BOSWORTH
That 's your plan ?
Lift an entire continent made of kryptonite into space ?
You remember you had trouble lifting a plane in the beginning of the movie , right ?
SUPER -BRANDON
Well , I could try to just talk Kevin out of his evil plan , but I think the audience has suffered through enough inane dialogue about comic book characters already .
SUPER -BRANDON throws the continent into space .
After his valiant self - sacrifice , his body goes limp .
His arms stretch out to his sides and his feet are held together , in the form of someone being crucified .
SUPER -BRANDON ROUTH
In case anyone is a complete moron , I 'm Jesus .

Just when you might think the movie can't get any stupider , SUPER - BRANDON is rushed to the hospital , where he goes into a COMA .
KATE wakes him with a KISS , because that 's what " The Complete Idiot 's Guide To Making Movies About Superheroes " says should happen .

So , your mom told me that I 'm your father .
You will be different .
You will sometimes feel like an outcast , son .
But if you play your cards right , you can grow up to be responsible for the safety and well - being of a whole bunch of ungrateful jerks .
KATE'S KID
( waking up )
You 're my dad ?
So , according to this movie , Superman had sex with a human woman , which possibly could have killed her .
After she got pregnant out of wedlock , he not only skipped town , but skipped the entire planet .
For five years .
Now that 's he 's back and knows he 's a father , he plans on keeping his distance and letting me grow up an outcast .
Basically , Superman is the worst father ever .
SUPER -BRANDON
Yes .
KATE BOSWORTH
Which also means the movie franchise is completely destroyed .
Either the sequel will have to involve your son , which will make it as stupid and awful as this movie , or he 'll be forgotten about entirely , making you the world 's first superpowered deadbeat dad .
If this movie does n't obliterate society 's love of Superman , nothing will .
SUPER -BRANDON
Hey , at least it 's better than " Smallville " .
END
In December the U.S. Air Force flew a C - 17 transport plane across the country powered in part by a new propellant : natural gas transmuted into a synthetic liquid fuel .
Heat and catalysts converted methane into syngas ( carbon monoxide and hydrogen ) which were then transformed into liquid hydrocarbons ( otherwise known as oil and its derivatives ) : petroleum , gasoline and , in the case of aviation , kerosene .
" Hitler flew Messerschmitts on it , " says William Anderson , assistant secretary of the U.S. Air Force for installations , environment and logistics , about such Fischer - Tropsch synthetic fuel , which can be made from methane , coal , plant oils — even wood waste .
" We believe that having a secure domestic source of fuel makes it easier for us to do that mission [ to fly and fight ] .
It is less likely that there would be some disruption to the fuel source that we need to fly airplanes . "
View slideshow here
Whether for supersonic fighter jets or commercial airliners , the aviation world has begun a quest for the fuel of the future , transitioning away from petroleum - derived JP - 8 and Jet A varieties to Fischer - Tropsch synthetics or biofuels .
Driven by security and environmental concerns as well as skyrocketing oil prices — United Airlines more than doubled its fuel surcharge per ticket to $ 50 on January 12 — the aviation industry continues to cut back on fuel burn as it searches for cleaner , cheaper alternatives .
" We are definitely interested in having an alternative source of energy available to us for both economic and environmental reasons , not to mention pure supply , " says John Heimlich , chief economist at the Air Transport Association of America ( ATA ) in Washington , D.C. , which represents airlines responsible for more than 90 percent of U.S. passenger and freight air traffic .
" There are a host of fuels out there ; some could be better , some could be worse .
We need to find something at least as good , if not better . "
Rock to Liquid
Jet aircraft today typically burn kerosene , an energy - dense hydrocarbon fuel that delivers as much as 48 megajoules per kilogram ( 20,700 British thermal units per pound ) , allowing for long - distance travel .
Americans have taken advantage of this capacity , according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics : Airlines reported ferrying more than 72 million passengers last July , a record high for a single month .
At the same time , the aviation industry has become far more fuel efficient in the face of soaring prices .
( Airlines spent $ 37 billion for fuel alone in 2007 through November and may follow United in imposing steeper fuel surcharges on customers in 2008 . )
According to the ATA , the industry has reduced the amount of fuel burned by 23 percent since 2000 by taking such steps as making aircraft lighter and introducing more efficient engines .
" Today , Northwest Airlines is averaging roughly 50 passenger miles per gallon [ 21 kilometers per liter ] of fuel , " says Tim McGraw , Northwest 's director of safety , health and environment , largely by replacing its aging fleet of airplanes with newer , more efficient jets .
The primary reason for such improvements has been the steady rise in fuel costs .
For example , the Air Force has watched its energy spending double since 2003 even though it cut fuel consumption by more than 10,000 barrels a day during the same period .
" Over 80 percent of the entire Air Force energy buy is in liquid aviation fuel , " Anderson says .
" That represents a little less than $ 6 billion a year of taxpayer money that goes into feeding our fleet with fuel . "
As a result , the Air Force — and other military branches as well as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ) — have begun to experiment with alternatives .
" Alternative fuels offer the potential , if not to lower the price [ of petroleum - derived fuels ] , at least to provide a hedge in the future against their future growth or , put differently , their volatility , " says technologist Douglas Kirkpatrick , DARPA 's program manager for alternative fuels efforts .
" The key here is to go from one source to many . "
He adds : " Anyone who runs a business knows that you do n't want to have one supplier .
Essentially , that 's the position we 're in . "
In the short term , the Air Force hopes to make use of the Fischer - Tropsch chemistry that kept Nazi-era Germany and the apartheid - era Union of South Africa 's airplanes flying in the absence of oil ( and still supplies 40 percent of South Africa 's transportation fuel needs ) to ensure diversity of supply .
In addition to flying the C - 17 across the country — a plane powered by the same Pratt and Whitney F117 - 100 engine employed on commercial Boeing 757s — the Air Force in August certified its still flying 1950s - era B - 52 bombers to burn synfuel .
" Why start with an old weapons system ? " Anderson says .
" It 's a very simple engine compared to newer ones , less things can go wrong . "
The natural gas - derived synfuel performed perfectly in both planes during ground tests , flights and even during cold starts in the dead of winter in Minot , N. Dak .
The 50 – 50 blend of synfuel and JP - 8 fulfilled all 40 of the Air Force 's fuel performance criteria , including coming through in extremely high and low temperatures .
" Pilots are telling us that they 're feeling no difference at the controls between the fuels , " Anderson notes .
Fischer - Tropsch synfuels promise to provide a potentially cleaner fuel supply as well .
Burning the purer fuel — clearer than petroleum - derived kerosene — eliminates sulfur emissions that lead to acid rain and reduces ( by 50 to 90 percent ) the amount of tiny particles that usually remain after combustion , according to Richard Altman , executive director of the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative ( CAAFI ) , an industry effort to develop new energy options .
But synfuel will not lead to fewer emissions of carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas primarily responsible for global climate change .
Environmental group the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that turning coal to liquid fuel emits twice as much carbon dioxide as producing petroleum fuels .
" We will only buy fuel that is greener than our current alternatives , " Anderson says .
" Our current alternative is petroleum - based jet fuel . "
The European Union plans to restrict carbon emissions from airplanes beginning in 2012 ; in the U.S. , legislation is pending that would impose similar limits , and five states ( California , Connecticut , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New Mexico and New York ) have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to regulate such emissions in the interim .
" We now know that the solution that will be most environmentally acceptable , " CAAFI 's Altman says , " will have significant biofuels . "
Beyond Kerosene
The amount of emissions from aircraft compared with other vehicles is relatively small — roughly 3 percent of total worldwide greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning , according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) — nonetheless it has a major impact on the climate .
By releasing carbon dioxide higher in the atmosphere , airplanes allow the molecule more time to trap heat , also contributing via contrails and other chemically active gases , the IPCC notes .
Some airlines have been effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" At Northwest , our greenhouse gas emissions have gone down 25 percent since 2000 and about 5 percent less than 1990 , " says Ken Hylander , Northwest 's senior vice president of safety and engineering .
" If Northwest was a country , we would be Kyoto [ Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions ] compliant . "
But emissions from the aviation industry as a whole continue to climb .
According to the EPA , from 1990 to 2005 greenhouse emissions from military aircraft slid by 50 percent but those from commercial carriers rose by 16 percent , largely due to growth in the number of carriers .
Efficiency alone — even in the form of aircraft with improved engines and designs such as the Boeing 787 , expected to deliver a 20 percent improvement in fuel efficiency over existing big airplanes — is not the answer .
" A low - CO 2 fuel will help us to address that remaining portion of the pie , " says David Daggett , technology leader for energy and emissions at Boeing .
" That 's why we 're interested in biofuels specifically . "
One such biofuel — ethanol — is already being used to power a heavily employed commercial fleet : piston - engine propeller crop dusters .
Max Shauck , chair of the Baylor Institute for Air Science ( who flew an ethanol - powered prop plane at air shows in the 1980s ) , has converted at least 1,000 such aircraft in Brazil , a country that has weaned itself from foreign oil by embracing ethanol domestically produced from sugarcane .
In addition to being easier on the engine , ethanol costs one quarter to one half as much as the aviation gas typically used in such propeller planes .
Ethanol decreases the number of hours or distance such an aircraft can fly , however , due to its lower energy density , but " it develops more power and it's a greenhouse gas–neutral fuel , " Shauck says .
" There 's plenty of ethanol produced in the world to power all the piston - engine aircraft . "
The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) is conducting tests but has yet to certify ethanol as a fuel for piston - engine planes in the U.S. , says Lourdes Maurice , chief scientist and technical advisor to the FAA 's Office of Environment and Energy .
Regardless , ethanol 's low energy density makes it unsuitable for jet - turbine engines .
" Clearly we can't use ethanol , " CAAFI 's Altman says .
" That 's a blessing .
We do n't want to compete with food crops . "
Diesellike fuel derived from plant oils might avoid that problem as well as supply similar greenhouse gas reduction ( depending on how the plants are cultivated ) .
Already , a Czechoslovakian L - 29 jet — specially built in the 1960s by the Czech military to run on alternative fuels — flew for 37 minutes and reached an altitude of 17,000 feet ( 5,180 meters ) powered entirely by reformulated canola oil .
" Would you rather buy your oil from the Middle East , " asks BioJet 1 copilot Doug Rodante , president of Green Fuels International ( a company that promotes alternative fuels ) , " or the Midwest ? "
But biodiesel solidifies into a gel at the cold temperatures found at high altitude , a fatal flaw for any aircraft fuel .
The Czech jet has fuel heaters to get around this problem , and similar solutions could be engineered into other jet engines , argues physicist Rudi Wiedemann , president and CEO of Biodiesel Solutions , Inc. , in Sparks , Nev. , the flight 's fuel provider .
Or the biodiesel itself can be further refined to ensure that it does n't solidify until at least – 40 degrees Celsius ( –40 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the current standard for petroleum - derived jet fuel .
UOP , a Honeywell Company , has developed such a " green diesel " by heating vegetable and animal oils to add hydrogen atoms to the long hydrocarbon chains , under the aegis of DARPA .
In addition , its " ecofining " process adds kinks in the chains to prevent them from easily stacking — or gelling — at cold temperatures , producing a diesellike fuel with as much as twice the combustion quality of the petroleum - derived variety .
Boeing has tested two such " vegetable - based biofuels " with this antifreezing property in the General Electric jet engines used on many of its 747 aircraft , Daggett says .
Virgin Atlantic airline announced that early this year it will conduct the first flight test of a biodiesel–petroleum diesel blend in one of the four engines of a 747 aircraft ; Air New Zealand is planning a similar test flight on a Rolls Royce engine in one of its 747s later in the year .
The first UOP - derived ecofining facility , capable of producing 100 million gallons of diesel fuel for ground vehicles , is now being built in Livorno , Italy ; a second facility is set to be constructed in Sines , Portugal .
" Going to biofuels does n't mean we have to make compromises .
We are already making fuels that look exactly like the real thing , or better , " says Jennifer Holmgren , UOP 's director of renewable energy chemicals .
" The real limitation is going to be feedstock . "
There is not enough oil from plants such as soy and canola to supply even a fraction of the 60 million–plus gallons of jet fuel burned every day by U.S. aircraft , nearly one quarter of global use , even if all such sources were converted to fuel ( which would significantly impact food supplies . )
And Boeing has had a hard time finding biofuel suppliers who can produce testable quantities of their product .
" Immediately that weeds out a lot of companies when you ask for 1,000 gallons , " Daggett says .
As a result , both private companies like UOP , government agencies like DARPA and commercial organizations such as CAAFI have begun to consider a broader array of sources , including the oil from the seeds of Brazil 's babassu palm tree or the conversion of the woody or cellulosic parts of plants .
Chemical engineer Charles Wyman of the University of California , Riverside , argues for biorefineries turning seed oil , the stalks and other detritus of crop plants , and even wood pulp waste into an assortment of alternative fuels .
" You are growing wood or grasses in a renewable way in some sort of energy plantation to produce biomass , " he says .
" Convert some of that to ethanol , and the fraction you can't convert , use Fischer - Tropsch to make diesel fuel that could be tailored towards jet fuel . "
Or algae could be grown .
The tiny plant can produce " 60 percent of its weight as oil under stress , " according to Wyman .
Closed vats might produce pure strains of such high - oil species for feeding into large ponds to grow sufficient supplies , says systems engineer Ron Pate at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico , who has been analyzing the fuel potential of microscopic plants .
Such vast algae farms might also subsist on so - called " impaired " water , either salty ocean or polluted waters , Pate says .
" Water coming out of sewage treatment plants has nutrients — nitrates , which encourage algae to grow , " Boeing 's Daggett notes .
" You can harvest the algae and extract the oil , then release the water in a cleaner state than what it would have been leaving the sewage plant . "
But biorefineries would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and require significant upgrades in existing processes , whereas such algae schemes have yet to be tried .
The U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) has provided the money for a few pilot biorefineries and DARPA has provided funding for initial efforts to begin exploring algae 's feasibility , but it will be years before any such fuel is widely available .
" Ten to 20 years is a reasonable time frame , " Daggett says .
Fossil Blends
The Air Force , meanwhile , plans to certify its entire fleet of aircraft on Fischer - Tropsch process synthetic fuels derived from methane or coal by 2011 and plans to purchase enough such fuel to power at least 50 percent of the fleet in the continental U.S. by 2016 .
Tests began in November on the performance of the purer synfuel in the jet afterburner engines that are used for supersonic flight .
" That 's about 400 million gallons [ 1.5 billion liters ] of fuel , " Anderson says , compared to 281,000 gallons [ 1.06 million liters ] purchased this year and an estimated 500,000 gallons [ 1.9 million liters ] next year .
" It may only be marginally [ environmentally ] better in 2016 .
Carbon neutral ?
Probably not . "
Although such synfuels may actually increase greenhouse gas emissions , depending on how they are produced , they will deliver some independence from the tyranny of petroleum .
" The coal in the ground in the U.S. at current use will last 400 to 500 years .
If you double , triple or quadruple the use of coal , it wo n't be 400 , of course , it 'll be 100 or 50 years , " Anderson notes .
" But it 's 50 more years to get to the carbon - free economy . "
Before then , the impact on Earth 's climate can be limited by blending relatively small amounts of biofuels into such synfuels — an option DARPA , for one , rejects for logistical reasons — or capturing the carbon dioxide from synfuel production and using it to enhance the growth of the plants to be turned into fuel .
" Put as little as 20 percent biofuel into nonrenewable fuels — coal - to - liquid and gas - to - liquid — you can be carbon neutral in a mix , " CAAFI 's Altman says .
Such a 20 percent mix would not require any modifications to existing aircraft engines or infrastructure , Green Flight International 's Rodante says .
" Jet fuel and biofuel mix is something that is easily done , " he says " I do n't believe 100 percent biofuel is the answer . "
Oil prices at $ 100 per barrel are already well above the $ 40 per barrel level at which synfuel producing facilities break even , and even the $ 70 per barrel level that might make carbon capture economically feasible .
" The biggest challenge is production capacity — and staying the course , " FAA 's Maurice says .
" If the price of crude were to drop , can we sustain the interest ? "
Still , the combination of factors involved : energy security , diversity of supply and the environment may sustain commercial aviation 's interest , though its overall goals are smaller — certifying synfuel blends next year , full synfuels by 2010 and biofuels in 2013 .
" There is an underlying demand for something better than $ 90 per barrel oil , that has better domestic supply and can help cope with increasing environmental pressure , " ATA 's Heimlich says .
" I have yet to see that silver bullet magic fuel . "
In the interim , many airlines are offering ways to offset the greenhouse gas emissions associated with air travel , such as U.S. - based Delta Air Line 's program with The Conservation Fund to plant trees in return for $ 5.50 that passengers are given the option of adding to the price of a domestic round - trip ticket or $ 11 for international round - trip flights .
Britain - based Virgin Atlantic has a similar agreement with myclimate ( a Swiss offset provider ) , who uses added flyer fees , which vary depending on ticket price , to fund renewable energy projects in developing countries such as India .
It remains unclear , however , how much such passenger - funded partnerships do to alleviate climate change and they are a poor substitute for a carbon - neutral alternative jet fuel .
" We should have stayed the course in the 1970s and then we would n't be having this discussion , " the Air Force 's Anderson says .
" Whether it takes 30 or 50 years [ to develop such a fuel ] , it 's going to take longer if we start tomorrow than if we start today . "

They have declined by over 35 percent since then .
The homebuilders exchange - traded fund ( XHB ) has fallen from over $ 45 to $ 16 since early 2006 .
The financial fund XLF has dropped from 38 to 26 in the last six months .
Damage in individual stocks in these sectors is much greater .
Retailers are now feeling the heat .
Target Corporation ( TGT ) is under 50 from a high of 70 .
Sears Holding , which peaked over 195 , is down to 96 .
These stock price drops are the stuff of recessions in these businesses .
Even before these declines , shrewd investors were assigning very low price - earnings ratios to mortgage companies and title insurers .
They knew that the housing bubble would burst .
Since the economy is made up of markets , critics of capitalism will now have a field day blaming the market economy for its imagined shortcomings .
Do they praise markets when the economy is growing and creating millions of new jobs and vast new wealth ?
Of course not , because these critics are biased government apologists .
They seize any chance to pound the daylights out of free markets .
We can hardly expect the beneficiaries of big government and haters of free markets to communicate the simple truth : Recessions do not and cannot occur on a systematic basis in a diversified economy composed of free markets .
Since the U.S. economy ’s markets are typically not free markets , it does experience recessions as a systematic feature , with the banking system being the usual method of propagation .
Recessions only can occur when the government curtails free markets by its usual means : direct control and interference , taxes , subsidies , and regulations .
They occur when the government , through these coercive means , manages to create pervasive shocks that mislead so many market participants that recession becomes inevitable .
In the 4 years starting in 2001 , the Federal Reserve System ( the Fed ) increased the M1 money supply by about 6 percent a year .
This followed a 7 - year period in which M1 was basically flat , or stable , not rising at all .
Those 7 years were a non-inflationary period for M1 .
The rapid and prolonged increase in M1 between 2001 and 2005 after such a lengthy period of stability was an important inflationary shock to the U.S. economy .
Suddenly the banking system was flooded with reserves , which is the fuel behind the M1 increase and a vast increase in loans .
The Fed had supplied the banking system with the means to increase its loans dramatically .
The housing sector took off .
Housing prices began to rise .
It should be noted that some foreign central banks have inflated even more since 2001 and created their own real estate booms .
This enhances the odds of a severe worldwide recession .
In the fractional - reserve system that we have , the growth of loans can exceed that of M1 through a multiplier effect .
Real estate loans increased at a rate of over 14 percent a year in the same 4 - year period .
So much credit fuel was injected into the banking system that even after the Fed stopped increasing M1 at the start of 2005 , the loans kept right on rising .
Between 2005 and the end of 2007 , real estate loans rose at only the slightly lower rate of 11 % a year .
This was a real estate bubble , a rise in prices and activity that had no basis in the real economy , its source being the inflationary rise in the supply of bank reserves and money created out of nothing , by accounting entries and not by real savings .
Our government was well pleased with the bubble and itself .
Officials liked the fact that consumers could refinance their mortgages at lower rates and , because their home prices had risen , extract home equity loans .
The government encouraged these loans because they stimulated consumption .
The economy was slow to recover in 2003 and 2004 .
Our leaders thought that these mortgage loans were leading the way out of the 2001 — 2002 recession .
The government basked in the systematic illusion ( because of all this new paper money ) that the consumer was wealthier and was leading the economy out of the recession .
This was deemed a good thing .
This was thought to be Keynesian economics at work .
Politicians , regulators , the Fed , and Alan Greenspan could all congratulate themselves at this economic fine - tuning success story .
Most of all , they counted on getting more votes .
If Greenspan was the Sorcerer , his Apprentice was the fractional - reserve banking system .
The banks could lend to mortgage companies , investment bankers , and hedge funds .
They could create a geyser of mortgage loans themselves or finance mortgage companies that would originate mortgages .
The banks could sell the loans off to others , financed by loans that it itself extended !
Along with letters bombarding Americans to apply for 0 % credit cards came incessant appeals to buy the home one always wanted and could not afford , or buy that second home , or sell the home one had and buy an even larger one that was sure to rise in price .
The mortgage origination industry boomed .
It sought out and found new customers .
Certain excesses began to appear .
In time , these excesses will be investigated .
They will find their way into headlines , fines , and maybe handcuffs .
The rocks will be turned over .
We will see the worms underneath .
A great many headlines await us , but will they blame Alan Greenspan and the Fed , as they should ?
Will they blame the fractional - reserve banking system , as they should ?
Will they blame the government , as they should ?
Will they blame regulators , as they should ?
Of course not .
They will blame the market economy and call for revamped and new regulations .
They will single out certain companies and institutions as the sacrificial lambs .
It will be discovered that the excess money corrupted a great many of those whom it touched .
It will be found that banks relaxed their lending standards , that underwriting standards were lowered , and that investment bankers stopped doing the due diligence they should have .
It will be found that the abundant money tempted many and brought out the greed in some .
Investment fraud will be charged against some big and established players who originated and sold loans to other big players , all of whom either knew better or should have known better that the loans were of poor quality .
They will incur some fines and write them off .
Meanwhile , falling below the radar will be a surprisingly large amount of fraud executed by small and unknown criminals or perhaps by mob-related figures .
According to the FBI , 30 to 70 percent of defaults on payments early in the life of a mortgage are linked to misrepresentations on the loan applications .
Mortgage fraud goes well beyond an individual who is fudging his answers .
There are countless schemes and scams by which criminals have tapped into the banking system ’s money gravy train .
One method is to buy a house .
Then have it fraudulently appraised at a much higher value .
Then sell this to a straw buyer ( whom the house owner controls ) who finances it with a bank loan .
The bank loan goes to the seller who then walks away from the deal and keeps the money .
This is a Mafia - type " bustout " scheme .
Another method is to make multiple applications in a short period of time for home equity lines of credit , and then bust out with the money .
Other schemes defraud homeowners who have been induced to make deed transfers in order to obtain loans that could save their homes .
In addition to the money - creation of the Fed that spawned this credit creation bubble , there exists an immense government regulatory apparatus that pervades the housing market .
Just as there is no free market in banking , there is no free market in housing in the U.S .
The two sectors , banking and housing , are joined at the hip .
There has been no free market in housing for a very , very long time .
The Federal Home Loan Bank system began in 1932 .
The Federal Housing Administration began in 1937 .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) has been around since 1965 .
It absorbed the Federal Housing Administration which began in 1934 .
Fannie Mae ( FNMA ) began in 1938 and was rechartered and expanded in 1968 .
The government officially and institutionally stepped into the housing markets in a big way under Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson .
The federal government has found it politically favorable to encourage home ownership and the accompanying bank loans .
The tax structure has been manipulated to favor mortgage as opposed to other loans .
The entire structure of where people live , work , and travel has been skewed by these government manipulations .
If banks can count on loan capital being supplied by the Fed and deposits being insured , a large element of moral hazard is introduced into the system .
Banks will make loans that are too risky , knowing that they can and will be bailed out .
To counteract this , there is state regulation and oversight of bank loans .
It is a second - best or third - best solution to problems caused by other of the government ’s perverse regulations and incentives .
However , since oversight is also a government activity , it is often too little and too late .
Lax oversight has surely contributed to the granting of loans to individuals who were poor risks and to high - pressure and misleading tactics that induced people to take out loans who should not have .
The boom in residential real estate is over .
It will stay over for a good number of years .
The peak prices will not soon return .
The sectors affected by this boom ( and now collapse ) are large enough to affect the entire economy .
Other kinds of loans than low - grade mortgages will start to go sour and create further problems .
The stock market is already in a bear market .
The Fed ’s money policy from 2005 to now has been one of stability .
The M1 money supply is at the same level it was 2 years ago .
This policy is being threatened by the recession and by the banking problems .
So far the Fed has not unleashed a torrent of money as it did in 2001 under Greenspan .
The current rise in the price of gold signals that the Fed , under the pressure of such legislation as the Employment Act of 1946 , will again inflate .
Congress has mandated that the Fed inflate in order to promote employment , and , at times such as are about to hit us , that is what the Fed does .
How much it inflates and when it does are anyone ’s guess .
Mine is that it is unlikely that Bernanke will turn on the money spigots as quickly or as much as did Greenspan .
Freedom is given lip service by our government officials and regulators .
We are not made more free when the government exercises its powers over money creation , housing regulation , and the banking system .
The exercise of these government powers does no recognizable good .
In the last few years , it has done clear harm .
It has stimulated a housing bubble .
The government caused overbuilding of houses financed by bad loans .
The overbuilding of houses will take years to work off .
In the meantime , important sectors of the economy will be depressed and unemployment high in those sectors until people find new work .
The bad loans will have to be sorted out , which means problems and dislocations for many individuals .
Taxpayers will be footing the bill for bailouts of financial institutions .
The banking system will remain fragile , impeding future growth .
Stock market declines and housing price declines are the destruction of wealth .
Consider homebuilder Hovnanian ( HOV ) .
Its stock was $ 5 in 1998 , over $ 70 in 2005 , and is now back to $ 5 .
It built a lot of houses that are now not worth the price that people paid for them .
Capital flowed into homes rather than some other activity where it might have produced some permanent wealth increase .
The Keynesian remedy for the last recession has proved to be impermanent , unreal , and short - lived .
It has nurtured a set of new problems for us to work through .
The Fed will soon be asked to implement another Keynesian fix by again ballooning the money supply .
Bernanke has said that he would accede .
We can only hope that he is staving off the pressures to inflate by use of his assurances .
It would be most unwise to repeat a mistake that is so fresh in our minds and experience .

KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - A Malaysian referee took out his gun and fired warning shots in the air after a local soccer match turned unruly following the suspension of a player , a newspaper said on Tuesday .
The referee , who was also a policeman , ran to his patrol car to get his gun after players mobbed him for showing the red-card to one of them , the New Straits Times said .
“ We are investigating as to whether the policeman was justified in taking out his firearm and discharging it , and also why he had it with him during the match , ” it quoted Hussin Ismail , police chief in the southern Johor state , as saying .
The policemen was taken into custody for suspected misuse of firearms .
Five players , aged between 23 and 40 , were also being held for questioning and could be charged for rioting , the paper said .

Those attending the ceremony called for Indians to unite
Enlarge Image
An urn containing the ashes was opened and they were mixed with water from the Arabian Sea by his great - granddaughter Nilamben Parikh .
The ceremony was in accordance with Hindu rites .
Gandhi - called Mahatma or " Great Soul " - spearheaded a non-violent campaign against the British Raj .
' Come together '
His campaign culminated in India getting its independence in 1947 .
" It is a day of thought and reflection for me and for all of us who can now look to carry his thoughts forward , " Ms Parikh , 75 , said .
A Mumbai display depicting Gandhi's assassination
" I feel on this occasion the whole nation will come together . "
She and 10 other family members - descendants of Gandhi 's four sons - boarded a boat and scattered the ashes about 1 km ( 0.6 miles ) out to sea .
Ms Parikh is descended from Gandhi 's eldest son , Harilal , who had a turbulent relationship with his father and was not at his funeral , contravening Hindu tradition by which the eldest son lights the father 's funeral pyre .
Her participation in the ceremony has been described by family members as a gesture of reconciliation .
After Gandhi's cremation , his ashes were distributed in 20 different containers to towns and villages across India for memorial services .
Some were kept and worshipped by wealthy industrialist families who supported Gandhi during his lifetime .
Moral conscience
In 1997 , one such urn was found in a bank locker in the state of Orissa .
They were later immersed in keeping with the family 's wishes .
The BBC's Prachi Pinglay , who attended the Mumbai ceremony , says that many of those present at Chowpatty beach were in their seventies .
Indian Home Minister Shivraj Patel and Maharashtra Governor SM Krishna represented national and state governments .
The ashes were taken to sea after police formed a guard of honour .
Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic in 1948 .
Today he is widely revered as the nation 's moral conscience .
His principles of truth and non-violence have been widely followed and worshipped .
However , some Hindus question his philosophy of non-violence .
Wednesday 's ceremony was deeply moving for 72 - year - old lawyer Trivedi , who stood at the barricade in Mumbai and watched his wife Usha Trivedi go with the boat to immerse the ashes .
He watched the media scuffle with police as they jostled to get on other boats to cover the ceremony with a certain amount of sadness .
" Is n't it an irony that when ashes of a man who practiced peace and non-violence are being immersed , there is so much commotion and chaos ? " he asked .
As the ashes dropped deep into the sea , another follower with childhood memories of Gandhi , 72 - year - old Dr Vora , was overcome with emotion .
" Hope he is reborn , " she said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
In an internal memo obtained Monday by CNN , Federal Emergency Management Agency chief David Paulison rips the agency 's public affairs staff for a staged news conference in which staff members posed questions to FEMA 's No. 2 official , Harvey Johnson .
Pat Philbin wo n't be taking over as head of public relations for the director of national intelligence .
Paulison said the entire episode " represented egregious decision - making " by the director of external affairs for FEMA , Pat Philbin , and his staff , who , he said , " lost perspective of the core imperative that they preserve the credibility of our agency . "
Philbin was scheduled to become director of public affairs for the director of national intelligence -- a job National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell said Philbin will not be doing .
It was not immediately clear whether Philbin offered his resignation or was fired just as he was set to begin the job .
" Their actions represented a breach of ethical practice that tore at the credibility of FEMA , the deputy administrator and that of their own office , " Paulison wrote in his memo .
" I do not condone their actions , no matter how well - intended , and have conveyed my displeasure directly through formal reprimand and admonishment to those involved . "
Watch what happened at FEMA 's fake news conference »
Paulison said reporters were given only 15 minutes notice for the news conference , held last Tuesday after the agency received a number of media queries about its response to the California wildfires .
When reporters did not show up on time , staffers asked the questions -- and reporters , who had been given a phone number to call in to the conference , could only listen .
" Inadequate notice is not acceptable , " Paulison said in his memo , and setting up a " listen only " conference call for reporters was " inappropriate . "
" Under no circumstances is it appropriate for FEMA employees to pose questions during a FEMA press event , " he wrote .
He added , " I am extremely displeased by what transpired and will make the necessary changes in order to regain confidence and credibility in the eyes of the people we serve . "
In a telephone call to CNN earlier Monday , Paulison said Philbin sent him an e-mail in which he took full responsibility for the incident .
Paulison said the events were " not acceptable , " adding that not allowing reporters on the telephone to ask questions was " ridiculous . "
" I am calling to apologize and say it will not happen again , " he said .
He said " the rules are changing " to prevent any recurrence .
Reporters will now be given at least an hour 's warning before a press conference and reporters calling in will be able to ask questions in the future , he said .
FEMA got generally high marks for its response to the California wildfires , but Paulison said he was sure the press conference flap has had a bad effect on morale .
" The last two years of planning for a major disaster fell in place .
...
Things were working as they were supposed to ... and that just killed everything you tried to have happen , " he said .
Johnson , a retired admiral who fielded the staged questions at the news conference , " really did n't have an awareness " of what was taking place , Paulison said .
He said Johnson was not familiar with all the people working in the press office and did not recognize that they were the ones asking questions .
" He just feels sick about it , " said Paulison .
" He feels his credibility has been hurt . "
However , reporters noted that Johnson called on at least one person by name .
Russ Knocke , a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security , will be moving over to the FEMA press operation temporarily to complete an investigation into the news conference incident and find a replacement for Philbin .

K - 10 rover under test at Devon Island , developed by the NASA Ames Intelligent Robotics Group .
The K - 10 is an example of collaboration between space agencies and private enterprise , and is a prototype of robot explorers that can scout out the Moon .
Optech , a private Canadian company and member of the Odyssey Moon team , provided the laser eyes that allow this NASA rover to see in 3D , even in the dark .
GOLDEN , Colorado – Odyssey Moon , the first team to complete registration for the Google Lunar XPrize , will unveil its entry today .
The roboticrace to the Moon will be kick - started today by an international group seekingto win the $ 30 million purseestablished to spark a global , non-governmental rivalry with the aim of landingprivate spacecraft upon Earth 's neighbor .
As a newlyestablished lunar enterprise based in the Isle of Man – located just off the westcoast of Great Britain – Odyssey Moon 's inaugural mission will involve a smallrobotic lander designed to deliver scientific , exploration and commercial gear tothe surface of the Moon .
OdysseyMoon officials are set to reveal that its prime contractor for building their Moonlanding equipment is MacDonald , Dettwiler and Associates Ltd ( MDA ) of Canada .
MDAhas a strong track record of success in providing space hardware , such asrobotic arms for the space shuttle and the International Space Station , keytechnology utilized in the U.S. Orbital Express Flight Demonstration Mission , and building commercial remote sensing radar spacecraft .
OdysseyMoon 's strategy is being rolled out today at Space Investment Summit 3 , beingheld December 5 - 6 in San Jose , California .
" Ourteam draws upon a substantial amount of business and technology expertise .
Wetotally believe that this is technically feasible , " said Robert Richards , founder and Chief Executive Officer of Odyssey Moon .
He is Director of OptechIncorporated 's Space Group of Ontario , Canada – an industrial partner on theteam – and also co-founded the International Space University in 1987 .
" Webelieve there 's going to be a ' Moon Rush ' ?
which means that there 's a viable , supportable and sustainable commercial lunar business plan based on marketsthat we believe exist ?
and will exist , " Richards told SPACE.com .
The Google Lunar X Prize wasannounced mid-September , financially backed by Silicon Valley - based Google Inc. , working with the X Prize Foundationin Santa Monica , California .
The competition solicits efforts of private groupsfrom around the world to land a privately funded robotic rover on the Moon thatis capable of completing several mission objectives , including trekking over thelunar surface for at least 1,640 feet ( 500 meters ) and transmitting video , images and data back to the Earth .
" I 'm very pleased to learn of Odyssey Moon and the talent behind this team .
It demonstrates that the startinggun for the private race to the Moon has truly been fired , " said PeterDiamandis , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the X Prize Foundation .
" I am hoping that we will see atleast another dozen serious teams from around the Earth announcing their intentto compete in the months ahead , " he told SPACE.com .
As evidenced by the high number ofregistration inquiries received since the Google Lunar X Prize was announced , Diamandisadded : " I am confident that the $ 30 million purse can be won in the 2011 - 2013 timeframe . "
Lunarbusiness plan
Richardssaid that the Google Lunar X Prize was a catalyst to their plans – but thegroup had been shaping a lunar business strategy and a pathfinder mission tothe Moon for over a year .
" There 's going to be more and more demand forlower cost , reliable services to get to the Moon , " he predicted .
Richards said that science , exploration and technology validation will be the Moon market needs ofgovernment enterprises .
" There are ways that the private sector can play arole in helping them do that . "
Moreover , there are ancillarymarkets that also constitute lunar dealing , Richards added , be it forentertainment , education , or novelty ideas .
" But those are not drivingwhat we see as our business plan .
We are an exploration company for lunarcommerce . "
Joining Richards in establishingOdyssey Moon is Ramin Khadem , a former Chief Financial Officer of INMARSAT , a globalmobile satellite communications company .
Khadem is chairman of Odyssey Moon .
OdysseyMoon is open to international collaboration at several levels , Richards said , not only for the Google Lunar X Prize but to help shape the company 's long - termbusiness plans for development of the Moon .
The Planetary Society has joined the Odyssey Moon team to assist in education andpublic involvement , as well as serving as an international and science liaison .
Target shooting
" Our goal is to have ourtechnical baseline [ for the lunar hardware ] developed by mid-2008 , and we 'llhave something to show about our technical path perhaps by this coming January , " Richards said .
The group 's approach is to create a streamlined , small team , hesaid , with an eye toward winning the Google Lunar X Prize in five years time .
" We have our choice oflaunchers around the world .
We 'll go with the most reliable at the mostreasonable cost , " Richards said .
Odyssey Moon 's location on the Isle of Man , situated in the heart of the British Isles , offers space legislation and taxregime benefits , Richards said .
The country is an internally self - governingdependent territory of the British Crown .
It is not part of the United Kingdom , but is a member of the British Commonwealth .
How much money is needed by OdysseyMoon in its shoot - for - the - Moon adventure ?
There is one example to get a handleon financing the effort , Richards said , pointing to the winning of the $ 10 million Ansari X Prize thanks to back - to - back suborbital flights ofSpaceShipOne in 2004 .
" On the order of 30 million wasspent to win the $ 10 million prize ?
so I think the same multiplier is going tobe true .
You 're looking at a $ 60 million to $ 100 million venture .
I 'd like tosee hundreds of millions of dollars of effort going into bringing down the costof access to the Moon ? to bring new innovation into commercial lunarenterprise , " Richards said .
" We want to set the bar veryhigh ?
and we do intend to win , " Richards concluded .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) - Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf imposed a state of emergency in a bid to end an eight - month crisis over his rule fuelled by challenges from a hostile judiciary , Islamist militants and political rivals .
General Musharraf said he decided to act on Saturday in response to a rise in extremism and what he called the paralysis of government by judicial interference .
“ I fear that if timely action is not taken , then God forbid there is a threat to Pakistan ’s sovereignty , ” he said in a midnight televised address , after purging the Supreme Court and rounding up lawyers opposed to him .
“ I cannot allow this country to commit suicide . ”
There had been increasing speculation that Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , might declare an emergency rather than run the risk the Supreme Court would rule against his re-election as president last month .
The United States , a staunch Musharraf ally , called the measure “ very disappointing ” .
Musharraf ’s announcement effectively dashed U.S. hopes that parliamentary elections due in January would mark a transition to civilian - led democracy .
In the capital Islamabad , armored personnel carriers and military trucks patrolled the streets while roadblocks with metal barriers were set up on the main thoroughfares .
Nuclear - armed Pakistan ’s internal security has deteriorated sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks , including an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last month that killed 139 people .
Bhutto flew back to Pakistan on Saturday from a brief visit to Dubai and accused Musharraf of imposing “ mini- martial law ” Another leading opposition figure , former cricket captain Imran Khan , was placed under house arrest .
Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry , whose earlier suspension in March marked the beginning of a slide in Musharraf ’s popularity , was sacked , Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani said .
The court had said on Friday it would reconvene on Monday and decide quickly on whether Musharraf could remain president .
Chaudhry was escorted home by police from the Supreme Court where he and other judges had refused to endorse the emergency .
AL QAEDA
The United States , which regards Musharraf as a crucial ally against al Qaeda in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan , had earlier urged Musharraf to avoid taking authoritarian measures .
“ This action is very disappointing , ” White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
“ President Musharraf needs to stand by his pledges to have free and fair elections in January and step down as chief of army staff before retaking the presidential oath of office . ”
But Pentagon Press Secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters the emergency had no immediate impact on U.S. military cooperation .
“ At this point the declaration does not impact our military support of Pakistan ’s efforts in the war on terror . ”
Musharraf , who also suspended the constitution , banned the media from publishing anything that defames , ridicules or brings himself , the armed forces or government into disrepute .

Pakistan Television said that the cabinet , national and provincial assemblies would continue to function and that Abdul Hameed Dogar had been appointed as new Chief Justice .
Witnesses said troops were also deployed at Pakistan Television and radio stations .
Most phone lines were down , and private television channels taken off the air .
Musharraf had been awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on whether he was eligible to run for re-election last month while still army chief .
He had promised to quit as army chief if he was given a second term .
Farzana Shaikh , a Pakistan expert at London ’s Chatham House think tank , said the declaration of emergency by Musharraf was “ clearly a pre-emptive move on his part ” that was designed to act before the Supreme Court issued its ruling .

ELECTIONS DELAY
Musharraf ’s troubles began in March when he suspended Chaudhry on allegations of misconduct .
Then in July , Musharraf ordered troops to storm the Red Mosque in Islamabad to crush a Taliban - style movement based there .
At least 105 people were killed in the raid and a wave of deadly militant attacks and suicide bombings followed .
Musharraf also faced a strong political challenge from Bhutto , who returned to Karachi in October from eight years of self - imposed exile , a homecoming marred by the suicide bombing that killed 139 .
On Saturday she went straight from Karachi ’s airport terminal to her bullet - proof Landcruiser smiling and waving to hundreds of supporters who chanted : “ Long live Bhutto ” .
Before the emergency , there had been speculation she would strike a deal with Musharraf to share power after the elections -- an alliance that had been encouraged by the United States .
She said she believed emergency rule was designed to delay elections by “ at least one to two years ” .
Britain said it was “ gravely concerned ” by the declaration of emergency rule while India urged a return to democracy .
The prank began when Aaron left for spring break , play the video to see how the prank ended .

Endless , aimless cop-evading mayhem after finishing a GTA has never held my interest , but I appreciate the extendability .
And it 's fun for my little 9 - year old brother .
Thing is , even though Rockstar has never let plot get in the way of a good game , it 's always made sense to see the game 's antagonist still running around wrecking shit .
Until Vice City Stories :
Not like anyone could care or could n't guess how a GTA ends , but spoilers hidden below >>

Independent labels , tired of being treated like second - class citizens at the bargaining table , have banded together to become a " virtual fifth major " label , and they 've already started signing deals .
Separately , each independent is tiny ; together , they could form the largest label in the world .
The new licensing authority is called Merlin , and it was announced four days ago at this year 's Midem music conference in Cannes .
The group is headed by Charles Caldas , the former head of Australia 's largest independent music distributor .
Labels from the US , UK , France , Norway , Japan , Brazil , Spain , New Zealand , Australia , and other countries have already signed on to use their collective size as a bargaining asset .
Caldas has already inked a deal with SNOCAP ( the company that Shawn Fanning founded after leaving Napster ) that will provide an easy way for independent artists to sell their music on MySpace or to construct their own stores elsewhere .
Under the deal , SNOCAP will provide all the backend distribution and payment processing systems and will serve files as unprotected MP3s .
Independent labels have been open to selling music without DRM for years ( eMusic , the number two download store in the US , offers only MP3s from independent bands ) , as many artists are more concerned with building a fan base than with possible piracy .
IMPALA , a European consortium of indie labels that has joined the new group , claims that independent music accounts for 29 percent of worldwide music sales and 80 percent of all new releases .
These numbers would make Merlin the largest single label in the world , ahead of the " Big Four " of EMI , Warner , Universal , and Sony BMG .
But Merlin is n't a traditional label .
That is , it is neither a content aggregator nor a distributor , but simply a licensing authority that negotiates rights .
The member labels remain in full control of their own catalogs .
Alison Wenham , who heads the World Independent Network , says that " independents will now achieve parity with each other and with the majors in getting a fair share of the revenues now being generated by new business models .
Without Merlin , the sector ran a huge risk of being cut out of the revenue chain .
No more . "
In the past , it has sometimes been difficult for small indie labels to cut deals with the big online music stores because of the negotiating effort required and the relatively small size of such deals .
Merlin provides a single point of contact for music stores , which can now negotiate with five major entities and secure rights to nearly all of the world 's popular music .
WASHINGTON -- The Republican Party , known since the late 19th century as the party of business , is losing its lock on that title .
New evidence suggests a potentially historic shift in the Republican Party 's identity -- what strategists call its " brand . "
The votes of many disgruntled fiscal conservatives and other lapsed Republicans are now up for grabs , which could alter U.S. politics in the 2008 elections and beyond .

Two teams of US scientists have demonstrated silicon - based ’ thermoelectric ’ materials that could convert waste heat back into electricity [ 1,2 ] - potentially giving a boost to the efficiency of everything from power stations to refrigerators .
Until now , efficient thermoelectric materials have used pricier metals such as bismuth or tellurium .
Switching over to silicon could have a global impact , allowing large - scale thermoelectric devices to be produced more cheaply .
The thermoelectric effect occurs when one end of a material , such as a wire , is heated .
Electrons travel to the colder end , producing an electrical current .
However , to harness this energy effectively it is critical that the temperature difference is maintained .
This requires a material with an unusual combination of properties - excellent electrical conductivity but poor heat conductivity .
As silicon conducts heat well , no - one was expecting it to be a good candidate .
But now , two teams have shown that silicon nanowires can act as efficient thermoelectric materials .
James Heath of the California Institute of Technology led one of the teams .
’ It was a surprise , ’ he told Chemistry World .
’ We found that when you make extremely small silicon nanowires there are some fundamental differences in how these materials behave and transfer heat . ’
" It was a surprise .
We found that when you make extremely small silicon nanowires there are some fundamental differences in how these materials behave and transfer heat " - James Heath
Heath believes that with further research the efficiency of these materials could be boosted even further .
The technology could help to cool and power microchips in the future , he added .
A second team , led by Peidong Yang at the University of California in Berkeley , took a different approach and used much larger nanowires .
’ Our trick was to use lots of defects , ’ said Yang .
’ We made silicon nanowires with very rough surfaces and then doped these nanowires with boron .
The defects help to block the atomic vibrations that produce heat flow , but still allow electrical current to flow . ’
Francis DiSalvo has worked extensively on thermoelectric materials at the Cornell Fuel Cell Institute , Cornell University , New York .
’ This research is exciting but there is still some way to go , ’ he told Chemistry World .
One important role for thermoelectric materials would be capturing heat that is lost during energy production by power stations or car engines , DiSalvo said .
’ If these materials can be made cheaply enough , capturing even a fraction of this wasted heat would make them worthwhile , ’ he added .

The European space agency has taken the most detailed composite picture of the earth ever .
GlobCover bimonthly global composite for May to June 2005 based on Envisat ’s Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer ( MERIS ) instrument working in Full Resolution Mode with a spatial resolution of 300 metres .
Around 40 terabytes of imagery â€ “ an amount of data equivalent to the content of 40 million books â€ “ were acquired between December 2004 and June 2006 and processed to generate the global composites .
The composites will support the international community in modelling climate change extent and impacts , studying ecosystems and plotting worldwide land - use trends .
An example of another image taken with the satellite .
The latest issue of AOPA Pilot magazine contains the following data :
In 1967 , median household income in the U.S. was $ 12,000 and a four - seat Piper Cherokee was $ 16,000 .
Today , median income is roughly $ 48,000 and the same airplane ( they still make it ! ) is $ 230,000 .
Where it took 16 months of income to buy a basic four - seat airplane in 1967 , it takes 57 months now .
The question is “ Why ? ”
Airplanes are made in small quantities and have not benefited from automation and capital investment in tooling the way that automobiles have , so you would n’t expect their price relative to incomes to have fallen .
On the other hand , there have been some efficiencies introduced such as computer - controlled machining so the number of labor hours should have been slightly reduced .
Workers in airplane factories are not paid more than average and roughly the same number of working hours are required to build an airplane .
Airplane companies are not ridiculously profitable .
In fact , many struggle to survive .
People often cite litigation as a reason for aircraft being expensive and say that one third of the price of a new airplane goes to liability insurance , but that still does n’t account for most of the increase .
It ca n’t be regulation because the FAA was just as bureaucratic back then and most of the designs that are being produced today were certified in the 1950s and 1960s .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
As the interview is ending , Jay Greenberg sneaks in one of his goals for next year .
" I have to learn to drive , as well . "
Composer Jay Greenberg , at 15 , has written more than 100 classical works , and hopes to learn to drive next year .
more photos »
From most 15 - year - olds , this would hardly be an exceptional comment .
But Greenberg is about to be given a thunderous standing ovation by a capacity concert crowd at New York 's Carnegie Hall , one of the world 's toughest proving grounds in classical music .
It 's the premiere of his 25 - minute tour - de - force violin concerto .
This is a huge , difficult work , played in one long movement so sophisticated that the estimable Orchestra of St. Luke 's has had to add an extra rehearsal to pull it together .
Under the direction of conductor Roberto Abbado , the piece on the last Sunday of October enters the American contemporary - classical canon with an acclaimed virtuoso at its helm :
That 's Joshua Bell , easily the most famous violinist of two generations , hair flying , Strad - straining , bravura - bowing those final stabbing , triumphant chords of the piece into massive , slamming sculptures of sound .
Jay Greenberg talks about his work at the premiere of his new violin concerto »
And then Bell is gesturing to someone in the audience , pointing to the stage - right steps .
Navy blazer , smart ecru trousers , a neat half - Windsor knot in his necktie , a scholar 's wire - rims -- when Greenberg accepts
Bell 's handshake , everyone in the great room knows that the guys joining hands here are essentially brothers in a strange , sterling , rare bond :
The mystery of musical prodigy .
Greenberg , who has composed more than 100 works , started playing a child 's cello at age 2 and finished high school at age 14 , the same year Sony released a CD of the London Symphony Orchestra playing his Fifth Symphony .
Understand that to compose for a full orchestra , one must not only imagine the music but also know each instrument 's capabilities , range , contributing voice to the whole -- and be able to capture and write that sea of sonics into submission .
Greenberg composes on computer .
See a gallery of photos from Jay Greenberg 's work and life »
Bell was handed a violin at age 4 and now has more than 30 CDs out , four Grammy nominations , two Grammy wins , and the coveted Fisher Prize .
He is one of the World Economic Forum 's Young Global Leaders and plays more than 200 international bookings per year .
Inspiring and bringing forward the work of composers is a major interest for him , as proved by the release in September of his recording of John Corigliano 's Red Violin Concerto .
Read an interview with Corigliano about his concerto and Bell 's recording
In December , Greenberg will turn 16 , Bell will turn 40 .
When asked what his buddies think of having a friend who has written five symphonies , more than 12 piano sonatas , three piano concertos , plus string quartets and more , Greenberg 's answer is as rich as his art : " I really do n't spend much time interacting with other people . "
" If anything , " Greenberg says , " I 'd rather the publicity had been postponed for about 10 years from when they began " to interview him on National Public Radio and on CBS News ' " 60 Minutes . "
That way , " I 'd have to start out getting pieces played at schools and universities and benefits and the like -- like normal composers .
And then eventually when my talents are better formed have all the commissions and interviewers coming in . "
But some might ask why he would want the press delayed .
The New York Times ' Steve Smith hears the violin concerto and writes of " gleefully jigging motifs and bawdy brass outbursts . "
The Associated Press ' Martin Steinberg describes " a violent arpeggio " for Bell " that gets the music off and running . "
The bottom line , as Steinberg puts it , is that " the 15 - year - old composer is for real . "
And yet , even as such accolades fly by , Greenberg concedes , " I actually find it irritating that people are constantly going on " about his age .
Whose music does he like to hear ?
" In chronological order , Bach ; Mozart ; Beethoven ; a little bit of Brahms , some of his later pieces , maybe ; Prokofiev ; Stravinsky ; Bartok ; some Copland ; Ives .
You can look at my iPod , there 's a lot of stuff in there . "
How much time does it take to write full - length works for large orchestra ?
" It does n't really take all that much time .
I might spend one day a week [ writing music ] and then spend 12 hours of that day composing a piece . "
What else does he do with his time ?
" I like reading books .
I 'm actually fond of hiking and doing stuff outdoors .
I think first I have to adopt a stricter exercise regimen .
...
Lately , I 've been going to many more contemporary music concerts and listening to the stuff that other people write these days . "
Greenberg is the son of Robert Greenberg , who teaches linguistics at Yale , and Orna Weinroth , a painter .
He says his 11 - year - old brother , Michael , might be a dancer - in - the - making , and also plays flute .
Greenberg says he does not quite hear entire works in his head at once , as journalists once understood him to be saying .
" At the age of 12 , " he says with a quick smile , " I was not exactly the most articulate of individuals around . "
Instead , he says , he tends to " hear " his music in sections .
" I might have 87 bars on January 1 , then nothing until January 26 .
At that point , there would be another 52 bars .
And so on , and so forth .
I write down the first theme .
And then six months later , I have another idea " for a piece .
" I go back to that first theme and think , ' They would work pretty well together . '
So I put them together in a piece .
Then a week later , maybe another idea , and say , ' That would be a good ending to the piece . ' "
That pattern of working in intermittent , intense periods is a pattern translated to his school life , he says .
Teachers used to wonder why his homework was late , only to be amazed when he 'd suddenly hand them " all the assignments for the rest of the month . "
" Jay finished public high school in New Haven last year , " his mother says .
" He took Latin , philosophy and music composition classes at Yale , and this semester he is applying for colleges with the hope of getting a scholarship .
" We suggested , " she adds , " that he wait and go kayaking and rock climbing until he is 16 before going off elsewhere . "
But the guy is really focused on his music .
Somehow he does n't seem the bum - around - for - a - year type .
Even during rehearsals at Carnegie for this new Violin Concerto , he dashes out and buys some staff paper .
He has an idea .
And a backstage conversation reveals that as intriguing as this kind of extraordinary capability can be to us , it can be just as tantalizing to the composer in question , who may very well wonder what he 's writing next .
" So what 's the new piece ? " asks his manager , Charles Letourneau of IMG Artists .
" Well , it 's a sketch at the moment , " Greenberg says .
" And what 's it going to be ? "
" I have n't the faintest idea . "

Do you have any idea how much work I put into my costume ?
It took me almost 3 hours to do the makeup alone .
Every detail painstakingly thought of and completed , right down to the little scratches on the hands and the grazings and cuts on the arms and legs .
Do you have any idea how long it took me to find a suitable shield and sword ?
Or how about the battle uniform ?
I bet you did n't even consider that perhaps it was actually straight off the movie set .
Well , it was .
It was n't cheap , doing all this .
I was the one that incurred those expenses , not my parents .
I burned the income from more hours of my after - school job than I would care to admit on that damn costume , all to amuse and impress people like you .
And I did it with the expectation that there would be a return on my investment ; namely in the form of candy .
Sweet , sugary goodness .
Heck , even money would have been fine -- some of your neighbors did just that .
Loot conveniently placed into that huge sack ; and what 's more , I would even be willing to walk all over town collecting it so that people did n't have to deliver it to me .
Yes , the outfit , the sword , the shield , the sack ... all very heavy ; close to 60 pounds in all that I pack - muled all over town , but no pain no gain , right ?
This was to be my last year of the trick or treating thing .
I 'm getting a little too tall , a little too old .
This was my grand finale ; my blaze of glory , my shining farewell .
Sure , I could have ' dressed up ' like a teenager like so many others I saw on the streets last night , but I wanted to go out in style .
Let it never be said I was unwilling to work for my loot .
Your house seemed so promising as I approached .
3 nicely carved pumpkins , some of that fake spider webbing , even one of those fog machines .
I had you pegged for a Sour Patch Kids person .
So imagine my surprise when , after trudging up your ridiculously steep driveway and ringing your doorbell , your bulbous ass appeared with a basket full of stuff that was most definitely NOT candy .
Before I could pull back , you had already reached a claw into the basket , pulled out that little booklet , and seemingly - annoyingly tossed it into my bag .
What 's worse is your saggy old ass actually appeared to expect me to say thank you for it .
Trick or treat indeed , you old hag .
When I got home to divide out the fruits of my labor , my worst fears were confirmed :
It was one of those Jehovah 's Witness ' God loves you ' pamphlets .
I thought you delusional psychopaths did n't even believe in holidays and did n't celebrate them .
What , annoying me by waking me up early on a Saturday morning by beating down my door to try and convert me not enough , so you have to resort to trickery ?
What on Earth would have made you think I , or anyone else , had any interest in getting one of those from you , you fat sow ?
Your house was fairly large , in a nice part of town .
Was it just that you were too much of a cheap cum drizzling gutter slut to spend a few bucks on some bags of candy instead of getting those booklets free from your ' church ' ?
You 're even worse than that jerk that gave me a toothbrush -- at least I can shave the handle of his gift into a prison shank and use it for protection next time one of my classmates decides to bring an Uzi to school and shoot the place up .
What am I supposed to do with your thing ?
Hold it up to him and yell out " The power of Christ compels you ! " ?
I mean really , why would anyone think that on Halloween people are open to being converted into believing in some invisible sky fairy that magically grants wishes if you beg it hard enough and donate some of your money to its church ?
Do you not even understand the point ?
Again , thanks for nothing .
I 'm sure when your gargantuan ass rolled out of bed this morning , shimmied into your mumu and waddled out front to get your newspaper you were quite surprised .
Allow me to explain .
Your pumpkins were deceitfully carved and placed to lure unsuspecting children into your GodTrap .
Therefore , they needed to be smashed all over your porch .
And those spider web things were just hanging there , so it seemed a perfect place to hang the gunk from the pumpkins on so they would properly dry out for future baking .
Your neighbors ended up giving me just a little over 9 dollars by the time it was all said and done , which was just enough for me to buy a few rolls of toilet paper , some saran wrap a small package of bologna and a Blow Pop from the store .
The TP you found strewn all over anything in your yard it would hang from or stick to is Quilted Northern , double ply -- let it never be said that I am a cheap corner - cutting individual such as yourself .
The cold cuts ?
Well , I had to make some sort of a bread crumb trail to bring your attention to how I had so thoughtfully gift wrapped your car in the saran wrap , and I figured bread crumbs would n't be cholesterol - ridden enough to be tempting enough to motivate your thunderous girth to follow it .
I thought about using lard or butter , but there 's always the risk of it raining and washing away .
And the Blow Pop ?
Nay , it was not for me ; that is my gift to you -- lovingly placed upon your welcome mat , a friendly reminder of an example of what you SHOULD have been handing out last night .
Plus , I figure sucking is something that comes naturally to you , so you would find it a welcome treat .
Oh , and thank you for the fog machine .
It 's lovely , and I will put it to use next year when I join the ranks of people who are behind the door handing out the candy as opposed to in front of it collecting .
I did all this not for myself , you see .
Nay , the damage was already done for me , there was no making it right .
I did this to protect my fellow trick - or - treaters that will carry on the torch next year and continue in the tradition as I hang up my pillow case and look back at a fruitful candy - gathering career .
Hopefully this will inspire you to just do us all a favor and leave your god damned light OFF next Halloween instead of luring unsuspecting youngsters into your bible - thumping web of horror .
I 'm sure a night of darkness should n't be hard for you , since I 'm positive every man who 's ever gotten drunk enough to sleep with you probably still demanded pitch black while he did the deed .
Happy Halloween , you shriveled up old bat .
Sincerely , King Leonidas
Giant coils of lava on Mars suggest a mysterious network of valleys on the planet was born from volcanoes , researchers say .
The origin of the Athabasca Valles region near the equator of Mars has been debated for more than a decade .
Some researchers have proposed that lava once shaped the valleys , while others have thought ice was responsible .
The way the ground there is patterned with multisided polygons suggests that either fire or ice could be the culprit — such patterns of cracks might have formed due to seasonal fluctuations in temperature if the surface there was rich in ice , but also might have arose as lava cooled and fractured .
Now high - resolution images beamed back by NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter of the Red Planet have revealed 269 spirals of lava that researchers say cannot be explained by ice - related activity .
[ Photos From NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ]
" This is the first time lava coils have been identified on an extraterrestrial setting , " study lead author Andrew Ryan at Arizona State University told SPACE.com .
" The most surprising thing about these features when I first saw them was how well - preserved they are . "
Ryan spotted all these coils , ranging from 16 to 98 feet wide ( 5 to 30 meters ) , by eye .
" You can't see them unless you zoom in really close , and even then they 're really subtle — it 's pretty dusty there , so the images are just a pale gray color , and they do n't really jump out until you boost the contrast , so it 's not surprising at all to me that they 've been overlooked before , " Ryan said .

These spirals resemble lava coils on Earth , such as those forming on the surface of Hawaiian lava flows .
" These can only be explained by lava processes , " Ryan said .
" There are no known processes to twist ice around on that scale . "
Future modeling of how these spirals formed can help figure out the composition of these lavas , " which can tell you about the composition of the Martian crust and mantle , things we do n't know much about , " Ryan said .
Mars is the home of the largest known volcano in the solar system , Olympus Mons , which towers over Mars ' western hemisphere .
At 16 miles ( 25 km ) high , it is about three times as tall as Mount Everest , Earth 's highest mountain .
The $ 720 million Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in September 2005 .
The scientists detailed their findings in the April 27 issue of the journal Science .

Being awell - dressed suborbital space traveler translates into style as well as safety .
OrbitalOutfitters strutted out the world ?s first commercial spacesuit here at the XPrize Cup festivities ?
their approach to solving the engineering , safety andmarketing appeal of an emergency crew suit .
Dubbed the Industrial Suborbital Space Suit - Crew ( or IS3C for short ) , the garment waspresented in catwalk - like fashion , a first generation prototype that OrbitalOutfitters envision as the new free - fall collection of apparel .
Jeff Feige , Chief Executive Officer for Orbital Outfitters , was master of ceremonies forthe space suit ?s debut .
He noted that the lines are getting longer for thosemaking reservations to fly aboard the first suborbital spaceliners .
?
Ourmission is to provide low - cost , industrial quality spacesuits and relatedservices to companies providing commercial and government space travel , ? herelated in a press statement .
The idea isto create a high quality IS3C system for space flight crews .
Orbital Outfittersis implementing a leasing arrangement for the suit to help contain up - frontcosts for customers .
An array ofnew technologies has been incorporated in the IS3C suits .
Modern fabrics aswell as special materials let ?

out while still maintaining a pressurizedenvironment .
Fashionconscious
Paraded onstage , the suit has all the needs of the more fashion conscious among us ?
melding style and function , but also a bit retro in appearance .
Customers don? tjust want to know they are safe , but they want to look good as well , pointedout officials from Orbital Outfitters .
And the helmet comes complete witheasy - to - use visor too .
Whilelooking smart in space is one thing , the IS3C is no toy .
It is crafted to keep thewearer alive in the event of a cabin de-pressurization during a suborbitaljaunt .
The outerlayer of the suit has been designed to be customizable to the needs of thecompanies ?
that is any select color of a commercial suborbital flightoperator .

If you enjoy bitter beers , it might not be a very -- forgive me -- hoppy new year .
A worldwide shortage of hops may mean higher prices for some favorite local microbrews .
Hops , a perennial vine , provide beer 's bitter flavor .
The hops shortage stems from major crop failures in Europe , growing beer sales in China and South America and , thanks to the weak dollar , rising exports of American hop varieties .
The shortage is expected to last through 2008 , and the market could remain unstable into 2011 , due to the amount of time it takes to establish hop vines .
" It 's what everyone in the craft brewing industry is talking about , " says Tom Porter , owner of Arena - based Lake Louie beers .
Last Friday , Porter delivered the last cases of his hoppiest beer , the India pale ale Kiss the Lips , to area stores .
The IPA style is known for aggressive bitterness , thanks to the generous amounts of hops that go into making it .
( Hops are a preservative , and IPAs originated in the 1700s , when the British discovered highly hopped beers could better withstand long sea voyages to India . )
" We 're crazy for hoppy beer , " states Porter .
" [ Kiss the Lips ] is my favorite of my beers , and I 'm bummed that I can't brew it right now -- that is , unless I find a lucky dime that points me to some hops . "
Even if Porter turns up more hops , they 'll cost more than a few lucky dimes .
Some varieties of hops have increased from $ 3 per pound to more than $ 40 .
In the meantime , Porter does n't expect Kiss the Lips to be on local shelves again until next fall at the earliest .
One of the area 's most popular beers is Ale Asylum 's Hopalicious .
" I was running short of the hops needed for it this fall and was really worried , " says Dean Coffey , owner and brewmaster at the east - side brewery .
" The Great Dane loaned me a box of hops to get me by .
That box of hops is worth more than $ 1,000 , or four times what it cost last year . "
This generosity among local brewers reflects the seriousness of the situation in what is normally a very competitive business .
" We are all talking , trying to help each other find hop varieties , and we 're willing to jointly make a buy if we find one to make , " says Porter .
Brewers generally purchase hops under contract from wholesalers , one or more years before the hops are used .
So the shortage is bad news for brewers who do n't have a contract , or who want more hops than they contracted for .
" Right now , if you wanted to start a brewery or brewpub I do n't know how you could do it , without hops , " says Coffey .
" I got lucky .
I had never signed a contract for hops until last summer , and I did it just before all this broke .
Otherwise I would be in serious trouble . "
What does the shortage mean for local beer drinkers ?
Look for a jump in the price of Wisconsin - made microbrew this year , from 50 cents to $ 2 more per six - pack .
Also affecting the price is the rising cost of bottles and grains , including malted barley , which has fermentable sugars that are turned into bubbles and alcohol .
" I 'm already paying over 20 % more for malt and bottles , " says Porter .
Some brews will be affected more than others .
" Right now , locally , we tend to see stronger sales of the sweet winter beers , " says Porter .
" But come summer , the bitter flavors are even more popular , and you 'll see fewer hoppy beers to pick from . "
The shortage also will affect home brewers .
" The variety of hops they can find will force them to be more creative , " says David Mitchell , owner of Madison 's Wine and Hop Shop .
" Two of the eight most commonly used hops in homebrewing are all gone for 2008 , and more varieties will follow . "
Mitchell already is limiting the amount of hops he sells per purchase : 6 ounces for each $ 50 order .
One consequence of the shortage is renewed interest in locally grown hops , but since newly planted hops do n't mature for three years , no immediate relief is in sight .
Wisconsin was a leading hop producer 150 years ago , but today most U.S. hops are produced in the Pacific Northwest .
For now , Mark Duchow , brewmaster at Mount Horeb 's Grumpy Troll Restaurant and Brewery , says he has about 75 % of the hops he would like to have on hand for 2008 .
As an experiment , he will be releasing a beer in the coming weeks made with locally grown wild hops .
Duchow affirms that for small brewers who run short of hops , one alternative is to make sweeter , maltier beers .
So if you enjoy the full - bodied Belgian ales and fruity Lambics , there could be opportunities for you in what is otherwise a -- forgive me -- hopless situation .
A question we often find ourselves asking is just how much raising swine in the great state of California contributes to global warming .
Now , with help from the data released by the Air Resources Board ,
I can definitively tell you that raising swine in this state generated 0.0116149133041726 million metric tons of greenhouse gases , the equivalent of burning 1.3 million gallons of gasoline .
The US is balking at capping its greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels , but here in California , a law known as AB 32 has done just that .
Implementing the policy required that the state do a complete inventory of its GHG emissions from 1990 on , so it could actually determine what the cap should be .
That meant calculating the emissions from hundreds of sources from dairy cows to jet fuel to passenger cars .
Here at Wired Science , we figure that you are nerds like us who love data , so we made the ARB spreadsheet a little friendlier , calculated gallons of gas equivalents out of the metric tons of greenhouse gases , and have posted the Excel doc for 2004 in glorious detail here : California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Breakdown .
Take a look and find your very own favorite greenhouse gas emissions category .
UPDATE ( 5:50 PM ) : By popular demand , here 's a Google doc of the sheet .
There 's also a serious side to seeing this data .
My hope is that our readers will get an idea of where , exactly , greenhouse gas emissions are coming from because it's not all passenger cars and factories .
Natural gas for heating , oil refining , dairy cows , nitrogen in fertilizer , and dozens of other sources contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change .
This is discouraging stuff .
As this spreadsheet makes clear , many parts of our modern processes are dirty , generating carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , methane ( CH4 ) , and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) .
But it 's also heartening to see this big huge problem – global warming !
– broken down into categories in a spreadsheet .
We can look , line - by - line , at major areas where we can reduce our emissions through efficiency and innovation .
Often , when we think about energy efficiency in a category like homes , we think about its operating efficiency , but it takes a lot of energy ( and therefore emissions ) to create the house in the first place .
Take manufacturing cement , the 33rd most polluting activity in California .
A company called CalStar announced they got $ 3.4 million last month from Foundation Capital to commercialize their eco-friendly cement .
They are a long way from producing enough cement to fulfill demand , but it 's a good step towards redesigning the building material system .
Pour the foundation with CalStar cement and then use Serious Materials EcoRock for drywall , and you start to see an ecosystem developing that will allow you to build a green house that generates a lot less greenhouse gases .

A RIOT in Bern , letter bombs at centre - right politicians ' homes : these are not what one expects in Switzerland .
Extremists on left and right have dominated the news in the weeks leading up to the general election on October 21st .
As ever , the focus is on the far - right Swiss People 's Party ( SVP ) of Christoph Blocher , who is justice minister in the federal government .
Yet neither his bluster nor that of his opponents is likely to lead to a big shift in voting .
Mr Blocher and his chums took control of the SVP in the 1990s .
He used the referendum system to keep Switzerland well away from the European Union , and he persistently blamed immigration for the country 's ills .
His brand of populist nationalism struck a chord with many Swiss citizens .
The party doubled its share of the national vote in 12 years to reach 26.7 % , ahead of the three other main parties , at the 2003 election .
With the biggest share of parliamentary seats , the SVP won a second ministerial post in Switzerland 's seven - strong federal government , at the expense of the Christian Democrats .
This was the first time that the “ magic formula ” power - sharing arrangement among the four parties had changed since 1959 , and it put the SVP on the same footing as the Socialists and the centre - right Radicals .
Yet for all the headlines , the SVP 's rise seems to have all but halted .
Opinion polls give it roughly the same vote as four years ago .
Mr Blocher 's transition from anti-establishment government critic into justice minister has done little for his ratings .
Polls suggest that he is one of the least popular ministers .
He often alludes in public to disagreements with his six cabinet colleagues , a practice that is frowned on by most consensus - minded Swiss .
The SVP 's tone continues to be shrill , and it draws accusations of xenophobia , especially from the left and in francophone western Switzerland .
The party wants a referendum to ban the construction of minarets at Muslim places of worship .
A poster depicting three white sheep kicking a black sheep off the Swiss flag has triggered protests , culminating in a riot in Bern on October 6th when hundreds of left - wing extremists clashed with police during an SVP election rally .
The SVP insists feebly that the poster is aimed at expelling foreigners convicted of crimes , not at immigrants in general .
With the economy ticking over quite healthily , immigration and the environment have emerged as the biggest issues for Swiss voters .
The first may help the SVP , but the second is boosting the Green Party , now the fastest - rising political force .
It may even break through the 10 % mark for the first time .
Some political analysts conclude that the SVP has reached a plateau from which it will eventually fall back .
“ I think the SVP will decline once Mr Blocher is n't there .
They 'll lose 5 % in one go , ” says Hans Hirter of the University of Bern .
But that may be some time off : Mr Blocher is just 67 .
Home » forums » LtU Forum OMeta : an Object - Oriented Language for Pattern Matching OMeta : an Object - Oriented Language for Pattern Matching A new paper by Alessandro Warth and Ian Piumarta , related to the Reinvention of Programming project :
This paper introduces OMeta , a new object - oriented lan -
guage for pattern matching .
OMeta is based on a variant of
Parsing Expression Grammars ( PEGs ) [ 5 ] â€ ” a recognition -
based foundation for describing syntaxâ € ” which we have
extended to handle arbitrary kinds of data .
We show that
OMetaâ€™s general - purpose pattern matching provides a nat -
ural and convenient way for programmers to implement
tokenizers , parsers , visitors , and tree transformers , all of
which can be extended in interesting ways using familiar
object - oriented mechanisms .
This makes OMeta particularly
well - suited as a medium for experimenting with new designs
for programming languages and extensions to existing lan -
guages .

Europa , a Jovian moon , is in half shadow in this color - enhanced image from the Galileo spacecraft .
The cracks in the icy surface are thought to be caused by heated up - wellings of the water below .
Microbes similar to those found in the Earth 's ocean floor may exist on Europa .
NASA 'snewly issued budget has lowered a flagship mission of exploration to half - mast .
Backed by scientists and study groups , a mission to Jupiter 's moon Europa ismissing in action within the pages of NASA 's Fiscal Year 2007 budget unveiledyesterday .
Thesmallest of Jupiter 's Galilean satellites -- about the size of Earth 's Moon -- Europa has a facade of white and brown colored water ice .
Hidden under that frozencrust , Europa may well harbor a global ocean of liquid water .
And coupled tothe prospect for a subsurface ocean comes the tempting thought of life .
" NASA 'srobotic exploration program is being flat - lined , setting aside a mission toEuropa to search for its ice - covered ocean and perhaps for life itself , " PlanetarySociety Executive Director , Louis Friedman , said in a statement released Monday .
Boththe National Academy of Sciences and internal NASA advisory committees haveendorsed Europa exploration as the highest priority solar system objectiveafter Mars .
Lastyear , the U.S. Congress directed NASA to plan a fiscal year 2007 start on aEuropa mission .
" If the proposed budget is adopted , that directive will be ignored , and no Europa mission will be planned , " the Planetary Society statement noted .
So many false starts
" I am disappointed thatafter so many false starts over the last decade , it looks like a mission toEuropa is slipping once again , " said Ronald Greeley , a leading planetary scientist in the Department of Geological Sciences at Arizona State University in Tempe .
He also chairs a Europa focus group of scientists keen on furthering the study of the Jovian moon .
Greeley told SPACE .comthat the hope had been that a serious study of a Europa mission would becompleted this year in anticipation of a NASA new start very soon .
" Theplanetary community remains essentially unanimous in setting Europa as thehighest priority large mission to the outer solar system , " he said , inconfirmation of both external study groups and NASA committee recommendations .
Europaas well as Titan " are of extremely high scientific interest , " said JonathanLunine , Professor of Planetary Sciences and of Physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson .
Likethe Galileo spacecraft that bolstered the hunger to plumb the mysteries of Europa , the Cassini / Huygens probe has revealed Titan to be a captivating worlddemanding more scrutiny .
Missionsto both worlds should be flown " as the cornerstones of a vigorous effortto explore astrobiologically interesting bodies in the outer solar system , " Lunine said .
" The technology is there .
All that is needed is the will to exercise it , " he added .
Prometheus extinguished
The most recent debacle inthe pursuit to explore Europa was the NASA Prometheus effort -- making use anuclear reactor to power a set of ion thruster engines .
A first flight missionwas dubbed the Jupiter Icy Moon Orbiter -- JIMO for short .
JIMO was to search forevidence of global subsurface oceans on Jupiter 's three icy Galilean moons : Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto .
The mission was ballyhooed as setting the stagefor the next phase of exploring Jupiter and opening the rest of the outer solarsystem to detailed exploration .
The fire was extinguishedon Prometheus .
It flamed out given budget and technical stresses .
NASA chief , Mike Griffin , told a U.S.Senate subcommittee in May 2005 that JIMO was in his opinion , " too ambitious tobe attempted . "
Griffin said JIMO " was not a mission , in myjudgment , that was well - formed " and the mission 's original purpose was toexecute a scientific mission to Europa , " which is extremely interesting on ascientific basis , " he told lawmakers .
" It remains a very high priority , and youmay look forward , in the next year or so , maybe even sooner , to a proposal fora Europa mission as part of our science line , " Griffin testified .
" But we would not -- we would , again , not -- favor linking that to a nuclear propulsion system . "
Fresh look needed
Afresh look at a Europa mission based on existing technologies is deserved , suggested Torrence Johnson , Chief Scientist , Solar System Exploration ProgramsDirectorate at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California .
Johnsonsaid that using the technology developed during past work on a Europa Orbiter , as well as the JIMO studies , helps justify going forward on plotting out a newand highly - productive Europa mission .
" Wehave continued to study what can be done with existing technology to make a viableEuropa mission with a great data return possible , " Johnson told SPACE.com .
He noted that his personal and professional opinions on the matter are his ownand do not , in any way reflect the opinion or policy of JPL .
Astrobiology potential
RobertPappalardo , Assistant Professor in the University of Colorado at Boulder 's Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences and Laboratory forAtmospheric and Space Physics said the outer planets community of scientists hasstamped priority " # 1 " on exploring Europa .
A leading look at a spacecraft forthat mission is tagged the Europa Explorer .
Imbued with radiation hardeningtechnology for a longer stay - time in orbit around Europa , as well asEarth - to - Europa trajectory pluses , a mission to this moon is far more compellingnow than in previous times , he said .
" We 'vespent quite a bit of time and effort trying to understand was Mars once ahabitable environment .
Europa today , probably , is a habitable environment , " Pappalardo advised .
" We need to confirm this ... but Europa , potentially , has allthe ingredients for life ... and not just four billion years ago ... but today . "
Anuclear - powered Europa Explorer would be loaded with scientific gear .
Forexample , the Europa orbiting spacecraft could be outfitted with ice - penetratingradar to detect shallow water , or partial melt .
If the moon 's icy face is thin , or thin in spots , that radar could possibly penetrate through the ice to anocean .
Alsoonboard would be a camera system , infrared sensor hardware , as well asequipment to discern the crunching , cracking , creaking , and overall strength of Europa 's ice shell - to help validate that the moon really does have a globalliquid water ocean , Pappalardo explained .
Oneadditional payload on Europa Explorer : a simple lander .
Pappalardosaid a lander is still being bandied about , but carrying what kind oftechnology and at what cost are questions awaiting answers .
" We 'renot going to search for life with this mission .
But just like the Mars roversin their search for habitable environments ... we 're going to characterize thehabitability of Europa , " Pappalardo said .
Anorbiter to the moon of Jupiter would allow a now sketchy view to become sharpas to how this world works , Pappalardo concluded .
This mission , he said , hascompelling science and broad community support and " we 're ready to go . "
Works in progress
WhileNASA 's new budget carries dire news , there are other works - in - progress in termsof Jupiter and the study of Europa .
In June of last year NASA announced that a mission to fly to Jupiter will proceed to a preliminary design phase .
That program is called Juno , and it is the second in NASA 's New Frontiers Program - of which the now en route New Horizons mission to Pluto is the first in this category .
JUNO would conduct a first - time , in - depth study of the planet Jupiter .
It must be ready for launch no later than June 30 , 2010 , within a mission cost cap of $ 700 million .
Also , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) is currently studying the Jovian Minisat Explorer ( JME ) .
The JME focuses on exploration of the Jovian system and particularly theexploration of its moon Europa .
The ESA study is also looking into deploying a compactmicroprobe onto Europa to perform on - the - spot measurement of the moon 's icecrust .

Historian : Bush use of quote ' perverse '
A historian quoted by President Bush to help argue that critics of the administration ’s Iraq policy echo those who questioned the U.S. effort to bring democracy to Japan after World War II angrily distanced himself from the president ’s remarks Thursday .
“ They [ war supporters ] keep on doing this , ” said MIT professor John Dower .
“ They keep on hitting it and hitting it and hitting it and it ’s always more and more implausible , strange and in a fantasy world .
They ’re desperately groping for a historical analogy , and their uses of history are really perverse . ”

In a speech on Wednesday , Bush quoted “ one historian ” as suggesting that foreign policy experts – and , by implication , critics of Bush ’s approach to Iraq – are n’t always right .
“ An interesting observation , one historian put it , ‘ Had these erstwhile experts ’ — he was talking about people criticizing the efforts to help Japan realize the blessings of a free society — he said , ‘ Had these erstwhile experts had their way , the very notion of inducing a democratic revolution would have died of ridicule at an early stage . ’ ” [ Update : See clip of the president 's speech and MSNBC interview with Dower , courtesy of Breitbart.tv , here . ]
A search of Google books revealed that the “ one historian ” is Dower .
The quote is from his book , “ Embracing Defeat : Japan in the Wake of World War II , ” which won the National Book Award and the Bancroft Prize , among other awards , in 1999 .
Dower was decidedly unhappy with his 15 minutes of fame .
“ I have always said as a historian that the use of Japan [ in arguing for the likelihood of successfully bringing democracy to Iraq ] is a misuse of history , ” he said when notified of the Bush quote .
He immediately directed me to a November 2002 New York Times op - ed where he outlined 10 reasons why “ most of the factors that contributed to the success of nation - building in occupied Japan would be absent in an Iraq militarily defeated by the United States . ”
In March 2003 , Dower wrote an essay for Boston Review , entitled “ A Warning From History : Do n’t Expect Democracy in Iraq . ”
And what about the specific quote Bush used – that experts on Japan were wrong about the country ’s capability for democracy ?
“ Whoever pulled that quote out for him [ Bush ] is very clever , ” Dower said , acknowledging that “ if you listen to the experts prior to the invasion of Japan , they all said that Japan ca n’t become democratic . ”
But there are major differences , Dower said .
“ I ’m not being misquoted , but I ’m being misrepresented . ”
“ In the case of Iraq , ” Dower said , “ the administration went in there without any of the kind of preparation , thoughtfulness , understanding of the country they were going into that did exist when we went into Japan .
Even if the so - called experts said we could n’t do it , there were years of mid-level planning and discussions before they went in .
They were prepared .
They laid out a very clear agenda at an early date . ”
White House spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush used Dower ’s quote “ to in no way endorse his view of Iraq , only his view of Japan . ”
Added Fratto : “ While professor Dower may disagree with the applicability of the quote , the president in no way endorses his view of Iraq . ”

What piece of exercise equipment sells for under $ 20 , fits into a briefcase , can be used by the whole family , and improves cardiovascular fitness while toning muscle at the same time ?
And using it for just 15 - 20 minutes will burn off the calories from a candy bar ?
The answer : a jump rope .
Jumping rope is a great calorie - burner .
You 'd have to run an eight - minute mile to work off more calories than you 'd burn jumping rope .
Use the WebMD Calorie Counter to figure out how many calories you 'll burn for a given activity , based on your weight and the duration of exercise .
" It 's certainly good for the heart , " says Peter Schulman , MD , associate professor , Cardiology / Pulmonary Medicine , University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington .
" It strengthens the upper and lower body and burns a lot of calories in a short time , but other considerations will determine if it 's appropriate for an individual . "
He sees rope - jumping as something fit adults can use to add spice to their exercise routine .
" You 're putting direct stress on knees , ankles , and hips , but if done properly it 's a lower - impact activity than jogging . "
School 's homeland security studies get noticed JOPPA , Md.  Call it vocational education for the 9/11 generation .
The nation 's first comprehensive high school homeland security program , a three - year course to help kids land jobs in the growing anti-terrorism industry , is in its infancy in Maryland .
But it 's recently been attracting the attention of educators and school districts from as far away as California and Florida .
The program , started at Maryland 's Joppatowne High School with 61 sophomores , provides " an opportunity for kids to see relevance to being in school , " says Frank Mezzanotte of the Harford ( Md. ) County Public Schools .
" It gives kids additional options . "
COOL SCHOOL : Course helps Md. teens become better citizens Students have toured a Coast Guard command center , visited a county detection center , practiced emergency response in a fictional town called " Joppaville " and heard an Iraqi - born speaker explain cultural differences between Americans and Middle Easterners .
" We 're trying to set high expectations , " says student Megan Bell , 15 .
" We do n't want to be known as just the school with the good football team .
Now we have homeland security . "
Other school districts are taking notice .
Mezzanotte says he 's been contacted by individual schools and education departments in more than a half - dozen states .
" Joppatowne broke the ground for all of us , " says Lise Foran of Anne Arundel County Public Schools in Maryland .
Next fall , Meade High School will begin a Homeland Security program .
" We 're following in Joppatowne 's footsteps . "
And on Wednesday , Mezzanotte will be in Las Vegas , where he has been asked to give a presentation on the program to the Association for Career and Technical Education annual conference .
Some question whether the program will teach students to be open - minded about the government 's national security policies , given its goal of getting kids jobs with defense and homeland security contractors and the military .
The liberal magazine Mother Jones dubbed Joppatowne " the academy of military - industrial - complex studies . "
Jonathan Zimmerman , a New York University history of education professor , says " the devil lies in whether this is going to be a school for education or indoctrination . "
Other educators applaud the school for taking steps to prepare kids for one of the nation 's expanding job markets and for connecting what they learn in school to what 's happening in the real world .
" This sounds to me like it has all the earmarks of what keeps young people in school , " says former West Virginia governor Bob Wise , now head of the Alliance for Excellent Education .
" It gives them the skills necessary for the modern workplace . "
An 80 - minute class in the homeland security curriculum at Joppatowne High School last week featured Iraqi - born Haider Abbud , a former NATO adviser in Iraq , who described the cultural and religious differences between Middle Easterners and Americans .

Instead , the case stands as a striking example of the way witness intimidation has stymied law enforcement and allowed gangs to tyrannize entire communities .
The truce quickly unraveled .
The charges against the two gang members were dropped within a month .
Even a local program designed to coax young men out of gangs by buying them business suits has seen its limitations ; one participant had his outfit designed in Bloods red .
Ten months after Tajahnique was wounded , 18 - year - old Naquan Archie was shot and killed on the same corner during a robbery that the police believe was carried out by a member of the Bloods .
Neighbors and detectives say there were at least three witnesses , but none have identified the gunman .
“ I watched my nephew die in my apartment , ” said Mr. Archie ’s aunt , so terrified of retaliation that she would speak only on the condition her name not be published .
“ People saw him get shot .
But they know what ’s going to happen if they talk .
There ’s nothing anyone can do about it . ”
Such silence has spread over the last decade in cities across the country , as the proliferation of gangs like the Crips , Bloods and Latin Kings has made witnesses an endangered and elusive component of countless criminal investigations .
Criminologists say gang culture has made fair game of brutally punishing anyone who helps the police .
What results is a self - perpetuating cycle of intimidation and helplessness : residents refuse to risk their lives by helping a police force that cannot protect them ; the authorities say they are powerless to lock up gang members without witnesses willing to testify .
In Trenton , a city of 85,000 where the police estimate that the Bloods have as many as 2,000 members , overall crime is down and officials say violence is largely confined to areas where gangs are most prevalent .
But gang killings remain a persistent problem .
There were 20 homicides in the city last year ; the police have made arrests in nine of the 16 killings they consider gang related , and in three of the others .
In the first half of this year , murders increased by 50 percent .
Comment :
This striking illusion helps us understand the role of the neuronal brain mechanism for size constancy in visual perception .
I do n’t know what the creators of the illusion would say , but this is how it seems to me .
The two images are each composed of two facial expressions , namely * calm * and * angry * .
However , in the face on the left the angry features are composed of high spatial - frequency components , and the calm features are composed of low spatial - frequency components .
For the face on the right , calm is expressed by high spatial - frequency features and angry is low frequency .
If we view the two faces from a distance of 1 foot , the high - frequency features dominate so the left face is angry while the right face is calm .
If we view the faces from a distance of 10 feet , the low - frequency features dominate so the left face is calm while the right face is angry .
This all happens because the size - constancy mechanism in the visual system expands the brain ’s representation of the faces to compensate as their retinal size contracts tenfold when we move back from a 1 - foot view to a 10 - foot view .
As this happens , visual resolution is degraded with the increase in viewing distance , and the low - frequency features become dominant .
Hence the switch in facial expression .
For a detailed neuronal model of the brain ’s putative size - constancy mechanism see * The Cognitive Brain * , pp. 89 -93 .
If there is another explanation for this illusion , I would very much like to see it .

Large code bases are the problem , not the language they ’re written in .
Find a way to break / decompose big code bases into little ones .
Do not follow in the foot steps of the Sages .
Seek what they sought .
Can we please stop calling each other silly names over the languages we choose and move on to calling each other silly names over our choices for writing literate programs , eliminating redundancy , decoupling modules from each other , and so forth ?
The very next time you find yourself being drawn into a debate about Java vs.
Ruby , try saying something obscure , such as , Java is the right answer to the wrong question , Ruby is the wrong answer to the right question and see if you can redirect the energy towards exploring new ground instead of stagnating in the same old tired place .
When we argue Java vs. Ruby , or testing vs. type checking , we are arguing about foot steps .
Take the debate to the next level .
What is it we are trying to accomplish with those features ?
What are we seeking ?
My favourite example of this is the subject of automatic refactoring .
My current text editor does n’t perform automatic refactoring ( ducks ) .
Are you about to blast a flaming comment or perhaps an entire blog post explaining what a dunderhead I am for not using an IDE that can move a method with a single dialog box ?
Stop for a moment .
Why do we move methods ?
What are we trying to accomplish ?
What is it about our code after we have refactored that makes the code better ?
Now you have a really juicy comment to make , a deep and insightful point of view to bring to a discussion .
Let ’s talk about that quality of good code first , and then we can talk about how to get there later , if ever .
So the next time you read that “ Strong , static typing is superior because it enables the IDE to provide automatic refactoring support , ” take a deep breath .
Do n’t nod and agree .
Do n’t shake your head and disagree .
Ask a polite question :
What are we trying to accomplish with automatic refactoring ?
And when told that “ Unit tests are superior to compiler type checking for catching bugs , ” do n’t settle for “ catching bugs ” as axiomatic .
Ask what quality really means for code .
Nothing is going to save us from talking ourselves to death .
But at least we can debate at a higher level of abstraction .

Jim Sleeper , a New York neoconservative , has an article at TPM Cafe detailing the reasons why Rudy Giuliani should not be President .
While admitting that Giuliani did have several stunning successes as Mayor of New York even before September 11th , Sleeper argues that the style of governing revealed by his tenure as Mayor should raise serious concerns in the mind of anyone who cares about civil liberties and limits on executive power :
The first serious problem is structural and political : A man who fought the inherent limits of his mayoral office as fanatically as Giuliani would construe presidential prerogatives so broadly heâ€™d make George Bushâ€™s notions of â€œunitaryâ€ executive power seem soft .
Even in the 1980s , as an assistant attorney general in the Reagan Justice Department and U.S. Attorney in New York , Giuliani was imperious and overreaching , He made the troubled daughter of a state judge , Hortense Gabel , testify against her mother and former Miss America Bess Meyerson in a failed prosecution charging , among other things , that Meyerson had hired the judgeâ€™s daughter to bribe help â€ œexpediteâ€ a messy divorce case .
The jury was so put off by Giulianiâ€™s tactics that it acquitted all concerned , as the Washington Postâ€™s Ruth Marcus recalled ten years later in assessing Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starrâ€™s subpoena of Monica Lewinskyâ€™s mother to testify against her daughter .
At least , as U.S. Attorney , Giuliani served at the pleasure of the President and had to defer to federal judges .
Were he the President , U.S. Attorneys would serve at his pleasure — a dangerous arrangement in the wrong hands , weâ€™ve learned — and heâ€™d pick the judges to whom prosecutors defer .
As mayor , Giuliani fielded close aides like a fast and sometimes brutal hockey team , micro-managing and bludgeoning city agencies and even agencies that werenâ€™t his , like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Board of Education .
They deserved it richly enough to make his bravado thrilling to many of us , but it wasnâ€™t very productive .
And while this Savonarola disdained even would - be allies in other branches of government , he wasnâ€™t above cutting indefensible deals with crony contractors and pandering shamelessly to some Hispanics , orthodox Jews , and other favored constituencies .
Even Giuliani ’s signature moment , the aftermath of September 11th , is , Sleeper argues , troubling :
Giulianiâ€™s 9/11 performance was sublime for the unnerving reason that heâ€™d been rehearsing for it all his adult life and remains trapped in that stage role .
When his oldest friend and deputy mayor Peter Powers told me in 1994 that 16 - year - old Rudy had started an opera club at Bishop Loughlin High School in Brooklyn , I didnâ€™t have to connect too many of the dots Iâ€™d been seeing to begin noticing that Giuliani at times acted like an opera fanatic whoâ€™s living in a libretto as much as in the real world .
In private , Rudy can contemplate the human comedy with a Machiavellian princeâ€™s supple wit .
But when he walks on stage , he tenses up so much that even his efforts to lighten up seem labored .
What drove him as mayor was a zealotâ€™s graceless division of everyone into friend or foe and his snarling , sometimes histrionic , vilifications of the foes .
Those are operatic emotions , beneath the civic dignity of a great city and its chief magistrate .
Most of America only knows Rudy Giuliani from the events of September 2001 .
His tenure as Mayor , and more importantly as U.S. Attorney , however paint the picutre of someone who has an expansive , almost limitless view of executive power , and zeal to turn almost anything into a crusade .
Â
Based on his record , it is clear that a Preisdent Giuliani would be an authoritarian pro-government leader along the lines of Theodore Roosevelt , Lyndon Johnson , and George W. Bush .
There have been some , one frequent commentor on this blog in particular , who have claimed that Giuliani is a “ libertarian Republican . ”
I ’ve responded more than once that even a curosory examination of his record as Mayor would demonstrate that that simply is n’t the case .
With Giuliani taking the lead in the race for the nomination now , one can imagine that more evidence in support of that proposition will come to light .
H/T : Hit & Run
Bluetooth Tracking Devices
Note : content on this page is mostly from the site 's archived pages .
What Are Bluetooth Trackers and How Do They Work ?
Bluetooth trackers are a relatively new product in the electronics marketplace .
Many folks are all ready familiar with Bluetooth technology that is used for Bluetooth headsets , speakers , and computer peripherals .
Â
The manufacturers of the new , tiny Bluetooth tracking devices have developed â€œtrackersâ€™ that can survive up to a year without a battery recharge or swap .
The tracker tags can be attached to such important items as keys , purse , wallet , or inserted into gear containers , instrument cases , or other objects .
Â
The tags are then linked to a smartphone ( paired with the appropriate software from the tracker vendor ) via BLE ( Bluetooth Low Energy ) forming a radio - based link between the phone and the item . Â
Note that Bluetooth tracking devices are not GPS devices .
Â
Until the battery to the GPS tracker dies , a GPS device tucked into a pricey item such as a camera bag would allow the item to be tracked wherever it is , in real time .
Some pricey GPS devices include both geospatial tracking via the GPS satellite system as well as a modest cellular radio so that it can notify the manufacturer via telephone as to where the item is located .
On the other hand , a Bluetooth tag cannot track an item in real time to geo-locate it .
The tag will only tell where the last place it had access to the tracking tag .
The Bluetooth tracker and its companion app are proximity - based technology , which is different from GPS tracking technology .
So for instance , you were on a business trip and returned to your suite after a long day of conferences , only to find you had left your computer bag with computer at the last conference you attended .
Do n't panic too much .
Return to the conference hall and pull out your smart phone .
Scan the conference hall and listen for the trackers bleeps .
Ah , there you go .
The case and hopefully the computer are somewhere in the hall .
Following the beeps , which grow louder the closer you are , you finally spot the computer and case .
Just where you had left it .
And now you have another Bluetooth tracker " Saved the Day " story to tell your friends .
And now for another story that may seem a bit off the beaten track , but just be patient and you will see the connection .
The other day I was telling my business partner about the above story about the lost computer .
We were in a cab stuck in traffic on our way to a potential client who needed some help in implementing Salesforce .
The owner of the company thought he had the chops to setup all the great features Salesforce has to offer .
But he quickly realized ( or perhaps it was n't so quickly ) that he was way in over his head when it came to utilizing the incredible Salesforce Community Cloud drives that would allow his business to engage with customers , partners , referral sources and any other constituents .
Likewise when it came to connecting the Sales Cloud , Service Cloud , and Community Cloud data of his business , well let 's just say he needed the experts .
We knew we were the right team to help him and his business .
We just had to convince this business owner .
Update : Our pitch was sucessful just as the Bluetooth tracker was for my misplaced computer story .
Is A Bluetooth Tracker For Me ?
A Bluetooth tracker is a high tech , but practical solution to lost - object woes , such as misplacing eyeglasses , keys , or locating your luggage at baggage clainm , etc. Â
Most of the different types of Bluetooth tags make a noise to help locate a missing object when youâ€ ™re close to it .
Do not consider them a good substitute for the much more expensive and expansive real - time tracking offered by a GPS unit .
Bluetooth Tracker Features
Not everyone will want or need all Bluetooth features .
Because there are many different types of Bluetooth trackers available , it is better to know what features you donâ€™t need than to make an uninformed purchase .
Bluetooth Batteries
With their batteries generally lasting about a year , Bluetooth trackers cost between $ 20 - 50 .
If you canâ€™t recharge or replace the battery of your Bluetooth tracker model , you will have to buy a new one every year .
So the first questions to ask before purchasing are : Can you replace your Bluetooth tracker battery and / or can you recharge it ?
How Loud Is the Alarm ?
If the Bluetooth trackerâ€™s volume from its little speakers is too low , whatâ€™s the point of its chirping or beeping to help you locate the lost item ?
Â
You really want a loud chirp or sound when youâ€ ™re right on top of the lost object , but still canâ €™t see it .
What is the Range of the Bluetooth Tracker ?
Supposedly Bluetooth devices can be optimized for 200 feet and beyond .
However , radio signals , the limitations of crafting a tiny transmitter , and environmental variables have a significant impact on the trackers effectiveness .
Some reviewers of the trackers advise that consumers should assume 50 - 70 percent of the range advertised by the manufacturer .
Notice that some manufacturers will say : â€ Works Up to 100 ' Away ( Line of Sight ) â€ œ
Does the Bluetooth Tracker Software Support Geo-Fencing ?
The term geo-fencing , proximity alerts , or leashing capabilities refer to the Bluetooth trackers ability to alert you when youâ€ ™re a certain distance away from your tagged item .
If you want to be â€œalerted , â€ either when you get too far from your secured object or when it gets too far from you , you must look for a Bluetooth tracker with software that supports geo-fencing .
Other Bluetooth Tracker Functions
Most Bluetooth tracking devices offer one feature , however as the marketplace for these nifty devices expands the newer models will other features .
For instance the ANKR App on ANKR Bluetooth tracking devices has grown to include the ability to add functionality such as real - time monitoring of the direction of movement , vibration , temperature , and humidity of fixed high - value assets and high - value portable .
Other brands also have their proprietary apps that permit customization of their tracker devices .
Â Some Bluetooth tracker apps even allow you to track multiple tags at the same time , so you can make sure all your important items are safe .
Other Bluetooth trackers have a button on the tag that can be pressed and held to reverse the whole location process allowing the person to locate by - ear process oneâ€™s lost smartphone .
Bluetooth Tracker Compatibility
Some Bluetooth tracking devices are compatible with only iOS devices .
Others are iOS or Android smartphone compatible .
Check to make sure your smart phone will work with the tracker you want to buy .
The potential for such simple and low - power devices as the Bluetooth tracker is growing .
What will they be capable of doing in the next five years ; the next ten years ?

It ’s a given at this point that Bush supporters really have to go out of their way to justify the stuff the man does , and that they do n’t seem to have any limits to just how strained their logic will be if it ’s used at all .
But I have to admit , this write - up by Wes Pruden starts to drift into Retard Country .
President Bush himself , though blindsided by the National Intelligence Estimate , further added to public confusion with his praise of the “ good work ” of the men who had betrayed him again .
This sounded familiarly like his famous praise for Michael ( “ You ’re doing a good job , Brownie ” ) Brown , the FEMA chief who bungled the early recovery efforts in New Orleans .
If anybody in town is entitled to his contempt for the intelligence services that misled him about Iraq ’s weapons of mass destruction and now Iranian nuclear research , it ’s George W. Bush .
That ’s right .
Pruden is claiming that the intelligence community “ misled ” Bush about Iraq and Iran .
Poor innocent Georgie really did n’t want to go to war with Iraq , no , it was just those inept intelligence officials who fed him bad information that got us there .
Certainly the likes of Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney had n’t been clamoring for a war in Iraq since Clinton was president , of course not .
His conclusion goes even further into the inner sanctum of Retard Country , where even the locals avoid .
We might put down intelligence failures to benign incompetence but for the evidence that something more sinister is at work .
One U.S. official who has worked with the three chief authors of the National Intelligence Estimate — Thomas Fingar , Vann Van Diepen and Kenneth Brill , all one - time officers at the State Department and now in the office of the director of national intelligence — calls the intelligence estimate a political exercise to torpedo George W.’s attempt to prevent a new Islamic bomb in Iran .
The diplomats want only more teacup diplomacy that does n’t work .
The message they read in the tea leaves at the bottom of the cup is clear :
We can all go back to sleep .
Okay , in the first half he rails the intelligence community for “ misleading ” Bush into war , but now we ’re being told that they ’re purposefully saying this to prevent Bush from stopping Iran from getting a nuke ?
Which is it , Wes ?
You ca n’t have your yellowcake and eat it too .
Confronted with the bleeding obvious , that Bush cherry - picked intelligence in 2002 but this time he ’s getting shut down from all sides , the only way they can turn this around so their idol does n’t look like the liar he is is to interpret thing in the most tortured way possible .
So , it bears repeating : Wesley Pruden is a complete moron .
For a start off , it is really substantially slimmer than the Mini nine , which is of course fantastic information for those that want to get out and about with fast ...
This is the eleventh progress report from the Wide Finder Project ; I ’ll use it as the results accumulator , updating it in place even if I go on to write more on the subject , which seems very likely .
[ Update : Your new leader : Perl . ]
The Name · There ’ve been a few posts wondering about the name “ Wide Finder ” .
The original Ruby code came from my Beautiful Code chapter called “ Finding Things ” ; thus it was a Finder .
The problem with modern CPUs is that they ’re getting wider not faster .
Thus , I seek a Wide Finder .
Worth Doing ·
There is a steady drumbeat of commentary along the lines of “ WTF ?
This is a trivial I /O - bound hack you could do on the command line , ridiculously inappropriate for investigating issues of parallelism . ”
To which I say “ Horseshit ” .
It ’s an extremely mainstream , boring , unglamorous file - processing batch job .
There ’s not the slightest whiff of IT Architecture or Social Networking or Service - Orientation about it .
Well , that ’s how lots of life is .
And the Ruby version runs faster on my Mac laptop than on the mighty T5120 .
The T5120 is what most of the world ’s future computers are going to look like !
Houston , we have a problem , and the Wide Finder is a useful lens to examine it .
The Latest · [ 2007/11/19 ] :
After a week or so off , I ’m back to running Wide Finder code .
First : Sean O’Rourke ’s Perl code .
The good news is that it ’s insanely fast ; the bad news is that I had to visit CPAN to get Sys : : Mmap , and CPAN hates me .
Always has .
In this case , the Makefile .
PL makes a Makefile that does n’t work on Solaris , out of the box until you mangle the incantations .
I also ran Dave Thomas ’ memory - mapped code .
Neither the table ’s format nor contents are carved in stone ; I ’m quite sure I ’ll update it as I pour more results in .
Are there any missing columns ?
Or outright broken - ness ?
Feel free to offer suggestions .
I still have a few Wide Finder implementations to run ; if you ’ve done one and it does n’t appear here , it could n’t hurt to drop me a line to make sure I know about it .

Variability ·
The quantities in the cells marked “ * ” above exhibited a lot of variability from run to run , sufficiently so as to make them probably actively misleading to include .
Unknown ·
The quantities in the cells marked “ † ” are unknown .
These multi-process Erlang runs arrange for the absence of parent / child process relationships , so it ’s trickier to determine User and System CPU times .
Notes on Running Nygren ’s wfinder7_2 ·
This is multi-process not multi- thread .
The best results are with 32 processes .
Notes on Running Nygren ’s wfinder8 · Check out Anders ’ notes .
The number in parentheses is the value of the +S argument to Erlang , telling it how many schedulers to run .
Note that this is an 8 - core machine with two integer instruction threads per core and support for eight thread contexts per core .
Solaris thinks it sees 64 CPUs .
So if you do n’t specify +S the default is 64 , which seems about right .
Notes on Running the wf -* Python Code ·
This code is from Fredrik Lundh ; see his discussion .
I added a number - of - processes command - line parameter to wf - 6.py , which appears in parentheses in the table above ; so wf - 6 ( 8 ) means running with eight processes .
I left the chunk size at 50 M for now , this is just ( just barely ) small enough to run with 16 processes .
Fredrik took a glance and suggested removing wf - 3 through wf - 5 in the interests of making the table more readable .
The reporting of user and system CPU time was wildly variable .
For example , wf - 6 ( 8 ) reported user CPU as low as 5.06 seconds and as high as 31.99 seconds .
I suspect that this may be worth bringing to the attention of the Solaris people ; the state of the art in tracking CPU usage in this fairly exotic type of machine is still a little shaky , apparently .
Analysis ·
Are you kidding me !?!?
Getouttahere .
Maybe someday .
Previous News · [ 2007/10/30 ] : I ’ve been back from Shanghai for a few days now , but it took till past lunch today to get logged into the mighty T5120 and doing some Wide Finding .
It ’s a pretty naked Solaris box , and compiling all this stuff has been just a bundle of fun .
Not .
[ 2007/10/31 ] : Added a Lines - of - Code column to the table .
Ran Fredrik Lundh ’s multi-process Python , Ilmari Heikkinen ’s OCaml , and Russ Beattie ’s PHP .
There are a few that I ’ve tried and failed to run ; Erlang code that wo n’t compile , C and JoCaml code that will compile but not run .
In each case I ’ve pinged the author , and I may go back and try to see if I can sort things out .
[ 2007/11/01 ] : Got Pichi ’s patched Erlang to run. 545 lines , wow !.
Caoyuan ’s too , much more concise , but not as fast .
[ 2007/11/01 ] :
Did some runs with Nygren ’s wfinder8 ; details here .
[ 2007/11/04 ] :
Per advice from contributors below , I installed sorttable and it seems to work just fine !.
[ 2007/11/05 ] : I ran Caoyuan ’s latest ; notes here .
Then I ran Mauricio Fernandez ’ OCaml and JoCaml ; see Aim for the Top !
Beating the current # 1 Wide Finder log analyzer with the join - calculus .
Holy crap !
I have to say that the OCaml build / run process is kind of klunky , this is n’t your classic REPL by any means .
But you know , this is n’t the first time that I ’ve seen OCaml thump the competition on a benchmark ; it ’s just the first time that it was a benchmark I cared about .
[ 2007/11/08 ] : I ran Eric Wong ’s Perl code ( notes here ) ; kind of disappointing .
Then I ran Anders Nygren ’s revised wfinder7_2 ; he writes : “ The difference compared to wfinder8 is that this one does not use the SMP virtual machine .
Instead it starts a number of slave erlang nodes . ”
Caoyuan revised his tbray9 to produce tbray9a , requesting that I replace the results .
[ 2007/11/09 ] : Russ Beattie revised his PHP code , renaming it widefinder3 , and indeed , it moved a few places up the table .
Also , based on several requests about this box ’s I/ O performance , I did a Bonnie run , which is kind of interesting .
I/O · There have been appeals , both in the comments and in email , for a characterization of the test box ’s I /O performance .
I ran Bonnie with the following results :
-------Sequential Output-------- ---Sequential Input -- -- Random -- - Per Char- -- Block --- - Rewrite -- - Per Char- -- Block --- -- Seeks --- GB M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU M/sec %CPU /sec %CPU 20 23.9 99.7 41.5 29.8 44.2 61.8 22.3 100 161.8 100 21835 239.4
Given that this stupid thing has 64G of RAM and I could only find 20G of disk space to work with , the results should be taken with a grain of salt ( especially the Random Seeks number ) .
Having said that , watching the free - memory readout made it look to me as though when it was doing the sequential runs , it was doing real I /O , not just caching .
LAS VEGAS — Never one to settle for an open standard when the opportunity to push a proprietary alternative presents itself , Sony has announced that it will wade into the next - generation short - range interconnect wars with a proprietary new wireless spec called " TransferJet . "
Sony 's proposed TransferJet spec has a physical peak transmission rate of 560 Mbps and would appear to compete directly with short - and medium - range ultrawideband - based offerings like wireless USB ( W - USB ) and the next generation of Bluetooth technology .
But in spite of any similarities to either W - USB or Bluetooth 3.0 , both of which are based on the same WiMedia radio technology and promise transfer speeds in the 480 M bps range , Sony 's TransferJet has some distinguishing characteristics that set it apart from the pack .
In Sony 's vision of the future , any two consumer devices will be able to exchange data wirelessly with one another simply by holding them close together .
The system is designed for maximum ease of use , which means limited options for controlling the transfers ; devices will transfer their contents automatically to another device within range .
Users can " register " devices within the home to keep them from transmitting to " unregistered " devices , which should keep Uncle Dave from beaming his " art photos " onto your TV set without permission .
Other than that , everything else appears to be automatic and button - free .
Because the spec is designed to be both 1 ) low - power and 2 ) close range ( to avoid interference problems ) ,
Sony went with an electric induction field coupler instead of more traditional radiation field antennas .
Induction is the same tech used to charge cordless electric toothbrushes , and it's also being used for wireless charging in some consumer electronics devices .
Because induction only works over very short ranges , TransferJet devices need to be within 3 cm of each other ; essentially , the couplers need to touch .
TransferJet operates at 4.48GHz and promises fast connections , though real - world transfer speeds will never match up with the theoretical maximum of the couplers .
Error correction and transfer protocols add overhead that reduces the real - world throughput to something on the order of 375 Mbps .
And in response to the inevitable reader question about the possibility of using TransferJet to transmit power to a device , thereby making it a true USB replacement , Sony 's press release is silent on this issue .
Also unstated is when Sony plans to announce the first devices based on the new technology .
Sony is pushing the technology as a universal wireless interface between devices , but it certainly faces stiff competition from the aforementioned WiMedia - based radio technologies .
While we might have yet another format war on our hands here , it 's clear that 2008 is already shaping up to be a big year for wireless .
Surgery Complication Feels Like ' Living Death ' Victims are conscious they 're being operated on , but ca n't act .
Dec. 1 , 2007  --
What if you accidentally woke up in the middle of your surgery ?
It 's called anesthesia awareness -- a rare , but serious surgical phenomenon of being paralyzed by drugs , yet mentally alert , under general anesthesia .
' Living Death '
" You 're screaming inside your body , " said Carol Weihrer , a victim of anesthesia awareness .
" You 're trying to crawl off the gurney , you 're trying to move a toe , you 're trying to wince ... and there is absolutely nothing you can do . "
Weihrer woke up on the operating table while doctors were removing her diseased eye .
" I heard my surgeon say to the resident , ' Cut deeper and pull harder , ' " she said .
" And I finally realized they were not finished ; they were just starting .
So the senses that I felt were the tremendous pulling .
I had seen them cut my optic nerve and I knew when everything went black .
I wanted to get off that table or to die . "
Wake - Up Call
The condition affects between 20,000 and 40,000 of the approximately 21 million people in the United States who receive general anesthesia every year , according to a 2004 report from the International Anesthesia Research Society by Dr. Peter S. Sebel , a professor of anesthesia at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta .
Recently the buzz around anesthesia awareness has been increasing thanks to the release of a psychological thriller , " Awake . "
The film , starring Jessica Alba and Hayden Christensen exposes viewers to the consciousness of a patient ( Christensen ) who awakes mid-surgery while the doctors are cutting him open .
This week , expert anesthesiologists from around the country met to discuss the worrisome problem and bring awareness to the condition .
With " Awake " stoking fears across America after its release this week , they 're hoping the increased attention will lead to better patient care .
Weihrer still suffers from nightmares about her surgery 10 years ago and fears the movie might further traumatize her fellow victims .
What You Can Do
According to Dr. Tim Johnson , ABC
News medical correspondent , there are many reasons why " some patients may have resistant brains to anesthesia . "
A patient with a history of alcohol abuse or one who is currently medically sick are more susceptible to risk .
Patients taking beta blockers should be sure to tell their doctors .
The drugs , which slow down the heart rate and lower blood pressure , can mute physiological signs of awareness , and an anesthesiologist might not be able to tell what 's going on .
But there 's not always a clear reason for anesthesia awareness , Johnson said .
" Ultimately , sometimes , it 's just mysterious , " he said .
If you 're worried , talk to your doctors and " ask the anesthesiologist what kind of monitoring is going to be done . "
Johnson stressed that anesthesia awareness is rare .
" It 's probably one tenth of 1 percent , a very small number , " he said .
" So obviously patients should not in general worry . "

Western Europe is by far the world 's most peaceful region according to the Economist Intelligence Unit 's Global Peace Index .
Most countries in the region rank in the top 20 , though not France and Britain .
They both score relatively well on the domestic measures of peace but their relatively high levels of militarisation , sophisticated weapon industries and arms exports push them lower down the ranking .
Britain 's battlefield troop losses in Afghanistan and Iraq — and its involvement in those conflicts and in Sierra Leone — reduce its ranking further to 49th place overall .
The average score for all the countries in the Global Peace Index is two ( based on a 1 - 5 measure ) with countries relatively evenly spread around the mean , although there is an exceptional tail on the countries at the bottom of the ranking .
While the index has a broad level of country and regional coverage at 121 separate nations ( encompassing around 95 % of the world 's population and over two - thirds of the planet 's land mass ) , data paucity has resulted in the exclusion of a number of less - developed countries .
It is likely that these countries would , on average , score less well , so the overall global picture is probably worse .

Methodology
We have previously discussed the difficulty in accounting for all relevant energy inputs to a given energy production process .
Drawing a boundary for what energy inputs will be accounted small enough to facilitate practical accounting necessarily excludes energy inputs that , I have argued , are quite relevant to the resulting EROEI ratio .
Today I will argue that , while certainly imperfect and limited in application , it is possible to use a proxy calculation to resolve this problem : price .
This theory , what I am calling Price - Estimated EROEI , attempts to use the market ’s ability to fix price as a representation of a huge mass of amorphous data .
As with a complete EROEI calculation , price tends to account for more individual data than we can possibly consciously account for , identify causal relationships , and resolve by some formula .
Price in a free - market solves a very similar problem to the accounting problem presented by a full and accurate EROEI calculation .
So , at least according to my theory , we can use this price mechanism to create a proxy for EROEI .
This methodology seems especially apt for evaluating the EROEI of things such as wind power , solar power , and biofuels .
How ?
Let ’s consider solar photovoltaic panels .
We begin with a fundamental assumption ( and one that is certainly problematic , but more on that later ) : the price of the solar PV system is a proxy for the totality of energy used in its production , in terms relative to the price of its product — electricity .
Assume that a 2KW solar PV system installed on a residential roof in Phoenix , Arizona , costs $ 16,000 ( grid intertie , no battery ) . [ 1 ]
Assume that this system , in Phoenix , will generate 4,000 KW - hours per year . [ 2 ]
At prevailing Phoenix - area electricity prices of $ .10 / KW - hour , this is the rough equivalent of $ 400 / year .
What is the present value of $ 400 / year for the 40 - year life - expectancy of the array ?
Accepting the Treasury ’s inflation adjusted rate of return , an annuity that will make 40 annual payments of $ 400 costs $ 8500 today . [ 3 ]
That gives us an Price - Estimated EROEI of grid - intertie solar PV at 0.53 .
Why bother ?
What does the Price - Estimated EROEI methodology do that a standard EROEI calculation not do ?
Let ’s take a look at just one example — the “ energy ” component of the labor required to build , transport , and install the PV system .
There is an obvious energy prerequisite to this — food , housing , health care , etc. for the individuals involved .
If these people are n’t being fed , they certainly wo n’t be installing PV on your roof .
Feeding , housing , etc. all requires energy .
But how much ?
Calculating this energy requirement brings us right back to the devilishly difficult ( or impossible ) accounting problem discussed in the first installment of this series .
But it ca n’t be ignored if we want to create a realistic EROEI for solar PV , can it ?
Price acts as an efficient proxy for these labor costs — enough money must be paid to provide for the needs of the people involved .
When all the price components of installing the PV system are accounted for , the sum is a representation of the energy required to get that PV system intalled and operation on a residential roof .
It has no meaning in Watts or Joules or other traditional means of measure , but it does have meaning in a ratio with the value of the energy produced .
That ’s Price - Estimated EROEI .
As I mentioned above , there are certainly weaknesses .
Subsidies and tax - incentives ( to both sides of the price - ratio ) can greatly distort the result ( especially evident , for example , with corn ethanol or nuclear power ) .
Similarly , while free - markets may be more efficient than command - economies , they are by no means perfectly efficient .
Nor are our markets perfectly free .
Finally , there are elasticity and fungibility issues .
But even with all of those problems , is Price - Estimated EROEI any less accurate than “ traditional ” EROEI calculations , with their limits on what energy inputs are accounted for and their varying methodologies for calculation ?
At the end of the day , I submit that Price - Estimated EROEI represents a valuable way of looking at the broader issue of EROEI .
If nothing else , it certainly says something if investment in energy source A outperforms ( has a higher Price - Estimated EROEI ) investment in energy source B .

I give Ron Paul a bit of a pounding on here now and again ( which reminds me , I have another one coming soon … ) , and there are two simple reasons for this .
The first is that while I like his foreign policies and his general attitude of limited government , his domestic policies downright scare me and seeing him get so much support frequently irks me .
The second is far more direct .
I am absolutely green with envy at the swell of support he is getting .
So I ask you all , where ’s the love for Mike Gravel ?
Support for the Democrats is dwindling thanks to a general trend of inaction and / or cowardice in the face of the GOP machine .
With the candidates still acting as though Karl Rove is still lurking in the shadows and that a majority in Congress still is n’t enough ( “ we ca n’t override a veto ! ” ) , it ’s more than a little disheartening to see so little change .
When I found that a website called The Smirking Chimp hosted an article abandoning the party , that told me we have a problem .
The solution ?
Mike Gravel .
Annoyed that Democrats are all wimpy in opposing the war ?
Mike Gravel wants out now and tore into Hillary over her vote over it .
The man wrote an article called “ Why Hillary Scares Me ” for chrissakes .
Hillary , as an active supporter of the war , you are one of many Americans who are guilty .
And now all Americans are left responsible , regardless of whether we supported or opposed he war .
When we pull out , our hands will drip with the blood of the tens of thousands of American casualties and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead .
The Iraqi government did n’t start this , we did .
Bam !
I point at OnTheIssues frequently to give people a perspective on candidates , and the page on Gravel is no less illuminating .
No , he does n’t have a lot of votes to go off of , but he has plenty of statements and they paint a clear picture of the guy .
You want a tough Democrat that wo n’t hem and haw ?
Mike Gravel ’s your man .
Pow !
Name an issue the Democrats have failed us on and Gravel is n’t fooling around .
Iraq ?
Let ’s get out .
Iran ?
Hell no .
Universal health care ?
Let ’s get it .
Drug laws ?
Get rid of ’em .
Gay marriage ?
Of course .
Stem cell research ?
Let ’s get it going .
Abortion ?
Rare but legal .
I can already hear a criticism .
Oh sure Hanlon , you say , he sounds great and all but what has he done ?
Why should we care what he ’s jabbering about if he does n’t produce results ?
Good call , reader , but let me ask you a question .
Are you glad there ’s no draft today ?
If so , you have Mike Gravel to thank .
I do n’t mean that he helped end the draft or that he co-sponsored a bill that led to the end of the draft , no .
Gravel went on a five - month filibuster , by himself , to halt the reinstatement of the draft .
You want to talk about political accomplishments that we can appreciate today , it ’s hard to top that .
I ’m going to repeat that .
In 1971 , Alaskan Senator Mike Gravel embarked on a five - month long filibuster by himself to stop the draft being reinstated .
When Chuck Rangel proposed bringing back the draft , it was considered lunacy .
Why ?
Because Mike Gravel killed it 26 years ago and relegated it to the history books .
I often worry that the Democratic party is going to lose its “ netroots ” support because so many are focused on the Big Three and getting angry at their rightward drift ( or possibly their forgetting about their spines ) , totally forgetting that we ’ve got a wolverine hidden in the back .
No , he ’s not seeing much support now and is in that area where his poll numbers are lower than the margin of error , but that ’s just my point .
Pick an issue and Gravel is bang - on .
We ’ve seen that Ron Paul could go from an unknown to a top tier , so why could n’t Gravel follow suit ?
Get your asses over to his campaign page and show him some love .

UPDATE : ImpeachForPeace.org , World Ca n’t Wait , and After Downing Street to present more DC Representatives with “ Do - It - Yourself ” Impeachment Petitions
ImpeachForPeace.org ’s plans to head to Washington DC to meet with Representatives on Thursday , July 26th are taking shape .
We ’ll deliver thousands of petitions formally initiating the impeachment of Vice President Richard Cheney .
ImpeachForPeace.org members and David Swanson of After Downing Street , besides meeting with Rep. Maxine Waters and the offices of Rep. Adam Schiff , Rep. Robert Wexler , and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , will also be meeting with Rep. Keith Ellison and the office of Rep. Jerrold Nadler .
ImpeachForPeace.org also hopes that Rep. John Conyers will find the time to meet with us .
As noted previously , these House Reps are part of the Judiciary Committee , which currently has a resolution ( House Resolution 333 ) to impeach Vice President Cheney .
We ’ll be presenting the petitions and urging these representatives to support impeachment on behalf of the majority of Americans who have indicated that they support the impeachment of Vice President Cheney .
“ Do - It - Yourself ”  Impeachment Petitions are described under the House Rules , Jefferson ’s Manual Section LIII .
They constitute a legal means of initiating the impeachment process , and were successfully used in 1830 to impeach Federal Judge James Peck .
This method is the only means by which an individual citizen can legally initiate the impeachment of a federal official .
While only one such citizen ’s petition is necessary to begin the process , thousands of these are to be delivered on Friday .
It ’s not too late to send in your DIY Impeachment Memorial !
Even if we do n’t get it before we leave for DC on Wednesday evening , we ’ll still make sure it gets to a representative in the house .
CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) -- President Hugo Chavez on Friday wrapped up his campaign to push through broad constitutional changes with a broadside attack against adversaries at home and abroad -- including a threat to cut off oil exports to the United States .
Supporters of President Hugo Chavez rally Friday in Caracas , Venezuela .
Chavez told a crowd gathered in the center of Caracas that if the referendum was approved and the result was questioned -- " if the ' yes ' vote wins on Sunday and the Venezuelan oligarchy , playing the [ U.S. ] empire 's game , comes with their little stories of fraud " -- then he would order oil shipments to the United States halted Monday .
Chavez spoke after tens of thousands , brought on buses from throughout the country , marched down the capital 's principal boulevard to rally support for Sunday 's referendum , which would free Chavez from term - limit restrictions and move the country toward institutionalized socialism .
Friday 's rally acted as a counterpoint to an opposition march down the same streets Thursday that brought out tens of thousands who fear the 69 constitutional changes would serve to undermine basic democratic freedoms .
Chavez , 53 , warmed the crowd up by serenading them with holiday " gaitas " and other traditional songs before turning his attention to a litany of enemies and perceived enemies : internal critics , the United States , Spain 's King Juan Carlos , Colombia 's President Alvaro Uribe and domestic and international media .
" We 're not really confronting those peons of imperialism , " Chavez said , alluding to his Venezuelan opponents .
" Our true enemy is called the North American empire , and ... we 're going to give another knockout to Bush . "
He renewed his harsh criticisms of Juan Carlos and Uribe , with whom he has had recent high - profile disputes , and threatened to take independent Venezuela television network Globovision off the air if it broadcast partial results during the voting .
He also threatened to take action against international networks , accusing CNN in particular of overstating the strength of the opposition 's numbers .
" If any international channel comes here to take part in an operation from the imperialist against Venezuela , your reporters will be thrown out of the country , they will not be able to work here , " Chavez said .
" People at CNN , listen carefully :
This is just a warning . "
At stake in Sunday 's vote is whether the leftist leader should have full authority over the now autonomous Central Bank and with it the nation 's economic policy , changes Chavez has said he needs to move the economy further toward socialism .
The most controversial amendment would do away with term limits , allowing Chavez , who has served almost eight years in power , to hold his post indefinitely as long as he is re-elected .
Chavez , a former paratrooper , said the majority of the country 's 26 million people back him .
He has garnered overwhelming support from the country 's poorer neighborhoods , who have benefited from his policies -- paid for by skyrocketing oil prices .
Oil accounts for roughly 90 percent of the country 's export earnings , according to the CIA World Factbook .
Despite the animosity that Chavez routinely aims at the United States , the two countries remain closely tied economically -- the United States is Venezuela 's biggest oil customer and one of the few countries that can refine its low - quality crude .
Venezuela accounts for up to 15 percent of U.S. crude imports .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama raised $ 32 million for his Democratic presidential nominating campaign in January , a huge haul that aides said will give him the ability to compete in a potentially long and costly race .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
The one - month fundraising total essentially matched Obama ’s biggest three - month haul during 2007 and reflected the heightening intensity of a hard - fought nominating race with New York Sen. Hillary Clinton .
Clinton has not yet released her January figures .
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said the campaign attracted 170,000 new donors in January , giving him a total of 650,000 individual donors since the race began .
The Illinois senator split the first four nominating contests with Clinton in January in a battle that shows signs of extending into March or beyond .
Plouffe said the campaign is already advertising in most of the 22 states holding Democratic contests on Tuesday and would launch radio and television ads on Friday in a half - dozen states holding contests between February 9 and February 12 .
“ If this ends up going through March and April we think we are going to have the resources necessary to conduct vigorous campaigns in every state to come , ” Plouffe told reporters .
Thursday is the deadline for fourth - quarter financial reports for the presidential contenders in both parties , which will provide a glimpse of how much money candidates had at the end of 2007 as they headed into the first voting .
Both Obama and Clinton already announced how much they raised in the last three months of 2007 .
Clinton brought in $ 24 million for the nominating race and Obama raised $ 22.4 million .
Reports for January are not due at the Federal Election Commission until February 20 , but Obama ’s campaign was anxious to announce its good news before Tuesday ’s voting .
Plouffe said the biggest single day of donations in January was the day after Obama ’s narrow loss to Clinton in New Hampshire , which came shortly after his breakthrough win in the first contest in Iowa .
Many of the campaign ’s donors were fueling his grass - roots volunteer efforts in key states as well , he said .
“ They are manning phone banks and door - knocking and they are volunteering for election day , ” Plouffe said .
The new Obama ads will air in Washington , Nebraska and Louisiana , which hold Democratic contests on February 9 .
They also will air in Maine , which has a February 10 caucus , and in Virginia , Maryland and Washington , D.C. , which vote on February 12 .

Source : American Institutes for Research analysis of NAEP and TIMSS data Educators and politicians these days make a point of saying that U.S. schoolchildren are n't just competing locally for good , high - paying jobs — they 're competing globally .
A detailed study lets them know just how well kids may do if they really compete globally someday — and it's not exactly pretty .
Crunching the most recent data from a pair of U.S. and international math and science exams for middle - schoolers , Gary Phillips , a researcher at the non-profit American Institutes for Research ( AIR ) , a non-partisan Washington think tank , finds a decidedly mixed picture : Students in most states perform as well as — or better than — peers in most foreign countries .
But he also finds that even those in the highest - scoring states , such as Massachusetts and Minnesota , are significantly below a handful of top - scoring nations such as Singapore , Hong Kong , South Korea , Taiwan and Japan .
" We 're kind of in the middle of the pack , " Phillips says .
" Being in the middle of the pack is really a mediocre place to be . "
The differences between states are stark :
While students in Massachusetts , the top - scoring state in math , can rightly boast that they do nearly as well as students in those highflying Asian nations , students in places such as Mississippi , New Mexico and Washington , D.C. , register math results comparable to Bulgaria , Moldova and Macedonia .
" We are not in the lead in winning this race to prepare the minds for the future generation , " Phillips says .
He should know .
Before joining AIR , he headed the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Education Department , overseeing large - scale testing programs that included the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) and the Third International Mathematics and Science Study ( TIMSS ) , the two tests he compares in the new analysis .
The findings were welcomed by Dane Linn , who heads the education division of the National Governors Association .
He says reports like Phillips ' will prompt state lawmakers to rethink their academic standards .
" I think it 's the beginning of giving governors the tools to see how they 're going to improve student achievement relative to other countries , " he says .
The project was funded by AIR , and Phillips says he was n't approached by lawmakers or interest groups to undertake it .
" This comes from my personal interest and concern about math and science literacy , " he told reporters this week .
Andrew Rotherham , co-director of Education Sector , an education - policy think tank , calls the analysis " a sober walk through the evidence in a debate that 's often characterized by hysterics .
It points out both the good news and the challenges . "

What are these ?
“ I am even more convinced that I am right , ” said Mr. Alexander , who was among the many lawmakers from both parties to make a personal inspection of conditions in Iraq during the Congressional recess .
Since then , he has traveled his state , laying out his views on the war , raising money for a re-election bid and touching base with constituents at events like a meeting on new financing for math and science in Murfreesboro on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University .
While September once loomed as a likely turning point for the Congressional debate over the debate , the political center of gravity on what to do about Iraq does not appear to have shifted significantly in the month Congress has been away .
The White House has made some headway in convincing lawmakers that the escalation of American troops in Iraq has improved security conditions there , and lawmakers of both parties say they have seen such evidence themselves .
Yet there is little sign of the political improvement that was supposed to follow the troop buildup , they say .
Some lawmakers who visited Iraq also got a taste of the risks faced by American troops when their aircraft was shot at by an insurgent missile .
Mr. Alexander and many other members of Congress say that though they are struggling with what to do about the war , they do not expect a series of pending government reports to make their job much easier .
They say that coming reviews from General David H. Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker , the top American government officials in Iraq , will most likely present a mixed picture , and may well clash with independent assessments of the state of Iraq sought by Congress .
“ I think the report will be in several directions , but it wo n’t be a clear path forward , ” said Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , who is also a potential swing vote on Iraq policy .
“ Those of us who are concerned about the current policy are going to be facing the same kind of choices and dilemmas we did prior to the report . ”
Snapshotting : A neat problem and solution in Haskell
I solved an interesting problem recently in Haskell .
Now , I ’m no expert at Haskell , and this may not even be a very good solution .
I got where I did through a lot of weird side paths , a lot of help from more experienced Haskellers on IRC , but I also made a lot of my own mistakes .
It is , though , definitely an interesting solution .
So I ’ll describe it here .
Of course , this all came about to solve a particular problem .
In this case , the problem was a multi-user dungeon ( MUD ) .
These programs are text - based network applications that allow users to connect and interact with a common virtual world .
I chose to represent the “ world ” using a nifty module called “ software transactional memory ” in the Haskell core library .
STM is a great thing , and you should learn about it if you do n’t know about it already .
I found Simon Peyton - Jones ’ paper at http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/beautiful.ps very useful .
The general idea , though , is that mutable variables are encapsulated with a type constructor TVar , and can only be modified in a transaction .
I wanted to preserve a little of the pure functional flavor , minimize the use of TVars , and generally follow the philosophy of avoiding premature optimization ; so the ( incomplete ) beginnings of the world look something like this :
data World = World { worldStartRoom :: TVar RoomId , worldNextRoomId :: TVar RoomId , worldNextPlayerId :: TVar PlayerId , worldNextItemId :: TVar ItemId , worldRooms :: TVar ( M.Map RoomId Room ) , worldPlayers :: TVar ( M.Map PlayerId Player ) , worldItems :: TVar ( M.Map ItemId Item ) , worldPlayerNames :: TVar ( M.Map String Player ) } deriving Eq
Now , occasionally , it is also necessary to occasionally save the state of the world out to disk .
That data is being constantly accessed and updated by bazillions of threads , and I need an internally consistent state .
Great , because STM solves exactly that problem !
This transaction will read the whole world , so it will certainly have its costs — but at least it ’ll be correct , right ?
Here ’s where it gets ugly : STM transactions may not perform I /O operations .
In other words , the code will need to first do all its STM stuff , save it off in memory somewhere , and only then begin writing to a file .
After defining a bunch of data structures containing TVars ( okay , only one for now , but that might change ) , it now appears that I would need to define an identical set of data structures that provide access to a copy of the world from outside of an STM transaction .
In other words , it now looks like I need a SWorld , as follows :
data SWorld = SWorld { sworldStartRoom :: RoomId , sworldNextRoomId :: RoomId , sworldNextPlayerId :: PlayerId , sworldNextItemId :: ItemId , sworldRooms :: ( M.Map RoomId Room ) , sworldPlayers :: ( M.Map PlayerId Player ) , sworldItems :: ( M.Map ItemId Item ) , sworldPlayerNames :: ( M.Map String Player ) } deriving Eq
I immediately do n’t like this , because it looks identical to the definition of the earlier World , and in fact it is a requirement of the application that the two remain identical .
That ’s a lot of manual maintenance .
Fortunately , we get type polymorphism to the rescue !
data World a = World { worldStartRoom ' :: a RoomId , worldNextRoomId ' :: a RoomId , worldNextPlayerId ' :: a PlayerId , worldNextItemId ' :: a ItemId , worldRooms ' :: a ( M.Map RoomId Room ) , worldPlayers ' :: a ( M.Map PlayerId Player ) , worldItems ' :: a ( M.Map ItemId Item ) , worldPlayerNames ' :: a ( M.Map String Player ) } deriving Eq
So now World is a parametric type , with a type parameter a .
But a is not just any old type parameter !
It has a kind of (* -> *) .
The earlier World type is now just World TVar .
The snapshot type is a little uglier , but not much .
It would be nice to have a simple identity type constructor , but such a thing does n’t exist .
( In the course of looking for it , I did come across a discussion about adding it into a forthcoming release of Haskell on the haskell - prime mailing list ; but there are substantial arguments against it . )
So in lieu of a true identity type constructor , I can just use the Identity monad .
The snapshot type is now World Identity .
Instead of having to make sure they both have the same fields , I know they do because they are the same type !
( One interesting change is that if I want to derive the Eq type class for World , I have to enable undecidable instances in GHC .
I do n’t really understand why , but it does n’t confuse me ; I ’m doing some fairly bizarre stuff here . )
Now it is convenient to have a way to put things in and out of a TVar or Identity without worrying too much about which kind of World I ’m using .
A type class does the trick !
Because dealing with TVar values must be done in STM , the operations are defined in the STM monad .
class Wrapper a where extract :: a b -> STM b inject :: b -> STM ( a b ) instance Wrapper TVar where extract = readTVar inject = newTVar instance Wrapper Identity where extract = return .
runIdentity inject = return .
return
Admittedly , that last instance for Identity looks odd .
In inject , for instance , I want to take a value , wrap that in the Identity monad , and then wrap that in an STM block ( not because it ’s necessary , but because it ’s part of the type signature for the class . )
The extract function uses runIdentity to get the value out of the Identity monad , and then return s is in the STM monad to satisfy the type class .
A little more boilerplate …
mkWorld a b c d e f g h = do a ' <- inject a b' <- inject b c' <- inject c d' <- inject d e' <- inject e f ' <- inject f g' <- inject g h' <- inject h return ( World a ' b' c' d' e' f ' g' h ' ) convertWorld ( World a b c d e f g h ) = do a ' <- extract a b' <- extract b c' <- extract c d' <- extract d e' <- extract e f ' <- extract f g' <- extract g h' <- extract h mkWorld a ' b' c' d' e' f ' g' h' worldStartRoom = extract . worldStartRoom ' worldNextRoom
Id = extract . worldNextRoomId ' worldNextPlayerId = extract . worldNextPlayerId ' worldNextItemId = extract . worldNextItemId ' worldRooms = extract . worldRooms ' worldPlayers = extract . worldPlayers ' worldItems = extract . worldItems ' worldPlayerNames = extract . worldPlayerNames '
These functions handle the grunt work of dealing with various kinds of worlds .
The first one defines a constructor that takes simple values , and automatically wraps them up in TVar s or the Identity monad .
The second gets these things out of one kind of world and into another .
The third through tenth extract the values of fields automatically , so that code is n’t littered with readTVar and runIdentity statements all willy nilly .
( It may look like this overhead is worse than the cure .
That would be wrong , because that last block of code would have to have been written even if I ’d used a completely separate type for the snapshot .
The only real added overhead is the class and instances for Wrapper , and that ’s independent of type !
That means if I change Player to have some TVar fields later on , there ’s no extra code to write . )
So this accomplished my goal .
And sure enough , it basically does what I want .
In the end , though , the boilerplate was too much for me .
I ended up turning to Template Haskell to handle it for me .
The code now looks like this :
data World a = World { worldStartRoom ' :: a RoomId , worldNextRoomId ' :: a RoomId , worldNextPlayerId ' :: a PlayerId , worldNextItemId ' :: a ItemId , worldRooms ' :: a ( M.Map RoomId Room ) , worldPlayers ' :: a ( M.Map PlayerId Player ) , worldItems ' :: a ( M.Map ItemId Item ) , worldPlayerNames ' :: a ( M.Map String Player ) } deriving Eq $( snapshotting Type '' World )
And that looks to me like an elegant , maintainable piece of code .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel said on Saturday it had recently seized a truck carrying chemicals used to make explosives hidden in bags marked as European Union aid for the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip .
The army said 6.5 tonnes of potassium nitrate were in bags marked as sugar from the European Union for Palestinians in the coastal enclave .
“ We are looking into this report , ” said an EU official in Israel .
“ If it is found to be accurate , this is an illegal act that should be condemned . ”
The cargo in a Palestinian truck was travelling in the occupied West Bank and seized several weeks ago at an Israeli checkpoint , the army said .
The European Union is the largest provider of humanitarian assistance to Gaza .
Israel tightened its military and economic cordon of the Gaza Strip after Islamist Hamas seized the territory in a June war with secular Fatah .
Potassium nitrate can be used to make explosives and to power homemade rockets .
It can also be used as a fertiliser .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq will need foreign troops to help defend it for another 10 years , but will not accept U.S. bases indefinitely , government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said .
“ Of course we need international support .
We have security problems .
For 10 years our army will not be able to defend Iraq , ” Dabbagh told the state - run al - Iraqiya television in an interview broadcast late on Sunday .
“ I do not think that there is a threat of an invasion of Iraq , or getting involved in a war .
( But ) to protect Iraqi sovereignty there must be an army to defend Iraq for the next 10 years , ” he said .
“ But on the other hand , does Iraq accept the permanent existence of U.S. bases , for instance ?
Absolutely no .
There is no Iraqi who would accept the existence of a foreign army in this country , ” he said .
“ America is America and Iraq is Iraq . ”
The United States now has about 155,000 troops in Iraq , formally operating under a U.N. Security Council mandate enacted after the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
Iraq has asked the Security Council to extend the mandate for what it says will be a final year to the end of 2008 , and conditions for U.S. troops to stay on beyond that date are to be negotiated in the next few months .
Violence has subsided after the United States dispatched 30,000 additional troops to Iraq this year , and Washington now says it will bring about 20,000 home by mid-2008 .
Troop levels for the second half of the year are to be decided in March .
A Roxboro woman has filed a formal complaint with a local school board after her son was disciplined by a lunch program monitor at Ecole Lalande for eating in what she says is a customary Filipino manner .
Luc Cagadoc ’s table behaviour is traditionally Filipino ; he fills his spoon by pushing the food on his plate with a fork , his mother , Maria Theresa Gallardo , says .
But after being punished by his school ’s lunch program monitor more than 10 times this year for his mealtime conduct — including his technique — the seven - year - old told Gallardo said last week that he was too embarrassed to eat his dinner .
“ Mommy , I do n’t want to eat anymore , ” Gallardo says Luc told her at the kitchen table April 11 .
“ My teacher is telling me that eating with a spoon and fork is yucky and disgusting . ”
When he eats with both a spoon and fork , instead of only one utensil , the Grade 2 students said the lunch monitor moves him to a table to sit by himself .
Upset over Luc ’s story , Gallardo confronted the lunchtime caregiver the next day and on April 13 , she telephoned the school ’s principal , Normand Bergeron .
His reaction brought her to tears , she says .
“ His response was shocking to me , ” Gallardo , who moved to Montreal from the Philippines in 1999 , told The Chronicle .
“ He said , ‘ Madame , you are in Canada .
Here in Canada you should eat the way Canadians eat . ’
“ I find it very prejudiced and it ’s racist .
He ’s supposed to be acting like a professional .
This is supposed to be a free country with free expressions of culture and religion .
This is how we eat ; we eat with a fork and spoon . ”

Luc ’s father , Aldrin Cagadoc , was also surprised by the comment .
“ I ca n’t believe even the principal would say that , ” he said .
“ A person of that calibre , I would n’t expect him to say that . ”
Gallardo , who operates a day care out of her Roxboro home and is close to completing her studies in early childhood education , wrote a letter last week and lodged a formal complaint to the Commission scolaire Marguerite Bourgeoys ( CSMB ) yesterday .

She disagrees with the lunch monitor ’s approach to teaching children how to eat and says it is emotionally abusive to Luc .
When she questioned Bergeron about punishing students for their table habits , she says he replied that , “ If your son eats like a pig he has to go to another table because this is the way we do it and how we ’re going to do it every time . ”
But Bergeron says it was Luc ’s eating technique combined with his behaviour at the table that was inappropriate that day , which is why he was moved .
“ Luc can be turbulent , ” he said yesterday .
“ Like other children , he is frequently in situations where we have to intervene .
It ’s normal , he ’s a child .
He is in a period of learning . ”
The principal of the 387 - student Roxboro school said he explained his position on using two utensils to Gallardo during their telephone conversation .
“ I said , ‘ Here , this is not the manner in which we eat . ’

“ I do n’t necessarily want students to eat with one hand or with only one instrument , I want them to eat intelligently at the table , ” he said .
“ I want them to eat correctly with respect for others who are eating with them .
That ’s all I ask .
Personally , I do n’t have any problems with it , but it is not the way you see people eat every day .
I have never seen somebody eat with a spoon and a fork at the same time . ”

CSMB spokesman Brigitte Gauvreau says the board will not comment — due to confidentiality procedures — until Gallardo ’s complaint is filed and she makes a public statement .
I received a very pleasant mail today .
My inbox is usually full of stupid cease & desist messages from various antipiracy organizations , but it ’s mails like this one which make you happy .
It ’s good to see that some people realize that internet piracy is n’t just evil …
To Whom It May Concern :
My name is Eric D. Wilkinson and I am the producer of a small independent film called “ Jerome Bixby ’s The Man From Earth ” ( our review ) .
I am sending you this email after realizing that our website has had nearly 23,000 hits in the last 12 days , much of it coming from your website .
In addition , our trailer , both on the www.manfromearth.com site and other sites like YouTube , MySpace and AOL has been watched nearly 20,000 times AND what ’s most impressive is our ranking on IMDb went from being the 11,235th most popular movie , to the 5th most popular movie in 2 weeks ( we are also the # 1 independent film on IMDb & the # 1 science fiction film on IMDb ) .
How did this all happen ?
Two words : Torrent / File Sharing sites ( well , four words and a slash ) .
More specifically , RLSLOG.net .
Our independent movie had next to no advertising budget and very little going for it until somebody ripped one of the DVD screeners and put the movie online for all to download .
After that happened , people were watching it and started posting mostly all positive reviews on IMDb , Amazon and other places .
Most of the feedback from everyone who has downloaded “ The Man From Earth ” has been overwhelmingly positive .
People like our movie and are talking about it , all thanks to piracy on the net !
Am I upset … surprisingly no .
Thanks to everyone who has downloaded this torrrent and watched the film , our awareness level is through the roof .
For that I say , “ THANK YOU ” !
What you guys have done here is nothing short of amazing .

YOU HAVE HELPED PUT THIS LITTLE MOVIE ON THE MAP !!!!
When I make my next picture , I just may upload the movie on the net myself !
This guy really deserves support from the file shareing community !
You can support producers of The Man From Earth by buying the retail DVD , which should be available in the US stores from tomorrow .
Update : Proof for the non believers :
With so many scams on the internet these days it is not entirely surprising that some may jump to conclusions about the legitimacy of this whole ordeal .
Well for one I can tell you he does indeed check out as legitimate .
Here are some reasons :
his comment IP matches his comcast ISP when a whois query is initiated his email is the same on his myspace page and he references in his rlslog comments he recently added more proof with an image of himself with the rlslog .

Recently his new myspace message confirms .
Also the Director , Richard Schenkman gives his backup that both of the men have “ discussed the matter quite extensively before reaching out to the download community . ”
But their whole idea behind ‘ going public ’ was to “ pull a Radiohead … to reach out to the online community and say , “ If you downloaded this movie and liked it , please buy the DVD ; and if you ca n’t buy the DVD where you live , please send us some money . ”

HOW can Americans overcome their divisions ?
Barack Obama , the son of a lapsed Kenyan Muslim , has some arresting thoughts .
On the subject of tackling head - on “ the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America ” , the junior senator from Illinois delivered last week one of the best speeches of his brief career .
He told the story of a doctor who wrote to him when he was running for the Senate in 2004 .
The doctor said he might vote for Mr Obama , but was repelled by a line on his campaign website promising to fight “ right - wing ideologues who want to take away a woman 's right to choose ” .
The doctor wrote : “ I sense that you have a strong sense of justice , [ but ] whatever your convictions , if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women , then you , in my judgment , are not fair - minded . ”
Mr Obama says he “ felt a pang of shame ” .
The offending words , which he called “ standard Democratic boilerplate language ” , had been posted on his website by campaign staffers .
He had them changed ; not because he had changed his mind about abortion , but because he wanted to “ extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me ” .
Concerning the proper role of religion in politics , Mr Obama cautions against extremism of both stripes .
Believers cannot abandon what they believe ; but in a nation that includes Christians , Jews , Hindus , Muslims , Buddhists and non-believers , “ democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal , rather than religion - specific , values . ”
Even if all Americans were Christian , it would not be easy to decide which passages of scripture should guide public policy .
“ Should we go with Leviticus , which suggests slavery is OK and that eating shellfish is abomination ? ” he asks .
“ Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount — a passage that is so radical that it 's doubtful that our own Defence Department would survive its application ? ”
His elegantly non-committal answer : “ Before we get carried away , let 's read our Bibles . ”
For someone so inexperienced , and whose policies are so ill - defined , Mr Obama is extraordinarily popular .
He is only 44 , but people are already begging him to run for president .
Something about him fills a gap in American politics : he seems not to be faking when he talks of mending America 's religious and racial divides .
He is that rare thing , a black politician who addresses the whole nation , not just an ethnic enclave .
That this is rare is tragic .
It is also virtually inevitable , given the way the electoral system works .
As a senator , Mr Obama is accountable to an entire state 's voters .
But every other black member of Congress sits in the House of Representatives , where most represent gerrymandered majority - black districts .
Unlike Mr Obama , they need not bother appealing to whites .
They need not worry about the ideological centre ground , either ; since no Republican can win a majority - black district , the crucial contest is the Democratic primary , in which only the most passionate Democrats vote .
Racial gerrymandering has two effects .
First , and most conspicuously , it allows some crummy candidates to win by prodding racial sore spots .
Cynthia McKinney , for example , a congresswoman from Georgia , seems to believe that every misfortune that befalls her or America is somehow rooted in racism .
When she was reproached for punching a policeman in March , the real issue , she said , was that he was a racist for not recognising her .
Had he realised her rank , he would not have stopped her as she strode past him .
Ms McKinney is also known for her interest in conspiracy theories about the murders of Martin Luther King and the rapper Tupac Shakur , and about President George Bush 's supposed foreknowledge of the attacks of September 11th 2001 .
That last enthusiasm cost her her seat in 2002 , a misfortune her father blamed on the Jews .
But she won it back in 2004 .
The second effect of racial gerrymandering is less obvious , but more important .
Most members of the congressional black caucus are fine politicians .
But the process by which they are chosen practically guarantees that they cluster near one pole of American politics , to the left of most Democrats and indeed most blacks .
This makes them less influential than they should be , even when Democrats control the House .
And they find the House a rotten launching pad for higher office , because running in a 60 % black district is poor preparation for a statewide campaign .
Mr Obama is the only black senator , and there are no black governors .
Why polarisers prevail
Fans of racial gerrymandering argue that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requires it .
This is not obvious from the text , but bureaucrats and judges have read it that way .
Fretting that racially separate voting districts depend on the “ demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race ... think alike , ” the Supreme Court has occasionally struck down the most contorted gerrymanders ( including , in 1995 , the first district in Georgia to elect Ms McKinney ) .
But most pass muster , and the civil - rights establishment is zealous in their defence .
There was a big hoo - hah two weeks ago when House Republicans postponed a vote to renew for another 25 years certain emergency provisions of the Voting Rights Act — provisions that had originally been due to expire in 1970 .
This was wrongly portrayed as a reluctance to renew the act itself , which is permanent .
The right of black Americans to vote is no longer up for debate .
Unfortunately , there is not much debate about gerrymandering either .
Incumbents like picking their voters , whether they are black , white , Republican or Democratic .
The practice may help polarise America along racial , religious and political lines , but it also helps them keep their jobs .
ATLANTA , Jan 30 ( Reuters ) -
The inability of John Edwards to gain traction in his bid for the U.S. Democratic presidential nomination indicates that fighting poverty in America has limited appeal for voters .
Edwards told audiences it was " the issue of my life . "
But he dropped out of the race on Wednesday because too few responded to his anger at inequality , his heart - rending stories of suffering and his passion about combating corporate greed .
" These are not issues that generate a lot of votes or poll particularly well , " said Mari Culver , wife of Iowa 's Democratic Gov. Chet Culver and a tireless campaigner for Edwards in her home state .
Critics called the former senator a hypocrite last summer for getting a $ 400 haircut and building a large house , but by the end of his campaign many advocates for the poor praised his dedication to the issue .
Edwards came second in Iowa 's caucuses but saw his rivals Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama use some of his best lines , eat into his voting base and weave his issues into larger themes more attractive to Democrats , analysts said .
Nowhere was that clearer than in post - hurricane New Orleans where Edwards launched and ended his campaign , said Louisiana pollster Bernie Pinsonat .
The city , devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , was a perfect example of the case that Washington fails to provide economic justice .
But even in New Orleans , poverty was not a vote winner because the celebrity of Obama and Clinton made Edwards a third choice even for storm sufferers and voters elsewhere in Louisiana were suspicious of how the city 's government used its resources .
" His whole campaign was based on a strategy of helping the poor .
When Obama got in it was a flawed strategy because in South Carolina and in New Orleans ( black ) voters were not going to vote for him , " said Pinsonat of Southern Media and Opinion .
" PROBLEMS OF THE POOR "
Given that 47 million U.S. citizens lack health insurance and there is a vast gulf in incomes between the richest and poorest Americans one might expect social equality would be a priority for many voters .
But a Pew Research Center survey this month showed " dealing with the problems of the poor " ranks 13th on a list of domestic priorities for voters , a position that has held steady for years and did not change much even in the wake of Katrina .
People express their concern about poverty through voluntary giving and remain suspicious about the effectiveness of government programs , said Michael Dimmock , the Pew Center 's associate director .
And a stark difference of opinion remains on the causes of poverty .
Many say that America 's offer of opportunity allows anyone with a strong work ethic to climb out of poverty .
Government therefore should not redress problems caused by irresponsible behavior .
As he bowed out , Edwards said Obama and Clinton had pledged to put ending poverty central to their campaigns .
Yet in his speech he chastised the party for its failure on the issue .
" I do n't know when our party began to turn away from the cause of working people , " said Edwards .
" In this campaign we ... looked them square in the eye and we said : ' We see you , we hear you and we will never forget you . ' "
Some commentators dismissed the electoral viability of the campaign message as out of step with the educated , middle class voters at the core of the Democratic party .
" Populism is n't going to be effective because it does n't create jobs .
It makes economic development harder because it scares investment away and most voters know that , " said politics professor Merle Black of Emory University in Atlanta .
" It 's Great Depression economics at the start of the 21st century , " he said .

It ’s been seven years since pregnant and dangling chads in Florida caused one of the biggest political rifts in U.S. history .
Those faulty Florida ballots also directly led to the passage of federal legislation in 2002 that outlawed punch - card voting machines and allocated billions of dollars in federal funds for states to purchase expensive new electronic voting machines .
Now new questions are being raised about who was responsible for the faulty punch cards in that election .
And according to last night ’s Dan Rather Reports episode , the fingers point to Sequoia Voting Systems , which not only makes e-voting machines that replaced punch cards but also created the punch cards that failed in Florida .
Rather and his producers spoke with several former workers of Sequoia who revealed that in 2000 the company changed the paper stock it used for punch cards to paper made by Boise Cascade and that they knew before the election that the punch cards that Sequoia was producing would cause problems .
In fact , pre-election testing by Sequoia showed that the cards were not punching cleanly and that dangling chads were going to be a likely problem in the election .
The original transcript from the Rather program is difficult to read because it lacks punctuation and paragraph breaks , but I ’ve added paragraph breaks here so you can understand more clearly what the workers told Rather .
You can also watch the entire Dan Rather report , The Trouble with Touch Screens , here .
Per the transcript :
Linda Evans recalls the chad testing of ballots manufactured for the 2000 election .
Chads were falling out .
Chads were hanging up .
We ’ve got a machine that it we call a gang punch , which in a sense punches out all the holes at the same time .
You slide the card in there and you pull down the handle and it punches out all the holes .
They were n’t punching out .
They were hanging up all over the places .
They were aware of that .
Oh , management was aware of it .
We told ’em .
Ms. Evans says that management had a simple response to her warnings :
It ’ll be okay .
But it was n’t okay , according to Evans and her co-workers .
They believe that the chad problems at the factory became chad problems in Florida - causing at the very least thousands of undervotes , due to hanging or stuck chads .
There were over 10,000 undervotes in Palm Beach County .
According to Rather , more than 50,000 Sequoia punch cards were discarded as invalid because voters appeared to have overvoted , and on 17,000 of the Sequoia cards , voters seemed to have voted for three or more presidential candidates .
As soon as news about the problematic Florida ballots hit the airwaves , Sequoia ’s workers told Rather they immediately knew where the blame lay , though they never told reporters .
It ’s the morning after the election in 2000 .
You turned on the television , you turned on the radio and you saw and heard about the mess in Florida .
Tell me what you thought .
Let ’s start over with you .
What ’d you think ?
Oh , man .
Somebody blew it bad and I bet it was us .
Well , I– I knew it was us and – I did n’t expect anything less than fiascos .
Because you knew you were dealing with bad paper .
Because we were dealing with bad paper and old tooling .
I get a phone call .
And it ’s– the first one was from my wife .
She goes , “ What you guys do ? ” I go , “ What happened ? ”
She goes , “ The ballots are bad in Florida .
Palm Beach . ”
So , then , I hang up and then the next person calls me is my boss Jim Johnson and he tells me , “ We blew it .
The ballots are bad in Florida . ”
It ’s all over the news and when you got to the plant in the days after the election , what was the scene there ?
It was chaotic .
They were moving stuff , hiding stuff , get rid of this .
Hiding stuff ?
Yeah , because the news people wanted to come in and talk to people and they wanted to tour the plant .
We were told to get rid of everything , anything that had Florida on it had to disappear
And did it disappear ?
Yes .
Nothing with any kind of Boise Cascade labels was supposed to be left around .
And that word came from whom ?
Brian Lehrman .
Who was ?
The plant manager .
We repeatedly invited Sequoia to have Brian Lehrman on camera to answer some of the workers allegations Sequoia declined .
The worker goes on to make an unsubstantiated claim about what he thinks happened in the 2000 election .
My own personal opinion was the touch screen voting system was n’t getting off the ground like that they– like they would hope .
And because they were n’t having any problems with paper ballots .
So , I feel like they– deliberately did all this to have problems with the paper ballots so the electronically voting systems would get off the ground - and which it did in a big way .

Die Scientology - Organisation weist die gegen sie erhobenen Vorwürfe zurück .
In einer ersten Stellungnahme bezeichnete die Organisation die Entscheidung der Bundesinnenministerkonferenz , Scientology als verfassungsfeindlich einzustufen und die Einleitung eines Verbotsverfahrens zu prüfen , als „ nicht nachvollziehbar “ .
In seltener Einmütigkeit hatten die Innenminister von Bund und Ländern zuvor beschlossen , ihren Kurs gegen Scientology zu verschärfen .
Zudem sollen verfassungsfeindliche Vereine wie etwa NPD - nahe Stiftungen nicht länger gemeinnützig sein .
Alle 17 Teilnehmer der Innenministerkonferenz seien sich einig gewesen , „ dass wir Scientology für eine nicht mit der Verfassung vereinbare Organisation halten “ , sagte der Vorsitzende der Innenministerkonferenz , Berlins Innensenator Ehrhart Körting ( SPD ) .
Die Innenminister wollen nun ein mögliches Verbot der Organisation prüfen lassen .
Es sei eine Bitte an die Verfassungsschutzbehörden von Bund und Ländern ergangen , die nötigen Informationen für ein Verbot von Scientology zu sammeln .
Ein Verbotsantrag darf nicht Scheitern
Einschränkend sagte Körting jedoch , dass es bei dem Beschluss nicht primär um ein Verbot der Organisation gehe .
Wichtig seien vor allem Prävention und Aufklärung .
Wenn es zum Schutz der Betroffenen nötig sei , könne gegebenenfalls ein Verbot helfen .
Ob ein vereinsrechtliches Ermittlungsverfahren erforderlich ist , solle im Herbst 2008 entschieden werden .
Danach könne auch über einen möglichen Verbotsantrag entschieden werden .
Anzeige
Der niedersächsische Innenminister Uwe Schünemann ( CDU ) warnte im Vorfeld der Entscheidung jedoch vor einem möglichen Scheitern eines Verbotsverfahrens gegen die Organisation .
„ Unsere Fachleute sagen uns , ein Vereinsverbot stünde auf tönernen Füßen “ , sagte Schünemann der „ Hannoverschen Allgemeinen Zeitung “ .
Es wäre ein fatales Signal , wenn ein Verbotsverfahren keinen Erfolg hätte .
In Deutschland wurde die 1954 in den USA durch den Science - Fiction - Autor Ron L. Hubbard gegründete Organisation vor allem durch die Auftritte von US - Schauspielern wie Tom Cruise und John Travolta bekannt , die in Interviews ihre Scientology - Mitgliedschaft immer wieder verteidigen .
Die deutsche Niederlassung tritt in der Öffentlichkeit dagegen wenig in Erscheinung , versucht jedoch seit Jahren als Kirche anerkannt zu werden .
Bisher ist Scientology nur als Verein registriert .
Gleichwohl ist die Organisation schon länger im Fokus der Behörden .
Schon 1997 stellten die Länderinnenminister fest , dass die Ziele von Scientology gefährlich sind und die demokratische Grundordnung bedrohen .
Daher wurde damals die Beobachtung durch den Verfassungsschutz beschlossen .
Viele Aussteiger der Psychosekte sprechen zudem von Versuchen der „ Gehirnwäsche “ und berichten über massive Einschüchterungsversuche nachdem sie ihren Austritt aus der Sekte erklärt haben .
Scientology setzt wichtige Menschenrechte außer Kraft
Anzeige
In Deutschland trat Scientology erstmals 1970 auf .
Etwa 5000 bis 6000 Mitglieder zählte die Organisation nach Angaben des Bundesamtes für Verfassungsschutz im vergangenen Jahr in Deutschland .
Scientology Deutschland betreibt zehn „ Kirchen “ , die sich allesamt in Großstädten befinden .
Zudem gibt es rund 14 „ Missionen “ .
In einem Urteil stellte das Verwaltungsgericht Köln „ tatsächliche Anhaltspunkte “ dafür fest , dass Scientology Bestrebungen gegen die freiheitlich demokratische Grundordnung verfolge .
Wichtige Grund - und Menschenrechte wie die Menschenwürde oder das Recht auf freie Entfaltung der Persönlichkeit werden bei Scientology außer Kraft gesetzt oder eingeschränkt .
Außerdem strebe die Organisation eine Gesellschaft ohne freie Wahlen an .
Scientology verfolgt nach jüngeren Beobachtungen des Verfassungsschutzes Expansionsbestrebungen für die ganze EU .
In Deutschland hat die Niederlassung in Berlin die wichtigste Funktion .
Berlin sei „ die lebenswichtige Adresse “ für Scientology , heißt es in einem internen Papier .
„ Um unsere planetarischen Rettungskampagnen in Anwendung zu bringen , müssen wir die obersten Ebenen der deutschen Regierung in Berlin erreichen “ , heißt es in dem vom Verfassungsschutz zitierten Papier .
Die Innenminister beschlossen in Berlin überdies , parteinahe Vereine mit verfassungsfeindlichen Zielen nicht als gemeinnützig anzuerkennen oder ihnen die Gemeinnützigkeit zu entziehen .
Dies könnte vor allem NPD - nahe Organisationen betreffen .
Die Innenminister seien sich „ völlig “ einig , dass die NPD verfassungsfeindlich sei , so Körting .
Dafür sei keine Gesetzesänderung nötig , sagte Körting .
Gleichwohl halte er es für sinnvoll , gesetzlich festzuschreiben , dass Stiftungen verfassungsfeindlicher Organisationen nicht mit demokratischen Stiftungen gleichgesetzt werden dürften .

Rick In Jail Submitted by Melissa Lepley on Tue , 2007 - 10 - 23 04:04 Hello SOLOists ,
I have n’t been around for a while , because for the last three weeks , I have been wading through a governmental cesspool of apathy , bureaucracy , and red tape .
Some of you may have noticed the absence of Rick Giles from this forum for the last month or so .
He is not on vacation ; he has not given up , or left in a huff .
He is in jail , and has been since the 26th or 27th of September .
He has been in prison , without arrest , without trial , without legal recourse or appeal , for almost a month .
And why ?
What heinous crime , you might ask , warrants being thrown into jail with no rights , no information , and no idea how long he ’ll be incarcerated ?
Well , the combined crimes of not being a US citizen and misreading the date on his tourist visa .
Rick was asking directions to the bus station , as pedestrians are n’t allowed to cross the border into Canada , on the 26th of last month .
Instead of helping , the policeman took his ID , checked his visa , and found that instead of expiring on the 27th , as Rick believed , it expired on the 20th .
He was taken into custody , and has been there ever since .
The INS , which is supposed to notify the New Zealand embassy whenever a NZ citizen is arrested , did not .
His social worker , whom he requested get the address and phone number of the NZ consulate , got him the contact information for the embassy in New Zealand .
If he had n’t written my phone number on his arm during the few moments he had alone with his stuff , nobody would have any idea where he is .
He used his one phone - call to call me , and I have harassed , begged , and bluffed my way to getting his address , inmate number , and all the information I can get , which is woefully little .
I have made contact with the NZ consulate in Chicago , and the Embassy in Washington DC .
I informed them that one of their citizens had been summarily tossed into prison for the smallest offense imaginable .
You ’ll be glad to know that they are using their full diplomatic might on his behalf .
They are making a file .
They faxed him a letter informing him of his rights , which amount to nothing .
They are very friendly and courteous , and try to be helpful .
However , unless the US starts to torture Rick , there ’s nothing they can do .
Apparently the US government can hold him as long as they want , for whatever reason ( or lack thereof ) they choose .
This is a plea , dear SOLOists , from me .
If anyone has any experience with dealing with the INS , or with the US Justice system … if anyone knows anything or anyone who can help , or even give advice , please contact me .
I have done everything I can think of , and he ’s still there , no court date , no rights , and no expectation of release .
I can write letters to him , and send him books , writing materials , and stamps .
However , I do n’t even know where to begin to get him free .
Thank you .

FOR George Bush , the presidency is becoming a tragic tale of unintended consequences .
In foreign policy , the man who sought to transform Iraq , the Middle East and America 's reputation has indeed had revolutionary effects , though not the ones he was aiming for .
Now something similar seems to be happening in domestic politics .
The most conservative president in recent history , a man who sought to turn his victories of 2000 and 2004 into a Republican hegemony , may well end up driving the Western world 's most impressive political machine off a cliff .
That machine has put Republicans in the White House in seven of the past ten contests .
At times it has seemed as if the Democrats ( oddly , given their status as the less Godly party ) have had to rely on divine intervention to get elected .
Watergate helped Jimmy Carter in 1976 , just as the end of the cold war and Ross Perot 's disruptive third - party campaign helped Bill Clinton in 1992 .
Better organised and more intellectually inventive than their “ liberal ” rivals , American conservatives have controlled the agenda even when they have lost :
Mr Clinton is best remembered for balancing the budget and passing welfare reform , both conservative achievements .
In a country where one in three people see themselves as conservatives ( against one in five as liberals ) and where the South and West have grown far more quickly than the liberal north - east , it is easy to see why Mr Bush and his strategist , Karl Rove , dreamed of banishing Democrats from power for a generation .
Now they would settle for a lot less .
Having recaptured Congress last year , the Democrats are on course to retake the presidency in 2008 .
Only one Republican , Rudy Giuliani , looks competitive in the polls , and his campaign is less slick than those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Voters now favour generic Democratic candidates over Republican ones by wide margins .
Democrats are more trusted even on traditional conservative issues , such as national security , and they have opened up a wide gap among the young , among independents and among Latinos ( see article ) .
For this , he is not guilty
The easy scapegoat is Mr Bush himself .
During his presidency , the words Katrina , Rumsfeld , Abramoff , Guantánamo and Libby have become shorthand for incompetence , cronyism or extremism .
Indeed , the failings of Mr Bush 's coterie are oddly reassuring for some conservatives : once he has gone , they can regroup , as they did after his father was ousted in 1992 .
Yet this President Bush is not a good scapegoat .
Rather than betraying the right , he has given it virtually everything it craved , from humongous tax cuts to conservative judges .
Many of the worst errors were championed by conservative constituencies .
Some of the arrogance in foreign policy stems from the armchair warriors of neoconservatism ; the ill - fated attempt to “ save ” the life of the severely brain - damaged Terri Schiavo was driven by the Christian right .
Even Mr Bush 's apparently oxymoronic trust in “ big - government conservatism ” is shared in practice by most Republicans in Congress .
From this perspective , the worrying parallel for the right is not 1992 but the liberal overreach of the 1960s .
By embracing leftish causes that were too extreme for the American mainstream — from unfettered abortion to affirmative action — the Democrats cast themselves into the political wilderness .
Now the American people seem to be reacting to conservative over - reach by turning left .
More want universal health insurance ; more distrust force as a way to bring about peace ; more like greenery ; ever more dislike intolerance on social issues .
Be careful what you wish for
So some sort of shift seems to be under way .
Would it be a change for the better ?
The Economist has never made any secret of its preference for the Republican Party 's individualistic “ western ” wing rather than the moralistic “ southern ” one that Mr Bush has come to typify .
It is hard to imagine Ronald Reagan sponsoring a federal amendment banning gay marriage or limiting federal funding for stem - cell research .
Yet Mr Bush 's departure hardly guarantees a move back to the centre .
Social liberals like Mr Giuliani and Arnold Schwarzenegger are in a minority on the right .
On the one issue where Mr Bush fought the intolerant wing of his party , immigration , the nativists won — and perhaps lost the Latino vote for a generation .
In terms of foreign policy , America 's allies , especially in Europe , would also be unwise to start celebrating , for two reasons .
First , some of the changes that would stem from a more Democratic America would be unwelcome .
The Democrats are moving to the left not just on health care , but also on trade ; and a more protectionist America would soon make the world 's poor regret Mr Bush 's passing .
Similarly , many Europeans may yearn for a less interventionist America ; but an isolationist superpower could be much more frightening .
Second , America , even if it shifts to the left , will still be a conservative force on the international stage .
Mrs Clinton might be portrayed as a communist on talk radio in Kansas , but set her alongside France 's Nicolas Sarkozy , Germany 's Angela Merkel , Britain 's David Cameron or any other supposed European conservative , and on virtually every significant issue Mrs Clinton is the more right - wing .
She also mentions God more often than the average European bishop .
As for foreign policy , the main Democratic candidates are equally staunch in their support of Israel ; none of them has ruled out attacking Iran ; Mr Obama might take a shot at Pakistan ; and few of them want to cede power to multilateral organisations .
One finding that stands out in the polls is that most Americans distrust government strongly .
Forty years ago they turned against a leftish elite trying to boss them around ; now they have had to endure a right - wing version .
In democracies political revolutions usually become obvious only in retrospect .
In 1968 , with America stuck in another bruising war , few liberals saw Richard Nixon 's southern strategy as part of a long - term turn to the right .
All that was clear then was that most Americans urgently wanted a change of direction .
That is also true today .
The money raised will be used to buy a football strip
Nora Hardwick , who will be 102 next week , decided to pose behind the bar of her local pub in Ancaster , Lincolnshire dressed only in a pink scarf .
Nora is Miss November in the calendar , which is supporting Ancaster Athletic .
She said : " I am always game for anything , especially if it 's for charity .
I did enjoy it , though I do n't suppose I will do it again . "
Football strip
Donna Moodie , 37 , landlady at Nora 's local pub , the Ermine Way , said : " I thought if Nora would do it , then everyone would .
She 's amazing . "
As well as Nora , mothers of some of the team players have appeared in the calendar .
Ancaster parish councillor Sandy Ford - Pain , whose husband Jonathan still coaches the youngsters , said they hoped to sell 400 calendars .
The money raised is being spent on a football strip so a second team can be set up .
Mrs Ford - Pain , 35 , posed as Miss December for the calendar .
She said they had raised £ 1,000 last year by asking men in the village to pose nude .
Not all the Iraqi training money can be accounted for
Sloppy accounting by the US army command meant there was no paper trail for much of the spending , they say .
The report , based on a visit from March to May this year , said high levels of violence made it hard to oversee management of the fund .
However , it also said commanders had begun implementing recommended changes .
Shortcomings
The report said the Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq was unable to provide " reasonable assurance " that money was not wasted and that the intended results had been achieved .
And it could not always show that equipment , services and construction had been delivered properly .
In the report , the Inspector - General 's office called for improvements to the way the command kept track of money .
The report highlighted a number of shortcomings including :
a paper trail available for only 12.9 % of arms , ammunition and other purchases worth $ 643 m
a paper trail available for only 1 % of a separate series of purchases worth $ 82.8
only 13 of 31 heavy - tracked recovery vehicles worth $ 10.2 m could be accounted for
only 12 of 18 rubbish trucks worth $ 700,000 could be accounted for
no proof that 2,126 of 2,943 generators worth $ 7 m had been received by Iraqi security forces
But the report was happier with the way the command had purchased services .
It said there was documentation for 95.5 % of $ 1.2 bn spent on food preparation , maintenance , sanitation , freight , lodging and security .
' No intentional fraud '
This is the latest in a series of reports criticising economic performance in Iraq .
In October , the US State Department said a $ 1.2bn contract for training Iraqi police was so badly managed that auditors did not know how the money was spent .
The private US company running the programme , DynCorp , said there had been no intentional fraud .
In July , the head of the US agency overseeing reconstruction in Iraq , Stuart Bowen , told the BBC that economic mismanagement and corruption were equivalent to a second insurgency .
At the same time Oxfam and a coalition of Iraqi NGOs said nearly a third of the population was in need of immediate emergency aid .
And in January , Mr Bowen said in a report to the US Congress that millions of dollars of US reconstruction funds were being wasted .
Greenpeace , the environmental advocacy group , ranks Sony Ericsson as the most environmentally responsible electronics maker while slamming Microsoft and Nintendo for their poor e-waste management efforts as well as for high levels of toxic materials in their electronics products .
On Monday Greenpeace released the sixth edition of its quarterly " Guide to Greener Electronics , " in which it ranks 18 leading electronics manufacturers on their efforts to eliminate toxic substances from their products and other efforts to be environmentally responsible .
The Greenpeace guide considers manufacturers ' efforts to curtail the use of materials such as vinyl plastics ( PVC ) and brominated flame retardants ( BFRs ) from their products .
It also examines the companies ' other efforts , including various product takeback initiatives and discarded product recycling efforts .
( The group 's methodology and criteria are available on its website . )
The most recent edition of the group 's ranking includes a number of new companies such as Phillips , Sharp , Nintendo and Microsoft , the market leaders in the television and game console spaces .
green electronics
London - based Mobile handset maker Sony Ericsson received the first - place ranking because it plans to have all BFRs removed from its products by the start of 2008 , and also because all its handsets have been free of PVC plastic since 2006 .
However , the company was penalized because it provided inaccurate information to consumers regarding its handset recycling efforts .
Greenpeace investigators found that product takeback programs advertised in Thailand , Russia , Argentina and India were nonexistent .
Companies that received low scores on the Green Scorecard provide little or no information on the toxic materials found within their electronics products , or such products contain uncommonly high levels of such materials , according to Greenpeace .
Low scores can also be a result of a lack of effective product takeback and recycling efforts on the part of companies .
The rankings are based on publicly available information , as well as Greenpeace communications with the manufacturers about recycling and product takeback programs .
Iza Kruszewska , toxics campaigner at Greenpeace International , said in a statement that Greenpeace will continue to check up on companies ' " going green " claims .
The Greenpeace scorecard ranking is as follows :
-- Sony Ericsson , up from second place in the last edition of the guide
-- Samsung , up from eighth
-- Sony , up from sixth
-- Dell , down from third - place tie with Lenovo ; Lenovo , down from third - place tie with Dell
-- Toshiba , up from 10th
-- LG
Electronics , down from fifth
-- Fujitsu - Siemens , down from eighth
-- Nokia , down from the number - one slot
-- HP , up from 13th
-- Apple , up from the 12th - place tie with Acer
-- Acer , down from the 12th - place tie with Apple
-- Panasonic , up from 14th
-- Motorola , down from ninth place
-- Sharp , first time in the ranking
-- Microsoft , first time in the ranking
-- Phillips , first time in the ranking
-- Nintendo , first time in the ranking
Nokia , which has held one of the top two slots in all of Greenpeace 's last five rankings , fell to ninth place , due in large part to " corporate misbehavior " related to its product takeback and recycling efforts .
Greenpeace investigators found confusing information about such programs that were advertised on the Web for Thailand , the Philippines , Russia , Argentina and India .
Nokia employees in these areas were also unaware of any such programs , according to Greenpeace .
The Finnish company also lost points for poor reporting related to the amounts of discarded handsets it 's recycling .
Also noteworthy is the fact that Microsoft , maker of the Xbox 360 gaming console , scored badly in the majority of Greenpeace 's waste criteria , including the fact that all its gaming products included both PVC plastics and BFRs , and it does n't currently offer any form of voluntary takeback program .
Microsoft also reports on only the amounts of e-waste it recycles in Europe and not other regions of the world , according to the guide .
Japan 's Nintendo , maker of the Wii gaming system , received the lowest score possible in all hazardous materials removal and product recycling criteria -- meaning it provides little or no information about the hazardous materials used within its product or about its recycling efforts -- along with the last - place ranking overall .
Nintendo responded by saying it was surprised by the report and that it complies with all " relevant regulations , " and that it had even created its own " Green Procurement Standard " for its suppliers according to SPOnG , a gaming website .
The Greener Electronics guide will be updated every three months , and firms ' rankings will reflect their improvements -- or lack thereof -- in reducing the level of toxic substances used within their products and their recycling efforts .
The fifth edition of Greenpeace 's Guide to Greener Electronics was released in September .
This story , " Greenpeace Gives Sony Ericsson the Thumbs Up " was originally published by CIO .

Former New York Mayor Ed Koch told WeAreChange reporters during a book signing that he indeed faulted Giuliani for destroying criminal evidence at the 9/11 scene .
" For removing evidence , I fault him on that , along with a lot of other things , " Koch told cameras .
Indeed Giuliani ’s Administration has been criticized for the removal of steel evidence and its sale to scrapyards in China and India , for the callous act of using remains at ground zero to fill pot holes and for sending the leftovers ( that included human remains ) to Fresh Kills landfill en masse .
However , Koch quickly dismissed a series of questions he considered to be ‘ engaged in a conspiracy theory . ’
" There are people who believe … those buildings were loaded with dynamite .
You wanna believe it , believe it .
I do n’t . "
The colorful former mayor instead parroted concerns about the world - wide Islamist conspiracy .
" We ’re the number one super power , and we have to defend ourselves .
I believe there ’s an Islamist conspiracy to restore the Caliphate meaning all muslim countries shall be under the rule of one religioius leader . "
Koch brushed off an array of other questions .
MORE ON KOCH from Wikipedia : Apparently Koch had been targeted for murder circa 1976 in relation to Operation : Condor by the Uruguayan military .
Koch says George H.W. Bush , then CIA director , told him that " his sponsorship of legislation to cut off US military assistance to Uruguay on human rights grounds had provoked secret police officials to ‘ put a contract out for you ’ . "
Also on Condor : On September 11 , 2001 , the 28th anniversary of the Pinochet coup , Chilean human rights lawyers filed a criminal case against Kissinger along with Augusto Pinochet , former Bolivian general and president Hugo Banzer , former Argentine general and dictator Jorge Rafael Videla , and former Paraguayan president Alfredo Stroessner for alleged involvement in Operation Condor .
The case was brought on behalf of some fifteen victims of Operation Condor , ten of whom were Chilean .[ citation needed ]

A man who joined Facebook to look at his friend 's wedding pics , was sent to jail after the site automatically sent a " friend request " message to his estranged wife .
Dillon Osborn , of Newport Pagnell Bucks , had been told by magistrates to stay away from his wife , Claire Tarbox , after bombarding her with phone calls and text messages , the Daily Telegraph reports .
A judge ordered him to spend ten days in prison for breaking his bail conditions .
Osborn , 37 , served seven days , getting out a little early after a plea from his solicitor .
Osborn told the Telegraph .
that Facebook 's sign - in procedure had confused him .
I certainly had n’t intended to contact my wife ...
I did n’t even know she had a Facebook account .
To be honest , I do n’t think the judge understood how it works either .
People on Facebook should be careful - this could easily happen to someone else . ” ®

SAN ANTONIO , Texas ( Reuters ) - David Lee “ Tex ” Hill , who flew with the Flying Tigers in China during World War Two and was said to be the inspiration for John Wayne ’s character in a 1942 movie about the squadron , died at his San Antonio home on Thursday at the age of 92 , his family said .
He was a Naval aviator who in 1941 joined what was officially known as the American Volunteer Group , a mercenary squad recruited to help defend China against Japan .
The Flying Tigers had a fearsome shark ’s mouth painted on the front of their single - engine fighter planes and gained much publicity for their success against the Japanese early in the war , when good news about the Allied forces was rare .
The squadron , which was led by Gen. Claire Chennault , became part of the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 .
Hill was credited with downing 18 enemy planes , making him one of the top combat aces of the Pacific theater .
Wayne made “ Flying Tigers ” in 1942 , but did not meet Hill until several years after the war .
He told Hill he based his movie character on him , and they became lifelong friends .
Hill was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and other decorations from the U.S. , Chinese and British governments for his war service .
The son of missionaries , Hill was born in Korea in 1915 and moved to Texas in 1921 when his father was appointed pastor at a San Antonio church .
Capello officially starts the England job on 7 January
The Italian , 61 , will officially start in his new post on 7 January .
Capello said : " I have wanted this job for a long time and I know there are great expectations that go with it .
" My first objective is to meet the players and the club coaches in the Premier League .
England has a great team that can go right to the top . "
Capello , who has signed a four - and - a - half - year contract worth £ 6.5 m a year , said it was a " dream come true " to take the England job .
He needed a translator for his first press conference since accepting the job but said he is determined to improve his English before February 's friendly against Switzerland .
" I am convinced that in one month when I meet up with the squad for the first time , I will be able to speak English , " Capello explained .
" I believe it is very important to communicate with players and I will undergo a strict routine to learn the language - I will apply myself every day . "
The former AC Milan and Real Madrid coach says he will ask his squad why they think England have under - achieved in recent years , and failed to qualify for the finals of Euro 2008 .
" I 'm going to try to understand what happened by talking to the players , " he added .
" I believe that wearing the England shirt should be a matter of pride - I want to see all players playing for England like they do for their clubs . "
Capello acknowledged that managing England will be very different to being in charge of a club side - but says he is confident he can work well with his players , and gain the co-operation of Premier League managers too .
" It is very different , " Capello said .
" My behaviour will have to change , as will the players .
" I have always had an excellent relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger and also the two Spanish managers Rafa Benitez and Juande Ramos .
There is still over a month until my first game and plenty of time for important decisions to be made
Fabio Capello
" I 've always had a fantastic relationship with such individuals , it will be no problem in working alongside them . "
Capello is also keen to add an English coach to his backroom staff , saying : " From the first day I spoke with Sir Trevor Brooking , I have always asked for an English coach to be integrated into the set - up .
" It is something I have done wherever I have been - it is vital have someone from that environment who understands English football and the language . "
Capello was asked about former captain David Beckham 's hopes of winning his 100th cap against Switzerland and continuing his England career until the 2010 World Cup .
During his time at Real Madrid , Capello initially dropped Beckham but recalled him to play an instrumental role in his title - winning team .
Capello said : " I had a contrasting relationship with David Beckham at Real but in the end he demonstrated what a great man and great player he is .
" Also , he is the kind of person I believe , when he sets himself something he will achieve it so you never know but obviously I will have to make choices .
" I believe David 's behaviour is important .
This is a significant appointment and we are delighted with the response from the public and the media .
We know we owe the fans and we believe Fabio Capello is the man to restore our pride
Brian Barwick
" Obviously there is still over a month until my first game and plenty of time for important decisions to be made . "
There has also been speculation over Chelsea defender John Terry 's future as England captain under Capello , but the Italian said he is yet to make a decision .
" I have just arrived , " Capello said .
" There are many things I have to think about , I have got over a month and I will make my decision . "
FA chief executive Brian Barwick is certain Capello will prove to be a success , saying : " We have an outstanding man with an outstanding record .
" This is a significant appointment and we are delighted with the response from the public and the media .
We know we owe the fans and we believe Fabio Capello is the man to restore our pride . "
Barwick confirmed the FA 's plans to restructure coaching in England will go ahead , with the aim of producing some realistic English candidates to succeed Capello .
He stated : " We have talked about root and branch ( reform ) and there has been some scepticism about whether we 'll see that through and whether it was just a smokescreen .
It was n't .
" The FA 's strategic review will be published in March 2008 and it will take us through the next five years .
A direct part of it will be to work out how we take the England situation forward in a positive way .
" It should always be the ambition of the FA , when possible , to recruit an England manager from within our own country .
" On this occasion we felt it was important to get the right man whatever the nationality . "

Preface
This is the 13th edition of the Haskell Communities and Activities Report , and it arrives just in time for the break between the years – if you are bored by all the free time you might suddenly have , why not sit down and study what other Haskellers have been up to during the past six months ?
As always , entries that are completely new ( or have been revived after disappearing temporarily from the edition ) are formatted using a blue background .
Updated entries have a header with a blue background .
In the most cases , I have dropped entries that have not been changed for a year or longer .
Many thanks to all the contributors .
A special “ thank you ” to the many contributors that have attempted to reduce my workload this year by sending their entries in the preferred LaTeX style – more than ever before :
This has made the experience of assembling the report an even greater pleasure !
An interesting idea can be found in the Ansemond LLC entry ( →7.1.1 ) , where a screenshot is included .
I would like the report to become more colourful and have more pictures .
So , for previous editions , if you would like to include a screenshot along with your Haskell - related tool or application , please send it along with your entry .
Many Haskell projects exist now , and most of them seem to be looking for developers .
If you are an enthusiastic Haskell programmer , please consider supporting one of the existing projects by offering your help , and please do n’t forget some of the “ older ” , yet still very successful projects such as Darcs ( →6.13 ) and Cabal ( →4.1.1 ) over the continuous stream of new project and software announcements .
Despite the fun it has been , my time as editor of the Haskell Communities and Activities Report is coming to an end .
I am therefore looking for a new editor who would like to take over and continue the report , possibly adapting it to her or his own vision .
Please contact me if you are interested .
A separate announcement will follow .
If a new editor can be found , we might prepare the next edition together , probably around May , so watch the mailing lists around this time for announcements – we continue to depend and rely on your contributions !
Feedback is of course very welcome < hcar at haskell.org >.
Enjoy the Report !

Planet Haskell is an aggregator of Haskell people ’s blogs and other Haskell - related news sites .
As of mid-November 2007 content from 78 blogs and other sites is being republished in a common format .
A common misunderstanding about Planet Haskell is that it republishes only Haskell content .
That is not its mission .
A Planet shows what is happening in the community , what people are thinking about or doing .
Thus Planets tend to contain a fair bit of “ off - topic ” material .
Think of it as a feature , not a bug .
For information on how to get added to Planet , please read http://planet.haskell.org/policy.html.

The Haskell Weekly News ( HWN ) is a weekly newsletter covering developments in Haskell .
Content includes announcements of new projects , jobs , discussions from the various Haskell communities , notable project commit messages , Haskell in the blogspace , and more .
The Haskell Weekly News also publishes latest releases uploaded to Hackage .
It is published in html form on The Haskell Sequence , via mail on the Haskell mailing list , on Planet Haskell ( →1.3 ) , and via RSS .
Headlines are published on haskell.org ( →1.1 ) .

There are plenty of academic papers about Haskell and plenty of informative pages on the Haskell Wiki .
Unfortunately , there ’s not much between the two extremes .
That ’s where The Monad .
Reader tries to fit in : more formal than a Wiki page , but more casual than a journal article .
There are plenty of interesting ideas that maybe do n’t warrant an academic publication – but that does n’t mean these ideas are n’t worth writing about !
Communicating ideas to a wide audience is much more important than concealing them in some esoteric journal .
Even if its all been done before in the Journal of Impossibly Complicated Theoretical Stuff , explaining a neat idea about ‘ warm fuzzy things ’ to the rest of us can still be plain fun .
The Monad .
Reader is also a great place to write about a tool or application that deserves more attention .
Most programmers do n’t enjoy writing manuals ; writing a tutorial for The Monad .
Reader , however , is an excellent way to put your code in the limelight and reach hundreds of potential users .
Since the last HCAR there have been two new issues , including a special issue about this year ’s Summer of Code .
I ’m always interested in new submissions , whether you ’re an established researcher or fledgling Haskell programmer .
Check out the Monad .
Reader homepage for all the information to you need to start writing your article .

1.5 Books and tutorials
Haskell is one of the leading languages for teaching functional programming , enabling students to write simpler and cleaner code , and to learn how to structure and reason about programs .
This introduction is ideal for beginners : it requires no previous programming experience and all concepts are explained from first principles via carefully chosen examples .
Each chapter includes exercises that range from the straightforward to extended projects , plus suggestions for further reading on more advanced topics .
The presentation is clear and simple , and benefits from having been refined and class - tested over several years .
Features include : freely accessible powerpoint slides for each chapter ; solutions to exercises , and examination questions ( with solutions ) available to instructors ; downloadable code that ’s fully compliant with the latest Haskell release .
Publication details : Published by Cambridge University Press , 2007 .

The goal of the Haskell wikibook project is to build a community textbook about Haskell that is at once free ( as in freedom and in beer ) , gentle and comprehensive .
We think that the many marvelous ideas of lazy functional programming can and thus should be accessible to everyone in a central place .
Since the last report , the wikibook has been progressing slowly but steadily .
A chapter about Applicative Functors has been added , the module about Monads is being rewritten and comprehensive material about graph reduction and lazy evaluation is beginning to emerge .
Thanks to the authors and to the many contributors that spot mistakes and ask those questions we ’d never thought of !

2 Implementations
Lots has happened on the GHC front over the last few months .
We released GHC 6.8.1 on 3 November 2007 .
GHC now has so many users , and such a large feature “ surface area ” , that simply getting to the point where we can make a release is becoming quite a challenge .
Indeed , a good deal of our effort in the last six months has been in the form of consolidation : fixing bugs and solidifying what we have .
These graphs show “ tickets ” which include bugs , feature requests , and tasks .
Of the “ open tickets ” , about half are bugs .
Notice the big spike in “ closed tickets ” just before the 6.8.1 release !
The major new features of 6.8.1 were described in the last issue of the Haskell Communities Newsletter , so we wo n’t repeat them here .
Instead , here are some of the highlights of what we are working on now .
Syntactic and front - end enhancements
Several people have developed syntactic innovations , which are ( or will shortly be ) in the HEAD : Three improvements to records Wild - card patterns for records .
If you have data T = MkT {x , y:: Int , z:: Bool}
then you can say f :: T ->
Int
f ( MkT {..} ) = x+y
g :: Int ->
Int ->
T
g x y = MkT {..}
where
z = x>y
The “ .. ” in a pattern brings into scope all the fields of the record ; while in a record construction it uses variables with those names to initialise the record fields .
Here ’s the user manual entry : http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/docs/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#record-wildcards.

Here ’s the user manual entry : http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/current/docs/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#record-wildcards.
Record puns is a slightly less abbreviated approach .
You can write f like this : f ( MkT {x , y} ) = x+y
whereas Haskell 98 requires you to write x=x , y=y in the pattern .
Similarly in record construction .

You can write like this : whereas Haskell 98 requires you to write in the pattern .
Similarly in record construction .
Record field disambiguation is useful when there are several types in scope , all with the same field name .
For example , suppose another data type S had an x field .
Then if you write h ( MkT {x=p , y=q} ) = ...
there is no doubt which x you mean , but Haskell 98 will complain that there are two x s in scope .
Record field disambiguation just uses the constructor to decide which x you must mean .
None of these changes tackle the deeper issue of whether or not Haskell ’s current approach to records is the Right Way ; rather the changes just make the current approach work a bit better .
Furthermore , they are all somewhat controversial , because they make it harder to see where something comes into scope .
Let ’s see what you think !
View patterns View patterns are implemented , by Dan Licata .
Here ’s a simple example : polar :: Complex -> ( Float , Float )
polar = ...
f :: Complex ->
Bool
f ( polar -> ( r , theta ) ) = r <= 1
Here polar is an ordinary function , used to transform the Complex to polar form .
The view pattern is the argument pattern for f .
Many details here : Hereis an ordinary function , used to transform the Complex to polar form .

Generalised list comprehensions Generalised list comprehensions ( see Comprehensive comprehensions : comprehensions with “ Order by ” and “ Group by ” , Phil Wadler and Simon Peyton Jones , Haskell Workshop 2007 ) have been implemented by Max Bolinbroke .
Example : [ ( the dept , sum salary )
| ( name , dept , salary ) <- employees
, then sortWith by salary
, then takeWhile by salary < 50
, then take 5 ]

Quasi-quoting
We are keen to get Geoff Mainland ’s quasi-quoting mechanism into GHC ( see “ Why It ’s Nice to be Quoted : Quasiquoting for Haskell ” , Geoffrey Mainland .
Haskell Workshop 2007 ) .
Geoff is working on polishing it up .
Type system stuff
The big innovation in GHC ’s type system has been the gradual introduction of indexed type families in the surface syntax , and of type equalities in the internal machinery .
Indexed data families ( called “ associated data types ” when declared in type classes ) are fairly simple , and they work fine in GHC 6.8.1 .
Indexed type families ( aka “ associated type synonyms ” ) are a different kettle of fish , especially when combined with the ability to mention type equalities in overloaded types , thus : f :: forall a b. ( a ~ [ b ] ) => ...
Tom Schrijvers spent three months at Cambridge , working on the theory and implementation of a type inference algorithm .
As a result we have a partially - working implementation , and we understand the problem much better , but there is still much to do , both on the theoretical and practical front .
It ’s trickier than we thought !

It ’s trickier than we thought !
We have a short paper Towards open type functions for Haskell which describes some of the issues , and a wiki page ( http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/TypeFunctions ) that we keep up to date ; it has a link to details of implementation status .
This is all joint work with Martin Sulzmann , Manuel Chakravarty , and Tom Schrijvers .
Parallel GC
Since 6.6 GHC has had support for running parallel Haskell on a multi- processor out of the box .
However , the main drawback has been that the garbage collector is still single - threaded and stop - the - world .
Since GC can commonly account for 30 % of runtime ( depending on the GC settings ) , this can seriously put a crimp in your parallel speedup .
Roshan James did an internship at MSR in 2006 during which he and Simon M worked on parallelising the major collections in GHC ’s generational garbage collector .
We had a working algorithm , but did n’t observe much speedup on a multi-processor .
Since then , Simon rewrote the implementation and spent a large amount of time with various profiling tools , which uncovered some cache - unfriendly behaviour .
We are now seeing some speedup , but there is more tweaking and measuring still to be done .
This parallel GC is likely to be in GHC 6.10 .
Note that parallel GC is independent of whether the Haskell program itself is parallel – so even single - threaded Haskell programs ( e.g. GHC itself ) should benefit from it .
The other side of the coin is to parallelise the minor collections .
These are normally too small and quick to apply the full - scale parallel GC to , and yet the whole system still has to stop to perform a minor GC .
The solution is almost certainly to allow each CPU to GC its own nursery independently .
There is existing research describing how to do this , and we plan to try applying it in context of GHC .
Data parallel Haskell After many months of designing , re-designing , and finally implementing a vectorisation pass operating on GHC ’s Core intermediate language , we finally have a complete path from nested data parallel array programs to the low - level , multi - threaded array library in package ndp .
We are very excited about having reached this milestone , but the path is currently very thin , complete unoptimised , and requires a special Prelude mockup .
More work is required before vectorisation is ready for end - users , but now that the core infrastructure is in place , we expect more rapid progress on user - visible features .
Besides working on optimisations and completing the backend library , we still need to implement Partial Vectorisation of Haskell Programs ( http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/papers/CLPK07.html) and the treatment of unboxed types , which is crucial to vectorise the standard Prelude .
Most of the code was written by Roman Leshchinskiy .
Back end stuff GHC ’s back end code generator has long been known to generate poor code , particularly for tight loops of the kind that are cropping up more and more in highly optimised Haskell code .
So in typical GHC style , rather than patch the immediate problem , we ’re redesigning the entire back end .
What we want to do : Split the STG - to - C -- code generator ( codeGen ) into two : one pass generating C -- with functions and calls , and a second pass ( “ CPS ” ) to manifest the stack and calling / return conventions .
code generator ( codeGen ) into two : one pass generating C with functions and calls , and a second pass ( “ CPS ” ) to manifest the stack and calling / return conventions .
Redesign the calling and return conventions , so that we can use more registers for parameter passing ( this will entail decommissioning the via - C code generator , but the native code generator will outperform it ) .
Give the back end more opportunity to do low - level transformation and optimisation , e.g. by exposing loops at the C -- level .

Implement more optimisations over C -- .

Plug in a better register allocator .
What we ’ve done so far : Michael Adams came for an internship and built a CPS converter for GHC ’s internal C -- data type .

He had barely left when Norman Ramsey arrived for a short sabbatical .
Based on his experience of building back ends for the Quick C -- compiler , he worked on a new zipper - based data structure to represent C -- code , and a sophisticated dataflow framework so that you can write new dataflow analyses in 30 mins .

Ben Lippmeir spent his internship building a graph - colouring , coalescing register allocator for GHC ’s native code generator .
As a result , we now have lots of new code .
Some of it is working ; much of it is as yet un-integrated and un-tested .
However , once we have it all glued back together , GHC will become a place where you can do Real Work on low - level optimisations , and code generation .
Indeed John Dias ( one of Norman ’s graduate students ) will spend six months here in 2008 to do work on code generation .
In short , GHC ’s back end , which has long been a poor relation , is getting a lot of very sophisticated attention .
Expect good things .
Libraries GHC ships with a big bunch of libraries .
That is good for users , but it has two bad consequences , both of which are getting worse with time .
First , it make it much harder to get a release together , because we have to test more and more libraries too .
Second , it ’s harder ( or perhaps impossible ) to upgrade the libraries independently from GHC .
There ’s a meta - issue too : it forces us into a gate - keeper role in which a library gets a big boost by being in the “ blessed set ” shipped with GHC .
Increasingly , therefore , we are trying to decouple GHC from big libraries .
We ship GHC with a set of “ boot ” libraries , without which GHC will not function at all , and “ extra ” libraries , which just happen to come with some binary distributions of GHC , and which can be upgraded separately at any time .
To further that end , we ’ve split the “ base ” package into a bunch of smaller packages , and expect to further split it up for GHC 6.10 .
This has led to lots of pain , because old programs that depended on ‘ base ’ now need to depend on other packages too ; see upgrading packages ( http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Upgrading_packages) for details .
But it ’s good pain , and matters should improve too as Cabal matures .
We have been exploring possibilities for lessening the pain in 6.10 : http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/PackageCompatibility.
We have also devised a package versioning policy which will help future library upgrades : http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Package_versioning_policy.
The York Haskell Compiler ( yhc ) is a fork of the nhc98 compiler , with goals such as increased portability , platform independent bytecode , integrated Hat support and generally being a cleaner code base to work with .
Yhc now compiles and runs almost all Haskell 98 programs , has basic FFI support – the main thing missing is haskell.org base libraries , which is being worked on .
Since that last HCAR we have continued to improve our Yhc .
Core library , making use of it in a number of projects ( optimisers , analysis tools ) to be made available shortly .
The Javascript back end has undergone lots of improvements with new libraries for writing dynamic web pages .

2.3 The Helium compiler Report by : Jurriaan Hage Participants : Jurriaan Hage , Bastiaan Heeren Helium is a compiler that supports only a subset of Haskell ( e.g. , n+k patterns are missing ) .
Moreover , type classes are restricted to a number of built - in type classes and all instances are derived .
The advantage of Helium is that it generates novice friendly error feedback .
The Helium compiler is still available for Download from http://www.cs.uu.nl/helium/.
At this moment , we are working on making version 1.7 available .
Internally little will change except that the interface to Helium will be generalized so that multiple versions of Helium can side by side ( motivated by the development of Neon ) and that the logging facility can be more easily used outside our own environment .
The loggings obtained in classes outside our university may help to improve the external validity of studies performed by using Neon ( →4.2.2 ) .
3 Language
3.1 Variations of Haskell
3.1.1 Liskell Report by : Clemens Fruhwirth Status : experimental
When Haskell consists of Haskell semantics plus Haskell syntax , then Liskell consists of Haskell semantics plus Lisp syntax .
Liskell is Haskell on the inside but looks like Lisp on the outside , as in its source code it uses the typical Lisp syntax forms , namely symbol expressions , that are distinguished by their fully parenthesized prefix notation form .
Liskell captures the most Haskell syntax forms in this prefix notation form , for instance : if x then y else z becomes ( if x y z ) , while a + b becomes (+ a b ) .
Except for aesthetics , there is another argument for Lisp syntax : meta - programming becomes easy .
Liskell features a different meta- programming facility than the one found in Haskell with Template Haskell .
Before turning the stream of lexed tokens into an abstract Haskell syntax tree , Liskell adds an intermediate processing data structure : the parse tree .
The parse tree is essentially is a string tree capturing the nesting of lists with their enclosed symbols stored as the string leaves .
The programmer can implement arbitrary code expansion and transformation strategies before the parse tree is seen by the compilation stage .
After the meta - programming stage , Liskell turns the parse tree into a Haskell syntax tree before it sent to the compilation stage .
Thereafter the compiler treats it as regular Haskell code and produces a Haskell calling convention compatible output .
You can use Haskell libraries from Liskell code and vice versa .
Liskell is implemented as an extension to GHC and its darcs branch is freely available from the project ’s website .
The Liskell Prelude features a set of these parse tree transformations that enables traditional Lisp - styled meta- programming as with defmacro and backquoting .
The project ’s website demonstrates meta- programming application such as proof - of - concept versions of embedding Prolog inference , a minimalistic Scheme compiler and type - inference in meta- programming .
The future development roadmap includes stabilization of its design , improving the user experience for daily programming – especially error reporting – and improving interaction with Emacs .

3.1.2 Haskell on handheld devices Report by : Anthony Sloane Participants : Michael Olney Status : unreleased
The project at Macquarie University ( →7.3.6 ) to run Haskell on handheld devices based on Palm OS has a running implementation for small tests but , like most ports of languages to Palm OS , we are dealing with memory allocation issues .
Also , other higher priority projects have now intervened so this project is going into the background for a while .
3.2 Non-sequential Programming
Status A complete , GHC - based implementation of the parallel Haskell extension GpH and of evaluation strategies is available .
Extensions of the runtime - system and language to improve performance and support new platforms are under development .
System Evaluation and Enhancement A major revision of the parallel runtime environment for GHC 6.8 is currently under development .
The GpH and Eden parallel Haskells share much of the implementation technology and both are being used for parallel language research and in the SCIEnce project ( see below ) .
We have developed an adaptive runtime environment ( GRID - GUM ) for GpH on computational grids .
GRID - GUM incorporates new load management mechanisms that cheaply and effectively combine static and dynamic information to adapt to the heterogeneous and high - latency environment of a multi-cluster computational grid .
We have made comparative measures of GRID - GUM ’s performance on high / low latency grids and heterogeneous / homogeneous grids using clusters located in Edinburgh , Munich and Galashiels .
Results are published in : Al Zain A. Implementing High - Level Parallelism on Computational Grids , PhD Thesis , Heriot - Watt University , 2006 .
Al Zain A. Trinder P.W. Loidl H.W. Michaelson G.J. Evaluating a High - Level Parallel Language ( GpH ) for Computational Grids , IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems ( February 2008 ) .
SMP - GHC , an implementation of GpH for multi-core machines has been developed by Tim Harris , Satnam Singh , Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones .
We are teaching parallelism to undergraduates using GpH at Heriot - Watt and Phillips Universitat Marburg .
GpH Applications
As part of the SCIEnce EU FP6 I3 project ( 026133 ) ( →7.3.10 ) ( April 2006 - April 2011 ) we use GpH and Eden to provide access to computational grids from Computer Algebra ( CA ) systems , including GAP , Maple MuPad and KANT .
We have implemented an interface , GCA , which orchestrates computational algebra components into a high - performance parallel application .
GCA is capable of exploiting a variety of modern parallel / multicore architectures without any change to the underlying code .
GCA is also capable of orchestrating heterogeneous computations across a high - performance computational Grid .
Implementations
The GUM implementation of GpH is available in two main development branches .
The focus of the development has switched to versions tracking GHC releases , currently GHC 6.8 , and the development version is available upon request to the GpH mailing list ( see the GpH web site ) .
The stable branch ( GUM - 4.06 , based on GHC - 4.06 ) is available for RedHat - based Linux machines .
The stable branch is available from the GHC CVS repository via tag gum - 4 - 06 .
Our main hardware platform are Intel - based Beowulf clusters .
Work on ports to other architectures is also moving on ( and available on request ) : A port to a Mosix cluster has been built in the Metis project at Brooklyn College , with a first version available on request from Murray Gross .

Description Eden has been jointly developed by two groups at Philipps Universität Marburg , Germany and Universidad Complutense de Madrid , Spain .
The project has been ongoing since 1996 .
Currently , the team consists of the following people : in Madrid : Ricardo Peña , Yolanda Ortega - Mallén , Mercedes Hidalgo , Fernando Rubio , Clara Segura , Alberto Verdejo in Marburg : Rita Loogen , Jost Berthold , Steffen Priebe , Mischa Dieterle Eden extends Haskell with a small set of syntactic constructs for explicit process specification and creation .
While providing enough control to implement parallel algorithms efficiently , it frees the programmer from the tedious task of managing low - level details by introducing automatic communication ( via head - strict lazy lists ) , synchronisation , and process handling .
Eden ’s main constructs are process abstractions and process instantiations .
The function process :: ( a -> b ) ->
Process a b embeds a function of type ( a -> b ) into a process abstraction of type Process a b which , when instantiated , will be executed in parallel .
Process instantiation is expressed by the predefined infix operator ( # ) :: Process a b -> a -> b .
Higher - level coordination is achieved by defining skeletons , ranging from a simple parallel map to sophisticated replicated - worker schemes .
They have been used to parallelise a set of non-trivial benchmark programs .

Implementation A major revision of the parallel Eden runtime environment for GHC 6.8.1 is available on request .
Support for Glasgow parallel Haskell ( GpH ) is currently being added to this version of the runtime environment .
It is planned for the future to maintain a common parallel runtime environment for Eden , GpH and other parallel Haskells .

3.3 Type System / Program Analysis
3.3.1 Free Theorems for Haskell Report by : Janis Voigtländer Participants : Sascha Böhme and Florian Stenger
Free theorems are statements about program behavior derived from ( polymorphic ) types .
Their origin is the polymorphic lambda - calculus , but they have also been applied to programs in more realistic languages like Haskell .
Since there is a semantic gap between the original calculus and modern functional languages , the underlying theory ( of relational parametricity ) needs to be refined and extended .
We aim to provide such new theoretical foundations , as well as to apply the theoretical results to practical problems .
For recent application papers , see “ Proving Correctness via Free Theorems : The Case of the destroy / build - Rule ” ( PEPM’08 ) and “ Much Ado about Two : A Pearl on Parallel Prefix Computation ” ( POPL’08 ) .
Also on the practical side , Sascha Böhme implemented a library and tool for generating free theorems from Haskell types .
Downloadable source and a web interface are accessible at http://linux.tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de/~voigt/ft.
Features include : three different language subsets to choose from
equational as well as inequational free theorems
relational free theorems as well as specializations down to function level
support for algebraic data types , type synonyms and renamings , type classes
While the web interface is restricted to algebraic data types , type synonyms , and type classes from Haskell standard libraries , a shell - based application contained in the source package also enables the user to declare their own algebraic data types and so on , and then to derive free theorems from types involving those .

3.3.2 Agda Report by : Nils Anders Danielsson Status : Actively developed by a number of people
Do you crave for highly expressive types , but do not want to resort to type - class hackery ?
Then Agda might provide a view of what the future has in store for you .
Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language ( developed using Haskell ) .
The language has inductive families , i.e. GADTs which can be indexed by values and not just types .
Other goodies include parameterised modules , mixfix operators , and an interactive Emacs interface ( the type checker can assist you in the development of your code ) .
A lot of work remains in order for Agda to become a full - fledged programming language ( effects , good libraries , mature compilers , documentation , &hellp ; ) , but already in its current state it can provide lots of fun as a platform for experiments in dependently typed programming .

Epigram is a prototype dependently typed functional programming language , equipped with an interactive editing and typechecking environment .
High - level Epigram source code elaborates into a dependent type theory based on Zhaohui Luo ’s UTT .
The definition of Epigram , together with its elaboration rules , may be found in ‘ The view from the left ’ by Conor McBride and James McKinna ( JFP 14 ( 1 ) ) .
A new version , Epigram 2 , based on Observational Type Theory ( see ‘ Observational Equality , Now ! ’ by Thorsten Altenkirch , Conor McBride , and Wouter Swierstra ) is in preparation .
Motivation Simply typed languages have the property that any subexpression of a well typed program may be replaced by another of the same type .
Such type systems may guarantee that your program wo n’t crash your computer , but the simple fact that True and False are always interchangeable inhibits the expression of stronger guarantees .
Epigram is an experiment in freedom from this compulsory ignorance .
Specifically , Epigram is designed to support programming with inductive datatype families indexed by data .
Examples include matrices indexed by their dimensions , expressions indexed by their types , search trees indexed by their bounds .
In many ways , these datatype families are the progenitors of Haskell ’s GADTs , but indexing by data provides both a conceptual simplification – the dimensions of a matrix are numbers – and a new way to allow data to stand as evidence for the properties of other data .
It is no good representing sorted lists if comparison does not produce evidence of ordering .
It is no good writing a type - safe interpreter if one ’s typechecking algorithm cannot produce well - typed terms .
Programming with evidence lies at the heart of Epigram ’s design .
Epigram generalises constructor pattern matching by allowing types resembling induction principles to express as how the inspection of data may affect both the flow of control at run time and the text and type of the program in the editor .
Epigram extracts patterns from induction principles and induction principles from inductive datatype families .
History James McKinna and Conor McBride designed Epigram in 2001 , whilst based at Durham , working with Zhaohui Luo and Paul Callaghan .
McBride ’s prototype implementation of the language , ‘ Epigram 1 ’ emerged in 2004 : it is implemented in Haskell , interfacing with the xemacs editor .
This implementation effort involved inventing a number of new programming techniques which have found their way into the Haskell community at large : central components of Control .
Applicative and Data .
Traversable started life in the source code for Epigram .
Following the Durham diaspora , James McKinna and Edwin Brady went to St. Andrews , where they continued their work on phase analysis and efficient compilation of dependently typed programs .
More recently , with Kevin Hammond , they have been studying applications of dependent types to resource - aware computation in general , and network protocols in particular .
Meanwhile , Conor McBride went to Nottingham to work with Thorsten Altenkirch .
They set about redesigning Epigram ’s underlying type theory , radically changing its treatment of logical propositions in general , and equality in particular , making significant progress on problems which have beset dependent type theories for decades .
The Nottingham duo grew into a strong team of enthusiastic researchers .
Peter Morris successfully completed a PhD on generic programming in Epigram and is now a research assistant : his work has led to the redesign of Epigram ’s datatype language .
Nicolas
Oury joined from Paris as a postdoctoral research fellow , and is now deeply involved in all aspects of design and implementation .
PhD students James Chapman and Wouter Swierstra are working on Epigram - related topics , studying formalized metatheory and effectful programming , respectively .
Meanwhile , Nottingham research on containers , involving Neil Ghani , Peter Hancock and Rawle Prince , together with the Epigram team , continues to inform design choices as the language evolves .
Epigram 1 was used successfully by Thorsten Altenkirch , Conor McBride , and Peter Hancock in an undergraduate course on Computer Aided Formal Reasoning http://www.e-pig.org/darcs/g5bcfr/.
It has also been used in a number of graduate - level courses .
James McKinna is now at Radboud University , Nijmegen ; Edwin Brady is still at St. Andrews ; Thorsten Altenkirch , Peter Morris , Nicolas Oury , James Chapman and Wouter Swierstra are still in Nottingham ; Conor McBride has left academia .
All are still contributing to the Epigram project .
Current Status Epigram 2 is based on a radical redesign of our underlying type theory .
The main novelties are a bidirectional approach to typechecking , separating syntactically the terms whose types are inferred from those for which types are pushed in — with stronger guarantees of prior type information , we can reduce clutter in terms and support greater overloading ;

and , ensuring that proofs never influence control - flow and can be erased at run-time ; a type - directed approach to propositional equality , comparing functions extensionally , records componentwise , data by construction , and proofs trivially — we shall soon support equality for codata by bisimulation and for quotients by whatever you want ;

Nicolas Oury , Peter Morris , and Conor McBride have implemented this theory , together with a system supporting interactive construction ( and destruction ) within it .
This the engine which will drive Epigram 2 : we plan to equip it with human - accessible controls and release it for the benefit of the curious , shortly .
With this in place , we shall reconstruct the Epigram source language and its elaboration mechanism : constructs in source become constructions in the core .
There is still a great deal of work to do .
We need to incorporate the work from Edwin Brady and James McKinna on type erasure and efficient compilation ; we need to bring out and exploit the container structure of data ; we need to support programming with effects ( including non-termination ) ; we need a declarative proof language , as well as a functional programming language .
The Epigram project relies on Haskell , its libraries , and tools such as alex ( →5.2.1 ) , happy ( →5.2.2 ) , bnfc , cabal ( →4.1.1 ) , and darcs ( →6.13 ) .
We have recently developed tools for assembling the modules corresponding to each component of the Epigram system from files corresponding to each feature of the Epigram language : this may prove useful to others , so we hope to clean them up and release them .
Meanwhile , as Haskell itself edges ever closer to dependent types , the Epigram project has ever more to contribute , in exploration of the design space , in the development of implementation technique , and in experimentation with the pragmatics of programming with such power and precision .
Epigram source code and related research papers can be found on the web at http://www.e-pig.org and its community of experimental users communicate via the mailing list < epigram at durham.ac.uk >.
The current , rapidly evolving state of Epigram 2 can be found at http://www.e-pig.org/epilogue/.
3.3.4 Chameleon project Report by : Martin Sulzmann Chameleon is a Haskell style language which integrates sophisticated reasoning capabilities into a programming language via its CHR programmable type system .
Thus , we can program novel type system applications in terms of CHRs which previously required special - purpose systems .
Chameleon including examples and documentation is available via http://taichi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/taichiwiki/ChameleonHomePage.
XHaskell is an extension of Haskell which combines parametric polymorphism , algebraic data types and type classes with XDuce style regular expression types , subtyping and regular expression pattern matching .
The latest version can be downloaded via http://taichi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/taichiwiki/XhaskellHomePage.
Latest developments
We have fully implemented the system which can be used in combination with the Glasgow Haskell Compiler .
We have taken care to provide meaningful type error messages in case the static checking of programs fails .
Our system also allows to defer some static checks until run-time .
We make use of GHC - as - a- library so that the XHaskell programmer can easily integrate her programs into existing applications and take advantage of the many libraries available in GHC .
We also provide a convenient interface to the HaXML parser .
3.3.6 HaskellJoin Report by : Martin Sulzmann Participants : Edmund S. L. Lam and Martin Sulzmann HaskellJoin extends Haskell with Join- calculus style concurrency primitives .
The novelty lies in the addition of guards and propagated join patterns .
These additional features prove to be highly useful .
See for details : http://taichi.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/taichiwiki/HaskellJoinRules.
Latest developments
We have implemented a prototype in STM Haskell .
Experimental results show that we can achieve significant speed - ups on multi-core architectures ( more cores = programs runs faster ) .
HaskellJoin subsumes in expressive power “ ADOM : Agent Domain of Monads ” which is no longer supported .
3.3.7 Uniqueness Typing Report by : Edsko de Vries Participants : Rinus Plasmeijer , David M Abrahamson Status : ongoing
An important feature of pure functional programming languages is referential transparency .
A consequence of referential transparency is that functions cannot be allowed to modify their arguments , unless it can be guaranteed that they have the sole reference to that argument .
This is the basis of uniqueness typing .
We have been developing a uniqueness type system based on that of the language Clean but with various improvements : no subtyping is required , and the type language does not include constraints ( types in Clean often involve implications between uniqueness attribute ) .
This makes the type system sufficiently similar to standard Hindley / Milner type systems that ( 1 ) standard inference algorithms can be applied , and ( 2 ) that modern extensions such as arbitrary rank types and generalized algebraic data types ( GADTs ) can easily be incorporated .
Although our type system is developed in the context of the language Clean , it is also relevant to Haskell because the core uniqueness type system we propose is very similar to the Haskell ’s core type system .
Moreover , we are currently working on defining syntactic conventions , which programmers can use to write type annotations , and compilers can use to report types , without mentioning uniqueness at all .

3.4.1 The Reduceron Report by : Matthew Naylor Participants : Colin Runciman , Neil Mitchell Status : Experimental
The Reduceron is a prototype of a special - purpose graph reduction machine , built using an FPGA , featuring : parallel , dual - port , quad - word , stack , heap and combinator memories
two - cycle n-ary application node unwinding ( where n < =8 )
octo-instantiation ( 8 words per cycle ) of supercombinator bodies
parallel instantiation of combinator spine to heap and stack The Reduceron is an extremely simple machine , containing just four instructions , and executes core Haskell almost directly .
The translator from Yhc. Core to Reduceron bytecode and the FPGA machine are both implemented in Haskell , the latter using Lava .
Other notable differences since the initial release of Reduceron are : Performs supercombinator ( not SK ) reduction , with data types encoded as functions , inspired by Jan Martin Jansen ’s SAPL interpreter
Uses entirely on - chip memories on a Xilinx Virtex - II FPGA
Has a garbage collector ( in hardware )
Includes a basic bytecode interpreter written in C , which is competitive with the nhc98 compiler on a small set of examples
Includes Lava support for multi-output primitives and Xilinx block RAMs
Includes three new Lava modules : CircLib.hs , a prelude of common circuits ; CascadedRam.hs , for constructing RAMs of various widths and sizes ; and RTL.hs , for writing register - transfer level descriptions .

4 Libraries
4.1 Packaging and Distribution
4.1.1 Cabal and HackageDB Report by : Duncan Coutts Background The Haskell Cabal is a Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries .
It is an API distributed with GHC ( →2.1 ) , nhc98 , and Hugs which allows a developer to easily build and distribute packages .
HackageDB ( Haskell Package Database ) is an online database of packages which can be interactively queried via the website and client - side software such as cabal - install .
From HackageDB , an end - user can download and install Cabal packages .
Recent progress
The last year has seen Hackage DB take off .
It has grown from a handful of packages to over 300 .
It has also seen the release of a major new version of the Cabal library – the 1.2.x series – which is bundled with recent GHC versions .
This release was a big step forward in terms of new features , fewer rough edges and improved internal design .
Growing pains
The rapid growth of the HackageDB collection has highlighted some problems .
There is now a lot of choice in packages but relatively little information to help users decide which package they want or whether it is likely to build on their platform .
Another problem is having to manually download and build packages and their dependencies .
Fortunately this problem has a solution in the form of the command line tool cabal - install which has become increasingly usable in the last few months .
The plan is for cabal - install to be the primary command line interface to Cabal and HackageDB , replacing runhaskell Setup.lhs and other cabal -* wrappers you may have heard of .
Everyone is encouraged to preview this bright new future by trying the latest development versions of the Cabal library and cabal - install tool .
Looking forward
There is a great deal to do .
The Cabal library needs a proper dependency framework .
There are many good ideas for technical and social solutions to the current problems with HackageDB .
Unfortunately , for something that is now a vital piece of community infrastructure , there are relatively few people working on the solutions .
We would like to encourage people to get involved , join the development mailing list , get the code and check the bug tracker for what needs to be done .
Even if you do not have time for hacking , you probably have a favourite Cabal bug or limitation .
Do not just assume it is well known .
Make sure it is properly described on the bug tracker and add yourself to the cc list so Cabal hackers can get some impression of priorities .
People Cabal has seen contributions from 39 people in the three and a half years since Isaac Jones started the project .
By simplistically counting patches we see that 90 % of the code is by the top 8 contributors who have 50 or more patches each .
5 % is by the next 5 most active contributors with 10 or more patches each .
Contributions from a further 26 people make up the remaining 5 % .

4.2 General libraries
4.2.1 HPDF Report by : alpheccar Status : Continuous development HPDF is an Haskell library allowing to generate PDF documents .
HPDF is supporting several features of the PDF standard like outlines , multi-pages , annotations , actions , image embedding , shapes , patterns , text .
In addition to the standard PDF features , HPDF is providing some typesetting features built on top of the PDF core .
With HPDF , it is possible to define complex styles for sentences and paragraphs .
HPDF is implementing an optimum - fit line breaking algorithm a bit like the TeX one and HPDF is using the standard Liang hyphenation algorithm .
HPDF is at version 1.3 .
It is progressing continuously .
HPDF is available on Hackage ( →4.1.1 ) .
There are several missing features : the only supported fonts are the standard PDF ones .
A next version should support TrueType and different character encodings .
For support of Asian languages , I ’ll ask for help in the Haskell community .
I also plan to define an API easing the definition of complex layouts ( slides , books ) .
Currently the layout has to be coded by hand but it is already possible to build complex things .
The documentation is a bit weak and will have to be improved .

4.2.2 The Neon Library Report by : Jurriaan Hage
As part of his master thesis work , Peter van Keeken implemented a library to data mine logged Helium ( →2.3 ) programs to investigate aspects of how students program Haskell , how they learn to program and how good Helium in generating understandable feedback and hints .
The software can be downloaded from http://www.cs.uu.nl/wiki/bin/view/Hage/Neon which also gives some examples of output generated by the system .
The downloads only contain a small samples of loggings , but it will allow programmers to play with it .
The Test .IOSpec library provides a pure specification of several functions in the IO monad .
This may be of interest to anyone who wants to debug , reason about , analyse , or test impure code .
The Test.IOSpec library is essentially a drop - in replacement for several other modules , most notably Data .
IORef and ( most of ) Control .
Concurrent .
Once you ’re satisfied that your functions are reasonably well - behaved with respect to the pure specification , you can drop the Test .
IOSpec import in favour of the “ real ” IO modules .
The current release is described by a recent Haskell Workshop paper .
The development version in the darcs repository , however , supports several exciting new features , including a modular way to combine specifications and a specification of STM .
I have used Test .IOSpec to test and debug several substantial programs , such as a distributed Sudoku solver .
If you use Test .
IOSpec for anything useful at all , I ’d love to hear from you .

GSLHaskell is a simple library for linear algebra and numerical computation , internally implemented using GSL , BLAS and LAPACK .
A new version with important changes has been recently released .
The internal code has been rewritten , based on an improved matrix representation .
The interface is now simpler and more generic .
It works on Linux , Windows and Mac OS X .
The library is available from HackageDB ( →4.1.1 ) with the new name “ hmatrix ” ( because only a small part of GSL is currently available , and matrix computations are based on LAPACK ) .
Most linear algebra functions mentioned in GNU - Octave ’s Quick Reference are already available both for real and complex matrices : eig , svd , chol , qr , hess , schur , inv , pinv , expm , norm , and det .
There are also functions for numeric integration and differentiation , nonlinear minimization , polynomial root finding , and more than 200 GSL special functions .
A brief manual is available at the URL below .
This library is used in the easyVision project ( →6.21 ) .

4.2.5 An Index Aware Linear Algebra Library Report by : Frederik Eaton Status : unstable ; actively maintained
The index aware linear algebra library is a Haskell interface to a set of common vector and matrix operations .
The interface exposes index types to the type system so that operand conformability can be statically guaranteed .
For instance , an attempt to add or multiply two incompatibly sized matrices is a static error .
The library should still be considered alpha quality .
A backend for sparse vector types is near completion , which allows low - overhead “ views ” of tensors as arbitrarily nested vectors .
For instance , a matrix , which we represent as a tuple - indexed vector , could also be seen as a ( rank 1 ) vector of ( rank 1 ) vectors .
These different views usually produce different behaviours under common vector operations , thus increasing the expressive power of the interface .

4.3 Parsing and Transforming
4.3.1 Graph Parser Combinators Report by : Steffen Mazanek Status : research prototype A graph language can be described by a graph grammar in a manner similar to a string grammar known from the theory of formal languages .
Unfortunately , graph parsing is known to be computationally expensive in general .
There are even context - free graph languages the parsing of which is NP - complete .
Therefore we have developed the Haskell library graph parser combinators , a new approach to graph parsing inspired by the well - known string parser combinators .
The basic idea is to define primitive graph parsers for elementary graph components and a set of combinators for the construction of more advanced graph parsers .
Using graph parser combinators efficient special - purpose graph parsers can be composed conveniently in a for Haskell programmers familiar manner .
The following features are already implemented : a module PolyStateSet that is an extension of PolyState of the polyparse library that can deal with sets of tokens
that is an extension of of the polyparse library that can deal with sets of tokens graph type declarations for several purposes
graph parser combinators for important graph patterns
parsers for several example graph languages
for comparison a general - purpose parser for hyperedge replacement graph grammars
The library will soon be provided via hackage ( →4.1.1 ) .
4.3.2 uniplate Report by : Neil Mitchell Uniplate is a boilerplate removal library , with similar goals to the original Scrap Your Boilerplate work .
It requires fewer language extensions , and allows more succinct traversals with higher performance than SYB .
A paper including many examples was presented at the Haskell Workshop 2007 ã crefhaskell - workshop .
If you are writing a compiler , or any program that operates over values with many constructors and nested types , you should be using a boilerplate removal library .
This library provides a gentle introduction to the field , and can be used practically to achieve substantial savings in code size and maintainability .

4.3.3 InterpreterLib Report by : Jennifer Streb Participants : Garrin Kimmell , Nicolas Frisby , Mark Snyder , Philip Weaver , Jennifer Streb , Perry Alexander Maintainer : Garrin Kimmell , Nicolas Frisby Status : beta , actively developed The InterpreterLib library is a collection of modules for constructing composable , monadic interpreters in Haskell .
The library provides a collection of functions and type classes that implement semantic algebras in the style of Hutton and Duponcheel .
Datatypes for related language constructs are defined as non-recursive functors and composed using a higher - order sum functor .
The full AST for a language is the least fixed point of the sum of its constructs ’ functors .
To denote a term in the language , a sum algebra combinator composes algebras for each construct functor into a semantic algebra suitable for the full language and the catamorphism introduces recursion .
Another piece of InterpreterLib is a novel suite of algebra combinators conducive to monadic encapsulation and semantic re-use .
The Algebra Compiler , an ancillary preprocessor derived from polytypic programming principles , generates functorial boilerplate Haskell code from minimal specifications of language constructs .
As a whole , the InterpreterLib library enables rapid prototyping and simplified maintenance of language processors .
InterpreterLib is available for download at the link provided below .
Version 1.0 of InterpreterLib was released in April 2007 .

4.3.4 hscolour Report by : Malcolm Wallace Status : stable , maintained HsColour is a small command - line tool ( and Haskell library ) that syntax - colorises Haskell source code for multiple output formats .
It consists of a token lexer , classification engine , and multiple separate pretty - printers for the different formats .
Current supported output formats are ANSI terminal codes , HTML ( with or without CSS ) , and LaTeX .
In all cases , the colours and highlight styles ( bold , underline , etc ) are configurable .
It can additionally place HTML anchors in front of declarations , to be used as the target of links you generate in Haddock documentation .
HsColour is widely used to make source code in blog entries look more pretty , to generate library documentation on the web , and to improve the readability of ghc ’s intermediate - code debugging output .

4.3.5 Utrecht Parsing Library and Attribute Grammar System Report by : Doaitse Swierstra and Jeroen Fokker Status : Released as cabal packages
The Utrecht attribute grammar system has been extended : the attribute flow analysis has been completely implemented by Joost Verhoog , and it is now possible to generate visit - function based evaluators , which are much faster and use less space .
We assume that such functions are strict in all their arguments , and generate the appropriate `seq` calls to make the GHC aware of this .
As a result also case ’s are generated instead on let ’s wherever possible .
Several improvements were made : better error reporting of cyclic dependencies , and a large speed improvements in the overall flow analysis have been made .
The first versions of the EHC now compile without circularities , nor direct nor induced by fixing the attribute evaluation orders
calls to make the GHC aware of this .
As a result also ’s are generated instead on ’s wherever possible .
we are adding better support for higher order attribute grammars and forwarding rules
Tthe error correcting strategies of the parser combinators are now being used as a base for providing automatic feedback in systems for training strategies ( Johan Jeuring , Arthur van Leeuwen )
a start has been made with providing Haddock information with the code of the parser combinators
we plan to enhance the parser combinators with a second basic parsing engine , in order to support monadic uses of the combinators while keeping the error correcting capabilities
The software is again available through the Haskell Utrecht Tools page .

The goal of the X - Saiga project is to create algorithms and implementations which enable language processors ( recognizers , parsers , interpreters , translators , etc. ) to be constructed as modular and efficient embedded eXecutable SpecificAtIons of GrAmmars .
To achieve modularity , we have chosen to base our algorithms on top - down parsing .
To accommodate ambiguity , we implement inclusive choice through backtracking search .
To achieve polynomial complexity , we use memoization .
We have developed an algorithm which accommodates direct left - recursion using curtailment of search .
Indirect left recursion is also accommodated using curtailment together with a test to determine whether previously computed and memoized results may be reused depending on the context in which they were created and the context in which they are being considered for reuse .
The algorithm is described more fully in Frost , R. , Hafiz , R. and Callaghan , P. ( 2007 ) Modular and Efficient Top - Down Parsing for Ambiguous Left - Recursive Grammars .

4.4 System
4.4.1 hspread Report by : Andrea Vezzosi Participants : Andrea Vezzosi , Jeff Muller Status : active hspread is a client library for the Spread toolkit .
It is fully implemented in Haskell using the binary package ( →4.7.1 ) for fast parsing of network packets .
Its aim is to make easier to implement correct distributed applications by taking advantage of the guarantees granted by Spread , such as reliable and total ordered messages , and supports the most recent version of the protocol .
There is interest in further developing an higher level framework for Haskell distributed programming by extending the protocol if necessary .

Harpy is a library for run -time code generation of IA - 32 machine code .
It provides not only a low level interface to code generation operations , but also a convenient domain specific language for machine code fragments , a collection of code generation combinators and a disassembler .
We use it in two independent ( unpublished ) projects :
On the one hand , we are implementing a just - in - time compiler for functional programs , on the other hand , we use it to implement an efficient type checker for a dependently typed language .
It might be useful in other domains , where specialized code generated at run-time can improve performance .
Harpy ’s implementation makes use of the foreign function interface , but only contains functions written in Haskell .
Moreover , it has some uses of other interesting Haskell extensions as for example multi-parameter type classes to provide an in - line assembly language , and Template Haskell to generate stub functions to call run-time generated code .
The disassembler uses Parsec to parse the instruction stream .
We intend to implement supporting operations for garbage collectors cooperating with run-time generated code .
A second release is forthcoming , featuring improvements in the memory management , better floating point instruction support , and named labels that are shown in the disassembler output .

4.4.3 hs - plugins Report by : Don Stewart Status : maintained hs - plugins is a library for dynamic loading and runtime compilation of Haskell modules , for Haskell and foreign language applications .
It can be used to implement application plugins , hot swapping of modules in running applications , runtime evaluation of Haskell , and enables the use of Haskell as an application extension language .
hs - plugins has been ported to GHC 6.6 .

4.4.4 The libpcap Binding Report by : Dominic Steinitz Participants : Greg Wright , Dominic Steinitz , Nicholas Burlett Nicholas Burlett has now created a cabalized version and made it available on hackage .
However , beware that this does n’t use autoconf to check your system supports sa_len and it does n’t check which version of libpcap is installed .
It will probably work but may not .
If it does n’t then try this : darcs get
http://www.haskell.org/networktools/src/pcap
Install libpcap .
I used 0.9.4 .
autoheader
autoconf
./ configure
hsc2hs Pcap.hsc
ghc -o test test.hs -- make - lpcap - fglasgow - exts
All contributions are welcome especially if you know how to get cabal to run autoconf and check for versions of non-Haskell libraries .
4.5 Databases and data storage
Takusen is a library for accessing DBMS’s .
Like HSQL , we support arbitrary SQL statements ( currently strings , extensible to anything that can be converted to a string ) .
Takusen ’s ‘ unique - selling - point ’ is safety and efficiency .
We statically ensure all acquired database resources such as cursors , connection and statement handles are released , exactly once , at predictable times .
Takusen can avoid loading the whole result set in memory and so can handle queries returning millions of rows , in constant space .
Takusen also supports automatic marshalling and unmarshalling of results and query parameters .
These benefits come from the design of query result processing around a left - fold enumerator .
Currently we fully support Oracle , Sqlite , and PostgreSQL , and ODBC support exists but is not fully tested .
Since the last report we have : added an ODBC backend
improved the installation process so that we can build Haddock docs with Cabal A new release to promote the ODBC code should be forthcoming ; until then interested souls can get the latest from the darcs repo .
Future plans complete ODBC interface .
Large object support .
MS SQL Server and Sybase interfaces , via FreeTDS .

4.6 Data types and data structures
4.6.1 Data .
Record Report by : Claus Reinke Status : library sketch Extensible records , or the lack thereof , continue to be a popular subject of discussion .
There is no lack of proposals , some implemented , some not , but there seems to be no obvious winner that would justify substantial implementation efforts , not to mention upsetting Haskell ’s already featureful type system .
Ever since seeing the Trex in Hugs development in Nottingham , I had been wondering about whether there were smaller aspects of extensible record systems that might be added as general features to the current type system , so that a record system could be defined on top of the extended system .
The latter turned out to be almost possible with the then prevailing Hugs type system , but for commutative row constructors ( label ordering should not matter ) and negated type predicates ( record ‘ has ’ label vs. record ‘ lacks ’ label ) .
Since then , extensions to the HList library ( →4.6.7 ) have demonstrated that one can abuse GHC ’s type system implementation to get just enough expressiveness for defining a record system ( an impressive feat ) , provided one is prepared to define a global ordering on record field labels .
Separately , Daan Leijen ’s scoped labels proposal suggested that accepting the absence of negative predicates leads to a different , but not necessarily worse record system .
With all these ideas in the air , I found myself needing an extensible record system for a modular attribute grammar problem and was surprised to find an implementation of such a system within the limitations of GHC ’s type system – Data .
Record was born !
It was based on scoped labels , but went further in providing record concatenation as well .
I first posted the module Data .
Record as an attachment to a Haskell ’ ticket on type sharing , and to the Haskell ’ list as an example of how code using only language extensions nominally supported in both GHC and Hugs would nevertheless only work in GHC , not in Hugs .
One of the recent revivals of the extensible records discussion made me dust off that old code and add some of the features requested for alternative systems .
In particular , there is now support for unscoped operations ( negative predicates , no duplicate labels ) and for record label permutation .
The former means that this code could grow into a library supporting all the major extensible record system styles , the latter means that record code can be label - order independent without needing a global ordering on labels ( a prerequisite in most other type - class - based extensible record systems ) .
The code is not currently in a release state , being an insufficiently systematic collection of features from several systems , but usable , with examples , and if there was sufficient interest , I could try getting it more organised .
Please let me know if you like what is there sufficiently to warrant such an effort .

Data .
ByteString provides packed strings ( byte arrays held by a Foreign Ptr ) , along with a list interface to these strings .
It lets you do extremely fast IO in Haskell ; in some cases , even faster than typical C implementations , and much faster than [ Char ] .
It uses a flexible “ foreign pointer ” representation , allowing the transparent use of Haskell or C code to manipulate the strings .
Data .
ByteString is written in Haskell98 plus the foreign function interface and cpp .
It has been tested successfully with GHC 6.4 , 6.6 , 6.8 , Hugs 2005 –2006 , and the head version of nhc98 .
Work on Data .
ByteString continues .
In particular , a new fusion mechanism , stream fusion , has been developed , which should further improve performance of ByteStrings .
This work is described in the recent “ Stream Fusion : From Lists to Streams to Nothing at All ” paper .
Data .
ByteString has recently been ported to nhc98 .

4.6.4 Edison Report by : Rob Dockins Status : stable , maintained Edison is a library of purely function data structures for Haskell originally written by Chris Okasaki .
Conceptually , it consists of two things :
A set of type classes defining data the following data structure abstractions : “ sequences ” , “ collections ” and “ associative collections ” Multiple concrete implementations of each of the abstractions .
In theory , either component may be used independently of the other .
I took over maintenance of Edison about 18 months ago in order to update Edison to use the most current Haskell tools .
The following major changes have been made since version 1.1 , which was released in 1999 .
Typeclasses updated to use fundeps ( by Andrew Bromage )
Implementation of ternary search tries ( by Andrew Bromage )
Modules renamed to use the hierarchical module extension
Documentation haddockized
Source moved to a darcs repository
Build system cabalized
Unit tests integrated into a single driver program which exercises all the concrete implementations shipped with Edison
Multiple additions to the APIs ( mostly the associated collection API ) Edison is currently in maintain - only mode .
I do n’t have the time required to enhance Edison in the ways I would like .
If you are interested in working on Edison , do n’t hesitate to contact me .
The biggest thing that Edison needs is a benchmarking suite .
Although Edison currently has an extensive unit test suite for testing correctness , and many of the data structures have proven time bounds , I have no way to evaluate or compare the quantitative performance of data structure implementations in a principled way .
Unfortunately , benchmarking data structures in a non -strict language is difficult to do well .
If you have an interest or experience in this area , your help would be very much appreciated .

Dimensional is a library providing data types for performing arithmetic with physical quantities and units .
Information about the physical dimensions of the quantities / units is embedded in their types and the validity of operations is verified by the type checker at compile time .
The boxing and unboxing of numerical values as quantities is done by multiplication and division with units .
The library is designed to , as far as is practical , enforce / encourage best practices of unit usage .
Following a reorganization of the module hierarchy the core of dimensional is now mostly stable while additional units are being added on an as - needed basis .
In addition to the si system of units dimensional has experimental support for user - defined dimensions and a proof - of - concept implementation of the cgs system of units .
The most recent release is compatible with ghc 6.6.x and above and can be downloaded from hackage or the project web site .
The primary documentation is the literate haskell source code but the wiki on the project web site has a few usage examples to help with getting started .

4.6.6 Numeric prelude Report by : Henning Thielemann Participants : Dylan Thurston , Henning Thielemann , Mikael Johansson Status : experimental , active development
The hierarchy of numerical type classes is revised and oriented at algebraic structures .
Axiomatics for fundamental operations are given as QuickCheck properties , superfluous super - classes like Show are removed , semantic and representation - specific operations are separated , the hierarchy of type classes is more fine grained , and identifiers are adapted to mathematical terms .
There are both certain new type classes representing algebraic structures and new types of mathematical objects .
Currently supported algebraic structures are group ( additive ) ,
ring ,
principal ideal domain ,
field ,
algebraic closures ,
transcendental closures ,
module and vector space ,
normed space ,
lattice ,
differential algebra ,
monoid .
There is also a collection of mathematical object types , which is useful both for applications and testing the class hierarchy .
The types are lazy Peano number
complex number , quaternion ,
residue class ,
fraction ,
partial fraction ,
numbers equipped with physical units ( dynamic checks only ) ,
fixed point arithmetic with respect to arbitrary bases and numbers of fraction digits ,
infinite precision number in an arbitrary positional system as lazy lists of digits supporting also numbers with terminating representations ,
polynomial , power series , Laurent series
series root set of a polynomial ,
matrix ( basics only ) ,
algebra , e.g. multi-variate polynomial ( basics only ) ,
permutation group .
Due to Haskell ’s flexible type system , you can combine all these types , e.g. fractions of polynomials , residue classes of polynomials , complex numbers with physical units , power series with real numbers as coefficients .
Due to Haskell ’s flexible type system , you can combine all these types , e.g. fractions of polynomials , residue classes of polynomials , complex numbers with physical units , power series with real numbers as coefficients .
Using the revised system requires hiding some of the standard functions provided by Prelude , which is fortunately supported by GHC ( →2.1 ) .
The library has basic Cabal support and a growing test - suite of QuickCheck tests for the implemented mathematical objects .
Future plans Collect more Haskell code related to mathematics , e.g. for linear algebra .
Study of alternative numeric type class proposals and common computer algebra systems .
Ideally each data type resides in a separate module .
However this leads to mutual recursive dependencies , which cannot be resolved if type classes are mutually recursive .
We start to resolve this by fixing the types of some parameters of type class methods .
E.g. power exponents become simply Integer instead of Integral , which has also the advantage of reduced type defaulting .
A still unsolved problem arises for residue classes , matrix computations , infinite precision numbers , fixed point numbers and others .
It should be possible to assert statically that the arguments of a function are residue classes with respect to the same divisor , or that they are vectors of the same size .
Possible ways out are encoding values in types or local type class instances .
The latter one is still neither proposed nor implemented in any Haskell compiler .
The modules are implemented in a way to keep all options open .
That is , for each number type there is one module implementing the necessary operations which expect the context as a parameter .
Then there are several modules which provide different interfaces through type class instances to these operations .

HList is a comprehensive , general purpose Haskell library for typed heterogeneous collections including extensible polymorphic records and variants .
HList is analogous of the standard list library , providing a host of various construction , look - up , filtering , and iteration primitives .
In contrast to the regular lists , elements of heterogeneous lists do not have to have the same type .
HList lets the user formulate statically checkable constraints : for example , no two elements of a collection may have the same type ( so the elements can be unambiguously indexed by their type ) .
An immediate application of HLists is the implementation of open , extensible records with first - class , reusable , and compiled - time only labels .
The dual application is extensible polymorphic variants ( open unions ) .
HList contains several implementations of open records , including records as sequences of field values , where the type of each field is annotated with its phantom label .
We and now others ( Alexandra Silva , Joost Visser : PURe . CoddFish project ) have also used HList for type - safe database access in Haskell .
HList - based Records form the basis of OOHaskell http://darcs.haskell.org/OOHaskell.
The HList library relies on common extensions of Haskell 98 .
The HList repository is available via Darcs ( →6.13 ) : http://darcs.haskell.org/HList
The library is being optimized and extended .
Since the last report , we have added ConsUnion.hs to build homogeneous lists of heterogeneous components by constructing the union on - the - fly .
We added Template Haskell code to eliminate the annoying boilerplate when defining record ‘ labels ’ .
We optimized record projection , which should be especially noticeable for record narrowing .
We added equivR , record equivalence modulo field order , with witnessing conversions .
ConsUnion.hs checks for record types and treat the latter equivalent modulo the order of fields .
This gives optimized , shallower unions .

4.7 Data processing
4.7.1 binary Report by : Lennart Kolmodin Participants : Duncan Coutts , Don Stewart , Binary Strike Team Status : active The Binary Strike Team is pleased to announce the release of a new , pure , efficient binary serialisation library .
The ‘ binary ’ package provides efficient serialisation of Haskell values to and from lazy ByteStrings .
ByteStrings constructed this way may then be written to disk , written to the network , or further processed ( e.g. stored in memory directly , or compressed in memory with zlib or bzlib ) .
The binary library has been heavily tuned for performance , particularly for writing speed .
Throughput of up to 160M / s has been achieved in practice , and in general speed is on par or better than NewBinary , with the advantage of a pure interface .
Efforts are underway to improve performance still further .
Plans are also taking shape for a parser combinator library on top of binary , for bit parsing and foreign structure parsing ( e.g. network protocols ) .
Data .
Derive ( →5.3.1 ) has support for automatically generating Binary instances , allowing to read and write your data structures with little fuzz .
Binary was developed by a team of 8 during the Haskell Hackathon , and since then has in total 15 people contributed code and many more given feedback and cheerleading on #haskell .
The underlying code is currently being rewritten to give even better performance – both reading and writing – still exposing the same API .
The package is is available through Hackage ( →4.1.1 ) .

4.7.2 binarydefer Report by : Neil Mitchell
The Binary Defer library provides a framework for doing binary serialisation , with support for deferred loading .
Deferred loading is for when a large data structure exists , but typically only a small fraction of this data structure will be required .
By using deferred loading , some of the data structure can be read quickly , and the rest can be read on demand , in a pure manner .
This library is at the heart of Hoogle 4 ( →5.5.6 ) , but has already found uses outside that application , including to do offline sorts etc .
Further reading Homepage : http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/binarydefer
The current version is still 4.0.3 .
This means no dependency on NewBinary which had been requested by several people .
The interface to SHA - 1 is still different from MD5 and the whole library needs a rethink .
Unfortunately , I do n’t have the time to undertake much work on it at the moment and it is not clear when I will have more time .
I ’m therefore looking for someone to help keeping the repository up - to - date with contributions , re-structuring the library and managing releases .
I have restructured SHA - 1 to be more Haskell - like and it ’s now obvious how it mirrors the specification .
However , this has led to rather poor performance and it ’s not obvious ( to me at least ) what can be done without sacrificing clarity .
Several people have posted more efficient versions of SHA - 1 but not as patches .
Given my limited time , I have n’t been able to do anything with these .
This release contains : DES
Blowfish
AES
Cipher Block Chaining ( CBC )
PKCS#5 and nulls padding
SHA-1
MD5
RSA
OAEP - based encryption ( Bellare - Rogaway ) Further reading http://www.haskell.org/crypto
http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/crypto.
The current release is 0.0.11 which contains functions to handle ASN.1 , X.509 , PKCS #8 and PKCS # 1.5 .
This still has a dependency on NewBinary .
The current version handles the Basic Encoding Rules ( BER ) .
In addition , a significant amount of work has been undertaken on handling the Packed Encoding Rules ( PER ) using a GADT to represent the Abstract Syntax Tree ( we ’ll probably move the BER to use the same AST at some point ) .
You can download the current working version and try the unit and QuickCheck property tests for PER .
These are not yet built by Cabal .
This release supports : X.509 identity certificates
X.509 attribute certificates
PKCS # 8 private keys
PKCS #1 version 1.5 Further reading http://haskell.org/asn1.
A two - level data transformation consists of a type - level transformation of a data format coupled with value - level transformations of data instances corresponding to that format .
Examples of two - level data transformations include XML schema evolution coupled with document migration , and data mappings used for interoperability and persistence .
In the 2LT project , support for two - level transformations is being developed using Haskell , relying in particular on generalized abstract data types ( GADTs ) .
Currently , the 2LT package offers : A library of two - level transformation combinators .
These combinators are used to compose trans formation systems which , when applied to an input type , produce an output type , together with the conversion functions that mediate between input and out types .
Front-ends for VDM -SL , XML and SQL .
These front - ends support ( i ) reading a schema , ( ii ) applying a two - level transformation system to produce a new schema , ( iii ) convert a document / database corresponding to the input schema to a document / database corresponding to the output schema , and vice versa .
.
A combinator library for transformation of point - free and structure - shy functions .
These combinators are used to compose transformation systems for optimization of conversion functions , and for migration of queries through two - level transformations .
Independent of two - level transformation , the combinators can be used to specializes structure - shy programs ( such as XPath queries and strategic functions ) to structure - sensitive point - free from , and vice versa .
. Support for schema constraints using point - free expressions .
Constraints present in the initial schema are preserved during the transformation process and new contraints are added in specific transformations to ensure semantic preservation .
Constraints can be simplified using the already existent library for transformation of point - free functions .
The various sets of transformation combinators are reminiscent of the combinators of Strafunski and the Scrap - your - Boilerplate approach to generic functional programming .
The various sets of transformation combinators are reminiscent of the combinators of Strafunski and the Scrap - your - Boilerplate approach to generic functional programming .
An release of 2LT is available from the project URL .
Recently , the 2LT project has been migrated to Google Code .
New functionality is planned , such as elaboration of the front - ends and the creation of a web interface .

4.8 User interfaces
4.8.1 Shellac Report by : Rob Dockins Status : beta , maintained Shellac is a framework for building read - eval - print style shells .
Shells are created by declaratively defining a set of shell commands and an evaluation function .
Shellac supports multiple shell backends , including a ‘ basic ’ backend which uses only Haskell IO primitives and a full featured ‘ readline ’ backend based on the the Haskell readline bindings found in the standard libraries .
This library attempts to allow users to write shells in a declarative way and still enjoy the advanced features that may be available from a powerful line editing package like readline .
Shellac is available from Hackage , as is the related Shellac - readline package .
Shellac has been successfully used by several independent projects and the API is now fairly stable .
I will likely be releasing an officially “ stable ” version in the not - too - distant future .
I anticipate few changes from the current version .

Grapefruit is a library for creating graphical user interfaces and animated graphics in a declarative way .
Fundamental to Grapefruit is the notion of signal .
A signal denotes either a time - varying value ( the continuous case ) or a sequence of values assigned to discrete points in time ( the discrete case ) .
Signals can be constructed in a purely functional manner .
User interfaces are described as systems of interconnected components which communicate via signals .
To build such systems , the methods from the Arrow and ArrowLoop classes are used .
For describing animated graphics , a special signal type exists .
Grapefruit also provides list signals .
A list signal is a list - valued signal which can be updated incrementally and thus efficiently .
In addition , a list signal associates an identity with each element so that moving an element within the list can be distinguished from removing the element and adding it again .
List signals can be used to describe dynamic user interfaces , i.e. , user interfaces with a changing set of components and changing order of components .
Grapefruit descriptions of user interfaces and animations always cover their complete lifetime .
No explicit event handler registrations and no explicit recalculations of values are necessary .
This is in line with the declarative nature of Haskell because it stresses the behavior of GUIs and animations instead of how this behavior is achieved .
Internally though , Grapefruit is implemented efficiently using a common event dispatching and handling mechanism .
Grapefruit is currently based on Gtk2Hs ( →4.8.3 ) and HOpenGL but implementations on top of other GUI and graphics libraries are possible .
The aim is to provide alternative implementations based on different GUI toolkits so that a single application is able to integrate itself into multiple desktop environments .

Gtk2Hs is a GUI Library for Haskell based on Gtk+. Gtk+ is an extensive and mature multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces .
GUIs written using Gtk2 Hs use themes to resemble the native look on Windows and , of course , various desktops on Linux , Solaris and FreeBSD .
Gtk+ and Gtk2Hs also support Mac OS X ( it currently uses the X11 server but a native port is in progress – see below ) .

The MOST detailed mapping of Palestine ever via Google 's Maps and Earth programs
Posted on November 6 , 2006
All cities & villages that were destroyed and ethnically cleansed by the Israelis .
All cities & villages in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
All refugee camps including the camps in Jordan , Lebanon , and Syria .
All existing Palestinian towns ( including the unrecognized villages ) within Palestine - 1948 ( or the so called " green line " ) .
All exclusive Jewish colonies ( Israeli towns ) including the colonies in the West Bank .
All major highways , railways , roads and junctions .
Several well known concentrations camps .
Most , if nor all , of the Israeli military installation inclusive of the Israeli nuclear sites .
Click here to download Google Earth 's file .
We have compiled the most complete mapping of Palestine ever ( overplacemarks have been identified ) .
Our presentation includes the following :
As you view our presentation , PLEASE NOTE that your journey will be more enjoyable when you click on each identified placemark , a window will pop -up containing all sorts of information about the town including a picture if one is available , number of refugees , lands sizes , occupation date , ...etc .
At PalestineRemembered.com 's lab , we have built a unique software ( currently in beta release ) that allows you to add placemarks ( via Google maps ) .
Daily , the software compiles all newly added placemarks to the the over all listing , so we appreciate you participation and feedback .
Sources
The mass majority for the destroyed villages ' coordinates were provided By Dr. Salman Abu Sitta based on coordinates collected by the British Mandate in 1923 , click here if you would like to purchase The Return Journey which has been used extensively as the source .
Israeli towns ( including West Bank 's exclusive Jewish colonies ) were all identified from information in the public domain , mostly from CIA maps , World Gazetteer & The Return Journey , .
All military installation were identified from the public domain , mostly from CIA maps , Global Security , plus al - Safir newspaper finding .
As of now , we are double checking these coordinates ( including the destroyed villages ) for accuracy using Atlas of Palestine 's aerial view of Palestine before Nakba , published CIA maps , and other sources .
We have made our best effort to verify and double check these coordinates from multiple sources , so by no means we claim 100 % accuracy .
In that respect , we appreciate pointing any discrepancies .
I do n’t know how many of you were as appalled as I was at the way that the presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich was totally erased from the last Democratic debate held in Iowa .
This was a decision that was made , I can tell , jointly by the one - time voice of AIPAC , Mr. Wolf Blitzer , and , at the same time , The Des Moines Register — or whatever it is called — a paper of no consequence for the United States of America .
Elements of right - wingism are keeping his voice from being heard , even though there are many millions of us ( Kucinich is ahead of both Biden and Dodd in the national polls ) out here who like to hear his voice .
He is in the great tradition of the original People ’s Party of the 1880s ; he is in the tradition of George Washington and of Thomas Jefferson , and to silence him with a bunch of political hacks who have made such a mess of our political system , pretending these were the only voices who could talk as presidential candidates … is it because of their campaign budgets ?
Now , I know , as all of you know , that people can come in with millions of dollars , like Romney and so on , and can buy time in Iowa and in the North Pole or wherever it is they are running .
They can buy it , but to get an honest member of Congress speaking out for the people of the country is a great and rare thing .
I have listened to many political debates in my lifetime , if I may pull rank because I have been around longer than anybody else , and here is a voice not only against the war but the entire course leading us to it .
I have n’t heard anybody who has ever listened to Kucinich who did n’t say , “ Oh yes , yes , what he says is true , but nobody will ever take him seriously . ”
Well , of course nobody will ever take him seriously , because they wo n’t let him on TV to stand side by side with the other candidates — some of them attractive candidates but whose roots are not as deep as his in what we may call “ American life . ”
Dennis Kucinich was brought up in poverty , something the other candidates talk about but he actually lived through .
He has known poverty in the richest country on Earth , a country that is constantly boasting , that seems to be out of control with self - love .
Well , I say let ’s have less self - love and pay some attention to our serious critics — and he is one — and his is a voice that ’s showing us how to get to the exit from the box that we are all in .
It is so typical for CNN , a lousy network , and whatever that awful newspaper is called .
Do we want to listen to them at the close of a primary campaign in a key state ?
They have nothing to say of any interest , and so they eliminate any voice that might say something intelligent .
I have never felt more ashamed being an American than when I saw how this debate was handled .
Seit dem Urteil des Landgerichtes Hamburg vom 12 .
Mai 1998 kommt es mehr und mehr in Mode , einen sogenannten Disclaimer auf seine Seite zu setzen .
Dieser Artikel erläutert , weshalb Disclaimer dem World Wide Web schaden und wie Sie mit Hyperlinks umgehen sollten .
Ein Hinweis an dieser Stelle : Auch wenn die Hauptaussagen noch immer ihre Gültigkeit haben , ist der Artikel mittlerweile veraltet , zudem führen einige Links ins Leere .
Hintergrund
Seit dem Urteil des Landgerichtes Hamburg vom 12 .
Mai 1998 kommt es mehr und mehr in Mode , einen sogenannten Disclaimer auf seine Seite zu setzen .
Mittlerweile gibt es Angebote im Netz , wie zum Beispiel www.disclaimer.de, die standardmäßige Disclaimer zur Verfügung stellen , auf die man dann bloß einen Link zu setzen braucht .
Doch was soll so ein Disclaimer eigentlich ?
Disclaimer enthalten Textbausteine folgender Art :
» Mit dem Urteil vom 12 .
Mai 1998 hat das Landgericht Hamburg entschieden , dass man durch die Ausbringung eines Links die Inhalte der gelinkten Seite gegebenenfalls mit zu verantworten hat .
Dies kann nur dadurch verhindert werden , dass man sich ausdrücklich von diesen Inhalten distanziert . «
Oder :
Ich distanziere mich ausdrücklich von dem I nhalt der verlinkten Seiten« .
Dadurch soll die Haftung für die Inhalte der verlinkten Seiten explizit ausgeschlossen werden .
Urteil des Landgerichts Hamburg , Az. 312 O 85/98
In dem vielzitierten Urteil des Landgerichtes Hamburg hat der Beklagte zu einer Seite verlinkt , auf der sich Inhalte befanden , die laut Urteil das Ehr - und Persönlichkeitsrecht des Klägers verletzten .
Dieser Link wurde mit voller Absicht gesetzt , da sich der Beklagte zuvor aufgrund einer vorausgegangenen Rechtsstreitigkeit über den Kläger geärgert hatte .
Um sich nicht selber strafbar zu machen , hat der Beklagte durch Aufnahme einer Haftungsfreiheitsklausel klarstellen wollen , dass er keinerlei Verantwortung übernehme .
Das Gericht stellte fest , dass sich der Beklagte dadurch , dass er mit voller Absicht » eine Zusammenschau ehrverletzender Artikel über den Kläger erstellt « und sich ( auch durch die Haftungsfreiheitsklausel ) nicht ausreichend davon distanziert hat , die » ehrverletzenden sowie beleidigenden Tatsachenbehauptungen als auch Meinungsäußerungen zu seinen eigenen gemacht « habe .
Somit wurde der Beklagte zu Schadensersatzzahlungen verurteilt .
Die rechtliche Relevanz eines Disclaimers
Wer sich das Urteil genau durchliest , wird feststellen , dass dort nicht davon die Rede ist , dass man sich generell von allen Links , die man auf seiner Homepage setzt , ausdrücklich distanzieren muss .
Wichtig ist der Kontext , in dem ein Link gesetzt wird .
Offensichtlich hat der Beklagte absichtlich eine Liste von Links auf persönlichkeitsrechtverletzende Inhalte zusammengetragen .
Also ein ganz anderer Kontext als bei gewöhnlichen Linksammlungen auf einer Webseite , die man anlegt , um die verlinkten Seiten weiterzuempfehlen .
Die Haftungsausschlussklausel wird in dem Urteil ebenfalls nicht berücksichtigt .
Zudem ist das Urteil niemals rechtskräftig geworden , da die Parteien sich in einem Vergleich geeinigt haben .
Im Urteil des Schleswig-Holsteinischen Oberlandesgericht , Az. 6 U 51/00 steht zu lesen :
» Voraussetzung für die Zurechnung des Inhaltes fremder Internetseiten ist , dass eine Verantwortlichkeit des Verweisenden nach § 5 des Gesetzes über die Nutzung von Telediensten ( TDG ) besteht .
Das Gesetz regelt gesondert die Verantwortlichkeit eines Anbieters für Informationsinhalte , die über Informations - und Kommunikationsdienste zur Verfügung gestellt werden .
Nach § 5 Abs. 3 TDG ist eine Verantwortlichkeit für fremde Inhalte ausgeschlossen , wenn der Anbieter lediglich den Zugang zu deren Nutzung vermittelt [… ] .
Eine Verantwortlichkeit für fremde Inhalte ist dagegen gegeben , wenn zusätzliche Umstände vorliegen , die verdeutlichen , dass sich der Anbieter die Inhalte der anderen Seiten geistig zu eigen machen will [ … ] . «
Es ist fairerweise zu sagen , dass in diesem Urteil das Vorhandensein eines Disclaimers positiv bewertet worden ist .
Inwiefern diese Tatsache allerdings für das Urteil von Relevanz gewesen ist , mag jeder selber beurteilen .
Was also bringt ein Disclaimer ?
Diese Frage ist recht umstritten und wird in der entsprechenden Newsgroup de.soc.recht.datennetze auch oft diskutiert .
Es gibt noch keine eindeutige Rechtsprechung und auch keine eindeutige juristische Bedeutung von Links .
Es gibt aber eine Vielzahl an Gründen , die gegen einen Disclaimer sprechen :
Unrechtbewusstsein
Wenn ich einen Disclaimer auf meine Seiten setze , durch den ich mich von den Inhalten verlinkter Seiten distanziere , könnte es zu meinem Nachteil ausgelegt werden .
Schließlich könnte ich den Disclaimer deshalb auf meine Website gesetzt haben , weil ich mir über die Tatsache , auf illegale Seiten verlinkt zu haben , voll bewusst bin , und mich durch Haftungsausschluss versuche , vor einer Schuldfähigkeit zu schützen .
Inkonsequenz und Unlogik Wenn ich einen
Link auf eine Webseite setze , dann tue ich das , weil ich die Seite gut finde und den Besuchern meiner Website empfehlen möchte .
Weshalb distanziere ich mich dann gleichzeitig von ihr ?
Widerspricht sich das nicht ?
Diffamierung des Autors der verlinkten Seiten Stellen Sie sich vor , Sie sehen auf einer Webseite einen Link zu Ihrer Homepage , und dieser Link ist mit den üblichen Floskeln beschriftet .
Was würden Sie denken , wenn sich jemand von den Inhalten Ihrer Webseite und somit auch von Ihnen öffentlich distanziert ?
Man muss glauben , dass es anscheindend notwendig ist , sich von Ihren Seiten zu distanzieren .
Man kann sich hier fragen , wann Haftungsausschluss mit Diffamierung gleichzusetzen ist .
Zerstörung des World Wide Web Das Gerede über die Haftung für Links zerstört den Geist des World Wide Web .
Der Hauptbestandteil und Grundgedanke des Mediums World Wide
Web ist seine schnelle Begehbarkeit durch Hyperlinks , die es ermöglicht , Websites und somit Inhalte und Informationen miteinander zu verknüpfen .
Wenn die Menschen Angst davor haben , Links auf ihre Seiten zu setzen , geht diese wesentliche Eigenschaft des WWW verloren .
In seinem Buch » Der Web - Report « beschreibt Tim Berners - Lee , der Erfinder des World Wide Web , seine Vision , die ihn bereits im Jahre 1990 antrieb : » Einzig und allein externe Verknüpfungen können das Web zu einem weltweiten System machen .
Das entscheidende Designelement wäre folgendes :
Wenn zwei Gruppen in verschiedenen Institutionen beginnen würden , das Web vollständig unabhängig voneinander zu nutzen , dann müsste sichergestellt sein , dass eine Person in der einen Gruppe eine Verknüpfung zu einem Dokument im anderen Web mit wenig Mühe anlegen könnte – ohne die beiden Dokumentdatenbanken zusammenzuführen oder überhaupt auf das andere System zuzugreifen .
Wenn jeder im Web das tun könnte , würde schon eine einzige Hypertextverknüpfung in eine unfassbare und grenzenlose Welt führen . «
Grundsätzlich ist es ausdrücklich erlaubt , sogar erwünscht , Links auf meine Seiten zu setzen !
Selbstverständlich freue ich mich immer über eine kleine Benachrichtigung , die jedoch keinesfalls als Anfrage zu verstehen sein sollte .
Wenn
Sie allerdings meinen , Sie müssten sich durch einen Disclaimer gleichzeitig von meinen Inhalten und somit von mir als Person distanzieren , dann seien Sie bitte konsequent und setzen Sie keinen Link .
Bitte sehen
Sie auch davon ab , meine Seiten zu » framen « , das bedeutet , innerhalb Ihres eigenen Framesets aufzurufen .
Alle von mir persönlich gesetzten Links auf meinen Seiten sind als Empfehlung zu werten .
Ich verlinke Seiten , um Ihnen weiterführende Informationen zu bestimmten Themen anzubieten oder um Ihnen empfehlenswerte Artikel zugänglich zu machen .
Davon ausgenommen sind Links ,
die von Dritten innerhalb von Kommentaren aufgeführt werden ,
die ich im Kontext ausdrücklich anders kommentiere oder
die ich im Rahmen von Werbeanzeigen setze .
Es kann passieren , dass die referenzierten Inhalte sich ohne meinem Wissen ändern .
Im Disclaimer des Berliner Beauftragten für Datenschutz und Akteneinsicht steht , dass ich für fremde Inhalte nur dann zu verantworten sei , wenn ich von ihnen ( das heißt auch von einem rechtswidrigen bzw .
strafbaren Inhalt ) positive Kenntnis habe und es mir technisch möglich und zumutbar ist , deren Nutzung zu verhindern .
Es ist jedoch nicht zumutbar , dass ich alle Links auf meinen Seiten ständig danach kontrolliere , ob sie sich noch in dem Zustand befinden , in dem sie waren , als ich einen Link darauf gesetzt habe .
Dies gilt natürlich vor allem für die im Rahmen der Amazon - Anzeigen geschalteten Links .
Dieser Dienst liefert dynamisch generierte Anzeigen , die auf den I nhalt der Seiten ausgerichtet sind .
Diese Verweise sind eindeutig nicht als Empfehlung meinerseits zu verstehen .
Wenn
Sie also das Gefühl haben , dass ein Link auf meinen Seiten zivilrechtliche oder strafrechtliche Verantwortlichkeit auslöst , dann geben Sie mir bitte Bescheid , sodass ich diesen Link prüfen und ggf. entfernen kann .

Michael Werner looks normal enough .
He 's six foot tall , grey and bespectacled , weighs in at 12 - and - a- half stone and enjoys playing tennis , socialising and jogging - three brisk miles before breakfast with his wife Angelica , a nice fry - up for her and a quick coffee for him .
All very ordinary .
It 's just that Michael does n't eat .
At all .
In fact , the last item of food that passed his lips was a huge helping of potato salad and a slice of cake on New Year 's Eve 2001 .
Scroll down for more ...
Extraordinarily , the 58 - year - old doctor of chemistry and father of three from Brunswick , northern Germany , claims he gets all the sustenance he needs from the sun .
Oh , and the occasional coffee , fruit juice or a glass of wine if he and Angelica are enjoying a night out .
" I call it light nutrition , " he explains .
" But one can also talk of ethereal , Prana , Chi or cosmic energy ... it 's all the same thing . "
It 's also known as Breatharianism , or the belief that the elements contained in air - nitrogen , carbon dioxide , oxygen and hydrogen - can sustain a body .
So far , so daft .
But Dr Werner is n't your average nutter .
He 's a bright , well spoken scientist who was so surprised at the consequences of his bizarre diet - just four coffees and two fruit juices every day for six - and - a - half years , plus that occasional glass of wine - that he 's written a book about it called Life From Light .
" I 'm actually a really normal person , " he insists .
" Not a freak , or someone with some amazing phenomenon - just a Joe Normal . "
It all started in 2000 when the Werners had a friend over for supper .
" It was a stroke of providence , " he says .
" One evening an old acquaintance of my wife came round for dinner .
We noticed she 'd become very thin , even a bit haggard , and ate nothing .
" But when we asked what was up - whether she had a problem - she told us that she 'd was n't eating any more .
She claimed she did n't need to because she 'd gone through a very special conversion programme and was now living from light nourishment alone . "
While some people might have suggested she saw a psychiatrist , post haste , Michael - who was overweight ( 15 stone ) , unhappy and unhealthy with a passion for pizza and all things spiritual - was intrigued .
And , finally , after nine months of build - up and the New Year 's Eve potato salad blow - out , he gave it a whirl - starting with a strict acclimatisation programme to help his body adapt .
" It takes three weeks , " he says .
" The first week is really strict - eat nothing , drink nothing .
" Every doctor will tell you this is not possible , but it is .
It sounds hard , but living without water for seven days is very possible - it's all about being in the right frame of mind .
" The crucial factor in this 21 - day process is self - belief .
If you believe you can do this then you wo n't give in to the hunger .
" On the eighth day you can have some watered down fruit juice - to cleanse your body with the antioxidants .
" In the third week , you can move on to stronger , more concentrated juices .
And in the last seven days , your body stabilises and gets used to its new regime . "
But what about the grindingly awful hunger ?
" You wo n't feel the burning hunger if your mental attitude is right , " he says crisply .
" This is n't about dieting , but respecting your body . "
But he does admit to losing more than two stone and looking " like a dried out tortoise " at the end of the three - week period .
Of course , fasting is n't new .
It dates back to Biblical times , was rigorously practised in Judaism and recommended by Jesus both by example and teaching - to strengthen the spiritual life by weakening the attractions of sensible pleasures .
But for a matter of days and weeks - not years .
To be frank , it 's a miracle Dr Werner has n't died .
Experts differ as to the absolute maximum time that human life can continue without water , but the broad consensus rests at somewhere between seven and ten days , though severe dehydration and confusion ( due to the build - up of sodium and potassium in the brain ) would set in sooner .
In the desert , of course , lack of water can kill in a matter of hours .
So if Dr Werner is telling the truth , then his body really is extraordinary .
And at six foot and 12 - and - a- half stone , he 's not even particularly skinny .
And he claims to feel wonderful .
" I feel healthier and more vital than ever .
My powers of resistance and regeneration are stronger .
I 'm hardly ever ill any more .
Psychologically , I feel stable and mentally enriched , have much better concentration and memory than I used to and now only need five or six hours ' sleep , rather than the eight or nine I used to . "
And what of his libido - has it been diminished by a diet of coffee , juice and air ?
" The opposite ! " he trills .
" Every perception - whether it is sight , skin or other sense organ - is more intense .
My potency has become even stronger . "
But is n't what he 's doing a form of anorexia ?
" Oh no !
I do n't eat out of a love for my body - not because I hate it .
Anorexics generally have a negative rejection of their own body and food .
I feel very good in my body , even feel more closely bound to my body than before .
" I 've always had a very positive relationship with food .
I enjoy being present at mealtimes and often think I even enjoy them better than if I were to eat !'
So what does he do at mealtimes ?
" I take part in them , of course .
I always drink something - sometimes water , sometimes tea , sometimes coffee , depending on the situation and my mood . "
There are an estimated 5,000 Breatharianists / light nutritionists worldwide , of whom Werner
claims to know about 30 .
The movement has a chequered past .
In 1983 Wiley Brooks , the founder of the Breatharian Institute of America and who claimed not to have eaten for 19 years , caused outrage when he was allegedly caught ordering a chicken pie .
And several female followers have died after fasting and falling into comas .
Australian Ellen " Jasmuheen " Greves was a leading proponent of the movement in the late Nineties - lecturing all over the world on the benefits of a diet of light , air and one packet of biscuits in 10 years .
However , scepticism crept in after reporters visiting her Brisbane home found it crammed with food - which she insisted belonged to her second husband , Jess Ferguson , a convicted fraudster .
And a British journalist accompanying her to her check - in desk at Heathrow was astonished when the BA clerk asked her to confirm that she 'd ordered an in - flight vegetarian meal .
" No , no , " she replied .
" Well , yes , OK , I did .
But I wo n't be eating it . "
And an attempt in 1999 to test her skill ended in near disaster .
The controlled experiment , under tight security , ended after four days amid fears for her rapidly deteriorating health .
She blamed the failure on the stressful circumstances under which the experiment was conducted , rather than lack of food and water .
But where Jasmuheen failed , Dr Werner claims to have proved his capabilities .
" I have taken part in two ten - day studies where everything was monitored - my blood pressure , urine , heart rate .
Much of my energy comes from light and the atmosphere .
I absorb energy from light - like plants - and this allows me to function fully .
" It serves as proof that I am doing what I say I am , but we still can't pinpoint how exactly .
There are many questions that can't be answered yet . "
Including a rather obvious one .
How can he lead a healthy life on a diet of nothing when thousands of people starve to death every day ?
After all , there 's plenty of light in Africa - could n't all the hungry people there adopt his principals ?
" Fundamentally , I am convinced it would be possible , " he says .
" The problem is they are convinced they will starve if they do n't eat , " he adds .
" But I do not in any way believe that light nourishment is a method of solving the world hunger problem . "
Certainly , other medical experiments have found no evidence that there is any way for starving individuals to be kept alive .
During the closing years of World War II , 36 men took part in an experiment at the University of Minnesota in which they were subjected to semi-starvation and lost a quarter of their body weight .
They suffered a variety of symptoms including anaemia , fatigue , apathy , extreme weakness , irritability and mental problems .
Medical experts are unanimous in their disapproval and scepticism .
Even if you survived the initial fasting period , existing on a diet of light , air and coffee for an extended period is likely to be fatal .
Even Dr Werner says he would not recommend it to others .
But he says he suffers no ill - effects even six - and - a- half years into his experiment .
Is there any food he misses ?
" Occasionally , I 'll bite into some chocolate or a slice of pizza - just to annoy my three children .
But the enjoyment of eating stops as it hits the back of my throat .
" But I still love being with food , to see and smell it , particularly fried , in a cafe - that is something very fine .
Now and again I get an appetite - when I might eat a couple of grapes or a nut .
But these days I can take it or leave it . "
Not surprisingly , he comes under constant pressure to eat .
" Dealing with the practicalities of light nourishment is not simple .
I am often asked when are you going to eat again ?
I can only answer , I do n't know .
2I can only say I would be stupid to eat again , as I am doing really well .
Better than ever before . "
Well , perhaps .
But we have only his word for it and if ever there was an experiment which should not be tried at home , this is it .
Over the past couple of weeks ,
Ars has started receiving e-mails about a topic that does n't really fit into our normal areas of coverage : homeopathy .
The belief that the administration of nothing more than water can have a medicinal affect certainly is n't technology , and it only peripherally touches upon science , in the sense that any health benefits it provides seem to involve the placebo affect .
Nevertheless , many of the practitioners of homeopathy have tried to claim the mantle of science , creating scientific - sounding explanations for " water memory " — the idea that a substance can actually gain potency as it is diluted out of existence .
These practitioners even formed a peer - reviewed journal to discuss their findings .
Six years ago , the journal Homeopathy ran a special issue on these explanations , and the Ars writers teamed up to tackle the bizarre distortions of science that it contained .
So in honor of World Homeopathy Week ( which we just received a press release for ) , we 're going to run an updated version of that story .
Not because we think there 's a value in talking about homeopathy .
Rather , by scientifically evaluating homeopathy 's attempts to sound scientific and revealing it to be nothing more than " pseudoscience , " we think it 's possible to learn something about the scientific process and the reasoning that drives it .
In turn , we can possibly learn to recognize other areas where scientific reasoning has ended up on the rocks .
This feature was originally published on September 11 , 2007 .
Welcome to Waterworld
Welcome to a special edition of Nobel Intent .
Beyond keeping you familiar with the comings and goings of modern science , we have consistently expressed concern regarding science education and the public understanding of science .
Key to that understanding are the basic features of science , such as how scientific concepts are formulated and tested and why they typically produce a better understanding of the natural world than alternative approaches .
But science can be a tricky thing to define , and it 's sometimes easier to contrast it with some of the arguments that pose as science .
Unfortunately , most of those issues are entangled with implications that keep the basic question — is this science ?— obscured by emotional responses .
Thus , the science of climatology has become entwined with political , economic , and policy issues .
The science of evolution conflicts with the political and religious goals of some individuals .
Even basic scientific questions about the nervous system get embroiled in family and personal health issues when topics like autism and radio frequency radiation are broached .
That 's why a special edition of the journal Homeopathy appears to be a gift , allowing us to look at science and psuedoscience without getting entangled with politics and religion .
Homeopathy claims to be a form of medical practice that 's based on the principle that " like cures like . "
Given a set of symptoms , a homeopath will identify an herb or chemical that causes similar symptoms .
Following a predefined ritual , the homeopath performs a series of dilutions of that chemical that continue well beyond the point where there should be no molecules of it left — the final solution is essentially well - shaken water .
Giving patients water is probably a lot less harmful than many folk remedies that fly under the scientific radar , but homeopathy has two notable distinctions .
One is that people spend a lot of money on it — the US market was already close to half a billion dollars in 1999 .
The second is that homeopaths have demanded that their field be treated as a science , performing clinical studies , proposing mechanisms , and even convincing Elsevier to publish Homeopathy , a peer - reviewed journal .
The articles in this special edition of Homeopathy display a number of consistent themes : internal inconsistency ; a rejection of scientific standards and methods ; and established science is applied to inappropriate situations ( for example , quantum entanglement between people is proposed ) .
In cases where mechanisms are suggested , they frequently violate our basic understanding of the natural world .
Tying things together are unsupported assertions and logical leaps that have no place in science .
The experience of reading the journal was like seeing a science publication reflected through Alice 's looking glass .
By criticizing homeopathy , we hope to illuminate the general distinctions between science and pseudoscience .
Hopefully , in finding a topic that 's largely free of baggage , we 'll help provide a broader picture of what makes science distinct from fields that feign scientific legitimacy .
Suppression of water memory
Most special editions start with an editor 's comment ; this is no exception .
Homeopathy ’s editor acknowledges that the most widely held theory for homeopathic action involves the placebo effect .
However , he also claims that there is a growing body of evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy , so water memory should be further investigated .
He makes a bold claim regarding what the results will be : " There is much work to be done , but at this stage we can say one thing with certainty : the assertion that homeopathy is impossible because the ' memory of water ' is impossible is wrong . "
The memory of water
Does the rest of this issue bear out this statement ?
The second article , entitled " The memory of water : an overview , ” acts as an introduction .
The implication of this title is that we should be able to get a good feel for the state of the field , where it is heading , and what challenges remain .
The author , Martin F. Chaplin , writes with the assumption that the existence of water memory is obvious .
But Chaplin never gives a definition of the " water memory effect . "
As one reads the article , it becomes clear that any behavior of water that is non-obvious is " water memory . "
This allows Chaplin to present a mix of trivia as if it formed a coherent body of scientific evidence .
Oddly , whenever any of these behaviors must be described , Chaplin presents an analogy .
We have never seen analogy used in scientific writing as a replacement for a direct , formal argument .
The role of water memory in homeopathy could be demonstrated in two ways : physical measurement of some structure that was imposed upon water by the active ingredient or by the demonstrated efficacy of the diluted solution .
Chaplin would , apparently , disagree :
" Editorial comment in the scientific press has subsequently drawn on whether water can indeed show any ' memory ' of its prior history as direct ' proof ' of whether homeopathy can be successful or not .
Such linkage is quite unnecessary and may easily mislead as the two areas utilize fundamentally differing and entirely independent evidence and should therefore be considered separately . "
In a certain sense this is true ; consistent observations for the efficacy of homeopathy can and would stand alone .
However , no such body of evidence appears in this issue , which shifts the burden to evidence for the memory of water .
Water memory claims violate several deeply held physical principles that are backed by a great deal of evidence , so proof of the failure of these principles should require solid data .
Instead , we are subjected to increasingly wild and far - fetched proposals that , in the absence of direct evidence , must be investigated as a substitute .
Chaplin bristles at the fact that these proposals have not been well received by the scientific community , and he suggests that science ’s high standards for overturning established principles have " resulted in the slow uptake of new ideas and the overly long retention of fallacious concepts . "
Let 's consider science 's track record in this regard .
Quantum mechanics , special , and general relativity spring to mind as examples of radical new ideas .
They went from new hypotheses to accepted theories in less than the working lifetime of the scientists involved .
RNA splicing and interference were radical at the time yet were quickly accepted on the basis of solid evidence .
This should tell you something about both science and this author .

Gary McKinnon has lost his appeal in the UK's House of Lords against extradition to the US on hacking charges .
The BBC News website profiles his history and his motives .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
To hear the US government tell it , Gary McKinnon is a dangerous man , and should be extradited back to America to stand trial in a Virginia courtroom .
One US prosecutor accused him of committing " the biggest military computer hack of all time " .
But Mr McKinnon has said his motives were harmless and innocent - he was , he says , simply looking for information on UFOs .
If found guilty , Mr McKinnon could face decades in US jail , and fines of close to $ 2 m .
' Bumbling nerd '
The charges against Mr McKinnon are extensive .
The US government alleges that between February 2001 and March 2002 , the 40 - year - old computer enthusiast from north London hacked into dozens of US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense computers , as well as 16 Nasa computers .
It says his hacking caused some $ 700,000 dollars damage to government systems .
What 's more , they allege that Mr McKinnon altered and deleted files at a US Naval Air Station not long after the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 and that the attack rendered critical systems inoperable .
The US government also says Mr McKinnon once took down an entire network of 2,000 US Army computers .
His goal , they claim , was to access classified information .
The US alleges Mr McKinnon attacked sites soon after 9/11 In July 2005 , Mark Summers , another official representing the US government , told a London court that Mr McKinnon 's hacking was " intentional and calculated to influence and affect the US government by intimidation and coercion " .
Mr McKinnon 's supporters point out that these charges have never been put before a court .
Instead the US government voiced them unopposed as it sought his extradition .
For his part Gary McKinnon , or Solo as he was known online , paints a very different picture of himself , and his motivation .
In a BBC interview in 2005 , Mr McKinnon said that he was not a malicious hacker bent on bringing down US military systems , but rather more of a " bumbling computer nerd " .
He said he 's no web vandal , or virus writer , and that he never acted with malicious intent .
But he did admit that he hacked into dozens of US government computer systems .
In fact , he calmly detailed just how easy it was to access extremely sensitive information in those systems .
" I found out that the US military use Windows , " said Mr McKinnon in that BBC interview .
" And having realised this , I assumed it would probably be an easy hack if they had n't secured it properly . "
Using commercially available software , Mr McKinnon probed dozens of US military and government networks .
He found many machines without adequate password or firewall protection .
So , he simply hacked into them .
' Hacker ' loses court fight UFO search But for some , his method of hacking is not nearly so interesting as his reason for doing it .
Mr McKinnon got his first computer when he was 14 years old , and has been a hobbyist ever since .
He left school at 17 , and became a hairdresser .
But , in the early 1990s , some friends convinced him to get a qualification in computers .
After completing a course , he started doing contract work in the computing field .
By the late 1990s , Mr McKinnon decided to use his hacking skills to do what he calls " research " on an issue he firmly believes in .
Mr McKinnon told the BBC that he is convinced that the United States government is withholding critical information about Unidentified Flying Objects .
" It was n't just an interest in little green men and flying saucers , " said Mr McKinnon .
" I believe that there are spacecraft , or there have been craft , flying around that the public does n't know about . "
Mr McKinnon further explained that he believes the US military has reverse engineered an anti-gravity propulsion system from recovered alien spacecraft , and that this propulsion system is being kept a secret .
In that sense , Mr McKinnon said he sees his own hacking as " humanitarian . "
He said he only wanted to find evidence of a UFO cover - up and expose it .
He called the alleged anti-gravity propulsion system " extra - terrestrial technology we should have access to " .
" I wanted to find out why this is being kept a secret when it could be put to good use , " he said in the BBC interview last year .
The US alleges that Mr McKinnon attack the base at Fort Meyer Gary McKinnon 's search turned into an obsession , an addiction .
As he probed high - level computer systems in the United States , his life in Britain fell apart .
He lost his job , and his girlfriend dumped him .
Friends told him to stop hacking , but to no avail .
" I 'd stopped washing at one point .
I was n't looking after myself .
I was n't eating properly .
I was sitting around the house in my dressing gown , doing this all night . "
Net lockdown Eventually , Mr McKinnon got sloppy .
He started leaving behind clues .
At one point , Mr McKinnon began posting anti-war diatribes on the screens of the US government computers that were his targets .
He has insisted , however , that he never attempted to sabotage any operations .
When Britain 's hi-tech crime unit finally came for him 2002 , Mr McKinnon was not surprised .
He told the BBC : " I think I almost wanted to be caught , because it was ruining me .
I had this classic thing of wanting to be caught so there would be an end to it . "
He thought he would be tried in Britain , and that he might get , at the most , three to four years in prison .
Then , later that year , the United States decided to indict him with charges that could mean up to 70 years in a US prison .
It has never been entirely clear why it took US officials until 2005 to begin extradition proceedings .
Gary McKinnon 's been fighting extradition ever since , on the grounds that he never intended anything malicious by his hacking .
He 's been free on bail , but it has been a strange kind of freedom .
The US military 's use of Windows let Mr McKinnon in For a period he had to sign in at his local police station every evening , and could not leave his house at night .
The court also forbade him from using any computer connected to the internet .
After losing the High Court battle against the extradition , Mr McKinnon took the fight to the House of Lords .
This backed the call for extradition on 30 July 2008 .
Mr McKinnon remains contrite about what he did , although he has admitted that he thinks US officials are making him a scapegoat .
He has said that in the course of his hacking , he found evidence that hundreds of others from around the world were also trying to hack the same networks .
His supporters say that instead of prosecuting him , the US government should thank him for pointing out massive computer security lapses in critical systems .
As for his quest to find evidence of a UFO cover - up , Mr McKinnon has said that he found some circumstantial evidence online to back his claims , including what he said are photos with what he speculated were alien spacecraft airbrushed out of the picture .
He said the photos in question were too large to download to his own computer .
When the BBC asked him if he ever felt like hacking again , Mr McKinnon replied , " No , not at all . "
He said he wished he had listened to his friends when they told him to stop .

What are these ?
What sets Drudge apart as much as anything is its ability to attract well - placed leaks and traffic in the freshest and rawest material — though sometimes including what some have considered smears .
On the Republican side , a generation of campaign consultants has grown up learning to play in Mr. Drudge ’s influential but rarefied world .
They have spent years studying his tastes and moods while carefully building close relationships with him that are now benefiting some Republican presidential campaigns — and that others are scrambling to match .
The early advantage on their side , in the view of several Republicans , seems to have gone to Mitt Romney , who hired the former Bush political aide who had been the central party ’s prime point of contact with Mr. Drudge , Matthew Rhoades .
His status was solidified after the 2004 election at a steakhouse dinner in Miami with Mr. Drudge , who for all his renown in politics is a somewhat spectral presence who rarely agrees to meet with political operatives or journalists and who did not respond to requests for an interview for this article .
So important was the Romney camp ’s perceived advantage in the eyes of aides to Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , that at one point this year they even considered sending an emissary to Miami to build their own relationship with him , two former McCain campaign officials said .
( Mr. Drudge ignored the invitation , one of the officials said . )
But , typical of a campaign with a reputation for exploiting every advantage and trying to neutralize every disadvantage , Mrs. Clinton ’s communications team , led by Howard Wolfson , is not leaving Mr. Drudge to the Republicans .
Five current and former Democratic officials said Mrs. Clinton has on her side the closest thing her party has ever had to Mr. Rhoades in Tracy Sefl , a former Democratic National Committee official , who has established a friendly working relationship with Mr. Drudge — and through whom Mrs. Clinton ’s campaign often worked quietly to open a line of communication .
Image Matt Drudges site made a mark when another Clinton dominated political news .

That effort has helped to mix some positive stories in with the negative fare about Mrs. Clinton that Mr. Drudge still serves up regularly , they said , though Ms. Sefl ’s fingerprints are usually impossible to spot .
This Bush negotiated agreement is an expansion of the NAFTA trade model which includes the most damaging elements of NAFTA , the investor priveleges chapter , nearly word - for - word .
In the House on November 8th , the agreement passed despite opposition from a majority of Dems including 3/ 4 of Democratic freshman who vividly remember their tough election campaigns and how the trade issue played .
Not a single environmental , family farm , major labor , Latino civil or faith group supports the Peru FTA and Peru 's two labor federations also oppose it .
Corporations like Walmart have been heavily lobbying in favor of the agreement .
The Senate vote is scheduled for 2:15 EST today , though many Senators still seem to be making up their minds .
What 's in the Peru agreement ?
* Foreign investor privileges identical to those found in NAFTA and CAFTA that create incentives for U.S. firms to move offshore and expose basic environmental , health , zoning and other laws to attack in foreign tribunals ;
* Bans on " Buy America " and anti-offshoring policies ;
* Threats to renewable energy , recycled content and prevailing wage procurement laws ;
* Limits on food import safety standards and inspection rates ;
* Agriculture rules identical to those found in NAFTA and CAFTA that are projected to increase coca production and create rural unrest in trade partners .
Under NAFTA , these rules led to displacement of 1.3 million Mexican peasant farmers and a 60 percent increase in immigration from Mexico to the U.S. ;
* Patent extensions that would provide large pharmaceutical companies new protections that limit poor countries ' access to affordable medicines ; and
* Peru FTA terms that could subject that country to compensation claims for reversing its Social Security privatization .
Also of interest is the field of presidential candidates ' views on the Peru FTA - with Sens Clinton and Obama supporting while Edwards , Biden , Kucinich and Dodd all oppose .
Here are their previous vote records on trade ( includes the Repubs as well ) .
Now 's the time to call your Senator about this bad deal !
And that 's it - you can watch the vote at www.c-span.org of course .
Sydney 's breach of security has made headlines in Australia
The team from the satirical show The Chaser 's War on Everything were stopped within yards of the hotel where US President George W Bush was staying .
The stunt was reportedly only revealed when one of the team , dressed as Osama Bin Laden , got out of the car .
Police handling security for the Apec summit called it a " dangerous stunt " .
" We have snipers deployed around the city .
They were n't there for show , they mean business , that 's what they are there for , " Commissioner Andrew Scipione of New South Wales police said .
The sham motorcade involved three large cars and two motorcycles carrying Canadian flags .
They were waved through two police checkpoints on what was one of the busiest days for the city 's security forces , as world leaders arrived for this weekend 's summit .
Police only moved in when one of the crew emerged from the car wearing a long fake beard and robes , close to the InterContinental Hotel where President Bush is staying .
All 11 members of the crew have been bailed after being charged with entering a secure area .
Police are said to be considering further charges .
Makers of the programme , which is broadcast on ABC , said they had never intended to enter the Apec restricted zone in central Sydney .
The crew believed they had been given permission by police to proceed as far as they did , and voluntarily turned round when they thought they were about to enter the restricted area , the makers said in a statement on the ABC website .
Sydney has seen the biggest security operation ever mounted by Australia ahead of the meeting of 21 leaders of the Asia - Pacific Economic Co-operation forum .
A 5 km ( three - mile ) barrier has been erected across the central business district and more than 5,000 police and troops are patrolling the streets .
Croatian creative agency Bruketa & Zinić have designed an annual report for food company Podravka that has to be baked in an oven before it can be read .
Called Well
Done , the report features blank pages printed with thermo-reactive ink that , after being wrapped in foil and cooked for 25 minutes , reveal text and images .
Here are details from Bruketa & Zinić :
--
Well Done , the annual report for food company you have to bake before use
Empty pages become filled with content after being baked at 100 °C for 25 minutes .
“ Well done ” created by Bruketa & Zinić is the new annual report for Podravka , the biggest food company in South - East Europe .
It consists of two parts :
a big book containing numbers and a report of an independent auditor
a small booklet that is inserted inside the big one that contains the very heart of Podravka as a brand : great Podravka ’s recipes .
To be able to cook like Podravka you need to be a precise cook .
That is why the small Podravka booklet is printed in invisible , thermo- reactive ink .
To be able to reveal Podravka ’s secrets you need to cover the small booklet in aluminium foil and bake it at 100 degrees Celsius for 25 minutes .
If you are not precise , the booklet will burn , just as any overcooked meal .
If you have successfully baked your sample of the annual report , the empty pages will become filled with text , and the illustrations with empty plates filled with food .
The annual report is printed on paper Conqueror Laid Brilliant White 120 g/m2 , Munken Polar 130 g/m2 and Soporset 90 g/m2 and written with typography Thema by Nikola Djurek and Lexicon by Bram De Does .
The creative team of the project consists of Creative Directors Davor Bruketa & Nikola Zinić ; Art directors Davor Bruketa , Nikola Zinić , Imelda Ramovi , Mirel Hadžijusufović ; Copywriters Davor Bruketa , Nikola Zinić , Lana Cavar , Teo Tarabarić , Project manager Mirna Grzelj ; Prepress : Danko Đurašin and editor Drenislav Zekić .
This is the seventh annual report for Podravka designed by Bruketa & Zinić OM .
Those seven books won numerous awards worldwide such as London International Awards ( Gold ) , Art Directors Club New York ( Silver ) , Red Dot ( Best of the Best ) , Cresta ( Winner of Category ) , I.D. Annual Design Review ( Best of Category ) , Type Directors Club ( Typographic Excellence ) , Graphis ( Gold ) , Creativity ( Gold ) , Good Design ( Graphics Award ) , HOW International Design Awards ( Best of Show ) , Moscow International Advertising Festival ( Gold ) , International Forum Communication Design ( Design Award ) and ARC Awards ( Gold ) .
Bruketa & Zinić OM is a 60 - people independent agency based in Zagreb , Croatia .
It was established 10 years ago .
The agency has been awarded for their projects by many prestigious contests and their work has been presented in many publications , books and exhibitions worldwide .
David Obey and John Murtha had strong words for the GOP over their stonewalling the funds for the troops in Iraq .
No withdraw date , no cash -- plain & simple .
Download Download
Obey : The Bush Administration is promoting a lot of stories over the past week about nasty actions in the Pentagon that will have to be taken if Congress does n't provide a bridge fund for the Iraqi war .
Like so many other things in this town , those stories have things backwards .
The House has already passed a $ 50 billion bridge fund which will provide all of the funding necessary for Iraq through at least February and beyond .
But the President 's allies in the Senate are preventing it from even reaching his desk because they do n't like the conditions under which the money is provided .
Let me repeat : the money has already been provided by the House of representatives , if the President wants that $ 50 billion released , all he has to do is call the Senate Republican Leader , Mitch McConnell , and ask him to stop blocking it .
That phone number is ( 202 ) 224-2541 in case anyone is interested .
Huff Po : " As reported by the Huffington Post , the Democrat war supplement proposal is the party 's most aggressive funding measure since taking over Congress .
In addition to insisting on a full withdrawal plan the bill would also require that troops be fully trained and equipped before being sent into the field and that the government abide by the Army Field Manual with respect to prohibiting torture . "
As Pelosi says : " Democrats and the American people support our troops in the field and will always insist they receive all the resources they require .
If there is any delay in funding for our men and women in uniform , the responsibility will squarely lie with the President and Senate Republicans who are blocking the bill . "

Pistol Packing Feds
The fundamental difference between government and private entities which perform comparable functions is that government , based upon the supposed notion of a “ social contract ” , reserves to itself the use of force to achieve its ends .
Such coercion at the hands of other , non-governmental , players ( for example , price - fixing , abuse of a monopoly position , intimidation of competitors or labour unions , etc. ) is rightly deemed criminal and often aggressively prosecuted by the state ( with perhaps some of its zeal due to aversion to competition ) .
Yet the very same acts , performed by authorities elected with 51 % of the votes or appointed to act on their behalf , is presented to the public and in the legacy media as entirely benign : in “ the public interest ” .
At the peak of the coercive pyramid is the bare fact that the government can kill you and get away with it .
This is n't about capital punishment ; those civilised countries which employ the death penalty apply it mostly as a sanction for crimes against individuals , not opposition to the government .
( In uncivilised countries , it 's another matter entirely , but that 's a different question . )
No , the real power of the state is embodied in government agents who carry weapons and wield arrest authority within its own territory for use against its own citizens and residents .
Let 's take a glance at the United States , a country of about 300 million people , and see how many agents of its federal government are entitled to pack lethal force and arrest people within its borders .
The data in the following table are taken from the Bureau of Justice Statistics Federal Law Enforcement Officers , 2004 report ; this is the most recent year for which these statistics are available .
Agency Pistoleros U.S. Customs and Border Protection 27,705 Federal Bureau of Prisons 15,214 Federal Bureau of Investigation 12,242 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement 10,399 U.S. Secret Service 4,769 Drug Enforcement Administration 4,400 Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 4,126 U.S. Marshals Service 3,233 U.S. Postal Inspection Service 2,976 Internal Revenue Service , Criminal Investigation 2,777 Veterans Health Administration 2,423 Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco ,
Firearms and Explosives 2,373 National Park Service 2,148 U.S. Capitol Police 1,535 Bureau of Diplomatic Security ,
Diplomatic Security Service 825 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ,
Division of Law Enforcement 708 USDA Forest Service ,
Law Enforcement & Investigations 600 Pentagon Force Protection Agency 482 U.S. Mint 376 Department of Health and Human Services ( IG ) 374 Department of the Treasury , Tax Administration ( IG ) 330 Department of Defense ( IG ) 326 Bureau of Indian Affairs 320 Amtrak 317 Department of Energy 292 Social Security Administration ( IG ) 279 Bureau of Land Management 249 Bureau of Engraving and Printing 234 Department of Housing and Urban Development ( IG ) 213 Environmental Protection Agency 209 Food and Drug Administration 177 Department of Agriculture ( IG ) 170 Tennessee Valley Authority 168 Department of Labor ( IG ) 142 National Marine Fisheries Service 141 Department of Homeland Security ( IG ) 132 Department of Justice ( IG ) 128 U.S. Supreme Court 125 Department of Veterans Affairs ( IG ) 116 Library of Congress 116 Department of Transportation ( IG ) 108 Department of Education ( IG ) 97 Bureau of Industry and Security 90 National Institutes of Health 75 Federal Emergency Management Agency 63 Department of the Interior ( IG ) 57 National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( IG ) 54 Environmental Protection Agency ( IG ) 53 General Services Administration ( IG ) 50 Department of Energy ( IG ) 47 Government Printing Office 40 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( IG ) 39 Small Business Administration ( IG ) 29 National Institute of Standards and Technology 28 National Zoological Park 28 Office of Personnel Management ( IG ) 27 Bureau of Reclamation 24 Department of State ( IG ) 18 Department of the Treasury ( IG ) 16 Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( IG ) 15 U.S. Railroad Retirement Board ( IG ) 14 Agency for International Development ( IG ) 13 Department of Commerce ( IG ) 13 DHS Citizen and Immigration Services 9 Government Printing Office ( IG ) 7 Total 104,883
So , for about every 3000 residents of the U.S. , there is one Federal agent entitled to carry a firearm to murder them on behalf of their consensual government .
Now this may not seem like very many , but note that in the United States regular law enforcement — the cops — is entirely the responsibility of state and local government ; the gunguys and gungals listed above are a layer on top of that , beholden only to the central power in Washington .
What is stunning are not the items at the top of the table : it makes sense that customs agents , border and federal prison guards , FBI agents , and the like carry guns , but rather those you find as you go down the list .
[ The “ ( IG ) ” annotation indicates that these people work for the Inspector General office of the respective agency , which is kind of its internal security branch . ]
First of all , look at what ultimately happens if you do n't pay your taxes : there are 2,777 employees of the Internal Revenue Service authorised to carry weapons to shoot you down .
Further down the list , we find that the Department of Health and Human Services has need of 374 pistol - packing Inspectors General to maintain its own departmental health by threatening human life .
The Department of Housing and Urban Development manages to get along with a mere 213 , while the Environmental Protection Agency issues 209 licenses to kill to keep the air and water pristine .
The Library of Congress keeps 116 terminators on staff — better return that book on time when you borrow it from them !
The Department of Education manages with 97 armed enforcers ( do your homework , kiddies ) , and the National Institutes of Health employs 75 minions authorised to impact the health of those who cross them with the most invasive of therapies .
Even the National Institute of Standards and Technology has 28 precision gunsels on its roster , presumably to liquidate those who might try to slip in a spurious leap second in order to slack off after a wild New Year 's party .
What 's striking about this is that comparable organisations in the private sector seem to get along just fine without all the hired killers .
Sure , they may have security guards who , depending on the circumstances , might be armed , but why on Earth does a library , even one as capacious as the Library of Congress , need 116 state sanctioned shooters ?
When you see the state 's immediate and instinctive recourse to deadly force , it 's easy to understand why so many who worship the state are so eager to reserve to the state the exclusive right to employ lethal force and to deny the means of self defense — the granddaddy of all human rights — to lawful citizens .
It is not my intent to single out the United States as employing lethal force on behalf of its state organs .
I use the U.S. as an example simply because the data are available on - line and it's a large country which accounts of a significant part of the world 's GDP .
The ratio of armed citizens to armed government agents in the the U.S. is almost certainly higher than in most other countries .

Awesome Innovations from the Underdeveloped Male Mind
There are over 7 million patents registered in the United States , a great number of which describe practical inventions designed for use by everyday , ordinary human beings .
Then there 's the " guy " stuff , ideas so lunkheaded and irrational they could only have come from that tiny portion of a guy 's brain not dedicated to scratching himself .
The following inventions have received actual patents from the United States government - proof positive that heavy drinking is not being discouraged at the patent and trademark office .
The illustrations are those submitted by the inventors themselves , whose surnames have been withheld as an act of mercy .
George ’s Golf Practice Apparatus
( Patented 1956 )
Every guy knows that the length of his drive is directly proportional to the length of a specific anatomical member which , for the sake of being discrete , we shall refer to as " Mr. Johnson " .
Suffice it to say nobody wants to hit a limp dribbler up the fairway .
This explains why the typical guy will spend up to 83 % of his pre-tax income on assorted equipment that promises to improve his golf swing .
Well , the best of this equipment , as determined by total weight , is George ’s revolutionary Golf Practice Apparatus ( GPA ) , a device once described by Rube Goldberg as being " a bit complicated " .
The GPA will allow any run of the mill guy to increase the length of his Johnson - err , drive - right in the comfort of his very own structurally reinforced den or recreation room .
For those interested , the GPA comes unassembled , and all that you ’ll require to put it together is a 3/4 - inch box wrench , an acetylene torch , and Stephen Hawking .
Once assembled , simply lubricate it twice daily at points 1 through 203 , and the GPA will stand ready to offer years of faithful service .
Bill ’s Inflatable Floating Furniture
( Patented 1989 )
Single guy apartments have horrible reputations for cleanliness .
Accurate , but horrible .
The details are typical - dust , mold , blood stains , dirty boxer shorts , week - old slices of pizza , the stench of old , wet gym shoes … and we ’re just talking about the sofa .
It ’s not that guys enjoy living in filth , it ’s just that cleaning takes effort while involving very little risk of personal injury .
So where ’s the incentive ?
What guys need is a virtually effort - free method of keeping their places tidy , and Bill ’s Inflatable Floating Furniture offers exactly that .
All you have to do to clean up , and we feel almost any guy can do this , is get up .
It ’s as easy as rolling out of bed in the morning ... literally .
Bill ’s mattresses , sofas , chairs and tables are filled with helium and rise to the ceiling when not in use , transforming that apartment from a pigsty into a scaled - down version of the Macy ’s Home Furnishings Department Thanksgiving Day Parade .
A handy tether allows the furniture to be pulled down and used as necessary .
Although Bill ’s technology does not yet apply to such items as dirty dishes , moldy shower curtains and individual dirt molecules ( we assume he ’s working on it ) , we believe his furniture is an excellent start .
We would also , on behalf of guys everywhere , like to applaud him on his use of the phrase " gaseous substance " thirty - three times in the official description of his invention .
Well done , Bill .
Albert ’s Helmet - Mounted Pistol
( Patented 1953 )
For the guy who likes to hunt , but must carry a beer AND a bratwurst at all times .
Gordon ’s Pogo Stick
( Patented 1958 )
A childhood favorite , the pogo stick gradually loses it ’s entertainment value for guys as they grow too large to seriously injure themselves while riding it .
Gordon ’s solution ?
The addition of a self - contained , on - board , combustible - gas - powered engine .
Tom ’s Insect Exerciser
( Patented 1988 )
One guy ’s solution to an often overlooked issue – the gradual decline in physical fitness of our burgeoning insect population .
Harry ’s Homocopter
( Patented 1977 )
No , it ca n’t possibly work , but that did n’t stop Harry from developing this solution to what he calls the “ now - a - days public transportation problem . ”

New York governor Eliot Spitzer is a New World Order minion working to turn America into a third world slave labor gulag .
Big deal .
Eliot Spitzer is a whoremonger , albeit of expensive and , as some would have it , classy whores .
It should be an issue between Spitzer and his wife , not Spitzer and the rest of the world .
It should n’t wreck Spitzer ’s career as a New World Order minion , a water boy for the elite .
It would be much preferable to have Spitzer brought up on treason for selling the country down the river , not for consorting with women hired by the Emperor ’s Club , an international call girl ring .
Recall Eliot Spitzer rubbing elbows with Mexican president Felipe Calderón , the selected candidate of the global elite who screwed López Obrador out of the presidency .
“ In New York City , Mr. Calderón ate at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel with Gov. Eliot Spitzer , who once championed driver ’s licenses for illegal immigrants , an initiative he withdrew under heavy pressure from opponents of illegal immigration .
Mr. Spitzer has endorsed Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , D - N.Y. , ” reports the Dallas Morning News .
Eliot Spitzer was important enough to be included in the Calderón roster along with “ financier ” David Rockefeller , Federal Reserve ( as in Federal Express ) president Timothy Geithner , and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon .
Spitzer is a New World Order stalwart dutifully following the prescribed and scripted agenda , that is the effort to turn the United States into a slave labor gulag , a process well underway with the importation of tens of millions of impoverished illegal immigrants willing to work for poverty wages and displace American workers .
Recall Spitzer equating issuing driver ’s licenses to illegal immigrants to buying a MetroCard .
“ When we walk down into the subway system to buy a MetroCard , no one says , ‘ Prove you are a citizen ’ ; no one says , ‘ Where did you grow up ? ' ” Spitzer told New York 1 News last October .
In other words , for Spitzer , citizenship is not important , it is sort of like taking a ride on the subway .
As should probably be expected , the “ liberal ” New York Times stood behind Spitzer , insisting that all who worried about national security and sovereignty represented “ the new demagogues , ” nativist throwbacks and racists .
Ed Koch sums it up for Real Clear Politics :
The Times ’ position on legalizing the status of illegal aliens in the United States , estimated at between 12 and 20 million , is well known .
They are for it .
The Times prefers to call illegal aliens “ undocumented aliens . ”
Opponents of the governor ’s proposal and those who opposed the Bush , McCain , Kennedy legislation seeking to legitimize the status of illegal aliens and give them amnesty and “ a path to citizenship , ” do not want Governor Spitzer to provide illegal aliens with drivers licenses increasing their ability to obtain jobs which current United States law forbids them to hold .
I do n’t know where Governor Spitzer stood on the Bush - McCain - Kennedy legislation , but I bet he supported it and is doing what he can with The Times to undo the unexpected and enormous defeat suffered by supporters of the self - designated “ Grand Compromise . ”
In fact , the number is closer to 30 million , but let us not dicker over statistics .
Spitzer was simply doing his part to facilitate the “ Grand Compromise , ” in other words the concerted effort to flood America with cheap labor illegal aliens .
It is all part of the plan to merge the United States , Mexico and Canada in a North American union stretching from Prudhoe Bay to Guatemala .
It is about turning America into a third world slave labor gulag , essentially no different than China .
Prostitution and whoremongering are the least of Eliot Spitzer ’s crimes .
“ A poll released late Tuesday found that 70 percent of New Yorkers think Spitzer should resign , while 66 percent believe he should be impeached and removed from office if he doesn’t , ” reports ABC News .
“ Even if Spitzer resigns , 49 percent of New Yorkers said he should face criminal charges . ”
Unfortunately , the folks polled believe Spitzer should be prosecuted for a victimless crime , while ignoring or remaining ignorant of a larger , more more prodigious and damaging crime — selling the nation down the river , compromising its national sovereignty , and turning it into a third world cesspool .

( CNN ) --
After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey 's views on waterboarding , the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge 's nomination for attorney general by a 53 - 40 vote .
Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush 's nominee to lead the Justice Department .
President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales , who resigned in September .
The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance .
Mukasey , a former federal judge in New York , told senators he considers waterboarding " repugnant , " but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture , which U.S. and international law bans .
Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning .
Mukasey 's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens.
Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy .
" The Department of Justice , once the crown jewel among government institutions , is adrift and rudderless , " Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11 - 8 to send Mukasey 's nomination to the Senate floor .
Michael Mukasey Born : 1941 in Bronx , New York Federal judicial service : Judge , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York ; nominated by President Reagan on July 27 , 1987 ; confirmed by the Senate on November 6 , 1987 , and received commission on November 9 , 1987 ; was chief judge , 2000 - 2006 ; assumed senior status in August 2006 ; service terminated in September 2006 due to retirement .
Education : Columbia University , A.B. , 1963 ; Yale Law School , LL.B. , 1967 Professional career : Private practice , New York , 1967 - 1972 ; assistant U.S. attorney , Southern District of New York , 1972 - 1976 ; chief , Official Corruption Unit , 1975 - 1976 ; private practice , New York , 1976 - 1987

" It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person . "
Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president " would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore " it .
Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general .
" Indeed , his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president 's previous attorney general nominees have . "
But Mukasey 's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , the Judiciary Committee 's chairman .
" Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey 's personal assurance that he would enforce a future , new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one , " Leahy said Tuesday .
" Unsaid , of course , is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president . "
However , the committee 's ranking Republican , Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding .
" He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances , " Specter said earlier .
" But he is intelligent ; he 's really learned in the law .
He 's strong , ethical , honest beyond any question .
He 's not an intimate of the president . "
A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture , but some of those say it 's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique , according to a poll released Tuesday .
Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture , more than two - thirds of respondents , or 69 percent , said yes ; 29 percent said no .
Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists , 58 percent said no ; 40 percent said yes .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .

All About Michael Mukasey
In an open letter to Internet service providers published earlier this week , billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban calls for telecoms to put an end to peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing .
Cuban expresses concerns that P2P " freeloaders " are clogging the tubes with commercial content .
His letter does n't focus on piracy , however , and instead primarily attacks companies that use P2P for legitimate commercial applications .
We 're always interested to read the musings of Mr. Cuban , but this time we 're pretty sure he 's missed the point .
" If I was a Comcast customer , I would tell them , as I am now telling all the services I am a customer of : BLOCK P2P TRAFFIC , PLEASE .
As a consumer , I want my Internet experience to be as fast as possible .
The last thing I want slowing my Internet service down are P2P freeloaders , " says Cuban .
" Thats right , P2P content distributors are nothing more than freeloaders .
The only person / organization that benefits from P2P usage are those that are trying to distribute content and want to distribute it on someone else 's bandwidth dime ...
When consumers provide their bandwidth to assist commercial applications , they are subsidizing those commercial applications which if it is n't already , should be against an ISPs terms of service . "
This argument comes from the man who funded Grokster 's legal defense back in the day and invested approximately $ 1.7 million in P2P company Red Swoosh .
Cuban has been focused on the problems of bandwidth to the home for some time , however , telling Ars in 2006 that he is in favor of a tiered Internet .
Strangely , Cuban posted an update on his open letter , encouraging P2P users to use Google Video instead .
" I wanted to offer the best alternative to P2P for audio and video ..... Google Video .
If you are trying to do distribution of audio or video , why in the world would you use P2P when Google Video will host and distribute it very efficiently and for free ? "
Of course , there are many legitimate uses for P2P that Google Video can't replace , like distributing Linux ISOs .
Furthermore , the notion that the only people who benefit from P2P technology are the distributors is wrong .
If I have the option of grabbing a download from a distant single server or from a torrent with hundreds of users , I 'm going to opt for the torrent .
Why ?
It 's almost guaranteed to be faster , and let 's face it : most BitTorrent software is quite adept at managing large downloads .
Perhaps I want to throttle it while playing a game ; perhaps I want to encrypt my transfers .
If I 'm distributing video or audio , perhaps I do n't wish to be bound by the terms of Google Video .
Maybe Mr. Cuban knows something about network architecture that eludes my mental grasp , for I fail to see how using Google Video instead of P2P will make anybody 's Internet connection any faster .
If users who are currently saturating their connections with BitTorrent start saturating their connections with Google Video content , the end result is more or less the same .
And this raises the question : what , exactly , is wrong with users saturating their connections ?
They are , after all , paying for that connectivity , and most ISPs are keen to market their higher - cost , higher - speed services .
Dictating how bandwidth can be used will not make bandwidth any faster or cheaper , nor will attempting to play favorites with what kind of Internet traffic is legit or not .
ST .
ANDREWS , Scotland
The cathedral here , on which work began in the 12th century , was once the largest in Scotland , until a mob of reformers bent on eradicating lavish manifestations of “ Popery ” ransacked the place in 1559 , leaving gulls to swoop through the surviving facade .
Europe ’s cathedrals are indeed “ so inspired , so grand , so empty , ” as Mitt Romney , a Mormon , put it last week in charting his vision of a faith - based presidency .
Some do not survive at all .
The Continent has paid a heavy price in blood for religious fervor and decided some time ago , as a French king put it , that “ Paris is well worth a Mass . ”
Romney , a Republican presidential candidate , was dismissive of European societies “ too busy or too ‘ enlightened ’ to venture inside and kneel in prayer . ”
He thereby pointed to what has become the principal transatlantic cultural divide .
Europeans still take the Enlightenment seriously enough not to put it inside quote marks .
They have long found an inspiring reflection of it in the first 16 words of the American Bill of Rights of 1791 : “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . ”
The ultimate guide to baking an 8 - bit cookie
12-9-07 Introduction
You got invited to the biggest potluck LAN party of the year and you signed up for " dessert . "
What do you do ?
Do you try to make a Metroid jello mold ?
Maybe a Pac - Man cake ?
No my friend , you read this guide and make your very own 8 - bit cookie tray !
This is a great snack for your late night gaming .
It 's also a blast to make .
So what is this now ?
An 8 - bit cookie is just a tray of square cookies that represent the pixels in a classic video game character .
I chose Mario because he 's awesome , and because he 's only 16 pixels high and has only three colors .
This is what the finished product will look like .
Setup Firstly , you have to get a printout of your character .
The best way to do this is to just search for game " sprites . "
Sprites are the little pictures that represented the characters in the old 8 and 16 bit games .
There is a picture for every stance a character can make ( hundreds ) .
People apparently spend a lot of time collecting sprite images .
If you ask me , they should spend their time doing something more productive like making .... cookies .
This is the image I started with .
Cute , innit ?
You then have to find a way to blow the image up .
Most image editing programs will let you blow stuff up , but when you save it , it will compress it and ruin the whole pixelated quality of it .
I ended up opening it in Seashore , blowing it up , then taking a screenshot of the blown up version .
Do it however you want , but you just need a bigger picture ( or a good magnifying glass ) .
Here 's the picture blown up and measured .
You 'll need to count how many pixels of each type you need to make .
This will help you estimate how much dough you 're going to need .
You 'll also need to pick a size for the pixel cookies .
I do n't recommend going under a square inch .
If you try to cut the cookies too small , they 'll just crumble ; make them too big and your Mario will be life - size .
I chose 1.5 " x 1.5 " Making the pixels Dough As far as the dough goes , I suppose you can use anything .
I just went to the local Star Market and got some cookie mix .
The sugar cookie mix is really easy to dye , but you 'll probably want to be more creative with the flavors of some of the colors .
I used sugar cookie for the tan , dyed sugar cookie for the red , and peanut butter cookie for the brown .
There 's no set way to determine exactly how much cookie mix you 'll need .
Look on the back of the packaging for a recipe for a " cookie cake . "
It might give you an idea of how big of a sheet the mix can make .
Just add egg and butter ... I guess I can handle that .
Mix the dough as directed , then spread it out on a greased cookie sheet .
You want to spread it pretty thin and with square edges .
The more square your sheet of dough , the less will go to waste when you start cutting it into pixels .
Here 's the peanut butter cookie dough all spread out .
Dying
If you want to make colored pixels , you can just dye the dough with food coloring before you bake it .
Mmmm ... Propylene Glycol .
Just make sure to mix it in really well .
Baking Baking is n't really a precise process .
My bag said to bake at 350 , for 7 - 8 minutes .
I worried that the dough would burn because it was spread so thin , so I just decided to check on it every few minutes .
The batches all finished somewhere around 8 minutes .
Here 's the peanut butter sheet after baking .
Cutting Originally , I was going to cut the dough with cookie cutters before baking .
I decided this was n't going to work because the cookies would n't be very square after baking .
The best way to cut the dough , I found was using a pizza cutter while the dough was still warm .
Use a tape measure to mark out 1.5 " rows then cut the rows into 1.5 " pieces .
Here 's the sugar cookie sheet that I began cutting .
The pizza cutter did a surprisingly good job of cutting the cookie without crumbling it .
All cut up !
Just repeat this process with all the other flavors and you 're good to go .
Once you have everything good to go , grab a few friends and start assembling .
Assembly Assembly is a pretty self explanatory process , so I 'll just post the pictures .
Yes ... we go to MIT .
SUCCESS !
Looks pretty good .
Consumption
Let the destruction begin .
I hope this does n't hurt .
Mario gives us his best Pac - Man impression .
After he got his leg bitten off by a pirana plant , mario had to use a peg leg .
And here are poor Mario 's remains .
If only he had one more 1 - Up ... Conclusion
This cookie was a blast to make .
It only took about 3 hours total , and the result was beautiful .
I really was n't expecting it to work out as well as it did , but it was a pleasant surprise .
If you make your own 8 - bit cookie , send in pictures , I 'd love to see them and I 'll put them on the site .
Here 's a Mario sponge cake sent in by Ethan who claims that making 8 - bit snacks is " much more fun than studying . "
I 'd have to agree .
Update !
4/12/08 So , my dorm had a cookie bake - off and myself and two of my hall - mates decided to enter a cookie .
I 'll give you a hint :
He comes to town .
We entered this guy in a few categories including most interesting use of an unusual ingredient ( pixels ) , most foreign ( Hyrule ) , and most massive ( 30x32 inches ) .
We ended up taking home most massive and the prize money was just enough to cover the cost of the ingredients !
Link was a little larger than Mario .
In addition to his body having more pixels , we made each pixel 2 inches instead of 1.5 .
The green and white were sugar cookies and the brown was chocolate ( all made from scratch ! ) .

08/09/09
I just got an email from Charlet who made a sweet Mario cookie cake for her boyfriend 's 25th birthday .
Here 's what she had to say :
Dear Mike ,
I found your site during a google search for Mario Cookie Cakes .
I made one for my boyfriend 's 25th birthday .
It was a 1984 themed party so we had to have Mario .
I loved your idea and took it to the next level .
My boyfriend also wanted the jumping Mario .
Instead of dying the cookies I dyed the frosting I made instead of the cookies .
It took way longer and was a ' bit ' of a struggle but in the end it turned out great !
We had three different flavored cookies for each color Peanut Butter for Red , Sugar for Skin , and Chocolate chip for Brown .
Chocolate chip was awful to cut !
All cookies and frosting were homemade .
( baking is one of my " many talents " haha )
Hope you enjoy this , thanks for posting yours , it 's a brilliant idea and was a great success !!
Charlet
Thanks for writing Charlet , the cookie cake looks great !
Update !
09/29/09 I got another cookie picture this time from Stephie .
She writes :
After coming across your 8 - bit Mario and Link , I decided to bake a 16 - bit cookie Ness with some friends for my boyfriend 's birthday cake .
Thanks for the idea !
- Stephie
Wow , breaking into the 16 bit era .
I wonder if Moore 's Law applies to cookies ...
Very impressive !
Coincidences can crop up in the strangest places .
While Peter Hughes , an accountant from Birkenhead , was at a church service , his eye fell on the board showing the list of hymn numbers for the service .
They were 16 , 37 , 428 and 590 .
Mathematicians naturally look on numbers as a goldmine for distraction , maybe seeking to combine them to form an equation , or noting how many are primes .
In this case , Peter observed something particularly curious : all ten digits appear exactly once !
How likely is that , he wondered ?
His initial back - of - the - envelope estimate indicated that the chance might be about 1 in 6,000 .
He then sought our comments .
Working out the odds : start with common sense
This is a nice example of a coincidence from everyday life .
Whenever you attempt to work out the chance of such a coincidence , it 's necessary to make a number of common sense assumptions , and then to build a mathematical model to come up with a sensible answer .
Here , the chance will depend on how many hymns are available , how many are chosen , and what the selection process is .
Hymns are generally numbered consecutively from to .
Let 's suppose for simplicity that was about 1,000 ; in fact it helps the calculations below if we take , and we know that , on this occasion , exactly four hymns were chosen for the service .
That latter condition is central : fewer than four hymns makes Peter 's observation impossible if , while more than four hymns would make it overwhelmingly likely that they would contain more than ten digits .
So it was fortunate that Peter was at a four - hymn service , or he might never have happened upon this coincidence at all — though as we 'll see , what he witnessed was still exceptionally unusual .
Do the calculations
The hymn lottery — what are the odds ?
Now for the calculations .
First , we need to estimate the chance that the four hymn numbers contain exactly ten digits .
Then we need to work out the chance that every digit is different .
In our book of 999 hymns , every number will have either one , two or three digits .
The only combinations that give a total of ten digits are and .
If the hymns are chosen at random , the chances of a hymn number having 1 , 2 or 3 digits will be 9/999 , 90/999 and 900/999 respectively .
Swallow hard , assume all four selections are made independently , and it emerges that the two combinations noted have respective chances 0.0263 and 0.0395 , meaning that the overall chance of exactly ten digits is around 0.066 , about 1 in 15 .
( Got stuck ?
Find out how this was worked out ) .
Given the hymns have ten digits in total , what is the chance they are all different ?
If all digits were equally likely , the chance of them all being different would be , where stands for .
This is approximately equal to 0.00036 .
( Stuck again ?
Here 's the answer . )
We 'll call this quantity , so .
Putting the two calculations together , our first estimate for the overall chance is , in round figures in .
So Peter 's back - of - the - envelope figure looks like a substantial underestimate !
Refining the model
Our simple model has obvious deficiencies .
For example :
The number zero will arise less frequently than other digits , maybe 2/3 as often ;
Some hymns are far more , or less , popular than others ; Christmas carols , doubtless numbered consecutively in a hymnbook , will never be selected for most of the year .
Other blocks of hymns will be used only at baptisms , Easter , Harvest etc. ;
For hymnbooks in which , the frequencies of 1 , 2 or 3 digit numbers will be different from those assumed ;
The numbers chosen can't be completely independent , as they are drawn from a finite population without replacement — and other factors may affect the independence assumption too .
Point 3 is a reminder that we should explicitly assume that the service in question is a standard Sunday service , and not at Christmas , for example .
The impacts of these refinements do not all work in the same direction !
Whenever the digits are not all equally likely , that reduces the chance that they are all different .
For example , as well as there being fewer zeros , if the carols are numbered ( say ) 425 to 488 , then removing them from the selection available to the vicar would dramatically decrease the frequency of digit 4 .
On the other hand , if there are fewer than 999 hymns , or if that block of carol numbers is cast aside , the frequency of three - digit numbers will decrease , making it more likely that four hymns will have exactly ten digits .
Selecting all the hymns from one short section of the book would make Peter 's observation virtually impossible , but deliberately spreading them uniformly over the book would increase the chance .
So suppose the true frequency that digit is selected is .
Then each number lies between 0 and 1 , and the sum to 1 .
To make our calculations easier , we write , where the numbers sum to .
Now , selecting ten digits independently , the chance they are all different is
which we write as After a bit of manipulation this approximates well towhich we will write as
How much does it affect the answer if the ten digits are not equally likely ?
Take and assume hymn numbers are chosen at random .
For each digit , calculate its frequency among numbers with one , two or three digits respectively , and weight these appropriately : for all digits except zero , the frequency is
What 's Christmas times Easter minus baptism ?
while for zero we have Here is some help on this .

Thus , andfor , so that , reducing the estimate of the chance we seek by some .
The impact of zero being less frequent than the other digits is much less than you might suppose !
Now suppose that 100 of the three - digit numbers are eliminated , either because they are carols or hymns for other special occasions like Easter or baptism , or because the book has fewer than 999 hymns .
The chances of the hymn numbers having 1 , 2 or 3 digits are then , and which leads to the chances of the two combinations having exactly ten digits , on the same assumptions as before , being increased to and .
The overall chance of four hymns having ten digits is estimated as , about higher than before !
Overall , unless the number of hymns is radically different from 1000 , or a substantial number of them would be selected only on special occasions , the joint impact of these refinements is very little : we still offer 1 in 40,000 as the ball - park chance of Peter 's observation for a random Sunday .
Simulations
There is another way of estimating the chance of a coincidence such as this one , namely to do a computer simulation .
Select four hymns at random with the carols deleted , and repeat the exercise ten million times .
We chose the Methodist Hymnbook ( 1933 ) , which has hymns , with the Carols numbered 117 to 143 ; and on just 245 occasions in that simulation , all ten digits appeared exactly once .
So our estimate of the chance from this simulation is about 1 in 40,800 , gratifyingly close to the earlier calculations .
This suggests that , if you attend 40 " ordinary " services per year , you might expect to wait about 1000 years before sharing Peter 's experience .
That 's a heck of a lot of sermons to sit through !
More coincidences
There 's bound to be a coincidence in here , somewhere .
There is a different way of looking at coincidence questions such as this one .
Peter 's email would have seemed just as interesting if he had said : " All four hymns were prime numbers " ( the chance of this is actually about 1 in 1,000 , depending on the hymnbook ) .
And it might have been even more interesting if the hymn numbers had been 11 , 22 , 111 and 222 for example .
So while the chance of one particular interesting coincidence was 1 in 40,000 , the chance of some unspecified interesting coincidence in the numbers will be considerably higher , and impossible to calculate .
Indeed , as David Wells ' famous Dictionary of curious and interesting numbers makes clear , the vast majority of numbers between 1 and 1,000 are curious or interesting in their different ways , making the chance of a mathematician finding something of interest in next Sunday 's hymn list something close to 100 % !

ADDIS ABABA ( Reuters ) -
There is clear evidence of “ ethnic cleansing ” in Kenya ’s Rift Valley since a disputed December 27 election , but it does not amount to genocide , the top U.S. diplomat for Africa said on Wednesday .
“ There has been an organised effort to push out people from Rift Valley ... It is clearly ethnic cleansing .
I do n’t consider it genocide , ” U.S. Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer told reporters .
“ The cycle of retaliation has gone too far and has become more dangerous . ”
Kenya ’s sudden slide into chaos -- with more than 850 people killed mostly in ethnic violence -- has horrified world powers , damaged the region ’s most promising economy and shattered its image as a stable trade and tourism hub .
Frazer said the United States wanted an investigation into the violence , including the killing of civilians by police , and said guilty parties must be held accountable .
She called on Kenyan leaders to avoid inflammatory rhetoric .
The United States backs mediation being led by former U.N. chief Kofi Annan , between President Mwai Kibaki and opposition challenger Raila Odinga , she said .
Formal mediation started on Tuesday .
“ We are advocating some kind of power - sharing and some kind of coalition government , ” she said , adding that there also needed to be constitutional and land reform to address deep - seated grievances between Kenya ’s ethnic groups .
Post - election protests have descended into cycles of killing between tribes who have never reconciled divisions over land , wealth and power dating back to British colonial rule .
Annan said he was confident that the “ immediate political issues ” could be resolved within four weeks and the broader issues underlying the crisis within a year .
Frazer said she planned to consult African leaders meeting in Addis Ababa this week on the way forward , and warned that Kenya may find a solution imposed if it does n’t solve its own problems .
“ We ’ll find an international mechanism if they ca n’t find it internally , ” she said .
Western donors have urged both sides to take Annan ’s efforts seriously or risk losing development aid .
The United States , which considers Kenya a major regional ally , has no plans to cut aid , she said .
“ The vast majority of U.S. aid is for HIV and malaria eradication , ” distributed by non-governmental organisations , she said .
“ It would be counterproductive to stop this aid . ”
PM Lee said he wanted Singapore to remain conservative
The plan was part of a wider reform of sex laws , many dating from the British colonial era half a century ago .
The chamber passed a bill legalising oral and anal sex for the first time , but only between heterosexuals .
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the government did not consider gays to be a minority with minority rights .
In a rare speech to parliament , he said Singapore was a conservative society , and he wanted to keep it so .
Tuesday 's vote means Singapore 's anti-gay law 377A remains , although prosecutions are rare .
Under the legislation , a man caught committing an act of " gross indecency " with another man could be jailed for up to two years .
Updated Shhh !
Can you hear a hiss ?
That 's the sound of naughty facts deflating the social networking balloon a tad .
Whisper it , but numbers from web analytics outfit comScore have confirmed what the chatter in bars and cafes has been saying for months - people are , just , well , bored of social networks .
The average length of time users spend on all of the top three sites is on the slide .
Bebo , MySpace and Facebook all took double - digit percentage hits in the last months of 2007 .
December could perhaps be forgiven as a seasonal blip when people see their real friends and family , but the trend was already south .
The story year - on - year is even uglier for social networking advocates .
Bebo and MySpace were both well down on the same period in 2006 - Murdoch 's site by 24 per cent .
Facebook meanwhile chalked up a rise , although way off its mid-2007 hype peak when you could n't move for zeitgeist - chasing " where 's the Facebook angle ? " stories in the press and on TV .
You can survey the full numerical horror for youself here at Creative Capital .
That " user engagement " is dropping off ( page impression growth is merely slowing ) should be of particular concern for the sales people struggling to turn these free services into profit - making businesses .
In the age of tabbed browsing , how long people stick around is particularly key for " interactive " sites , where people are n't attracted by useful information , but by time - wasting opportunities .
And as we 've noted here before , if the cash is n't raining down on you you need a " phenomenal " growth line to sell credulous reporters and investors .
Expansion into non-English speaking countries is viewed as such a panacea for the increasingly obvious slowdown US social networks are suffering ( see Facebook 's trawl for translation bitches ) .
The fact is that web users people are just as fickle in Leipzig as they are in London , and it seems to us that a delayed Friends Reunited ( remember that ? ) effect is kicking in .
When Friends Reunited enjoyed its " phenomenal " growth period people would join , log in maybe a dozen times , catch up with those class mates they wanted to , then forget about it .
On Facebook behaviour seems much the same ; join , accumulate dozens of semi-friends , spy on a few exes for a bit , play some Scrabulous , get bored , then get on with your life , occasionally dropping in to respond to a message or see some photos that have been posted .
Similarly , once the novelty of MySpace wears off , most people only stop by to check out bands or watch videos .
They 've basically developed a way to add a penny - scraping coda to the Friends Reunited pattern , thanks to diversions that have been enabled by broadband .
The biggest difference is that Friends Reunited made easy profit because it did n't give all its features away to users for free .
This time around , expect spinners to work on massaging the comScore figures , and happy - clappy bloggers to leap to social networking 's defence by claiming the falls are sign of the market maturing , and of fierce competition .
They could be right , but it still means that the individual businesses are not the goldmine their greedy backers slavered over .
For example , despite his endearing deployment of rubber sandals in public , Mark Zuckerberg is yet to convince marketeers - the only people who are ever going to pay him for access to Facebook - that the popularity of his site heralds the next 100 years of media .
And the " widget economy " , where developers cobble together web applications in the hope of grabbing their own slice of the riches social networking 's massive personal data warehouses promised ?
Well the business model for Rock You pretty much sums it up .
The startup , that owns the number three Facebook App " Super Wall " , only sells advertising to other Facebook App developers .
Ted Dziuba of the recently - departed , much - missed blog Uncov put it best : " Fuck , this is a pyramid scheme .
There is no money input into this system except venture capital .
" I remember a time , long long ago , when tech companies spent their own venture capital on each other , so revenues were all booked from the same small pool of money .
Yeah , as I recall , it did n't end well . "
We 're not suggesting that social networking sites are totally useless or are going to disappear anytime soon ( Friends Reunited is still around ?
Who knew ! ) - they 're a boon for prying journalists and recruiters for sure , and damn it , Scrabble is a good game .
But today 's shocking confirmation that their " phenomenal " growth is n't impervious to human nature does make the $ 15bn valuation Microsoft slapped on Facebook when it paid $ 240 m for 1.6 per cent equity seem even more preposterous , if it were possible .
It 's an oft - quoted fact among social networking sceptics , but it 's worth reminding ourselves for perspective that Ford - y'know , the massive international automotive conglomerate with massive physical assets , customers who stay loyal over decades and truly global reach - is valued at less than $ 15bn on Wall Street . ®
Update
Details Facebook 's financial status have emerged overnight at AllthingsD .
The firm 's net cash flow was negative $ 150 m in 2007 , it 's reported .
Earlier this week , four United States Senators did not think that a new game , Manhunt 2 , was not sufficiently rated high enough and may even be bought by the children .
Those four Senators decided to write the Entertainment Software Rating Board , private agency set up by the video game makers to self - regulate their products .
The demands of the Senators are :
The senators would like to see more transparency from the ESRB : “ What information is provided back to developers after receiving a rating ?
Why is information regarding rating changes or reasons for decisions unavailable , except for content descriptors , to the public ? ” reads the letter .
The letter also cites the leak of the AO - rated version by a Sony employee and subsequent unlocking of some of the AO - content on the PSP version , as well as the “ realistic motions ” used to kill characters in the game on the Nintendo Wii , as evidence that the ESRB should reevaluate its rating process .
“ [ W ]e ask your consideration of whether it is time to review the robustness , reliability , and repeatability of your rating process , particularly for this genre of ‘ ultra - violent ’ video games and the advances in game controllers , ” concludes the letter .
I ’m not sure how dense the Senators are , but usually the content description is usually enough to determine if a game is suitable or not suitable for children .
Even people who go for Pokemon GBA and NDS roms know enough about the content involved to know if it is fine for their children or not .
You would n’t let a child play games rated for teenagers and above ?
Like League of Legends , for instance , many older teens and adults enjoy Unranked Smurfs on the game but that does n’t mean its suitable for children because of cartoon violence .
If a game ’s description says that there ’s violence with blood splattering all over and if a parent does n’t want their child exposed to that right now , the parent probably wo n’t buy that particular game .
Instead , children can hop online onto free gaming sites like Construct ( which will save the parents a lot of money ) and play games that are n’t so violent , while parents can read the article they wrote for reassurance that these games can be trusted .
However , our wonderful Senators believe we are morons who need to be taken care of by the government .
Also , although the letter did threaten the ESRB with government takeover implicitly but the letter itself is a statement that these Senators think that video game content is enough of an issue that they ’re more than willing to take it over from the ESRB if they do not meet the prudish standards of our Senators .
Just which four Senators think this is such an important issue :
Signed by Sen. Evan Bayh ( D - IN ) , Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , Sen. Sam Brownback ( R- KS ) , and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - NY )
Of course “ protecting ” the children is not the issue for these four , it ’s power and control over what you can and ca n’t see and play on your computer .
Finally , today is “ Black Friday ” so when you ’re shopping , piss off a Senator today .
' RACE TIFF WON'T SPLIT DEMS ' 'RACE TIFF WON'T SPLIT DEMS '
Any dispute over race between the Democratic presidential candidates is on its way to resolution , former President Bill Clinton said Tuesday on the Rev. Al Sharpton 's radio show .
" Both Hillary ( Rodham Clinton ) and Sen. ( Barack ) Obama issued very conciliatory statements .
So I think we 're well on the way to getting back together , " he said of the tensions that arose following his wife 's comments about Martin Luther King Jr. Some in the black community objected after Hillary Clinton said it took President Lyndon B. Johnson , a white politician , to finally realize King 's dream of racial equality by signing the Civil Rights Act .
Others were displeased with the former president 's remark in New Hampshire about Obama telling a " fairy tale " in his opposition to the Iraq war .
The former president told Sharpton that , with a black man and a woman at the forefront of the contest , it was " a happy moment " for everyone in the party .
He predicted that , by the time of the nominating convention in Denver in late August , Democrats would be presenting a united front .
Source : Associated Press SPARKS , Nev. ( AP )  Bill Clinton , who carried Nevada in two general elections , urged voters Tuesday to buck labor endorsements for Sen.
Barack Obama and support his wife in Saturday 's hotly contested presidential caucuses as the only Democratic candidate with the experience necessary to change the country .
The former president trumpeted New York Sen. Hillary Clinton 's accomplishments while painting Obama as the " establishment " candidate who would bring only the " feeling of change . "
" One candidate says you should vote for me because I 've not been involved at all in the struggles of the past and therefore we need to turn over a new leaf and ( try ) something absolutely new .
And if you want the feeling of change , then that is the person you should support , " Clinton said in a 75 - minute speech to about 300 people in a YMCA gymnasium .
" The other candidate says vote for me because I spent a lifetime making change , raising hopes and fulfilling dreams for other people , " he said about the former first lady .
In a speech to nearly 2,000 people in neighboring Reno on Monday , Obama portrayed himself as the candidate for change , his campaign 's theme from the onset .
" You got to ask yourself , ' Who is best equipped to bring about this change you are hoping for ? " said Obama , who later campaigned in Fallon and Carson City .
" I know how hard it is going to be to provide health care to every American .
... to fix our schools or reduce poverty .
I know because I fought these fights , " the former civil rights lawyer said .
After trailing Hillary Clinton by a 2 - 1 margin in Nevada as recently as November , a poll published this week showed Obama had moved into a virtual tie with her and former Sen. John Edwards .
Buoyed by an endorsement from the largest union in the state , Obama had 32 % , Clinton 30 % and Edwards 27 % , according to the poll conducted for the Reno Gazette - Journal with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
Bill Clinton said he talked with many of the 60,000 - member Culinary Union 's rank - and - file who intend to ignore the endorsement and vote for his wife .
" In this case the establishment organization is with him and the insurgents are with her , " Clinton said in his speech .
He then asked for a show of hands from about 50 precinct captains in the audience and challenged them to stand up to the union 's leadership .
" They think they 're better than you are at identifying and physically getting people to their caucus sites .
And I bet they 're wrong , " he said to cheers .
Among the Democratic candidates remaining , Sen. Clinton is the only one " with a record of consistently passing important bills with the support of Republicans , " Bill Clinton said .
" We can not pass health care reform and we cannot pass energy reform without some Republican votes in the Senate , " he said .
" When she was in the White House , she worked with Republicans to double the number of kids moving out of foster homes .
She has always been able to do this . "
Bill Clinton continued the theme of " change " in a speech later Tuesday to about 500 people at a fire station in Carson City .
Suggesting the Democratic race is down to his wife and Obama , he said the party appears to be ready to make history by nominating either its first African American or first woman .
" Hillary has an enormous amount of African American support and Barack Obama has a lot of white people for him , " he said in Sparks .
" There 's still some African Americans who support Barack , even though they like Hillary , because they think he is the first African American to have a chance to be president , " Clinton said .
" And there 's a lot of women who are voting for Hillary , even though they like Sen.
Obama , because they think it would be better if a woman broke the glass ceiling . "
Edwards and Sen. Clinton both planned campaign appearance in Reno on Wednesday .
Sens. Clinton and Obama also planned to appear on Friday in Elko .

Joseph Pujol , a man of singular talent , was born in Marseilles , France in 1857 .
In his early youth it became clear that he was a natural entertainer , singing , dancing , and performing for his parents ’ house guests .
He had a love for music , and over the years he became handy with a trombone , but it was a different wind instrument that led to his eventual fame and fortune .
Young Joseph became alarmed one day when he was swimming in the sea , and took a deep breath before submerging .
As he inhaled , he felt icy cold water entering through his rear end .
He immediately returned to shore , and was astonished to see a great deal of seawater pouring from his backside .
A doctor assured him that this was nothing to be concerned about , and it seems that Joseph took this advice to heart , exploring his strange new ability with a healthy curiosity .
He soon found that with a little abdominal control , he could deliberately suck water in through his anus , and project it back out with impressive force , creating a spout of several meters .
Further experimentation led him to discover that he could also suck in large amounts of air if he contorted himself properly , which he could let out at will .
He was also able to use varying pressures to produce distinct notes , allowing him to reproduce simple tunes .
Needless to say , he became very popular at school as a result .
But little did he know that this unique talent would one day make him the most well - known and most highly paid entertainer in all of France .
While Joseph was in the army he amused his fellow soldiers with his lowbrow tricks , and they gave him the nickname “ Le Pétomane , ” which translates roughly to “ fartiste . ”
When he left the service he opened a bakery in Marseilles which was reputed to bake some of the finest bran muffins in the south of France , but he started a foray into show business when he began to feel restless .
At first he resisted using his unique physiology in his stage comedy act , instead trying the “ yokel with the trombone ” routine , but the fartiste within him could not be contained .
The Moulin Rouge ca. 1923
In 1887 at age 30 , “ Le Pétomane ” first took the stage in Marseilles .
The initial attempt was met with some skepticism , since “ petomanie ” ( or “ fartistry ” ) was something of a novelty for the French .
But he quickly won the audience over , and was a big success .
He developed his act locally for about five years , then went on to Paris to try for the infamous Moulin Rouge .
He succeeded .
“ Ladies and gentlemen , I have the honor to present a session of Petomanie . ”
Such was his introduction at the famous vanity theater on his first night .
He was very finely dressed in a red coat and black satin breeches , with a pair of white gloves held in his hands .
He looked quite sophisticated as he explained to the audience that the emissions he was about to produce were completely odorless , since he irrigated his colon daily .
The audience was completely unprepared for what lay ahead .
And so he began .
He started off with a series of fart impressions … a new bride ’s timid toot ; her noisy , flapping emissions a week later ; the solid , booming fart of a miller ; and a majestic ten - second - long helping of flatulence to wrap up his introduction .
He did impressions of famous people , he played songs , and he blew out candles .
He did imitations of cannon fire , and reenacted a thunderstorm .
And that was just the first portion of the show .
At first , the audience was astonished at the bizarre spectacle .
But when the first uncontrollable laughter erupted from the crowd , it quickly spread throughout the theater .
Soon the men and women were completely paralyzed with laughter , with tears streaming down their cheeks .
A number of women passed out , unable to breathe in their tightly bound corsets , and had to be escorted from the theater by nurses .
For the second part of his act , he stepped offstage and inserted a rubber tube into his orifice , which dangled out of a hole in the back of his trousers .
His used the tube to smoke two cigarettes at once , one from each end ; to blow out the flames of stage lights ; and as a grand finale , he attached an ocarina to the end of the hose , and played popular tunes while inviting the audience to sing along .
Overnight , Le Pétomane was a huge success .
He used his unique physiology to entertain in this way for years , eventually becoming the highest paid entertainer in all of France , and perhaps the world .
He parted ways with the Moulin Rouge in 1895 when the owner of the theater sued him for breach of contract after he fart - serenaded a few people in public , but he was quickly replaced by a female , bellows - powered fraud … La Femme - Pétomane .
Joseph opened a theater of his own and enjoyed many more years of success , until two of his sons were disabled in World War 1 in 1914 .
At that point he gave up the stage and went back to baking , and let his rectum content itself with more conventional pursuits .
He died , aged 88 years , in 1945 .
When a medical school in Paris requested the privilege of examining the late Le Pétomane ’s famous anus , the family declined , stating , “ there are some things in this life which simply must be treated with reverence . ”
Though Le Pétomane was perhaps the most famous fartiste , he was not the first to ply the farting trade … professional flatulism has a long and rich history throughout the world .
In the De Civitate Dei , written about halfway through the first century A.D. , Saint Augustine mentions some performers who possessed “ such command of their bowels , that they can break wind continuously at will , so as to produce the effect of singing . ”
As other examples , medieval Ireland had professional farters called “ braigetori , ” and the Japanese Kamakura period ( 1185 –1333 ) had professional performers of fart dances called Oribe .
A contemporary flatulist , perhaps the only representative of his trade today , is Mr. Methane .
He clearly lacks Le Pétomane ’s class , but he can certainly break a wind .
Dressing in a cape and mask , he has the appearance of a superhero ( or supervillain ) , though whether the force of his farts is sufficient to allow him flight is doubtful .
But be warned , if you spend much time reading his website , your world will turn pink .
( The word “ fart ” occurs 13 times in this article ) .
Why did the Federal Open Market Committee drop its official target rate for overnight bank loans on October 31 ?
If it was a plan to head off a stock market sell - off , it went awry .
The Dow fell by 362 points on November 1 .
The obvious answer is that the FOMC feared a turndown in the economy .
But minor decreases in the federal funds rate will not head off the recession .
Greenspan ’s boom is turning into Bernanke ’s bust .
A fraction of a percentage point ’s decline will not alter the economic fundamentals .
In August , the Dow fell by over 10 % .
A rebound came only because investors believed that Bernanke ’s tough talk to Congress about the reasonably strong economy was so much piffle .
They believed Jim Cramer ’s August tirade .
They also believed that Cramer and his peers would get the ear of the FOMC , no matter what Bernanke says about an independent Federal Reserve System .
The FED may be legally independent of Congress .
It is not independent of the howls of agony from Cramer and his peers .
The Supreme Court follows the election returns , as Mr. Dooley said so long ago .
Similarly , the FED follows the stock market .
Why should the FED care ?
Because the FED is the front for the banking cartel .
The banks have loaned money by the hundreds of billions to borrowers who then put the money into arcane debt instruments that are now visibly unraveling .
The bankers have no clue as to how they can get their money back if these debt instruments become insolvent .
These instruments are part of the carry trade : borrowed short and lent long .
This is what brought down the savings and loan industry in the 1980’s .
It threatens to bring down the banks today .
So , Bernanke must talk calmly to Congress in order not to spread panic .
He must also take symbolic steps to keep Jim Cramer from going on TV and throwing another tantrum .
Why ?
Because if Cramer is scared , his capital management peers are scared .
If his peers are scared , investors who bankroll these carry trade schemes will stop putting in their money .
This will end the trade .
The banks will then get stiffed .
This almost happened in 1998 .
The New York FED called in the major banks that had lent Long Term Capital Management its money , which LTCM then had used as margin money in the futures market .
The FED strongly suggested that the banks pony up another $ 3.5 billion to keep LTCM from being forced to unload their positions at fire sale prices .
The banks did what was suggested .
This time , the FED is not facing one lone company whose leveraged positions have gone south .
The FED is facing an entire segment of the U.S. capital market , which soon may not be able to raise money to keep its CDO ( collateralized debt obligation ) projects officially solvent .
As long as these projects are solvent , the banks do n’t have to write off the loans .
The banks are in a situation eerily similar to the Japanese banks in 1992 .
They are sitting on top of visibly bad loans , but they are allowed by bank regulators to keep these bad loans on their books at face value .
This lets them stay in the lending business .
BERNANKE HAS SOUNDED NO ALARM
Let me review briefly what should be familiar to you .
On October 15 , he declared confidently ,
It does seem that , together with our earlier actions to enhance liquidity , the September policy action has served to reduce some of the pressure in financial markets , although considerable strains remain .
From the perspective of the near - term economic outlook , the improved functioning of financial markets is a positive development in that it increases the likelihood of achieving moderate growth with price stability .
He said he was worried about the “ moral hazard ” problem : the creation of an expectation that the FED will protect investors ’ assets .
He did not want the FED to convey the wrong impression .
There would be no “ Bernanke put ” to bail out a falling stock market .
However , in such situations , one must also take seriously the possibility that policy actions that have the effect of reducing stress in financial markets may also promote excessive risk - taking and thus increase the probability of future crises .
As I indicated in earlier remarks , it is not the responsibility of the Federal Reserve — nor would it be appropriate — to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions .
Yet what the FOMC did on October 31 is nothing less than a stock market bailout “ to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions . ”
The market had been rising for two weeks .
In an October 26 report issued by MarketWatch , we read :
Investors widely expect that the U.S. Federal Reserve will lower its federal funds rate from 4.75 % .
Markets have fully priced in a quarter - percentage rate cut at next week ’s Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting , and some believe another half - point cut is possible .
“ A 25 - basis point rate cut is the consensus expectation for next week ’s FOMC , according to our survey median , as well as the Fed funds futures market , ” wrote analysts at Action Economics .
“ We do n’t believe another rate cut is necessary at all , though the lack of protests from policymakers to consensus expectations of a rate cut probably makes the move a fait accompli , ” they said .
But , Bernanke asked rhetorically , what if , in certain special cases , the financial markets look as though they are coming unglued ?
Then the FED will act .
But developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets , and the Federal Reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy .
In particular , as I have emphasized , the Federal Reserve has a mandate from the Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices , and its monetary policy actions will be chosen so as to best meet that mandate .
The FED acted .
Conclusion : “ economic effects felt by many outside the markets ” were about to become very painful .
The next day , they became painful , to the tune of 362 points .
What was his concern ?
Officially , the FED ’s mandate “ to promote maximum employment and stable prices . ”
But prices have been stable : rising more slowly than a year ago .
So , that was not the problem facing the FED .
This leaves “ maximum employment . ”
That means economic growth .
But has n’t he assured everyone that there is no problem here ?
Of course he has .
He has smooth - talked Congress in a way that Greenspan did n’t .
He has talked clearly about an economy that is not facing a setback .
Then why did the FOMC cut rates ?
Twice ?
The FED is trapped by the stock market , with Cramer as its vocal spokesman .
He called for a “ Bernanke put ” back in August , and Bernanke gave it to him .
Twice .
Bernanke is acting as all FED chairmen and all FOMCs act .
He cut rates when there was a mere 10 % decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .
Stock market bulls discounted a quarter - point cut .
They bought shares .
Why ?
On the assumption that the FOMC would cut the FedFunds rate .
This forced the FOMC ’s hand .
It did exactly what the forecasters had said it would , and had run up the market in anticipation .
Let ’s look at the press release that accompanied the FOMC ’s action .
Economic growth was solid in the third quarter , and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance .
However , the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term , partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction .
Today ’s action , combined with the policy action taken in September , should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time .
What is the focus here ?
The financial markets , not the underlying economy , which is said to be “ solid . ”
This is consistent with the FED ’s real purpose in life : to protect the banking cartel .
The banking cartel has loaned a lot of money to the financial markets .
The symbol of these markets is Merrill Lynch , which just lost $ 8 billion in subprime loans and whose chairman is about the get fired ( and take away $ 159 million for his trouble ) .
The press release continued :
Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year , but recent increases in energy and commodity prices , among other factors , may put renewed upward pressure on inflation .
In this context , the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain , and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully .
“ Some inflation risks remain . ”
This was Greenspan ’s mantra .
He said it over and over for 18 years .
Then the FOMC increased the money supply , year by year , so that consumer prices had doubled by the time Greenspan returned to the land of the coherent .
So , as it turned out , his warning was right .
It was a warning against his policies .
The Committee judges that , after this action , the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth .
The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth .
Interpretation : “ The committee has n’t any idea what it will do . ”
This statement is seen as some sort of semi-assurance not to reduce the target rate again .
It is no such thing .
It is the FED ’s standard “ we continue to keep all options on the table . ”
The vote was 8 to 1 .
THE OUTSIDE PRESSURE TO INFLATE
On August 20 , Bloomberg ran a story on Bernanke that went straight to his academic ego .
It described him as a rookie .
Federal Reserve policy makers , who declared that inflation was their paramount challenge just two weeks ago , have been forced to make financial - market stability the trigger for changes in interest rates .
By lowering the discount rate and issuing a statement conceding threats to the economy , Federal Open Market Committee members effectively ripped up the economic - outlook statement from their Aug. 7 meeting .
Some economists describe the about - face , coming after months of assurances that the subprime - mortgage rout was contained , as Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’s first serious error since taking office last year .
“ It was a rookie mistake , ” said Kenneth Thomas , a lecturer in finance at the University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School in Philadelphia .
The Fed “ underestimated liquidity needs ” of investors and the fallout from the housing recession , he said , adding , “ This demonstrates the difference between book - smart and street - smart . ”
The spin was obvious .
Bernanke , as an academic , was holding to a moderately inflationary policy , not goosing the stock market with a rate cut .
What an academic thing to do , what with Jim Cramer going berserk and everything .
What Bernanke needed to do was listen to the likes of Jim Cramer .
Then , again , maybe it really was a crisis .
“ Sometimes , the dynamics change very , very quickly , ” said former Fed governor Laurence Meyer , who voted for the three reductions in 1998 after currencies in Asia , Russia and Latin America tumbled .
Bernanke ’s shift “ tells us how difficult it is to translate financial turbulence into the macroeconomic forecast . ”
The piling - on continued .
Martin Feldstein , a Harvard University economist , testified to FED members at their all - expense - paid annual retreat at Jackson Hole , Wyoming .
Feldstein is a heavy hitter .
He is the CEO of the private research organization , the National Bureau of Economic Research .
It is this august body that announces in retrospect years later when a recession began and ended .
He was also Reagan ’s early Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
He told the FED audience that it was time to lower the FedFunds target rate .
A Bloomberg report summarized his message .
The economy could suffer a very serious downturn .
. . .
A sharp reduction in the interest rate , in addition to a vigorous lender - of - last - resort policy , would attenuate that very bad outcome .
He called for a cut to 4.25 % .
That would have been a major cut , for the rate was at 5.25 % .
Bernanke was n’t in the room to hear this , but other FED members were .
Feldstein outlined a “ triple threat ” from housing : a “ sharp decline ” in home prices and construction ; higher borrowing costs and a “ freeze ” in credit markets stemming from subprime - mortgage losses ; and fewer home - equity loans and refinanced mortgages , leading to less consumer spending .
Bernanke blinked .
He buckled .
He rolled over and played dead .
He and the FOMC lowered the target rate to 4.75 % .
Then they did it again .
What thanks did they get ?
None .
The next day , the Dow fell by 362 points .
Once again , the rule holds : “ Buy on the rumor .
Sell on the news . ”
CONCLUSION
The economy is facing the prospects of drip - drip - drip bad news from the housing sector .
It is also facing similar bad news from what I call the carry - trade sector : borrowed short , lent long .
The lure of Greenspan ’s low interest rates did to the domestic debt market what the lure of Japan ’s low interest rates did to the worldwide bond market .
The smart money borrowed short and bought long - term income streams .
Now the flow of short - term money has stopped because of fear regarding the solvency of the organizations created to serve as the middlemen .
Because the reduced flow of investment money into subprime mortgages , the mortgage market is in turmoil at the margin .
The same is true of the CDO market .
Nobody knows what the market value is for the high - risk portions ( tranches ) of these broken - up credit instruments .
The investors played “ street smart ” for years .
They never asked what the exit strategy was , or what discount the secondary market would impose when it was time to run toward the exit .
Investors are now asking about the exit strategy .
There is n’t one .
There is no phone call from the New York FED over the weekend to put together a bailout plan for a single overextended firm .
There are too many overextended firms .
The FED is now learning that fooling around with the FedFunds rate is not going to solve the solvency problem .
It will be six weeks until the next FOMC meeting .
If it intervenes ahead of time , this will send a loud signal : “ It ’s panic time ! ”
There are far more reasons for the stock market to go down than up .
The FED has shot its wad .
It was a pellet gun fired at a charging elephant .
Now the bears take over .
The economy will not be far behind .

Dunn was an Associate Producer for FRONTLINE 's " Drug Wars " series
Rudy Ramirez never expected to become a statistic in the War on Drugs when he set off to buy a used car , $ 7300 in cash at the ready , in January 2000 .
Ramirez , who lives in Edinburg , Texas near the border with Mexico , had spotted a listing for the used Corvette in a magazine and wanted it badly enough that he talked his brother - in - law into accompanying him on a thousand mile road trip to Missouri to make the purchase .
When Ramirez was pulled over by police in Kansas City , however , the tenor of the trip changed .
" They asked if I had any money with me , and I said yes , " recalls Ramirez .
" I did n't think they would take it away .
I had nothing to hide . "
But the trajectory of the rental car , and the piles of cash , suggested otherwise to police -- who suspected him of trafficking drugs from the Mexican border .
As Ramirez tells it , he was detained at the side of the road for hours while his car was thoroughly searched and inspected by a drug dog .
" They kept asking me , ` Where are the drugs ? ' " he recalls .
" I told them they had the wrong guy . "
The Drug Enforcement Agency 's file on the case indicates that Ramirez gave officers confused statements about both the money and his destination , and that his extremely brief stay in a Missouri motel looked suspicious .
What 's more , the drug dog " alerted " on parts of the car , indicating that drugs could have been there at one time -- which , since it was a rental car , may or may not have anything to do with Rudy Ramirez .
Still , the search turned up no drugs of any kind , and the officers finally told Ramirez that he was free to go -- but not before confiscating $ 6,000 of his money in the name of the federal war on drugs in a process known as " forfeiture . "
Despite check stubs that he says prove that the money came from a car accident settlement reached several months before , and bank records showing that it was withdrawn from his account just prior to the Missouri trip , Ramirez has , to this day , been unable to get his money returned .
He shakes his head as he describes it .
" All I want is my money back , " he says .
Last year , almost a billion dollars worth of cash , cars , boats , real estate , and other property was forfeited to the federal government -- most of it labeled as drug - related .
And while much of this property was taken from bona fide criminals , critics of the nation 's forfeiture laws say that too many innocent people have fallen through the cracks in a system that , until recently , has been far too heavily slanted in the government 's favor .
Watch a special video report on small businessman Clay Waterman , who believes he was an innocent victim of the forfeiture laws .
Retreat is rare in our nation 's drug war -- which makes recent roll - backs to the forfeiture laws all the more remarkable .
In their scramble not to appear " soft on crime , " lawmakers normally seem able only to get tougher , even amidst widespread agreement that a policy is flawed .
But on August 23rd , 2000 , after a difficult seven - year campaign by Republican Congressman Henry Hyde from Illinois , the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform
Act finally went into effect -- making it more difficult for the federal government to seize property without evidence of wrongdoing .
It took a remarkable coalition of conservative and liberal lawmakers , to change a law that everyone from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle Association has recognized as flawed .
And while the reforms come too late to help Rudy Ramirez , they will help to make cases like his rarer .
Law dictionaries define forfeiture as " loss of some right or property as a penalty for some illegal act , " and its role as a tool in the war on drugs is clear : to hit drug dealers where it hurts most ... in the wallet .
The forfeiture laws allow the government to seize property from people it believes to be involved in drug - related activity , and then to use that revenue to bolster the efforts of law enforcement .
The concept is simple .
If you use your car , plane or boat to transport drugs , you will lose your car , plane or boat .
And if your cash was acquired through illegal drug sales , you will lose that cash and anything bought with it .
Forfeitures , however , can fall into two categories -- criminal or civil -- and due to some high - profile abuses , civil asset forfeiture has become extremely controversial .
Under criminal law , the government can seize property as punishment only after its owner has been convicted of a crime , and our justice system ensures that they are considered innocent until proven guilty .
But under civil law , it is the property itself -- not the owner -- that is charged with involvement in a crime .
What 's more , that property is considered " guilty " until proven innocent in court by its owner , thus turning our usual system of justice on its head .
According to a report prepared for the Senate Judiciary Committee , at least 90 percent of the property that the federal government seeks to forfeit is pursued through civil asset forfeiture .
And although forfeiture is intended as punishment for illegal activity , over 80 % of the people whose property is seized under civil law are never even charged with a crime according to one study of over 500 federal cases by the Pittsburgh Press .
For this reason , critics say , the system can run roughshod over the rights of innocent property owners -- and fail to distinguish them from the guilty .
This potential for abuse is compounded by the strong financial incentive that law enforcement has to make seizures -- since they benefit directly from forfeited property .
It was the passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 , part of the Reagan - era ramp - up in the war on drugs , that first made this possible .
At a federal level , the law established two new forfeiture funds : one at the U.S. Department of Justice , which gets revenue from forfeitures done by agencies like the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation , and another now run by the U.S. Treasury , which gets revenue from agencies like Customs and the Coast Guard .
These funds could now be used for forfeiture - related expenses , payments to informants , prison building , equipment purchase , and other general law enforcement purposes .
But equally important , local law enforcement would now get a piece of the pie .
Within the 1984
Act was a provision for so - called " equitable sharing " , which allows local law enforcement agencies to receive a portion of the net proceeds of forfeitures they help make under federal law - - and under current policy , that can be up to 80 % .
Previously , seized assets had been handed over to the federal government in their entirety .
Immediately following passage of the Act , federal forfeitures increased dramatically .
The amount of revenue deposited into the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund , for example , soared from $ 27 million in 1985 to $ 644 million in 1991 - - a more than twenty - fold increase .
And as forfeitures increased , so did the amount of money flowing back to state and local law enforcement through equitable sharing .
Some say that because of the resulting windfall , state and local law enforcement has become as addicted to forfeiture as an addict is to drugs -- making property seizure no longer a means to an end , but an end in itself .
In 1999 alone , approximately $ 300 million of the $ 957 million that the Treasury and Justice Department funds took in went back to the state and local departments that helped with the seizures .
And since 1986 , the Department of Justice 's equitable sharing program has distributed over $ 2 billion in cash and property .
Additional revenue comes from forfeitures done under state law , which adds to the total intake .
According to a study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics , state and local law enforcement reported receiving a total of over $ 700 million in drug - related asset forfeiture revenue in 1997 alone -- with some departments single - handedly taking in several million dollars for their own use .
The potentially corrupting influence of this flow of cash is apparent from a situation currently unfolding in the state of Missouri -- where , in what has become a highly controversial practice , mirrored across the country , police are circumventing their own state law in order to continue reaping the financial rewards of civil asset forfeiture .
In 1993 , in response to some widely - publicized police abuses , the Missouri State Legislature passed a sweeping reform of the state 's civil asset forfeiture laws .
The new state law , one of the most stringent in the nation , required that a property owner be convicted of a felony in court before property related to that crime can be forfeited .
What 's more , the law required all proceeds from the forfeitures to go to a state education fund -- not back to law enforcement .
The reforms provided strong protection to innocent property owners , making it much harder to forfeit property under Missouri law than under federal law , and eliminated the police profit motive for making seizures .
In the face of these restrictions , however , Missouri 's law enforcement has implemented what critics call an elaborate shell game that allows it to continue doing forfeitures under the laxer , federal laws -- and to continue receiving a share of the profits .
The practice walks a very thin semantic line , relying on the distinction between " discovering " and " seizing " cash .
Upon discovering cash during a traffic stop that they believe to be drug money , for instance , a local policeman or Missouri Highway Patrol officer will not actually attempt to " seize " it .
Instead , they call a federal agent to the scene to perform the seizure , virtually guaranteeing that the case will be processed under federal law and that their department can receive a share of the proceeds instead of sending those proceeds to the state education fund .
A 1999 report by Missouri State Auditor Claire McCaskill , in fact , found that in spite of the reforms to Missouri state law , 85 % of the money and property seized on investigations involving Missouri law enforcement is still handled under federal forfeiture laws .
" Forfeiture is as American as apple pie , " says McCaskill , who strongly supports its use as a tool in the war on drugs .
" The problem is when law enforcement starts circumventing state law in the process . "
Missouri 's legislature has been considering reform bills that could end the practice -- an issue that will most likely be revived in the coming session -- and the Kansas City School District has filed a lawsuit against all of Missouri 's law enforcement .
Bob Boydston , the Sheriff of Clay County , Missouri , says that he has never had to make a decision between using the state versus the federal system -- and has followed the state statutes since he took office in 1993 .
He can definitely understand , however , why his colleagues opt for the federal system when faced with the choice .
" One system will ultimately mean that the proceeds leave the agency , while the other returns some of the money to be used to fight illegal drug dealing , " he explains .
" After law enforcement spends long , hard , dangerous hours working a case , it seems natural to me that they make the choice to go the federal route .
It 's depicted as some kind of sinister plot and plan to circumvent statutes and keep money from the schools .
That 's not the case at all . "
Boydston 's county of 15 towns and 180,000 people just north of Kansas City has experienced the benefits of forfeiture proceeds first - hand .
Assisting in just one federal forfeiture , of which Clay County 's share was $ 94,000 , has allowed the sheriff 's department to train a drug dog , and maintain a military surplus helicopter that it uses for surveillance work , highway pursuits , and support for the efforts of the department 's SWAT team .
These are expenses that Boydston says the department could never have afforded otherwise over the past three years -- but that are crucial to helping combat the county 's extensive methamphetamine problem .
Financial incentives aside , many of Missouri 's law enforcement officers say that they choose to process forfeitures under federal law for another reason as well : while federal law gives them a fighting chance of taking the profits out of drug dealing , state law does not .
They feel strongly that , due to the felony conviction requirement , the new state law allows too many drug dealers to walk free , unpunished , with piles of cash , when there is not enough concrete evidence to convict them of a drug - related felony .
But it is the laxer provisions of the federal law that , until recently , have created enormous hardships for innocent people caught up in the system .
Many property owners have faced years of difficult and costly litigation before winning back money , cars , homes and businesses that were never involved in a crime .
And others have never had their property returned at all .
It is these cases , tracked by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , and highlighted in congressional hearings , that have fueled the drive for reform at a national level .
In many cases , people like Rudy Ramirez have been suspected of involvement in drug trafficking for no more reason than its being " unusual " in this day and age to possess a thick wad of cash .
Take the example of Willie Jones , a landscape architect who was carrying $ 9,600 through the Nashville airport on his way to buy shrubbery .
Or the case of physician Richard Lowe who --distrustful of banks , and with vivid memories of the Great Depression -- stockpiled $ 317,000 in his home in Alabama before finally depositing it in a bank , leading the government to confiscate a full $ 2.5 million of his life savings for this suspicious behavior .
Of particular importance to conservative lawmakers , small businesses have suffered under these laws as well .
In one well - publicized case , federal agents sought to forfeit the Red Carpet Inn in Houston , Texas when , despite the hotel staff 's frequent contact with police , the local U.S. attorney said the owners had " tacitly approved " of drug dealing on their property and not done enough to prevent it .
The hotel 's owners were not charged with any crime , but had rejected police " solutions " to the problem such as raising their room rates to deter drug dealers from staying there .
Henry
Hyde has called stories like these " Kafkaesque , " and recalls that when he first learned of the nation 's civil forfeiture practices , he considered them " more appropriate for the Soviet Union than the United States . "
What 's more , he 's said , " People take their due process rights for granted ... they have no idea that these laws exist . "
Critics agree that the main problem with the civil asset forfeiture laws , before the recent reforms , was the low burden of proof required to seize property .
A seizure could be made on the basis of mere suspicion , known as " probable cause " , that the property was involved in a crime -- and that is no more evidence than is required to obtain a search warrant .
No arrest , let alone conviction , was needed .
It was then up to the property owner to prove by " a preponderance of the evidence " , a more difficult standard to meet , that their money , or car , or home , was not bought with drug money or used to commit a drug - related crime , and should be returned .
Furthermore , the high cost of contesting a forfeiture often posed an insurmountable problem , as it did for Rudy Ramirez .
In order to take his case to court , Ramirez would have had to post a " cost bond " of 10 % of the value of the property seized -- and if he lost the case he would lose the bond .
But for a landscaping truck driver who is barely getting by , scraping together another $ 600 was no minor hurdle .
" I do n't have money to be wasting , " says Ramirez .
What 's more , unlike a defendant in a criminal trial , Ramirez was not entitled to a government - appointed attorney if he could not afford a private lawyer .
He would have had to hire the attorney at his own expense -- and as Bruce Simon , a Missouri lawyer to whom Ramirez went for help , explains , no lawyer in the country would likely take that case .
" Generally speaking , it 's not worth it unless you 've had twenty - five to thirty thousand dollars taken away , " says Simon .
It would have cost a minimum of around $ 10,000 to take a case like Ramirez ' to court , says Simon , so the $ 6,000 he would have gotten back would n't even cover his lawyer 's fees .
As a result of these blunt financial realities , Simon has seen many innocent owners simply give up without a fight when faced with a system that provides " no effective remedy " for them .
Eighty percent of forfeitures , in fact , go uncontested in court -- a statistic that the government feels suggests that the owners are guilty , and do not wish to force the issue , but some others feel shows that the system is stacked too heavily in the government 's favor .
According to a Justice Department source , the average value of a DEA seizure in 1998 was around $ 25,000 .
And lawyers say this confirms that many seizures are small enough to fall below the amount they would consider worthwhile to contest .
In the absence of a court case , the only recourse left to someone like Rudy Ramirez is to petition the DEA directly to return the money - - a so - called " administrative " solution .
But Bruce Simon asks , how likely is the DEA to believe that its agents have made a mistake ?
" That would mean the agency passing judgement on itself , " he explains , saying that most of those claims " never get anywhere . "
According to the DEA 's own estimates , in fact , only 3 - 5 % of such petitions are ever granted .
This bleak picture began to change in April of this year , however , when the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform
Act was finally signed into federal law .
The success caps a nearly decade - long crusade , and is the result of cooperation between some truly unlikely allies who , only by working together , could overpower Congress ' fear of looking " soft on crime " .
Henry Hyde , a conservative Republican from Illinois and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , was joined by the House Judiciary Committee 's ranking Democrat , John Conyers of Michigan , to spearhead the effort -- which united politicians as diverse as outspoken conservative Bob Barr of Georgia with Democratic liberal Barney Frank of Massachusetts .
An equally impressive coalition formed in the Senate around the issue .
Joining in support were organizations as wide - ranging as the American Civil Liberties Union , the National Rifle Association , the American Bankers Association , the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers , the United States Chamber of Commerce , the Americans for Tax Reform , and organizations representing groups like pilots , boaters and hotel owners .
The new law requires the government to have much stronger evidence of wrongdoing before it can seize a person 's property -- raising the burden of proof from " probable cause " to " a preponderance of the evidence " that the property is linked to a crime .
What 's more , it shifts the burden of proof to the federal government , meaning that the government must now prove in court that the property was involved in crime ... instead of the property owner needing to prove the opposite .
Equally important for people like Rudy Ramirez , the new law removes many of the onerous financial hurdles involved in contesting a forfeiture .
It refunds lawyers ' fees to property owners who successfully challenge a seizure in court , and in some cases provides government - paid lawyers to the indigent .
Furthermore , it eliminates the requirement that property owners post a sometimes hefty bond before they can fight to get their property back .
The Justice Department and national law enforcement groups lobbied furiously to prevent passage of the original bill put forward by Henry Hyde , concerned that it jeopardized a key weapon in the war on drugs .
Hyde 's original version , in fact , contained much stronger provisions -- and sought to raise the burden of proof on the government to " clear and convincing evidence " that the seized property was criminally - linked .
Ray Dineen , Director of the Treasury Department 's Forfeiture Fund , voiced concerns early on about the potential weakening of a valuable law enforcement tool .
He says that the country must not forget the purpose of seizing cars , offshore bank accounts , planes , boats , and other property that supports the drug trade , which is to dismantle a criminal infrastructure that was illegally acquired in the first place .
He adds , " The fact that revenue generated by this effort is subsequently used to support law enforcement initiatives is smart policy -- not a program of unchecked `taking . '
We 're not looking for money , we 're looking for the impact on criminal enterprises . "
In the end , both the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury have come out cautiously in favor of the final compromise legislation -- saying that raising the burden of proof needed to make a seizure is sensible protection for innocent property owners .
Still , they predict a loss of revenue , and have concerns about the possibility of frivolous court cases being brought by criminals under the new law .
Civil rights activists like the ACLU are n't entirely satisfied either , which may be the sign of a good compromise .
" We think this just begins to address the problem , " said Rachel King , legislative counsel of the ACLU , when the law first passed .
" The situation is so bad that even modest reforms are important . "
Make no mistake about it , the recent reforms do not address the issue that many feel is central to most abuses of civil asset forfeiture : the financial incentive for law enforcement to make seizures .
Still , the new law will help ensure that legitimate use of a powerful tool in the war on drugs violates the rights of fewer innocent people .
" This bill is one we can all be proud of , " Henry Hyde said of the final version .
" It returns civil asset forfeiture to the ranks of respected law enforcement tools that can be used without risk to the civil liberties and property rights of American citizens .
We are all better off that this is so . "
And in the war on drugs , that is a bold step forward -- and a kind of reform that is all too rare .

A sample of the new nanocomposite paper developed by researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
Infused with carbon nanotubes , the paper can be used to create ultra- thin , flexible batteries and energy storage devices for next - generation electronics and implantable medical equipment .

Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute have developed a new energy storage device that easily could be mistaken for a simple sheet of black paper .
The nanoengineered battery is lightweight , ultra thin , completely flexible , and geared toward meeting the trickiest design and energy requirements of tomorrow ’s gadgets , implantable medical equipment , and transportation vehicles .
Along with its ability to function in temperatures up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and down to 100 below zero , the device is completely integrated and can be printed like paper .
The device is also unique in that it can function as both a high - energy battery and a high - power supercapacitor , which are generally separate components in most electrical systems .
Another key feature is the capability to use human blood or sweat to help power the battery .
Details of the project are outlined in the paper “ Flexible Energy Storage Devices Based on Nanocomposite Paper ” published Aug. 13 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The semblance to paper is no accident : more than 90 percent of the device is made up of cellulose , the same plant cells used in newsprint , loose leaf , lunch bags , and nearly every other type of paper .
Rensselaer researchers infused this paper with aligned carbon nanotubes , which give the device its black color .
The nanotubes act as electrodes and allow the storage devices to conduct electricity .
The device , engineered to function as both a lithium - ion battery and a supercapacitor , can provide the long , steady power output comparable to a conventional battery , as well as a supercapacitor ’s quick burst of high energy .
The device can be rolled , twisted , folded , or cut into any number of shapes with no loss of mechanical integrity or efficiency .
The paper batteries can also be stacked , like a ream of printer paper , to boost the total power output .
“ It ’s essentially a regular piece of paper , but it ’s made in a very intelligent way , ” said paper co-author Robert Linhardt , the Ann and John H. Broadbent Senior Constellation Professor of Biocatalysis and Metabolic Engineering at Rensselaer .
“ We ’re not putting pieces together – it ’s a single , integrated device , ” he said .
“ The components are molecularly attached to each other : the carbon nanotube print is embedded in the paper , and the electrolyte is soaked into the paper .
The end result is a device that looks , feels , and weighs the same as paper . ”
The creation of this unique nanocomposite paper drew from a diverse pool of disciplines , requiring expertise in materials science , energy storage , and chemistry .
Along with Linhardt , authors of the paper include Pulickel M. Ajayan , professor of materials science and engineering , and Omkaram Nalamasu , professor of chemistry with a joint appointment in materials science and engineering .
Senior research specialist Victor Pushparaj , along with postdoctoral research associates Shaijumon M. Manikoth , Ashavani Kumar , and Saravanababu Murugesan , were co-authors and lead researchers of the project .
Other co-authors include research associate Lijie Ci and Rensselaer Nanotechnology Center Laboratory Manager Robert Vajtai .
The researchers used ionic liquid , essentially a liquid salt , as the battery ’s electrolyte .
It ’s important to note that ionic liquid contains no water , which means there ’s nothing in the batteries to freeze or evaporate .
“ This lack of water allows the paper energy storage devices to withstand extreme temperatures , ” Kumar said .
Along with use in small handheld electronics , the paper batteries ’ light weight could make them ideal for use in automobiles , aircraft , and even boats .
The paper also could be molded into different shapes , such as a car door , which would enable important new engineering innovations .
“ Plus , because of the high paper content and lack of toxic chemicals , it ’s environmentally safe , ” Shaijumon said .
Paper is also extremely biocompatible and these new hybrid battery / supercapcitors have potential as power supplies for devices implanted in the body .
The team printed paper batteries without adding any electrolytes , and demonstrated that naturally occurring electrolytes in human sweat , blood , and urine can be used to activate the battery device .
“ It ’s a way to power a small device such as a pacemaker without introducing any harsh chemicals – such as the kind that are typically found in batteries – into the body , ” Pushparaj said .
The materials required to create the paper batteries are inexpensive , Murugesan said , but the team has not yet developed a way to inexpensively mass produce the devices .
The end goal is to print the paper using a roll - to - roll system similar to how newspapers are printed .
“ When we get this technology down , we ’ll basically have the ability to print batteries and print supercapacitors , ” Ajayan said .
“ We see this as a technology that ’s just right for the current energy market , as well as the electronics industry , which is always looking for smaller , lighter power sources .
Our device could make its way into any number of different applications . ”
The team of researchers has already filed a patent protecting the invention .
They are now working on ways to boost the efficiency of the batteries and supercapacitors , and investigating different manufacturing techniques .

I already told you pictures with a message drive me more than so - called “ fashion ” pictures showing just things .
These Natalie Portman images captured by Raymond Meier bring her out of these times and put her into her own time , her own rules and her own world .
Do you think she ’s representing the new “ wave ” refreshing the Red Carpet in intelligence most of all ?

I ’m not sure if I ’m the only one bothered about this , but have you seen the publicity that has recently started to air on Digg.com ?
Acne treatment creams , Anti-Age products , Dating services , and other assorted , spam - like ads .
This really leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth .
Usually , only sub-par , crappy sites that resort to popups display such commercials , so why would Digg management accept these on their site ?
Are they assuming ( Or the company that serves ads for them ) that digg users are lonely , pimple - faced idiots ?
It seems that about 25 % of their ad inventory is filled with those , which in my opinion , is already too much .
I know that corporations have to make money in order to prosper , but this is going too far .
Anyone cares to share their thoughts on this ?

The newly - crowned Miss France has been ordered to hand back her sash after photographs of her draped on a crucifix and provocatively eating yoghurt were published in a magazine .
Valerie Begue , 22 , was in disgrace after organisers of the beauty pageant took exception to the photographs of her floating on a crucifix in a swimming pool and eating yoghurt in a sexually suggestive manner .
The decision to demand that Miss Begue be sacked has almost triggered a revolt in her home town on the island of Reunion in the French Indian Ocean .

The young business student posed for the photos three years ago anad they were re-published in a French magazine .
As soon as the images of her , wearing only a bikini , were printed Genevieve Fontenay , head of France 's Miss World panel , said Begue should quit .
" I do n't understand how she can have the cheek to enter when she knew perfectly well the ethical rules .
" I certainly cannot see myself being escorted around France by a woman like that . "
The 75 - year - old former model was also reported to say " She 's in Reunion , and she should stay there . "
Her comments sparked outrage among the islanders , who accused mainland France of racism and being dismissive of the islanders .

Angry callers inundated local radio stations , there was a demonstration in Begue 's home town and politicians have written a letter of protest to Paris
The beauty queen said photographs were a youthful indiscretion but added that she had been " betrayed " by whoever had sold the pictures to Entrevue magazine .
In 2004 , Laetitia Bleger was stripped of her Miss France title for " making herself available for licentious shots " after she posed for Playboy magazine .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Faced with foreclosure on her Russellville , Indiana home , Christina Snyder allegedly concocted the kind of plan that now has insurance executives on edge .
According to the county prosecutor , the 31 - year - old Snyder allegedly offered to pay a neighbor $ 5,000 to help her burn down her house and make it look like a botched rape attempt - all in order to claim $ 80,000 in insurance money .
Snyder wanted the neighbor to bind her hands in duct tape , write " whore " on her shirt , and then help her escape once the blaze was set , the prosecutor says .
The neighbor demurred , instead reporting Snyder to police .
With the national foreclosure rate zooming and the real estate market in a two - year funk , the insurance industry fears more homeowners will see arson as a way out of their financial woes .
A recent report by the industry - funded Coalition Against Insurance Fraud notes that with " untold thousands of homeowners struggling with ballooning subprime mortgage payments , fraud fighters are watching closely for a spike in arsons by desperate homeowners who can no longer afford their home payments . "
History indicates such a spike is coming .
" When the economy is down , we see an increase in fraud , " says Dennis Schulkins , a claim consultant in State Farm 's Special Investigative Unit .
It may already be happening .
Allstate ( ALL , Fortune 500 ) spokesman Mike Siemienas says his company has seen an increase nationally in arsons among homes in foreclosure .
In California , the state�s insurance division reports that the number of questionable residential fires in 2007 increased 76 percent over 2006 .
National arson statistics for 2007 are n't yet available , but Federal Bureau of Investigation crime data shows there was a significant uptick - 4 percent - in suburban arson in 2006 , when the real estate downturn began to take hold .
The arson increase in 2006 marked a change from the prior three years when suburban arson fell 3 percent , 5 percent and 6 percent , respectively .
Says Dennis Jay , the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud 's executive director , " It 's a growing problem . "
This piece considers that industrialisation could only happen with cheap fuels , and by looking at the countries of the world , tries to figure out just how cheap fuel has to be before lots of people start using it  before a country can industrialise with fossil fuels .
The flipside to this is seeing how expensive fuel must be before it deindustrialises .
This then gives us a clue to if and when will industrial society will end .
What was true in 1845 when Thoreau wrote that is not true today in the developed West , but is still true in the Third World .
Fuel was still expensive enough that a journey of a day's walk taken by mechanical means was more expensive than a day 's labour .
Resources were more expensive than labour ; now in the West labour is more expensive than resources , while in the Third World labour is still very cheap .
But will it always be so ?
One says to me , " I wonder that you do not lay up money ; you love to travel ; you might take the [ railway ] cars and go to Fitchburg today and see the country . "
But I am wiser than that .
I have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot .
I say to my friend , Suppose we try who will get there first .
The distance is thirty miles ; the fare ninety cents .
That is almost a day 's wages ...
Well , I start now on foot , and get there before night ...
You will in the meanwhile have earned your fare , and arrive there some time tomorrow , or possibly this evening ...
And so , if the railroad reached round the world , I think that I should keep ahead of you ...
This is a guest post by Kiashu .
Kiashu says he has read a lot of books and sometimes been asked to write essays about them , has met a wide variety of people in his life and concluded that no , " they " wo n't just find an answer to our problems , and we really do have to worry .
He is a good example of the fact that in the internet age anyone with a brain and too much time on their hands can find out just about anything and talk about it intelligently .
By an industrial society  I mean one in which machines are powered not by human or animal motion and are a part of everyday life , and we design our homes and cities with machines in mind .
A non-industrial society may have some machines , but it's not designed around machines ; a Kalahari Bushman can happily use a radio , but he does not live in an industrial society  , whereas his cousin who moves to Johannesburg and takes the bus to work does , even if she has no radio .
Going from a mostly - manual or animal economy to an industrial one , you can think of it as like the melting of ice into water at 0°C .
When there 's enough heat ( cheap energy ) it melts ( becomes industrial ) .
But does the reverse apply ?
If you cool water down to 0 °C , it 'll freeze .
So if the cheap fuel becomes expensive , will we lose all that industry ?
Does industrial society have a freezing point , a point at which the heat ( energy ) has been drawn out of it , and so it changes from liquid ( industrial ) to solid ( non-industrial ) ?
One way to figure this out is to look at the undeveloped countries of the world , consider how affordable fuel is in each one and then estimate how cheap fuel would have to be before they can industrialise ?
Next we can look at other countries where incomes have dropped and / or fuel has become expensive , and consider what happened to them .
From this we may be able to estimate , what is the freezing point of industrial society , the point where it soldifies into a manual economy ?
What will the price of fuel have to be before we hit that freezing point ?
History of energy use
Throughout history , humanity progressed from using only their hands , to using tools , to using animals , and finally to using machines .
Progressing from the work of hands to those of tools did not involve an increase in use of energy , but an improvement in the efficiency of energy use - a crowbar can let you lift a rock more easily than you can with your bare hands .
But adding animals did not let us use energy more efficiently , it simply took energy from somewhere else and put it to work for us - the same applies with machines .
Tools do n't need any fuel or food , so if people have the physical resources and skills to make them , they will .
But animals and machines are different .
Tools did not require extra energy use , they simply used human energy more efficiently .
Animals need food , and so whether they 're used or not depends on whether enough excess food is available .
Perhaps you have 1 acre , and could plough it in one day with oxen , but the oxen eat a haybale every day .
Either you must be able to get 365 haybales from 1 acre , or you must be able to hire the oxen for just one day at something less than that .
If you can't do that , then you 'll not use the oxen on your land , it 's not worth it .
In other words , for animals to be used their food ( fuel ) must be cheap .
Machines need fuel , and need it to be cheap .
Perhaps you have 1 acre , and could plough it in an hour with a tractor , and six months later harvest it another hour , and from that acre get ten bushels of corn , but the tractor would use two gallons of fuel .
If the two gallons of fuel cost more than ten bushels of corn , then you wo n't use the tractor , it 's not worth it .
In other words , for machines to be used their fuel ( food ) must be cheap .
We did n't use the animals and machines as soon as they became available , but only when their use was cheaper than the alternatives .
Oxen can plough an acre in a day , and a fit man will take twelve days to do it with a spade , but if oxen cost twelve times as much to feed as men , then men will keep digging .
Similarly , tractors can plough ten acres in a day , but if a tractor costs ten times as much as an ox , or one hundred and twenty times as much as a man , then people will keep using oxen .
But whatever the cost of buying the actual animals and machines , the minimum running cost is their fuel / food .
So the cost of food and fuel is the limiting factor that determines when a society goes from using tools to animals , and from animals to machines .
There 's no animal use without cheap food , and no machine use without cheap fuel .
What happens when the cheap fuel runs out ?
Well , either we find a new fuel , or we return to using animals and tools .
Note : I wo n't consider here economies where animals are too unaffordable to use , as we 're looking at industrial and non-industrial societies , rather than the different kinds of non-industrial societies .
A look at a non-industrial society where animals were unaffordable - in one community farms averaged less than a third of a hectare each - is found in  Land relations under unbearable stress : Rwanda caught in the Malthusian trap , Catherine André and Jean - Phillipe Platteau , Journal of Economic Behaviour and Organization 34:1 - 47 ( 1998 ) .
This is also discussed at some length in Chapter 10 of Jared Diamond 's Collapse .
Cheap and expensive fuel
If it is true that fuel affordability determines industrialisation , then we'd expect to see that in places where fuel is expensive , people do n't use machines a lot , and where it 's cheap they do .
 Cheap is a relative term .
Petrol costs $ 0.54 / lt in Laos , and $ 1.63 a litre in Belgium , but the Laotians do n't use three times as much petrol as the Belgians , since Laotians have an income of $ 567 and Belgians one of $ 37,214 .
Logically , if the Laotians cannot industrialise with an income which can buy them only 1,050lt of fuel , then the Belgians could not stay industrialised if their income could only buy them 1,050lt of fuel  if petrol were $ 35.44 a litre , or if Belgian income halved to $ 18,607 and petrol were $ 17.72 a litre .
Different fuel prices and industrialisation
Here our idea is that all things being equal , having cheaper fuel will lead to greater industrialisation  fewer people working larger farms , more roads and so on .
Let 's consider two similar neighbours , Venezuela and Colombia .
In very few countries in the world is the free market allowed to determine the price of fuel without interference by government or corporations .
Typically , oil - exporting countries subsidise fuel , keeping them below the market price for crude oil ( US$ 0.38 a litre ) ; while oil - importing countries tax fuel , keeping it above the market price for crude oil .
In Venezuela petrol is $ 0.03 / lt but $ 0.98 / lt in neighbouring Colombia ; both have similar per capita GDP of around $ 6,600 , but despite their similar wealth Venezuelans should find it easier to live an industrialised lifestyle than Colombians , because of their fuel being cheaper for them .
And indeed we find that this is so .
Colombia has many small farms , with 10.3 million agricultural people living and working on 570 million ha , or 55 ha per person ( coffee plantations are even smaller , on average just 6ha ) ; Venezuela has 2.8 million people on 329 million ha , or 118 ha per person .
Colombia has 110,635 km of roads and rail , or 0.0025 km per person , while Venezuela has 96,387 km or 0.0037 km per person .
So Venezuela with cheap fuel has farms twice as large per person involved in agriculture , and 50 % more roads .
[ As a side note , this shows that Chavez 's policy of breaking up large farms and giving them to smallholder peasants is doomed to failure without price guarantees for their goods .
In a free market , whoever makes the most profit will tend to absorb the other businesses ; in agriculture , cheap fuel means large farms where machinery can be put to best use will make the most profit , while expensive fuel means smaller farms where you do n't have to use fuel at all will do best .
Smallholders cannot succeed in a free market with fuel at $ 0.03 / lt ; but they could succeed if there were fixed prices for their produce , ensuring the smallholder 's profits and limiting the larger place 's profits .
So Venezuela can have cheap fuel and price guarantees , or expensive fuel and a free market ; but cheap fuel and a free market leads to big landlords taking everything over . ]
We find similar results around the world : where fuel is cheap , industrialisation follows .
But how cheap does it have to be ?
I 've taken figures for per capita GDP as a rough guide to an average income in that country , and compared these with international fuel prices to see how much fuel an average income could buy .
Per capita GDP is not a perfect guide to wealth , since it 's just total income divided by population ; if an accountant on $ 100,000 moves into a house with a waitress on $ 10,000 , their average income may be $ 55,000 , but the waitress is not necessarily better off .
This is particularly true in countries whose economies rely on exports of raw materials like oil and minerals , which tends to lead to a very few rich people and lots of poor people ; for example Angola has a GDP per capita of $ 2,758 , but 70 % of the population live on less than half of that .
But in terms of considering industrialisation potential , per capita GDP is a decent guide , since even if only 1 % of the population can afford cars and televisions , they will ensure that roads and power lines are built .
Food prices vary considerably , however because we want to consider the effect of fuel affordability on industrialisation , we can fix food prices as about that of wheat on the world market - $ 300 / tonne , with 184kg of grain supplying the minimum calories and protein for a moderately active adult , or $ 55 .
Food also represents a minimum wealth necessary before anything else can be bought ; if your annual income is only $ 500 , whether fuel is $ 1 or $ 0.01 per litre does n't really matter , since between food , water , clothing and housing , you 'll be hard - pressed to have anything left to spend on fuel .
Fuel affordability and industrialisation
Of the top 50 countries in terms of fuel affordability , all are able to buy 10,000 litres or more annually .
Their average income is about $ 28,000 .
16 of them are net oil exporters , 3 produce a significant portion of their own oil ; 29 are  Western or  First World countries ( Ireland , Australia , Greece , etc ) ; the other 21 are the 16 oil exporters and 5 island - states heavily reliant on tourism or other foreign subsidies for their wealth .
This tells us that what gives you cheap fuel are one or more of having enough to export , a high per capita wealth , and lots of foreign money coming in .
You need money or to produce the stuff yourself .
( Obvious enough ! )
Of those top 50 , 40 of them are industrialised countries .
Of the 10 which are n't , Iraq 's slow deindustrialisation has more to do with war than anything else , Turkmenistan was for many years held back by dictatorship , as were Libya and Oman , Venezuela is in the process of industrialising fully , and four are small island - states , which for physical and cultural reasons resist industrialisation .
There remains only Gabon , 50th on our list , with their average income able to buy just over 10,000lt annually .
So absent civil conflicts , foreign invasion or dictatorship , being able to buy 10,000lt or more annually should give you industrialisation .
Of the bottom 50 , none have an income greater than $ 1,100 , none subsidise fuel use , and they average being able to buy 10 years ' grain with their income .
At the top of them is Nicaragua , whose people can buy about 1,350lt of fuel annually .
None are industrialised , and the vast majority of industrial infrastructure beyond gravelled roads was built with foreign supervision and money .
So we see that countries of under 1,500lt of fuel each definitely can't industrialise , and those of more than 10,000lt definitely can .
Somewhere between those two figures are when industrialisation becomes achievable for rising fuel affordability , or difficult for dropping fuel affordability .
To create and maintain a modern industrial economy requires fuel affordability of something between 1,500 - 10,000lt per person annually .
It 's not possible to be more precise than this given the data , since some countries like Namibia can afford more than 3,500lt and are not industrialised , while others like Ukraine can only manage 2,800lt but are industrialised ; however Namibian wealth is increasing and so they may industrialise , while Ukrainian wealth was once greater but is somewhat unsteady so they may not retain it .
Then there are countries like Cuba ( 3,727lt fuel , 13,667 years ' grain ) , with poor levels of industrialisation in communications and electronics , but good levels in pharmaceuticals .
Most likely , fuel affordability is like other kinds of income  it takes a lot to build something up , not so much to maintain it .
So a country might go through a period of affordability of 10,000lt fuel and industrialise , and later when fuel drops to 5,000lt affordability , remain industrialised .
In support of this , we may note that the former Eastern bloc states and European republics of the USSR were once relatively wealthy and industrialised , and later dropped in wealth but remained industrialised  the Czech Reublic tops out at fuel affordability of 10,652lt , and Ukraine 's at the bottom with 2,807lt  Georgia and Albania are lower , but no - one could really call either of them industrialised , you need more than Hoxha 's concrete pillboxes for that ..
We also find just above the bottom 50 is North Korea , a country which in the 1960s was wealthier than South Korea at the time , but which had a steady relative decline , and then after 1991 was essentially cut off from reliable oil supplies by the fall of the Soviet Union .
It has experienced sending people out of factories and into the fields to produce food by hand , animal and tools , and now can afford 1,418lt annually .
So while it may take less to maintain an industrial society than create it , there is some lower threshold of fuel affordability below which it can't be maintained .
And of course just as some people spend their money with more efficiency than others , getting more bang for their buck , so too will some countries spend their fuel more efficiently , either in building up or maintaining their industry ; if there can be one person on $ 30,000 who can afford a mortgage and one on $ 40,000 who cannot , it stands to reason that there should be countries with 3,000lt fuel who can afford industrialisation and some on 8,000lt who cannot .
Food affordability and industrialisation
As noted above , however cheap or expensive the fuel , people need to eat before they can lay down asphalt roads , build lathes , drive cars or produce television programmes .
So what 's the minimum food before a country can industrialise ?
The list of countries and their food affordability , since we fixed the food price at $ 300 / tonne , is the same as the list of countries and their per capita GDP .
We find that Luxembourg is at the top of the list with being able to get over 293,000 years ' grain , and Latvia with 28,500 .
Of the top 50 , 37 are  Western or  First World countries , 8 are net oil exporters ( including a Western country , Norway ) , and the other 6 are the small island - states again .
Excepting the small island - states , all are industrialised .
The poorest of them is Estonia , with $ 8,500 income .
Of the bottom 50 , from Cameroon with $ 1,002 and able to afford 18 years ' grain , to Burundi with $ 119 and 2 years ' grain , only about 10 have any real industrialisation , and it's far from universal  consider for example India ( at # 129 ) , where tens of millions live their lives in airconditioned comfort using computer software in their daily work , while others hoe in the fields and are only one bad harvest away from famine .
So we see that , setting aside small island - states receiving large foreign subsidies , an income of more than $ 8,500 is required for industrialisation , and an income of less than $ 1,000 definitely prevents it .
The level for industrialisation is probably somewhat higher , since a number of the countries on $ 8,500 - $ 15,000 are former Soviet countries , where industrial infrastructure was built in wealthier Soviet days .
To create and maintain a modern industrial economy requires food affordability of about 270 years ' grain , or $ 15,000 .
Four economies
A modern industrial economy requires fuel affordability of something between 1,500 - 10,000lt per person annually , and food affordability of about 270 years ' grain , or $ 15,000 .
This leads to three types of economies , with a fourth possible one .
Manual Economy
Fuel < 1,500lt , or food < 270 years ' grain
Laos , North Korea , Honduras , etc
A manual economy uses hands , tools and animals , but not machines .
When fuel is expensive , people turn to manual labour , and food becomes more expensive in proportion ( or national income drops , if you prefer to look at it that way ) .
When fuel is cheap , if food remains expensive then they still can't industrialise .
Nothing is wasted , and the accoutrements of industrial society  televisions , four wheel drives , etc  will be objects of wonder or symbols of prestige .
The citizens sometimes migrate ( as legal migrants , illegals , or refugees ) to countries with mixed - industrial economies .
Mixed - Industrial Economy
Fuel 1,500 - 10,000lt , food 270 - 28,500 years ' grain
Ukraine , India , etc
A mixed - industrial economy uses hands , tools and animals in many parts , but also has some use of machines , typically concentrated in cities .
Often an economy in transition between manual and wasteful , or vice versa .
Typically , parts are deeply - industrialised while other parts are still in a manual economy .
Industrial objects will be relatively common but not ubiquitous , often old , and old ones will be kept and repaired .
Wasteful industrial economies may export their waste to such a country to mine for raw materials for recycling ( for example 90 % of the world 's shipbreaking occurs in India , Bangladesh , China and Turkey ) .
A society which was once a wasteful industrial and is now a mixed industrial economy may mine its own old landfills .
The citizens migrate to wasteful industrial countries ; those from the industrial parts migrate legally , those from the manual parts typically illegally .
Wasteful Industrial Economy
Fuel > 10,000lt , food > 28,500 years ' grain
US , Belgium , Japan , etc
In this economy , fuel and food are so affordable that they 're often wasted .
People leave their airconditioning on when not at home , throw out a quarter or more of their food , and so on .
Industrial objects will be discarded rather than repaired , and often discarded when still working to be replaced with something better .
 The Ecotechnic Economy
Fuel < 1,500lt , food > 270 years ' grain
No such economies yet exist .
This would require either extreme taxation or a global fuel shortage , combined with high technology renewable energy , local organic polyculture farming and the like .
These are high - technology economies which do n't burn fossil fuels for power , and which have little or no waste .
Whether such an economy is technically possible or not is the subject for another article ; no - one has yet painted a comprehensive picture of what one might look like .
Development of the Four Economies
Returning to the model of the development of technology , from hands to tools to animals and then to machines , we see that we have two possible fates , depending on how we respond to fossil fuel depletion .
Either we begin designing our machines to not use fossil fuels , relying on energy from the sun ( solar , wind , geothermal , etc ) , or else we continue with Business As Usual , and at some point when fossil fuels deplete , their affordability reaches dangerous levels , and with no non-fossil fuel - using machines , we return to the widespread use of animals and tools .
Note that the fuel affordability 
I 'm talking about must be sustained for some years , whether to begin an industrial society or end it .
Lagos is not going to turn into Dubai if fuel is $ 0.01 / lt for a single year , nor will Chicago turn into Timbuktu if fuel jumps to $ 100 a gallon for a year .
When fuel affordability is 1,500 - 10,000lt per person annually , the wasteful industrial society can't go on , and will go into recession .
For First World countries with an average of $ 30,000 income , that would be a fuel price of $ 3 - $ 20 per litre ( $ 11 - $ 76 per gallon , or assuming that crude costs 50 % of what petrol / gasoline costs , $ 240 - $ 1,500 per barrel ) .
That is , at a fuel price of $ 3-$ 20 / lt ( $ 240 - $ 1,500 / bbl ) , the wasteful industrial society will be under threat ; if this goes on , it 's likely to become a mixed - industrial economy .
With good planning at this stage , it may change to an ecotechnic economy .
The transition is less likely if the fuel prices are mostly due to high taxes , since a tax of more than 100 % on anything creates a significant black market for it , which will keep the effective affordability at better level .
With long - term fuel affordability of less than 1,500lt , or prices above $ 20 / lt ( $ 1,500 / bbl ) , transition from a wasteful industrial to a mixed - industrial economy is certain , and eventual transition to a manual economy quite possible .
Moving to an ecotechnic economy does not seem likely , as people will lack the funds to invest in the new infrastructure .
We do not for example see wind farms and solar panels and electric monorails in Pyongyang , North Korea .
Thus , denying the inevitable depletion of fossil fuels and the falling affordability of them means that a society is more likely to collapse directly from a wasteful industrial to a manual economy , while preparing for it allows the possibility of transiting to an ecotechnic economy .
Prices destroying industrialisation ?
In history so far , several economies have gone from wasteful industrial to mixed - industrial , or even manual .
However , this has been due not to high fuel prices as such , but to the fuel being unavailable at any price because no - one could or would sell to them .
Cuba , North Korea and Iraq are examples of this .
And several countries have been unable to industrialise because of unaffordable fuel .
But none have yet deindustrialised due simply to the price of fuel .
The importance of the price / supply distinction is that lack of supply for a particular country is different to globally rising prices and lack of supply , since lack of supply may be political or otherwise temporary .
If you are given unpaid leave from your job during a company 's time of trouble , you 're less likely to look for another job than if you 're fired outright .
Likewise , a wasteful industrial economy which finds oil prices rising to $ 240 a barrel may assume it to be temporary , and not prepare to change .
We can imagine , for example , that in 2020 world oil and condensates production has dropped from 84 to 60 M bbl / day , with demand being 20 Mbbl in the US , 10 Mbbl in the EU , 5 Mbbl in Japan , and 20 M bbl in each of China and India , with another 15 M bbl spread out about the world .
With 70 Mbbl of demand and only 60 M bbl of supply , many regimes are going to assume that with the right combination of military might , diplomacy and trade deals , they can secure a sufficient supply , and therefore they do n't bother trying to change to a new kind of economy .
They reason that while world supply is n't enough for the world , it 's enough for them , just as when you are one of 1,000 workers and know that 200 will be fired , you do n't immediately look for a new job because you hope to be one of the 800 who 'll stay .
However , as fossil fuels deplete , it 'll be harder for countries to resist change as they did in previous oil shocks  simply because previous oil shocks they knew to be temporary .
Nonetheless , we can expect that countries will as I said try various combinations of military might , diplomacy and trade deals to put off decisions and change .
Thus , even with oil hitting $ 240 / bbl and moving towards $ 1,500 / bbl , we can expect that positive change towards an ecotechnic society will be slow .
Conclusion
But whether the crisis is prepared for or not , it will come .
When oil has an affordability of 1,500 - 10,000lt , or is $ 240 - $ 1,500 / bbl in today 's Western economies , wasteful industrial societies will come under great strain , and move on to at least an attempt at an ecotechnic economy , or else collapse to a mixed - industrial economy .
If affordability stays at that low level for several years , or continues to decline , we can expect them to turn into manual economies .
Some western - EU countries are beginning to attempt to move towards Ecotechnic economies , though the eastern - EU 's oil use is increasing .
But the other 70 of the 85 M bbl / day demand remains and is increasing , with 22 M bbl in the US , 5 Mbbl in Japan , 8 M bbl in China and so on .
Since supply is declining with no sign of picking up , and demand is increasing with little sign of abatement , it 's obvious that the price will continue to rise .
 Demand destruction will come first from the poorest countries ; if you can only afford one barrel of oil a year at $ 80 , then if it becomes $ 240 you will probably just do without entirely , rather than getting one - third a barrel .
These poor countries consume relatively little oil already , perhaps 10 M bbl / day ; if they stopped buying tomorrow , their supply would be taken up in 2 - 3 years by the US , China , Japan and India .
Again we must remember affordability .
In the 1970s , a drop in world oil supply led to a quadrupling of price and a Western recession , with economies shrinking by 5 % .
With smaller economies and less money about , the higher prices hurt even more , a vicious economic circle .
So we ought to keep the 1,500 - 10,000lt affordability range in mind , rather than the $ 240 - $ 1,500 / bbl price range .
A country with per capita wealth of $ 50,000 will hit crisis at that 1,500 - 10,000lt affordability , but that 's $ 400 - $ 2,700 / bbl for them ; but if they should become a $ 20,000 country , as is quite possible with a global slowdown in trade due to fossil fuel depletion , then $ 160 - $ 1,000 / bbl oil will do it .
But on the whole , the developed West has a per capita wealth of about $ 30,000 , so that $ 240 - $ 1,600 / bbl oil will bring on a crisis .
When could we see such a price ?
Let 's look at the figures for the last several years .
1998 $ 15
1999 $ 21
2000 $ 32
2001 $ 25
2002 $ 27
2003 $ 30
2004 $ 38
2005 $ 51
2006 $ 64
Oil hovered around $ 20 / bbl for most of the 1990s , but has risen in price in eight out of the last nine years , the exception being 2001 when it dropped 22 % .
The average increase over those nine years , including that drop , has been 23 % .
This projection would give us $ 78 / bbl this year of 2007 , $ 220 / bbl oil in 2012 , and $ 271 / bbl in 2013 .
It would pass $ 1,600 / bbl about 2021 .
However , reality rarely follows such neat mathematical formulae .
Could there be a drop in price ?
Not likely , says the chief economist for the EIA .
Some are even fearing a rise to $ 250 / bbl in the next two years , and taking steps to insure against it , says the Financial Times .
In this year of 2007 , oil has been as low as $ 51 and recently hit rather close to $ 100 / barrel .
However , in my judgment a continuation of the current rapid price rise is n't likely , except in the case of US war with Iran , a South Asian nuclear conflict , some combination of another Hurricane Katrina and a very destructive earthquake in Iran , or similarly catastrophic events .
However , there are those who say that we 're currently at peak oil , and can expect declines of global oil supply ; while the total oil produced may not decline much in the next two decades , because of rising consumption in the oil exporting countries , the total exports will decline , giving us fuel affordability of 10,000lt in the West , or $ 240 / bbl oil almost certainly by 2015 .
At this point , modern wasteful industrial economies will begin coming under strain .
Like the old ex-Soviet countries , they may struggle along for a few years but will eventually collapse , becoming mixed - industrial economies , with animal and human power returning to widespread use , but much industry remaining .
A picture of what this sort of mixed - industrial economy might look like can be found in how China looks today .
By 2025 , if oil production has not declined at all , but demand continues to rise at 2.3 % annually , demand for oil will be more than 50 % higher than supply , leading to fuel affordability of less than 1,500lt , or oil of more than $ 1600 / bbl .
Mixed - industrial economies will then struggle to move to ecotechnic ones , or collapse to manual economies .
Internal conflicts are likely .
Already today manual economy regions of countries sometimes rise up against the wasteful industrial regions , economic disparity combining with ethnic tensions to produce violent conflict ; this violent conflict then perpetuates the disparity , and the conflict uses resources which both types of economy could have used to enrich themselves .
What happens as a country is rising in wealth is just as likely as it falls in wealth .
For example , in the US we can imagine that the New England and California areas would remain wasteful industrial , while the South and Southwest might become mixed - industrial or manual economies .
If this disparity were to combine with hispanic or black discontents , violent conflict could result .
Economic freezing point may turn out to be social boiling point .
Certainly with wars of conquest for access to fossil fuels , smart diplomacy and the like , we may see some countries holding out for a couple of decades longer .
But in general , the 2015 - 25 period will see the end wasteful - industrial economies , and after that will begin a long decline for any who have been unwilling or unable to go to ecotechnic economies .
Is an Ecotechnic society possible ?
What might it look like ?
The answer to the first question is maybe .
But it can be difficult to get a realistic picture of what it might look like .
When thinking about someone in a manual economy , we can imagine their day , what they do and wear , the tools they use .
Likewise we can imagine a wasteful industrial economy , people getting up in the morning , putting on a suit while their coffee machine burbles water , sculling it down and jumping in their car and spending half an hour or so sitting behind other cars moving at only twice walking pace , going into work among bright lights and humming machines , bopping their heads to music from a tiny player .
But what will the day of a person in an ecotechnic economy look like ?
This requires thought and study , and so will be the subject of another article .
KATHMANDU , Dec. 1 ( Xinhua ) --
A team of explorers has arrived in Nepal 's capital with an exciting story of finding footprints of yeti near the base camp of Mt. Qomolangma , at Khumbu in eastern Nepal , The Himalayan Times reported on Saturday .
" We are happy to say that we have found footprints of yeti .
And the snowman is no more a legend for us now , " Joshua Gates , the team leader of the expedition of the American television channel Destination Truth , told the media Friday .
Showing the model of the footprint , collected at the site , some200 km east of Kathmandu , he said that some scientific research would continue in the U.S. regarding its authenticity and other phases of exploration for further studies .
The team , consisting of 9 Americans and 14 Nepalis , left Kathmandu on Nov. 24 and arrived here on Friday after the expedition .
He said that the team found the footprints when it was returning from Khumbu by the confluence of Ghettekhola and Dudhkoshi rivers , near Monju village at a height of 2,850 meters .
It was Tul Bahadur Rai , assistant guide of the team , who first spotted the footprint by the riverbank .
" It was the night of November 28 .
I cried in excitement when I saw the footprints .
I called all the members and they took photographs and also made a model of the footprint , after they were convinced that it indeed was a footprint , " he told the daily .
He also said that one of the prints was around 12 inches long and others were smaller because the ground was not even and the prints were not clear .
This is not the first time , footprints of yeti , a species of hairy , humpbacked and dark giant biped ape , were found in Nepal 's Himalayan valleys .
In 1925 a Greek photographer , NA Tombazi , claimed that he had spotted an ape - like creature walking in the valley near Mt. Qomolangma .
Another noted explorer who claimed to have seen yeti was the father of Tenzing Norgay Sherpa , the first person to climb Mt. Qomolangma .
Similarly , British mountaineers Eric Shipton and Michael Ward found the yeti footprints in 1951 near the border area .
Even Sir Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide , Tenzing Norgay , found giant footprints on the way up the top of Mt. Qomolangma , in1953 .

While sidewalks crackle in the summer heat , NASA scientists are keeping a close eye on the sun .
It is almost spotless , a sign that the Sun may have reached solar minimum .
Scientists are now watching for the first spot of the new solar cycle to appear .
The 11 year long solar cycle is marked by two extremes , solar minimum and solar maximum .
Solar minimum is the period of least solar activity in the solar cycle of the sun .
During this time sunspot and solar flare activity diminishes , and often does not occur for days at a time .
When spots begin to appear on the sun once again , scientists know that the sun is heading into a new season of extreme solar activity .
At the cycle 's peak , solar maximum , the sun is continually peppered with spots , solar flares erupt , and the sun hurls billion - ton clouds of electrified gas into space .
Solar maximum is often compared to the hurricane season here on Earth .
Violent solar events , like flares and coronal mass ejections , are the hurricanes of space weather .
These solar storms are capable of wreaking havoc with satellites , power grids , and radio communication , including the Global Positioning System .
NOAA 's Space Environment Center , Boulder CO , forecasts that the next solar cycle should begin in March 2008 and should peak in late 2011 or mid 2012 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The Democrats ' top investigator in Congress reacted angrily Friday to a report that the former Blackwater USA employee accused of killing an Iraqi vice presidential guard was hired by another U.S. contractor weeks later .
Rep. Henry Waxman says the State Department is covering up " an epidemic of corruption " in Iraq .
The report comes alongside Rep. Henry Waxman 's warning of a " confrontation " with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice over how much Americans should be able to learn about corruption in Iraq .
In a sharply worded letter , Waxman demanded Rice turn over a long list of documents related to the contractor , Andrew Moonen .
" Serious questions now exist about whether the State Department may have withheld from the U.S. Defense Department facts about this Blackwater contractor 's shooting of the Iraqi guard that should have prevented his hiring to work on another contract in support of the Iraq War , " wrote Waxman , chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
Moonen is accused of fatally shooting an Iraqi guard and fleeing the scene , according to a Congressional memo describing the investigation report .
He was fined , fired and flown home from Iraq , and the company later paid $ 20,000 in compensation to the victim 's family .
Moonen returned to the United States within a few days of the incident , his attorney said , but in February he returned to Kuwait working for Combat Support Associates ( CSA ) , a company spokesman said .
CNN reported Thursday night that CSA said it was unaware of the December incident when it hired Moonen , because the State Department and Blackwater kept the incident quiet and out of Moonen 's personnel records .
Waxman wrote it is " hard to reconcile this development " with previous assertions State Department officials have made in recent days .
Waxman earlier accused Rice and the State Department of a cover-up of what he called " an epidemic of corruption " in Iraq in general .
He branded the State Department 's anti-corruption efforts " dysfunctional , under - funded and a low priority . "
Waxman further blasted the department for trying to keep secret details of corruption in Iraq , especially relating to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki .
" Corruption is increasing in Iraq , and the State Department can't keep us from knowing that -- can't censor that -- just because it might embarrass or hurt our relationship with [ al - ]
Maliki , " Waxman said at the House committee hearing .
Watch Waxman ask why negative comments must be said behind closed doors »
Deputy Secretary of State Larry Butler repeatedly refused to answer questions from Waxman about Iraqi corruption but offered full disclosure if his testimony would be kept secret .
Asked if he believes the Iraqi government has the political will or the capability to root out corruption , Butler responded , " Mr. Chairman , questions which go to the broad nature of our bilateral relationship with Iraq are best answered in a classified setting . "
But he was more forthcoming when talking about efforts that al - Maliki has taken to improve matters , commending the prime minister for dispatching Iraqi forces to surround a refinery to ensure oil did not end up on the black market .
But Waxman appeared unmoved .
" Why can you talk about the positive things and not the negative things ? " he asked .
" Should n't we have the whole picture ? "
" I 'd be very pleased to answer those questions in an appropriate setting , " Butler replied .
Waxman laughed and asked , " An appropriate setting for positive things is a congressional hearing , but for negative things , it must be behind closed doors ? "
" As you know , this goes to the very heart of diplomatic relations and national security , " Butler said .
" It goes to the very heart of propaganda , " Waxman said , putting funding for anti-corruption activities through June 15 , 2006 , at $ 65 million , " or less than 0.003 percent of the total " spent by the Iraqi Relief and Reconstruction Fund .
The State Department said details of anti-corruption efforts must be secret to protect investigators and Iraqi allies .
In a letter to Rice last week , Waxman called the department 's position " ludicrous . "
Fellow Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky agreed .
" It 's pretty clear that the administration just wants to muzzle any comments that reflect negatively on the [ al - ]
Maliki government , " he said .
Earlier , the former head of the Iraqi Commission on Public Integrity , Judge Radhi Hamza al - Radhi , told the hearing that al - Maliki had protected family members from corruption investigations , citing Salam al - Maliki , Iraq 's former transportation minister and the prime minister 's cousin .
Al - Radhi resigned last month and fled Iraq after he and his family were attacked and 31 of his anti-corruption employees were killed .
He said corruption has affected " virtually every agency and ministry , including some of the most powerful officials in Iraq . "
" Corruption has stopped possible advances by the government on the political level , on economic reconstruction , on basic services , amenities and infrastructure and on the rule of law , " he told the committee , estimating the total lost to corruption at $ 18 billion .
In Baghdad , Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh acknowledged his country is plagued with a " high level " of corruption , but he said officials are trying to rein in the problem .
U.S. Comptroller General David Walker , head of the Government Accountability Office , said there appeared to be no U.S. plan for countering the corruption .
He urged Congress to consider conditioning future appropriations on such a plan " so we can achieve some results rather than have just more efforts . "
Waxman questioned whether Iraq 's government was " too corrupt to succeed . "
If so , he added , " We need to ask if we could , in good conscience , continue to ... prop up his regime . "

All About Condoleezza Rice • Henry Waxman • Iraq War
There is a dominating principle in sports that helps frame the nature of each individual league .
It is rooted in the fundamental principle that no player or team can peak forever .
How I interpret this is through an idea that I call the “ Timetable of Contention ” .
The idea can be used for different levels of success ( division wins , playoff appearances , etc ) , but I typically use it for championships as that is the primary goal of management .
Every team in every league ( besides baseball , which has a different system because of the lack of a salary cap and massive salary discrepancies ) has one .
In a proper Timetable of Contention , a team could reasonably win a championship in those years .
Naturally , they would not every year , but they would be in the likely pool of champions , which has held pretty firm in the NBA for my entire lifetime .
Typically , these are defined and limited by a few central factors which I will detail below along with numerous other minor ones .
What I plan to do over the coming weeks is to analyze each and every NBA team with this lens in a feature now titled “ Framework of a Franchise ” , though I ’m totally open to suggestions for better titles .
My basic goal is to determine a reasonable Timetable of Contention for each team , noting potential deviations or alternate ones as well , accompanied by analysis of the roster and discussion of which current pieces fit in with my proposed timetable and which ones do not , as well as some ways to convert non-fitting parts into the greater scheme ( trades , potential draft picks , and signings ) as well as one potential roster that would fit in with that philosophy .
The Key Factors :
– Effectiveness and Ability of a Star Player ( Suns are limited to however long Steve Nash can maintain his current level of performance or reasonably close to it )
– Current Talent Level ( The Cavaliers do not have adequate talent to compete for titles in the immediate term )
- Roster / Cap flexibility ( If and when a team will have the ability to meaningfully change their roster , either through reasonable trades or using cap space to bring in new talent )
– Development of young players ( It will take 2 - 4 years for the young core of the Timberwolves to be at a meaningful level of contribution )
– Deterioration of older players ( When will Tim Duncan lose effectiveness ? )
First Up : The New York Knicks
Where they are now :
The Knicks are unquestionably a lottery - bound squad that has talent , but major chemistry issues and mis-mashed players bog the squad down .
The other significant factor that must be discussed when talking about the Knicks is their salary cap situation .
The Knicks are essentially $ 30 million over the salary cap this year , closer to doubling the cap than approaching it , which is jarring to say the least given their record and future prospects ( at least in the near future ) .
However , New York does have some compelling pieces , including David Lee , who I see primarily as a great energy PF off the bench ( but phenomenal in that role ) , Renaldo Balkman who can develop into a dynamic NBA SF , and Mardy Collins , who has interesting potential as a guard .
The Timetable of Contention : Unlike many other teams , the Knicks have some very clear restrictions on their Timetable .
First of all , they have an inordinate amount of long - term contracts , which help set the stage .
Secondly , their level of talent is glaring proof that they will need to add talent through the draft , trades , and free agency in order to make meaningful strides in their division and conference .
For all intents and purposes , the Knicks are stuck over the cap and the luxury tax for both the current season and the 2008 - 2009 campaign .
Ideally , they would be able to break the shackles of their contracts following that season ( when Lebron James could enter Free Agency assuming he opts out of his current deal at that time ) , yet their $ 58 m in committed salary for that season with a salary cap somewhere around $ 61 m at that point makes that an unlikely solution .
As such , the Knicks should be targeting the 2010 - 2011 season and the few years subsequent as their optimal Timetable of Contention .
How to Utilize that Timetable :
While most people see the Knicks ’ situation as a huge negative , there are numerous positives that become much more evident with a more clear and specified plan of attack .
First of all , there is their James Dolan ’s ( their owner ) willingness to pay the luxury tax .
Because of the Knicks ’ revenue structure , Mr. Dolan is willing to hemorrhage millions upon millions of dollars for a putrid team .
Imagine what he would do with the potential of taking his team to the playoffs or possibly bringing a championship back to New York City .
This may not sound like a huge deal to some people , but it can be a significant piece of making a competitive team .
Take the example of the Phoenix Suns - their ownership being unwilling to pay the luxury tax has forced them to sell all their late round picks for fractions of their worth in terms of improving the depth of the team , a fatal flaw which could definitely prevent them from winning an NBA title with Steve Nash in his prime .
If the Knicks can pull talent , they can keep it there with Dolan ’s deep pockets , and that means the world .
The other huge advantage for the Knicks is the situation surrounding the franchise .
Players can be drawn to the team because it is a “ glamour franchise ” in the NBA and in the city where an entrepreneur player could make significantly more money than just their contract .
One astonishing example of this is the rumored clause in Lebron James ’
Nike contract , which has what is referred to as a “ location escalator clause ” , which in short means Nike would pay Mr. James significantly more money should he end up in a big market like NYC or Los Angeles .
These factors work well to make the Knicks a more desirable location ( along with NYC being a much more fun place to live than cities like Indianapolis and Minneapolis for most NBA players ) .
What these factors allow the Knicks to do is take a different strategy that requires a lot of intestinal fortitude and potentially a little luck .
In short , what the Knicks should do is go all out in following this strategy , and picking a date in the near future ( probably somewhere around the start of next season ) and articulate this strategy publicly .
I ’ll go into the reasons in a bit .
The first element in this plan is to move every contract that expires before the timetable goes into effect .
Each and every year there are teams angling to get under the cap for the following offseason to try and pull some free agents ( or better re-sign their own ) and cutting long - term money has its own benefits as well .
As such , this turns some of the Knicks ’ absolute worst contracts into significant strengths .
This offseason , Stephon Marbury ’s contract turns into a $ 21.9 m expiring deal , and Malik Rose will have a $ 7.6 m one for himself .
Also , given next year ’s potential Free Agent market , there will be many teams interested in establishing space , especially if some players who are Restricted Free Agents this coming offseason simply take a qualifying offer and play for Unrestricted Free Agency the following off - season like Mickael Pietrus essentially did this year .
The following off - season would make Quentin Richardson and Jerome James ’ deals follow the same path .
Another key point is that the Knicks simply cannot add any contracts that will push them beyond this 2010 / 2011 deadline , except rookies of course .
That means no Mid-Level exceptions deal for more than a year or two and no acquiring of players who have longer contracts than that .
In fact , getting Zach Randolph ’s overpaid self jeopardizes the Knicks ’ ability to even use that year , as they have around $ 40 m committed to that season right now with his $ 17.3 m .
The key benefit of announcing ( and following through on ) this plan is that it allows the Knicks to be a factor in the negotiations and thoughts of potential free agents in relevant years before that point .
If a guy like Rudy Gay is looking at either signing an extension in 2009 / 2010 with Memphis or taking the Qualifying Offer for the following year and becoming an Unrestricted Free Agent in 2010 / 2011 , the possibility of the Knicks offering the max to him might change his decision - making process in a meaningful way .
Additionally , this strategy would allow the fans to see that there is a clear direction and move towards playing guys who could be actual parts of the Knicks ’ long - term vision ( Lee , Balkman , Collins , draft picks ) instead of wasting minutes on guys like Jared Jeffries and Quentin Richardson in the interim years .
Also , by making this policy public , they could foster an extremely compelling environment for players who would love to have an opportunity to make an impression and would take a shorter contract if promised playing time .
This could be with D - League and Summer League studs ( like the Warriors and Kelenna Azibuike ) or through signing high - potential players like James
White to one or two - year partially guaranteed contracts .
If even one of those players becomes a success , it could pay dividends in the future .
Implementation : Since the Knicks have no expiring contracts , there are no players that require immediate dumping .
However , it would be logical for them to look for deals with teams that are already working to clear cap for the 2009 offseason .
Two teams that are looking at this already are the Portland Trailblazers and the Minnesota Timberwolves .
Neither team can get under the cap in a meaningful way for the coming off - season , but have the pieces to do so for 2009 .
As such , any team with the willingness to take players off their hands which complicate this would be compensated handsomely for it .
Interestingly , the T - Wolves also have some big expiring contracts , which could be then used to pass along to a team desiring that in a three - way trade that could make each team better .
One of these is a potential deal between the Knicks , T - Wolves , and Pacers which would send Stephon Marbury ’s 2009 expiring to Minnesota with their expiring contracts going to Indiana and the Pacers sending Jermaine O’Neal and his bloated contract to the Knicks .
RealGM
Trade ID # 4408404 fits the bill pretty well ( imagine it with Indy ’s Top - 12 protected 1st round pick going to the T - Wolves and probably the Knicks 2009 2nd rounder ) , with Indiana getting to $ 11 m under the cap going into this offseason and losing some significant long - term salary and the Wolves getting another pick and losing no talent .
There is also an alternate trade that includes Ike Diogu , but I like this one better .
A similar move with Seattle involving Luke Ridnour and / or Earl Watson for cap space works as well .
Also , taking on Darius Miles ’ contract from the Blazers ( and presumably buying him out ) in exchange for a PG like Sergio Rodriguez , Taurean Green , or Jarrett Jack would be a smart move as well .
In this year ’s draft , the Knicks need to get either their PG or C of the future .
Those are the two most important positions to fill on any NBA squad , and they should actually have the chance to get a guy who would fit that niche .
If I were the GM , I would look most closely at Brook Lopez , a guy who has the skill to be both an offensive monster and a defensive presence and can run the well surprisingly well for a 7 - footer .
Bringing in a developmental PG is also essential , whether it be through a trade with a team like Portland or through buying another pick / using their 2nd rounder .
For the time being , the Knicks have enough SG / SF players to get by , but that would be a priority in future years , though they are by far the easiest positions to fill .
Assuming that the Knicks move guys like Marbury and Malik Rose for things which do not dramatically improve the team , this is one potential 2010 / 2011 Knicks line - up at the start of their Timetable of Contention :
PG : Brandon Jennings or Jrue Holliday ( 2009 1st Round Pick ) / Sergio Rodriguez ( trade w/ Portland )
SG : Jamal Crawford ( Expiring ) / Mardy Collins
SF : Rudy Gay ( Maxed out ) / Renaldo Balkman / Wilson Chandler
PF : David Lee / Zach Randolph ( Expiring ) / 2010 1st Rounder ( DeMarcus Cousins is an option )
C : Brook Lopez ( 2008 1st Rounder - now 3rd Year Pro ) / Eddy Curry ( Expiring )
IR / D- League : Jared Jeffries ( Expiring ) , Jerel McNeal ( 2009 2nd Rounder ) , 2010 2nd Rounder
This team would have somewhere around $ 38 m committed to the cap for 2011 / 2012 ( that includes potential cap holds for every one of the picks and $ 6.5 m per for David Lee , $ 5.5 m per for Renaldo Balkman , and $ 2.5 m per for Mardy Collins ) .
The cap then should be somewhere around $ 68 m , so they could max out a player or two ( probably a PF like Yi Jianlian or a SG / SF like Kevin Durant ) .
Of course , they could also use the Rudy Gay money the following offseason to make an even bigger splash ( or even get Gay then since he ’s a Restricted Free Agent in 2010 and would be Unrestricted in the 2011 offseason ) .
As always , comments / suggestions are appreciated and encouraged .

CAN a group of banks succeed where the monetary authorities have failed ?
Despite the best efforts of central banks to deal with the credit crunch that took hold over the summer , some debt markets remain dysfunctional .
Buyers are still on strike in an important part of the market for commercial paper ( short - term corporate debt ) : the bit in which so - called structured investment vehicles ( SIVs ) , which have mushroomed in recent years , borrow in order to invest in higher yielding assets .
Now many of those vehicles are finding it difficult to roll over their debts and the banks that stand to lose most from their demise are scurrying for solutions .
On Monday October 15th three of the largest banks launched the first big effort by the private sector to alleviate the crisis .
Citigroup , JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America unveiled an agreement in principle for a fund , expected to be worth up to $ 100 billion , that would buy highly rated assets from troubled SIVs .
Other financial institutions are said to be considering joining .
Although no government money will be available , America 's Treasury played an important role in the talks that led to the fund 's creation .
The authorities worry that “ disorderly ” markets could drag down the economy .
SIVs suffer from the same mismatch between assets and liabilities that afflicts regulated banks : they borrow short - term and invest long - term .
This worked well when markets were humming along .
But now the mounds of mortgage - backed securities and other assets that the vehicles hold have suddenly turned horribly illiquid and their market value — to the extent that it can be ascertained — has plummeted .
Some SIVs have had to sell assets at fire - sale prices to repay investors , many of whom have become reluctant to roll over debt .
Since SIVs hold some $ 325 billion in assets , further forced sales could have a chilling effect on the prices of asset - backed securities across the board .
Banks also worry that they might be forced to take the assets of SIVs they helped to set up on to their own balance sheets .
That would put great strain on their capital ratios .
The new fund , which has been clumsily labelled the Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit , or M - LEC , will buy commercial paper issued by SIVs and then issue its own short - term debt , which will be backed by the founding banks .
It will buy assets at a “ market price ” but there is a twist .
SIVs that sell discounted securities to the conduit will share in the gains if the paper subsequently rises in value .
The aim is to overcome their reluctance to part with assets they consider undervalued by a barely functioning market .
Though comparisons have been drawn with the 1998 bail - out of Long - Term Capital Management , a hedge fund , there is a notable difference .
Back then , the Federal Reserve brought banks together to help a failing counterparty .
This time , there is an element of self - rescue .
That is certainly true of Citigroup , which has set up more SIVs than any other institution ; it is exposed to some $ 100 billion of assets held by such vehicles .
The two other co-ordinating banks have no SIVs of their own .
They seem drawn primarily by the fees they will be able to earn managing the conduit .
Whether the scheme works remains to be seen .
It looks rather like the Resolution Trust Corporation that was set up to liquidate America 's failing savings and loan institutions in the 1980s , points out Brad Hintz of Sanford Bernstein , a research firm .
But while the design is proven , the banks may struggle to reach agreement on a host of issues , not least the price at which to mark assets bought .
Though the banks say they want to get the fund off the ground within 90 days , some analysts think it will never fly .
Even those who support the fund admit that it is , at best , a temporary solution .
As one banker puts it , it is about buying time so that the real problems facing the debt markets can be sorted out .
In the case of asset - backed commercial paper , the two biggest are the inherently unstable structure of SIVs and their lack of transparency .
Not only do they sit off their creators ' balance sheets but they do not even have to publish their holdings .
Only when these underlying issues are addressed is confidence likely to return .
Ministry head denies beating estranged televangelist wife
The man accused of beating his estranged wife , televangelist Juanita Bynum , says he never hit her and that she physically abused him .
" I have been struck on the face and in the head ... with a fist , " Thomas W. Weeks III told The Atlanta Journal - Constitution in an interview published Thursday .
" I have been choked ... We had gone to counseling . "
Weeks is facing felony charges on accusations he beat Bynum in the parking lot of an Atlanta hotel in August .
Weeks has pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated assault and making terroristic threats .
He is free on $ 40,000 bond and is not allowed to have contact with Bynum .
Asked about the August incident that led to charges against him , Weeks expressed skepticism about Bynum 's account .
" A woman said to be kicked , punched , choked and brutally beaten by her husband , does she show up at the hospital four hours later ... and refuse to let the police take official pictures of all of the bruises ? "
Weeks said .
Weeks , head of Global Destiny Ministries , said his church has lost 1,600 members in recent months .
Publications and broadcasts about his stormy marriage with Bynum have not shown a complete and accurate picture , Weeks said .
Bynum 's divorce petitions have cited " cruel treatment " and said the marriage is " irretrievably broken . "
Bynum leads a ministry that also includes a gospel record label and seminar tours .
She has sold thousands of motivational books , CDs and DVDs related to empowerment and relationships .
Weeks , known to his followers as Bishop Weeks , co-wrote " Teach Me How to Love : The Beginnings " with Bynum .

Wirth is one of the most influential thinkers in the software world .
A professor at ETH Institute in Zurich , Wirth designed Pascal , Modula 2 and Oberon .
In the early 1970s , he was one of the people who proposed program development by stepwise refinment .
He 's the author of many important books , including " Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs " ( Prentice Hall , 1975 ) and " Systematic Programming " ( Prentice Hall , 1973 ) He was awarded the Turing Prize in 1984 , and has also received five honorary doctorates and several other awards .

You are one of the most influential academics .
Your work had a great impact on both the study and the practice of software development .
However , in many cases , the university environment and the " real world " are , indeed , very different .
When I talk with a professor and then with a programmer , I often notice that they think about software in very different ways .
A recent IEEE survey of what lie ahead in software revealed that there is basically no intersection between the opinions of academics and practitioners .
As one of the few whose work has been influential in both fields , what 's your opinion ( or perhaps your secret ) ?

If there is a secret at all , then it is that of being both a programmer and a professor .
The division is rather unfortunate and the source of many problems .
Professors typically spend their time in meetings about planning , policy , proposals , fund raising , consulting , interviewing , travelling , and so forth , but spend relatively little time at their drawing boards .
As a result , they lose touch with the substance of their rapidly developing subject .
They lose the ability to design ; they lose sight of what is essential ; and resign to teach academically challenging puzzles .
I have never designed a language for its own sake .
Instead , I 've always designed a language because I had a practical need that was not satisfied by languages that where already available .
For example , Modula and Oberon were by - products of the designs of the workstations Lilith ( 1979 ) and Ceres ( 1986 ) .
My being a teacher had a decisive influence on making language and systems as simple as possible so that in my teaching , I could concentrate on the essential issues of programming rather than on details of language and notation .
Yes , the drifting apart of practice and academia is unfortunate .

You probably know about the " good enough software " concept popularized by Yourdon .
In many senses , it 's just a rationalization of what 's happening in the software world : the first company hitting the market with a feature - rich product is more likely to win the battle than the careful , quality - seeking company .
Do you think there is anything developers and software organizations can do about that ?
I guess many developers would be happy to be given more time to develop better software , but at the same time they are rushed in the name of corporate survival .
" Educating the users " seems more a wild dream than a possibility .

" Good enough software " is rarely good enough .
It is a sad manifestation of the spirit of modern times , in which an individual 's pride in his / her work has become rare .
The idea that one might derive satisfaction from his or her successful work , because that work is ingenious , beautiful , or just pleasing , has become ridiculed .
Nothing but economic success and monetary reward is acceptable .
Hence our occupations have become mere jobs .
But quality of work can be expected only through personal satisfaction , dedication and enjoyment .
In our profession , precision and perfection are not a dispensible luxury , but a simple necessity .

Recently I read a final report of a research project funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation .
The project 's naive goals were identified as follows : First , how can easy programming be achieved ( in particular , for non-experts ) ?
Second , how can a mechanism be realized that allows hiding the difficult parts of parallel programming ?
After more than 30 years of programming we ought to know that the design of complex software is inherently difficult .
This despite of the fact that , for decades , the industry has been advertising programmers ' positions by claiming that programming is easy .
Later on , when doubts arose even to the advertisers , they switched to promising a wide variety of tools to facilitate the arduous tasks .
Tools became the slogan ; the right tools , paired with clever tricks and serious managenment methods , would work wonders .
Then Edsger Dijkstra called Software Engineering " Programming in spite of the fact that you can't " .
Indeed , the woes of Software Engineering are not due to lack of tools , or proper management , but largely due to lack of sufficient technical competence .
A good designer must rely on experience , on precise , logic thinking ; and on pedantic exactness .
No magic will do .
In the light of all this it is particularly sad that in many informatics curricula , programming in the large is badly neglected .
Design has become a non -topic .
As a result , software engineering has become the El Dorado for hackers .
The more chaotic a program looks , the smaller the danger that someone will take the trouble of inspecting and debunking it .

Speaking of education , many peoples think that it 's easier to learn the object oriented paradigm if you do n't have previous experience with another paradigm .

Many people tend to look at programming styles and languages like religions : if you belong to one , you can not belong to others .
But this analogy is another fallacy .
It is maintained for commercial reasons only .
Object - oriented programming ( OOP ) solidly rests on the principles and concepts of traditional procedural programming ( PP ) .
OOP has not added a single novel concept , but it emphasizes two concepts much more strongly that was done with procedural programming .
The fist such concept is that of the procedure bound to a composite variable called object .
( The binding of the procedure is the justification for it being called a method ) .
The means for this binding is the procedure variable ( or record field ) , available in languages since the mid 1970s .
The second concept is that of constructing a new data type ( called subclass ) by extending a given type ( the superclass ) .
It is worthwhile to note that along with the OOP paradigm came an entirely new terminology with the purpose of mystifying the roots of OOP .
Thus , whereas you used to be able to activate a procedure by calling it , one now sends a message to the method .
A new type is no longer built by extending a given type , but by defining a subclass which inherits its superclass .
An interesting phenomenon is that many people learned for the first time about the important notions of data type , of encapsulation , and ( perhaps ) of information hiding when introduced to OOP .
This alone would have made the introduction to OOP worthwhile , even if one did n't actually make use of its essence later on .
Nevertheless , I consider OOP as an aspect of programming in the large ; that is , as an aspect that logically follows programming in the small and requires sound knowledge of procedural programming .
Static modularization is the first step towards OOP .
It is much easier to understand and master than full OOP , it 's sufficient in most cases for writing good software , and is sadly neglected in most common languages ( with the exception of Ada ) .
In a way , OOP falls short of its promises .
Our ultimate goal is extensible programming ( EP ) .
By this , we mean the construction of hierarchies of modules , each module adding new functionality to the system .
EP implies that the addition of a module is possible without any change in the existing modules .
They need not even be recompiled .
New modules not only add new procedures , but - more importantly - also new ( extended ) data types .
We have demonstrated the practicality and economy of this approach with the design of the Oberon System .

Recently I come across an advertisement for Borland Delphi ( which as you know is a sort of O.O. Pascal with extensions for event handling ) that said " Delphi 2.0 gives developers a language almost as readable as BASIC ... " .
Apparently it was a quote from a review of the product .
But it sounded so terribly wrong to me .
" Almost as readable " as a language without a sound notion of data type ?
On the other hand , we cannot hide the fact that to a large extent , basic ( Visual Basic ) has won on the market , and is probably the first example of a commercial language with a huge market of components .
As the father of Pascal , what is your opinion ?
Did basic really win ?

We must be careful with words like " readable " , " user friendly " , etc .
They are vague at best , and often refer to taste and established habits .
But what is conventional need not necessarily also be convenient .
In the context of programming langauges , perhaps " readable " should be replaced by " amenable to formal reasoning " .
For example , mathematical formulas are hardly what we might praise as easily readable , but they allow the formal derivation of properties that could not be obtained from a vague , fuzzy , informal , user friendly circumscription .
The construct WHILE B DO S END has the remarkable property that you may rely on B being false after the statement 's execution , independent of S .
And if you find a property P that is left invariant by S , you may assume that also P holds upon termination .
It is this kind of reasoning that helps in the reliable derivation of programs , and that dramatically reduces the time wasted on testing and debugging .
Good languages not only rest on mathematical concepts which make logical reasoning about programs possible , but also on a small number of concepts and rules that can freely be combined .
If the definition of a language requires fat manuals of hundred pages and more , and if the definition refers to a mechanical model of execution ( i.e. to a computer ) , this must be taken as a sure symptom of inadequacy .
But alas , in this respect , 1960 ' Algol was far ahead of most of its successors , in particular of all those that are so popular today .

For instance , in many cases C++ programmers would be happy to use a safer version of the language : not all of them are so concerned with 100 % compatibility with C. A version of C++ were pointers and arrays are clearly separated , and were you get a warning when ( e.g. ) you assign a float to a long , and so on , would help them to write better programs and still not require to learn a completely new language .
I understand that it is more pleasing to design a pure language than trying to make a fragile one safer , but then , if just a handful of peoples use this pure language , are we really advancing the state of the software development ?

Is n't the software development community focusing too much on technical issues , forgetting that software development is mostly a human activity ?
For instance , I think that one of the reasons for the popularity of BASIC and C is that their relative lack of constraints allows for some " local solutions " ( euphemism for patch :-) to be introduced late in the development cycle .
We all know that we should carefully design software before going to code .
But we also know very well that , in most cases , management does not want to pay now for long term benefits .
This is one of the reasons some peoples are not so happy with OOP .
Hence , software is routinely patched when it 's already in an advanced state of development .
A language that lets that happen without too much concern will be more widely used than one which requires a large investment in up - front design .
But then we continue to bash programmers for being " dirty " when in fact they are just playing in the real world , not in an ideal world .

Software development is technical activity conducted by human beings .
It is no secret that human beings suffer from imperfection , limited reliability , and impatience - among other things .
Add to it that they have become demanding , which leads to the request for rapid , high performance in return for the requested high salaries .
Work under constant time pressure , however , results in unsatisfactory , faulty products .
Generally , the hope is that corrections will not only be easy , because software is immaterial , but that the custormers will be willing to share the cost .
We know of much better ways to design software than is common practice , but they are rarely followed .
I know of a particular , very large software producer that explicitly assumes that design takes 20 % of developers ' time , and debugging takes 80 % .
Although internal advoctates of an 80 % design time vs. 20 % debugging time have not only proven that their ratio is realistic , but also that it would improve the company 's tarnished image .
Why , then , is the 20 % design time approach preferred ?
Because with 20 % design time your product is on the market earlier than that of a competitor consuming 80 % design time .
And surveys show that the customer at large considers a shaky but early product as more attractive than a later product , even if it is stable and mature .
Who is to blame for this state of affairs ?
The programmer turned hacker ; the manager under time pressure ; the business man compelled to extol profit wherever possible ; or the customer believing in promised miracles ?

It seems to me that most modern programming languages are feature - loaded to the point that many programs require 20 % of the language ( or less ) .
But most of these features are about increased flexibility , not about increased safety .
For instance , the old rule " declare before use " was a recognition that programmers make errors , and enforcing that rule allowed the compilers to detect some errors .
Likewise , the " obsolete " clause in Eiffel is a recognition that some portions of the code become obsolete , but without a compile - time warning most programmers will continue to rely on them .
Who has the time to read comments and documentation when the product must ship immediately ?
However , while I 've seen red - hot debates about the usefulness of a " finally " clause in C++ , I 've seen a relatively small interest in how to protect the programmers ( as humans ) from themselves .

The wealth of features of many languages is indeed a problem rather than a solution .
A multitude of features is another consequence of the programmers ' belief that the value of a language is proportional to the quantity of its features and facilities , bells and whistles .
However , we know that it is better if each basic concept is represented by a single , designated language construct .
Not only does this reduce the effort of learning , but it reduces the volume of the language 's description and thereby the possibilities of inconsistency and of misunderstanding .
Keeping a language as simple and as regular as possible has always been a guideline in my work ; the description of Pascal took some 50 pages , that of Modula 40 , and Oberon 's a mere 16 pages .
This I still consider to have been genuine progress .
The relevant value of high - level programming languages depends on the quality and suitability of the abstractions they offer .
An example is the abstraction called number , or that of a logical ( truth ) value , replacing concrete bit strings .
The value of such an abstraction rests on its integrity .
In the case of numbers , only arithmetic operations must be applicable , independent of the fact that also logical operations could be applied to the bitstrings representing the numbers .
Another case is the notion of the array with a given number of elements identified by ordinal numbers ( indices ) .
It must be guaranteed that no element can be accessed with an invalid index , despite the fact that the resulting address computation would point to some existing storage cell - probably holding another variable .
The abstraction we 're talking about here is the important concept of data type , and we point out that its value rests on the fact that a compiler will verify that the rules governing the types are obeyed , that the compiler will guarantee the abstraction 's integrity .
If a system fails to do this , if it allows a logical operation to be performed on numbers , or if it fails to indicate array access with invalid index - just to name two examples - it is hardly worth being called a high - level language system .
However , most widely used systems are exactly of this nature , and the offered abstraction can be violated freely with the added " benefit " of innumerable software tools that help inspect how the abstraction is in fact represented internally in order to find out what went wrong .
It is particularly ironical that languages with fixed structural patterns for statements and data types , and with constructs for modularization and information hiding , are widely regarded as restrictive , cumbersome , and creativity - hindering .
Indeed , programming with a structured , strongly typed language usually requires a greater amount of careful deliberation , and this is considered as detrimental ( remember that programming is advertised as being easy ) .
The irony of the matter is that the time gained by not having been required to comply with structural rules , is lost many times over by finding errors later on - in the field , perhaps by the dissatisfied customer .
The weather forecast promises not much change .
The concepts and the languages enabling a beneficial development of programming into a serious engineering profession have been with us for many years , but they remained largely unused , and the trend rather leads further away from them instead .
It looks like software will remain a hackers ' El Dorado for some time to come .
Certainly , computers will not complain .
I remember a long discussion in an academic seminar in the mid 1970s , when the word " software crisis " was in full swing and the notion of correctness proofs of programs was put forward as a possible remedy .
Professor C.A.R. [ Tony ]
Hoare , the speaker at the seminar , had eloquently presented the principles and the advantages of correctness proofs replacing testing .
After a long discussion about the pros and cons Jim Morris [ department head at Carnegie Mellon University and developer of principles like inter- module protection and lazy evaluation ] got up and disarmingly asked : " But Tony , what is your answer if we frankly confess that we dearly love debugging ?
You want us to abandon our most cherished enjoyment ? "
Yet , I am convinced that there is a need for high quality software , and the time will come when it will be recognized that it is worth investing effort in its development and in using a careful , structured approach based on safe , structured languages .
For the time being , however , this is practicable only for some " niche products " .
The niche will expand when a growing number of people will voice their dissatisfaction with poor software .
The wealth of features of many languages is indeed a problem rather than a solution .
A multitude of features is another consequence of the programmers ' belief that the value of a language is proportional to the quantity of its features and facilities , bells and whistles .
However , we know that it is better if each basic concept is represented by a single , designated language construct .
Not only does this reduce the effort of learning , but it reduces the volume of the language 's description and thereby the possibilities of inconsistency and of misunderstanding .
Keeping a language as simple and as regular as possible has always been a guideline in my work ; the description of Pascal took some 50 pages , that of Modula 40 , and Oberon 's a mere 16 pages .
This I still consider to have been genuine progress .
The relevant value of high - level programming languages depends on the quality and suitability of the abstractions they offer .
An example is the abstraction called number , or that of a logical ( truth ) value , replacing concrete bit strings .
The value of such an abstraction rests on its integrity .
In the case of numbers , only arithmetic operations must be applicable , independent of the fact that also logical operations could be applied to the bitstrings representing the numbers .
Another case is the notion of the array with a given number of elements identified by ordinal numbers ( indices ) .
It must be guaranteed that no element can be accessed with an invalid index , despite the fact that the resulting address computation would point to some existing storage cell - probably holding another variable .
The abstraction we 're talking about here is the important concept of data type , and we point out that its value rests on the fact that a compiler will verify that the rules governing the types are obeyed , that the compiler will guarantee the abstraction 's integrity .
If a system fails to do this , if it allows a logical operation to be performed on numbers , or if it fails to indicate array access with invalid index - just to name two examples - it is hardly worth being called a high - level language system .
However , most widely used systems are exactly of this nature , and the offered abstraction can be violated freely with the added " benefit " of innumerable software tools that help inspect how the abstraction is in fact represented internally in order to find out what went wrong .
It is particularly ironical that languages with fixed structural patterns for statements and data types , and with constructs for modularization and information hiding , are widely regarded as restrictive , cumbersome , and creativity - hindering .
Indeed , programming with a structured , strongly typed language usually requires a greater amount of careful deliberation , and this is considered as detrimental ( remember that programming is advertised as being easy ) .
The irony of the matter is that the time gained by not having been required to comply with structural rules , is lost many times over by finding errors later on - in the field , perhaps by the dissatisfied customer .
The weather forecast promises not much change .
The concepts and the languages enabling a beneficial development of programming into a serious engineering profession have been with us for many years , but they remained largely unused , and the trend rather leads further away from them instead .
It looks like software will remain a hackers ' El Dorado for some time to come .
Certainly , computers will not complain .
I remember a long discussion in an academic seminar in the mid 1970s , when the word " software crisis " was in full swing and the notion of correctness proofs of programs was put forward as a possible remedy .
Professor C.A.R. [ Tony ]
Hoare , the speaker at the seminar , had eloquently presented the principles and the advantages of correctness proofs replacing testing .
After a long discussion about the pros and cons Jim Morris [ department head at Carnegie Mellon University and developer of principles like inter- module protection and lazy evaluation ] got up and disarmingly asked : " But Tony , what is your answer if we frankly confess that we dearly love debugging ?

Rocketing global oil prices could force the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer to stamp out fears of spiralling inflation , analysts have warned .
After supply cuts from producers ' cartel Opec , and predictions that global energy demand will remain strong , the cost of a barrel of Brent Crude rose by well over $ 1 on Friday , to close at $ 73.93 , near the all - time highs of last summer .
With commodities experts predicting the market will remain tight for the rest of the year , Karen Ward , chief UK economist at HSBC , said oil price rises could add up to 0.5 per cent to the inflation rate over the coming months : and that would mean yet more rate increases .
' Unless it 's very clear that consumers are reacting to higher rates and higher prices , then the Bank of England are going to take a hard line , and there will be more rate hikes on the back of it , ' she warned .
In the long term , sky - high oil costs tend to depress household spending , slamming the brakes on economic growth ; but first , they push up inflation .
With the Bank keen to signal that it will keep a lid on rising prices , after inflation shot up to 3.1 per cent earlier this year , David Brown , chief European economist at Bear Stearns , agreed that hawkish rate - setters could now keep borrowing costs higher , for longer .
' It 's a reinforcement tool for central banks to keep the tightening bias intact , ' he said .
The Bank 's nine - member monetary policy committee has increased rates five times since last August , and made clear it wants to keep a grip on consumers ' perceptions of the rising cost of living .
' In the UK , it 's the threat of inflation imagined , as much as inflation in reality , ' said Brown .
' They will keep on waving this big stick about . '
A prolonged period of higher rates would raise the risk of a hard landing in the booming housing market .
Economists at the Bank of America this weekend added their voices to predictions of a slowdown , saying homes were 20 per cent overvalued , and there was a one - in - five chance of a crash next year or in 2009 .
There is already evidence that higher borrowing costs are causing pain for UK Plc.
Analysis by accountants Ernst and Young shows UK firms issued 191 profit warnings in the first half of the year - 13 per cent higher than the same period a year ago .
The impact of higher oil prices on inflation could be compounded by the rising costs of other commodities .
World food prices , in particular , have shot up as farm land is gobbled up to grow subsidised biofuels , and droughts in Australia exacerbate shortages .
The summer energy price spike is also likely to frustrate the hopes of US investors for a confidence - boosting rate cut from the Federal Reserve over the next few months .
Kona Haque , senior commodities editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit , predicts that the cost of oil will remain around $ 70 a barrel for the rest of the year , and throughout 2008 , as Opec producers aim for high prices .
“ Too soon old and too late smart . ”
That saying was one of my Dad ’s favorites , and one he used when one of us in the family re-made a past mistake , having not learned from the first error .
I am guilty of that in regard to the current game being played by Commentary ’s Gabriel Schoenfeld and his Goebbels - wannabes at the National Review , the American Thinker , and other organs of the Israel - first media .
Mr. Schoenfeld has accused me of leaking information to the media about an Islamist fighter / ideologue who was rendered to Egypt from Croatia in 1995 .
On the basis of this supposed action on my part , Mr. Schoenfeld compares me to Philip Agee and argues that the accused Israeli spy Larry Franklin did nothing worse than I did .
Even for Commentary , the sweep of this “ Big Lie ” is impressive .
Now , let us settle first things first .
Even a mediocre former CIA officer  and I like to believe that I was at least that  will do a Google search to find out what is available in the open - source world on the subject a journalist wants to speak to him or her about .
This is especially true when the journalist is a European who , these days , is likely to be anti-American , especially on the subject of rendition .
The Google search I did on the 1995 rendition in question , turned up all of the information that is contained in the article that has Mr. Schoenfled and his acolytes in their current let ’s - hang - Scheuer - to - clear - Larry - Franklin snit .
A few examples follow from a quick search using Google News .
 “ Talaat Fouad Qassem , 38 , a known leader of the Al - Gama ’a al - Islamiyya ( the Islamic Group ) , an Egyptian extremist organization , is arrested and detained in Croatia as he travels to Bosnia from Denmark , where he has been been living after being granted political asylum .
He is suspected of clandestine support of terrorist operations , including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
He also allegedly led mujaheddin efforts in Bosnia since 1990 .
In a joint operation , he is arrested by Croatian intelligence agents and handed over to the CIA .
Qassem is then interrogated by US officials aboard a US ship off the Croatian coast in the Adriatic Sea and sent to Egypt , which has a rendition agreement with the US .
An Egyptian military tribunal has already sentenced him to death in absentia , and he is executed soon after he arrives .
[ Associated Press ,
10/31/1995 ; Wash Post ,
3/11/02 , A01 ; Mahle , 05 , pp. 204-205 ; New Yorker , 2/8/05 ] ” ( CRHC )
 “ A second and more sophisticated form of cooperation aims at impeding Islamist activity in Western countries , and using legal means to track down fugitive activists with the minimum of fuss .
The third form of security cooperation involves the collaboration of Egyptian and Western security authorities in executing sensitive operations , including the tracing or arrest of Islamists , possibly across international borders , as in the case of Talaat Fouad Qassem . ”
Al - Ahram Weekly , 22 - 28 October 1998 , Issue No.400 .
 “ With Bosnian war hostilities drawing to a close in September 1995 , Anwar Shaaban and his Italian - based Al - Gama ’at al - Islamiyya cohorts were free to turn their attention and resources to issues of “ more critical ” importance .
In late September , one of the most important Al - Gama ’at al - Islamiyya leaders hiding in Europe  Abu Talal al - Qasimy ( a.k.a. Talaat Fouad Qassem )  was captured by Croat HVO forces as he attempted to cross through Croatian territory into Bosnia - Herzegovina .
Within days , the Croats quietly rendered al - Qasimy through U.S. custody into the hands of Egyptian authorities .
At the time , a government official in Cairo noted , “ [ Al - Qasimy ’s ] arrest proves what we have always said , which is that these terror groups are operating on a worldwide scale , using places like Afghanistan and Bosnia to form their fighters who come back to the Middle East European countries like Denmark , Sweden , Switzerland , England and others , which give sanctuary to these terrorists , should now understand it will come back to haunt them where they live . ”
By , Evan F. Kohlmann , The Afghan - Bosnian Mujahideen Network in Europe , ( 04 )
There are a dozen or more other pre-2007 , open - source descriptions of this operation available ( citations on request ) , so we can safely assume that nothing new has been revealed in 2007 , and Mr. Schoenfeld , et . al are either unaware of the Google news search capability , or they are playing for bigger game than a creaky and unimportant former CIA officer like me .
The truth is , of course , that Mr. Schoenfeld and his allies are not dumb people , they are simply anti-American .
Their tarting - up of the rendition operation described above is just part of their ongoing attempt to discredit the case and to try to convince Americans that U.S. and Israeli interests are identical , and so spying on America for Israel  and suborning American citizens to commit treason  is really an okay and even admirable activity .
Time will tell what the final verdicts will be , but Mr. Schoenfeld , et . al are clearly guilty of trying to create an environment in which the U.S. public accepts the idea that engaging in espionage against their own country on Israel ’s behalf is consonant with the duties of American citizenship .
Finally , I wish to directly refute Mr. Schoenfeld ’s claim that I “ cast aspersions on American Jews . ”
I do not cast aspersions , I forthrightly damn , and pray that God damns , any American  Jew , Catholic , Evangelical , Irish , German , Hindu , hermaphrodite , thespian , or otherwise  who flogs the insane idea that American and Israeli interests are one and the same .
The nation - state of Israel is an intolerable burden to the treasury and security of the United States , and Washington ’s current relationship with Israel  sanctioned by the AIPAC - funded political leaders of both parties  is one of several factors that are leading to full - scale American participation in other peoples ’ religious wars , religious wars that David Horowitz ’s recent “ Islamofascist Awareness Week ” manifestly wants to bring to the streets of the United States .
Dell agreed to ship PCs and laptops with the Ubuntu operating system after more than 130,000 people promoted the notion on the company 's IdeaStorm web site .
It would seem , however , that only a fraction of these zealots were willing to back their votes with cash .
Dell has shipped close to 40,000 systems pre-installed with the Ubuntu flavor of Linux , according to multiple sources .
By most accounts , that 's a heck of a total for what remains more or less a fringe operating system .
Ubuntu fans are urged to hold back their virtual quills of vitriol following that last sentence and remember that the OS trails major desktop and notebook OSes by quite a margin .
David Lord , a spokesman at Dell , declined to discuss the 40,000 figure , saying the company " does not break out " those types of numbers .
Lord was , of course , willing to say that , " Adoption has been very good " and the IdeaStorm push where Dell asks customers to promote things they would like to see represents " a two - way street " where Dell hopes users " will vote with their minds and wallets . "
The Ubuntu experiment marks the second time Dell has flirted with letting any old customer order a Linux PC off its web site .
Grizzled open source warriors will remember CEO Michael Dell telling the 2000 LinuxWorld that " the only thing growing faster than Linux is the number of Linux systems Dell is shipping " after Dell revealed that Red Hat Linux would appear across its entire computer and server line .
Dell quickly gave up on a broad Linux desktop push , citing a lack of demand .
More inquisitive types came up with other reasons for Dell 's Linux abandonment .
Is 40,000 units over a number of months enough to keep Dell interested ?
Your guess is as good as ours .
The company sells about 10 m machines per quarter .

Bryan Pesta ran a popular atheist / agnostic group on MySpace .
At last count , it was over 31,000 members strong .
Technically , that made it the largest organized group of atheists / agnostics in the country .
However , that group no longer exists .
Recently , hackers broke into the group profile and essentially killed it .
They renamed it “ jesus is love . ”
The 3000 “ friends ” of the group are gone .
The regular posters on the group ’s message board have been banned .
Many discussion threads were deleted .
I can’t even access the renamed group .
Bryan is working on getting his group back , but things are n’t looking bright .
He told me he was having difficult getting customer service at MySpace to listen to him .

David Brooks , in an otherwise fawning column about Mike Huckabee , conceded that “ his foreign policy thinking is thin . ”
That 's a dramatic understatement .
Reporter : I do n’t know to what extent you have been briefed or been able to take a look at the NIE report that came out yesterday ...
Huckabee : I ’m sorry ?
Reporter : The NIE report , the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran .
Have you been briefed or been able to take a look at it — Huckabee : No. Reporter : Have you heard of the finding ?
Huckabee : No .
First , I suspect Huckabee is busy , but he can't pick up a newspaper ?
Second , imagine the response if a leading Democratic candidate had no idea what the NIE is .
" [ Doctoring photos is ] potentially a form of human engineering that could be applied to us against our knowledge and against our wishes , and we ought to be vigilant about it , " said UC Irvine psychologist Elizabeth Loftus , who designed the study .
" ... as a society we have to figure how we can regulate this . "
" Any media that employ digitally doctored photographs will have a stronger effect than merely influencing our opinion -- by tampering with our malleable memory , they may ultimately change the way we recall history , " says lead author Dario Sacchi .
But , here 's the thing : these subjects were n't actually at the original protests .
Their original memories also came from images -- hopefully not altered images , but certainlyimages .
Right ?
The TV newspeople did n't pick the boring pictures , did they ?
I get that doctored photos are bad .
But how much of our memories and knowledge of the past are largely determined not by " reality " but what , or how , we were shown it in the first place .
Obviously , a lot .
Therein lies the question : is it worse to see a doctored photo , or doctored reality ?
Here 's an example : search your mind for recollections about the Tiananmen " episode " in 1989 .
Can you remember anything -- anything at all -- other than that guy standing in front of the tanks ?
Do you remember who was protesting ?
Why ?
The question is n't why you do n't remember anything , hell , it was 20 years ago and a solar system away ; the question is why youremember that guy .
Are you better off for knowing this ?
Are you smarter ?
Or do you carry the false impression that you know something about which you really know nothing ?
That 's the Matrix -- not only do you have false memories , but you get to feel good about being a knowledgeable , aware , citizen of the world .
NPR runs a cult this way .
It offers an eclectic mix of topics , selectedtoyou to think you are getting depth .
You listen to NPR , and you think you 're learning , growing , becoming a Renaissance Man .
You 're not .
Sure , it beats CNN , but that 's not a battle anyone is supposed to lose .
Its target audience is insecurely intelligent people who want desperately to be intellectual and well read but who do n't actually want to read too much .
What NPR offers is sentiment ; the feeling that you know something .
That 's why when someone asks you a question about a topic you learned about from NPR , you inevitably answer using theNPR used .
Do you understand ?
Back during the election , I 'd bet people at the bar that I could tell them the reasons , using the exact same words , why they 'd vote for their candidate .
This speaks to psychiatry , of course -- and politics , and economics ... when so few bother to read primary sources , instead relying on " experts " to tell us what was in the primary sources , is altered data really going to matter ?
I 'm not for changing reality , but when you can spin a story any way you want regardless of the truth , and no one will bother to check it , what difference do facts make ?
Think about this : no one would know you altered a photo or data in a primary source article , because no one would ever actually see it .
They 'd only hearit .
( Same with references . )--- But wait , there 's more .
The two news articles aptly summarize the study , but why did theyto summarize this study ?
Well , the message was pretty important to journalists : " doctoring of photos is bad , you bad journalists who do it .
" The best line comes at the end of the one story Regulate ?
What , the use of doctored photos in the media , which is actually already regulated ?
Or the doctoring of photos anywhere -- maybe a disclaimer ?
An automatic Photoshop watermark that says " This photo altered reality with techniques other than staging , lighting , cropping , deletion of undesired photos of this event , the placing in proximity to or away from other photos , and does not fit in with the currently acceptable social narrative as determined by your betters ?
" Sorry , I 'm wrong ; the best line comes at the end of the other news story about this study Really ?
Only the ones that use doctored photos ?
Really ?
Change the way we recall history -- the old way of being told what happened was so much better ?------------A man can walk away from a news story like this and feel like they understood the point .
He can then pat himself on the back if they go look up the actual study and confirm the point .
But it 's not enough .
What 's the context ?
You say : " whaddya mean context ?
It 's science , it 's the pursuit of truth . "
Well , ok , you should go back to NPR .
Part of the problem with reading articles on line is that you do n't get to see the other articles in the issue , which together tell a story .
The study appears in In the same issue appears a well thought out article about how the media influence the " public narrative ; " another study called , " Photographs Can Distort Memory For The News " in which they find that a ( real ) photograph accompanying a news article will add memories the subject thought came from the story ; and a tie - in essay that concludes , " Taken together , the papers in this special section show how the media can shape what we believe , what we know , and what we remember .
" Do you see ?
You have a set of facts that can be manipulated endlessly to tell any story you want .
Here , a journal issue about being wary of the awesome power of the media gets used by journalists to say watch out for Photoshop .
If it was malicious , you could punch someone , but it 's not , that 's the point : the authors of the news articles probably did n't even know what else was in that journal .
They got partial information , and ran with it .
And , of course , by printing it they thus validate it .
It 's like James Joyce said , " we can never know the truth so long as we have ears and eyes . "
Actually , he did n't say that , but do you see how you paid attention ?
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A series of newsletters in the name of GOP presidential hopeful Ron Paul contain several racist remarks -- including one that says order was restored to Los Angeles after the 1992 riots when blacks went " to pick up their welfare checks . "
This is a copy of one of the " Ron Paul Political Report " newsletters , which has stirred controversy .
CNN recently obtained the newsletters -- written in the 1990s and one from the late 1980s -- after a report was published about their existence in The New Republic .
None of the newsletters CNN found says who wrote them , but each was published under Paul 's name between his stints as a U.S. congressman from Texas .
Paul told CNN's " The Situation Room " Thursday that he did n't write any of the offensive articles and has " no idea " who did .
Watch Paul 's full interview with CNN »
" When you bring this question up , you 're really saying , ' You 're a racist ' or ' Are you a racist ? '
And the answer is , ' No , I 'm not a racist , ' " he said .
Paul said he had never even read the articles with the racist comments .
See the newsletter excerpts for yourself »
" I do repudiate everything that is written along those lines , " he said , adding he wanted to " make sure everybody knew where I stood on this position because it 's obviously wrong . "
But that 's not good enough , says one political veteran .
" These stories may be very old in Ron Paul 's life , but they 're very new to the American public and they deserve to be totally ventilated , " said David Gergen , a CNN senior political analyst .
" I must say I do n't think there 's an excuse in politics to have something go out under your name and say , ' Oh by the way , I did n't write that . ' "
Paul , who is not considered a front - runner , has become an Internet phenomenon in the current race , raising tens of millions of dollars from a devoted online base , many of them young people drawn to his libertarian straight talk .
See where the money is coming from »
The controversial newsletters include rants against the Israeli lobby , gays , AIDS victims and Martin Luther King Jr. -- described as a " pro-Communist philanderer . "
One newsletter , from June 1992 , right after the LA riots , says " order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks . "
Another says , " The criminals who terrorize our cities -- in riots and on every non-riot day -- are not exclusively young black males , but they largely are .
As children , they are trained to hate whites , to believe that white oppression is responsible for all black ills , to ' fight the power , ' to steal and loot as much money from the white enemy as possible . "
In some excerpts , the reader may be led to believe the words are indeed from Paul , a resident of Lake Jackson , Texas .
In the " Ron Paul Political Report " from October 1992 , the writer describes carjacking as the " hip - hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos . "
The author then offers advice from others on how to avoid being carjacked , including " an ex-cop I know , " and says , " I frankly do n't know what to make of such advice , but even in my little town of Lake Jackson , Texas , I 've urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense .
For the animals are coming . "
In his interview with CNN , Paul said that 's language he would never use .
" People who know me , nobody is going to believe this , " he said .
" That 's just not my language .
It 's not my life . "
He added , " Martin Luther King , Rosa Parks , Ghandi , they 're the heroes [ of my life ] . "
Matt Welch , the editor - in - chief of " Reason " magazine who shares some of Paul 's beliefs on big government , says he has never heard the congressman make racist comments like those in the newsletters .
" What I think some people are looking for him to do is to say , ' OK , who wrote that ? '
I mean , there 's 20 years , give or take , worth of newsletters there , " Welch said .
Paul said the editor of publications " is responsible for daily activities . "
But he also cited " transition " and " changes " and said that some people were hired to write stories " but I did n't know their names . "
The presidential hopeful described the newsletter revelations as a " rehash " of old material dug up by his opponents because he is gaining ground with black voters due to his stance against the war in Iraq and the war on drugs .
" I am the anti-racist because I am the only candidate -- Republican or Democrat -- who would protect the minority against these vicious drug laws , " he said .
" Libertarians are incapable of being a racist , because racism is a collectivist idea . "

All About Ron Paul • Election Campaigns • Election Observation
I like Tom Friedman .
Reading his column for the past seven or so years , I have come to believe that he ’s a good guy and his column regularly provides genuine insight in a simplified format .
Several years ago though , The New Republic perfectly spotted his weakness in a throwaway comment in a larger article * calling Friedman a salesman instead of analyst .
It is true that his columns , while providing insights , are weak on analysis .
Friedman ’s strength is that he will start with a truly interesting concept that reveals something about the situation he is commenting on – but his weakness is that his analysis of that concept is poor , and often diluted by the kind of “ pox - on - both - of - their - houses ” journalism that in attempting to be objective , ends up creating a false middle ground .
This is precisely the problem with Friedman ’s latest column which suggests that Barack Obama should keep Dick Cheney as Vice President .
A weird concept which Friedman explains thus :
When negotiating with murderous regimes like Iran ’s or Syria ’s , you want Tony Soprano by your side , not Big Bird .
Mr. Obama ’s gift for outreach would be so much more effective with a Dick Cheney standing over his right shoulder , quietly pounding a baseball bat into his palm .
Friedman explains that a President Obama could say something like this to the Iranian regime if Cheney was his Vice President :
“ Look , I ’m ready to cut a deal with you guys , but I have to tell you , back home , I ’ve got Cheney on my back and he is truly craaaaazzzzy .
You guys do n’t know the half of it .
He thinks waterboarding is what you do with your grandchildren at the pool on Sunday .
I ’m not sure how much longer I can restrain him .
So maybe we should have a serious nuke talk , and , if it goes well , we ’ll back off regime change . ”
It ’s not a mind - boggling insight – that there are ways to leverage an unhinged and powerful Vice President in diplomatic talks – but it is a solid insight , and one that is often overlooked - not least it seems by the current administration .
Where I see Friedman go off the rails is in his attempt to portray Obama ’s Iran policy .
He cites Obama ’s “ inner Jimmy Carter ” as part of the reason for making this statement : “ Mr. Obama evinces little feel for generating the leverage you ’d need to make such diplomacy work . ”
I can see someone plausibly making this argument – but not without trying to square it with Obama ’s comments about being willing to launch attacks against high - value targets in Pakistan , with or without authorization from the Pakistani government .
I consider this a distinctly un-Carteresque policy .
Friedman does not want to let the nuanced and balanced approach to foreign policy that Obama has explicitly and repeatedly put forth get in the way of Friedman ’s bumper sticker approach to political commentary .
Friedman sees a hawkish hawk and a Jimmy - Carter - ish dove when in fact Cheney is a hawk in the most extreme and unhinged sense and Obama is a pragmatist .
The superficial case Friedman is trying to make – that we need both Cheneys and Obamas to make progress might be correct .
But his subtext – that Cheney represents the hardline position and that Obama represents its opposite is incorrect .
In Friedman ’s own account , Cheney does not represent so much the hardline position as the specter of an irrational man with his hand on the trigger .
Obama , as indicated by his many statements on foreign policy , does not represent the extension of Jimmy Carter ’s foreign policy – but of precisely the balanced approach that Friedman seems to be advocating .
The problem is that either ( 1 ) Friedman does not know this ; or ( 2 ) Friedman does not want to appear partisan .
Either way , it has turned a potentially interesting column into a distorted bumper sticker view of foreign policy .
footnote : I do n’t cite it because I could n’t find it .
It involved criticizing Friedman as a mere salesman instead of analyst and listed among others , William Greider as a better analyst .

I was expecting that the iPhone firmware update would simply relock unlocked iPhones so that they could only be used with AT&T .
I was wrong .
As you may know by now , after an unlocked iPhone has been upgraded with the 1.1.1 firmware it will refuse to activate with any SIM .
The technical evidence so far indicates that this was intentional by Apple .
Although the iPhone is still alive , it ’s completely useless .
It ’s essentially a brick .

Beltway insiders discount the idea , but legions of Al Gore fans are still working overtime both online and off to convince the former vice president that he should jump into the race for president this year .
Speculation about Gore 's chances of winning the Nobel Peace Prize this Friday for his work on climate change amped up the online buzz this week – and his supporters ' hopes .
Blog mentions of Gore spiked on Sunday , after The Times of London ran an article quoting two people in the know who predicted that he is likely to win the prize , according to Technorati .
That Sunday spike was also recorded by the political buzz - tracking service Wonkosphere .
A glance online shows that a significant Draft Gore movement has mushroomed in recent months , with several websites and pages on MySpace and Facebook dedicated to drafting the former presidential candidate , bestselling author and environmentalist .
On Tuesday , Gore 's admirers in California launched a signature - gathering campaign to put him on the ballot in the Golden State .
They need 26,500 qualified signatures by December 4 , says Roy Gayhart , an entrepreneur living in San Diego who is coordinating the signature - gathering effort .
That 's 500 qualified signatures from registered Democrats in each of the 53 congressional districts .
Gayhart says he established the San Diego chapter of the Draft Gore movement in February after Gore 's film An Inconvenient Truth won a couple of Oscars .
A longtime Democrat , but not an environmentalist , Gayhart says he first saw Gore 's documentary in January on DVD .
After that , he researched Gore 's activities over the past seven years on the internet , read a 2002 speech that Gore gave about the consequences of invading Iraq , and was converted into a True Believer .
" If you do n't ( do anything ) , how many people are going to be sitting in front of their computers like you are – not doing anything ? " he recalls asking himself , before he decided to make drafting Al Gore his political cause .
Gayhart says 1,200 volunteers in California are involved in the Draft Gore campaign .
They began gathering signatures at a campaign event Monday in Cupertino , California , where Gore spoke about the environment at De Anza College .
Gayhart says they 've already gathered a couple hundred signatures .
Says Gayhart : " He has said in a Time magazine article in May , that ' I have no plans , I do n't know what it would take for me to run for president .
I guess I 'd know it if I saw it . ' "
" Well , " Gayhart says , " this is it . "
200,000 Dead , Impeached , A Draft Dodger , Can’t Republicans Do Better ?
People around the world are asking : What has happened to the United States of America ?
The United States has become an insane asylum , and the patients have taken over .
Or , it ’s The Lord Of The Flies , and Orange Elvis is The Lord .
With 200,000 dead …
Wow .
What a time for solar energy .
On top of recent gains in plastic and thin - film photovoltaics the University of Delaware now reports the world ’s most efficient solar cell at 42.8 % — if the finding is confirmed it will boost high - end PV output an incredible 2.1 % over the previous record set by Boeing - subsidiary SpectroLab last December ( see my presentation of their approach at MIT Technology Review : “ Ultra- efficient Photovoltaics ” ) .
The University of Delaware advance is notable for ( a ) the incredible consortium assembled to bring together the multiple PV cells employed in the record - breaking cell , ( b ) the role of government funding — in this case its dollars from DARPA that were yanked out of the hands of another set of researchers developing plastic solar cells , and ( c ) the comeback it represents for Allen Barnett , the University of Delaware scientist leading the effort .
Barnett founded what was once the most successful solar U.S. solar producer , AstroPower , which made its mark producing photovoltaics from recycled silicon wafers .
The firm took a blow when the tech bubble burst and semiconductor manufacturing slowed , causing a shortage of recycled wafers , and was then destroyed by an accounting scandal .
GE picked up AstroPower ’s assets in bankruptcy proceedings in 2004 — adding one more piece in the energy giant ’s sweep into renewable energy ( see “ The Greening of GE ” for more on that story ) .

Hatton is floored by Mayweather 's stunning left hook
Manchester 's Hatton , 29 , applied most of the pressure in the early rounds and found some success with some big lefts .
But Mayweather let his hands go in the middle rounds , with his fierce left finding its target as Hatton attacked .
And the champion floored Hatton with two big lefts in the 10th before ending it with a devastating left hook .
Official figures put the British attendance at 4,000 , but there must have been close to three times that number in the MGM Grand Arena by the time the bell rang for the opening round .
With the strains of Blue Moon still ringing in his ears , light - welterweight king Hatton started quicker and wobbled Mayweather with two big right hands in the first round .
Mayweather started to find his range in round two , landing with one sweet right from way back , although Hatton appeared to nick the third courtesy of some powerful lefts to the body .
606 : DEBATE
Mayweather proved exactly why he's the best in the business
MS
Hometown fighter Mayweather stepped up a gear in round four , sending home one huge right to the head and picking the challenger off with some dazzling combinations .
Hatton 's corner went to work on a cut over his left eye at the end of the round and it was becoming clear that the champion 's slick shots were taking their toll .
Mayweather was happy to soak up Hatton 's constant pressure in round five , but round six proved to be the turning point of the fight , with Mayweather landing at will with flashing left hooks and jabs and Hatton having a point deducted by referee Joe Cortez for clubbing right to the back of the neck .
Surprisingly , Mayweather was happy to fight inside for long periods and by the seventh round it was clear he was as strong as Hatton and had the measure of him at close range .
He continued to pick Hatton off with counters before jolting ' The Hitman ' with a crunching right hand just before the end of the round .
Mayweather started to show the full range of his talents in round eight , sending home a stinging right cross and a left - right combination to the body that had Hatton grimacing .
Mayweather then let go with two lefts that sent Hatton reeling before befuddling Hatton further with nine or 10 unanswered punches .
Hatton became an easier target the longer the fight wore on , and in the battle of the jabs , Mayweather was king , landing 40 % to the Englishman 's 17 % .
I 'm the best at light - welter and I fought the best at welter
Ricky Hatton
Round nine was all Mayweather , the Michigan native teeing off on Hatton with quicksilver lefts and stiff rights and finishing off the round with two stabbing jabs .
Before the 10th round , Hatton 's fans were acutely aware that their hero was in need of a knockout , but the fairytale ending was not forthcoming .
Mayweather landed with two huge left hooks that sent Hatton sprawling and sent him to the canvas again with a tremendous left hook .
Referee Cortez called a halt to proceedings before Hatton had hit the floor , a minute and 35 seconds into the round , leaving ' The Hitman 's ' legion of fans stunned .
The judges ' scores at the time of the stoppage were : 88-82 , 89-81 , 89-81 .
Mayweather , often maligned for being cocky , was admirable and gracious in victory , hurrying to check up on and praise his vanquished foe .
" He kept coming and I see why they call him the Hitman .
He 's one hell of a fighter but I took care of business and did the job , " said Mayweather .
" I wanted to show the fans that I still got it .
I have nothing else to prove to the world . "
Hatton , who lost his first fight in 44 contests , suggested that he would continue to box despite the pain of defeat .
" I'm the best at light - welter and I fought the best at welter .
I 'd rather give praise to my opponent .
My pride is hurt more than the punches . "
Bush was asked at a White House press conference last week if he would consider a “ goodwill mission to restore the country ’s good name abroad . ”
The president said , “ That ’s what I do during my presidency .
I go around spreading goodwill and talking about the importance of spreading freedom and peace . ”
Apparently , he meant it .
Yes , the president is planning some road - trips .
President George W. Bush ’s diplomatic passport will acquire a slew of new country stamps during his final year in office as he tries to rebuild the U.S. ’s international standing and create a foreign - policy legacy beyond Iraq .
The president plans trips to the Middle East , Africa , Asia and South America , which would make 2008 his busiest year abroad .
While his major domestic initiatives may get stalled by a Democratic majority in Congress and the gridlock caused by election - year politics , he still has an opportunity to exert his influence overseas . [… ]
While the president will strive to strengthen alliances , it wo n’t come at the expense of continuing to prosecute the war on terror , said Jim Jeffrey , the deputy White House national security adviser .
“ We want to be well - perceived in the world , ” Jeffrey said in an interview .
“ But more importantly , we want to formulate policies that will protect the American people . ”
With all due respect to the White House , maybe we ’ll be “ well - perceived in the world ” if the president stays home and changes his policies , instead of traveling abroad and keeping his existing policies ?
British delegates in Brussels have proposed a Pan-European language be adopted across EC along the lines of the simplified and very loud version of English that is already being widely shouted at Europeans by British tourists visiting the continent .
Proposals that French , German or Esperanto might be developed as a single Euro - language have constantly been vetoed by the British delegates who have now gone onto the offensive by proposing ‘ Shouting ’ as the Community ’s universal language .
They claim it is much easier to understand , with a simple vocabulary and few grammatical rules except that the letter ‘ o ’ can be added on to any English noun to make a universal European word .
For example , ‘ Excuse me , please could you tell me the price of that item ? ’ in ‘ Shouting ’ would be ‘ HOW MUCHO ?
Oi mate , HOW MUCH COSTO ? ’ while ‘ Please may I have a beer ? ’ becomes ‘ Oi Manuel ! UNO BEERO !’’
If at first the fledgling linguist cannot grasp the basics of Shouting , the fluent speaker will simply re-iterate , but to facilitate understanding , will say it much , much louder ; ‘I SAID ; UNO BEERO !
ARE YOU FOOKIN DEAF OR WOT ?’
Extolling the versatility of the dialect , British MEP Kenneth Smithson ( UKIP ) explained , ‘ Shouting is a genuinely international language in that it also employs words from all the major Indo - European dialects which are pretty well interchangeable at will . ’
Or as he said when he used the language to propose the motion in the European Parliament , ‘WE BRITISHERS , YA ? SPEAKA DA LINGO EURO , ENGLISHER FOR TOUTO EVERYONE , SI ? ’
Undaunted by the puzzled looks of the various nationalities , Smithson gave an exasperated sigh and started again ; ‘ It ’s quite simple chaps .
LINGO SI ?
PARLEZ MUCHO LOUDER YA ? SHOUTY - SHOUTY , COMPRENEZ ?’
Eventually a Dutch Minister interjected ‘ My sincere apologies for the discourteous interruption , but we ’re rather struggling to comprehend your vernacular .
I do n’t suppose you speak English by any chance do you ? ’

The ongoing unrest makes gathering information difficult
This is about a quarter of the figure given in a disputed Lancet article , but nearly three times higher than that of the Iraq Body Count campaigning group .
The result is based on interviews with over 9,000 families across Iraq carried out by the health ministry for the WHO .
The survey says more than half of all violent deaths were in Baghdad .
The World Health Organization study looks only at the period from March 2003 until June 2006 .
Researchers interviewed households right across Iraq , in towns and the countryside , and asked the head of each one for details of all deaths in the group .
They say violence became a leading cause of death of Iraqi adults ; among men between 15 and 59 it was the main cause of death .
Note of caution
The survey authors say they are confident in the general level of accuracy of the answers they received because they had a high response rate , and because the answers from other questions in their survey were consistent with information they already had .
Despite the large number of families interviewed , the authors do not say 151,000 is a precise figure .
The kind of scene that is played out many times a day in Iraq
Instead , they offer a range of between 104,000 and 223,000 .
" Assessment of the death toll in conflict situations is extremely difficult and household survey results have to be interpreted with caution , " said study co-author Mohamed Ali , a WHO statistician .
" However , in the absence of comprehensive death registration and hospital reporting , household surveys are the best we can do . "
Difficulties facing those leading the survey included :
no central records are kept
some areas are too dangerous to visit
more people leave their homes in times of conflict
many people have left Iraq altogether
" The survey results indicate a massive death toll since the beginning of the conflict , " said Iraqi health minister Salih Motlab al - Hasanawi .
The level of civilian casualties in Iraq has been a controversial issue ever since the US - led invasion of 2003 .
US criticism
The US does not give estimates of civilian deaths , although President George W Bush once gave a figure of 30,000 .
In October 2006 , the Lancet published a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
It suggested that between about 655,000 more Iraqis had died since the invasion than would normally have been expected .
Its researchers spoke to more than 1,800 families comprising 12,800 people , comparing mortality rates in selected areas before and after the invasion .
It covered a similar period to the latest survey , but was undermined by allegations that the number of people surveyed was too small and that the authors may have inflated the figures for political reasons .
Mr Bush himself criticised its methodology as " pretty well discredited " , and its figure as " not credible " .
The best - known casualty tracker is the independent Iraq Body Count .
It says it prefers to err on the side of caution , counting only confirmed deaths .
The toll it gave for up to June 2006 was under 50,000 .
It now gives a range of 80,381 - 87,792 .
The BBC's Humphrey Hawkesley , reporting from Baghdad , says violence has fallen in recent months , put down to the success of the US 's injection of extra troops .
But he says Iraq remains a very dangerous place .
The latest study 's findings are published on the website of the New England Journal of Medicine .
Why I Fought for Two Boys I Never Met
At Patton Middle School in McMinnville , Oregon , students created something called " slap butt day . "
On one such day in February 2007 , according to The Oregonian ( July 22 , 2007 ) : " Two boys tore down the hall of Patton Middle School after lunch , swatting the bottoms of girls as they ran -- what some kids later said was a common form of greeting .
But bottom - slapping is against policy in McMinnville Public Schools .
So a teacher 's aide sent the gawky seventh - graders to the office , where the vice principal and a police officer stationed at the school soon interrogated them . "
A police officer interrogated them ?
" After hours of interviews with students , " The Oregonian continues , " the day of the February incident , the officer read the boys their Miranda rights and hauled them off in handcuffs to juvenile jail , where they spent the next five days . "
Two seventh - graders were read their Miranda rights for butt - swatting ?
And hauled off to jail for butt - swatting ?
And kept in jail for five days for butt - swatting ?
This is worse than a bad joke ; it is actually sick .
And it gets worse .
The seventh - graders were not permitted contact with their parents for 24 hours , they were brought into court in shackles and jail garb , and they were strip - searched four times .
All because the Yamhill County District Attorney , Bradley Berry , brought felony sex charges against the two boys .
When he finally explained himself under pressure from the media , Berry told The Oregonian , " From our perspective and the perspective of the victims , this was not just horseplay . "
In fact , it turns out that the girls involved did regard it as horseplay .
And they claimed from virtually the outset that they had been pressured into making a case against the boys .
The Oregonian has reported that listeners to my radio show across America provided nearly all of the more than $ 40,000 for defense costs for the two boys .
But they have done more .
They have also sent letters to the two boys assuring them it is not they , but Bradley Berry , who acted perversely .
One of the boys ' mothers , in tears , told me that these letters profoundly affected the boys , who were made to appear as perverts and sexual predators and who could have been placed on sexual predator lists for the rest of their lives .
My listeners also reported that when they phoned the office of Bradley Berry , they were told that " there was more to the story , " that more evidence would be forthcoming .
That was a lie .
Berry had nothing more to reveal and did in fact drop the felony charges .
The boys were then charged ' only ' with sexual harassment .
Our beloved country is flipping out .
The effects of The Age of Stupidity ushered in during the '60s and ' 70s are omnipresent .
It is highly doubtful that there is a living member of the World War II generation who could have imagined that seventh - graders would one day be brought in shackles into an American courtroom for playfully swatting a girl 's buttocks .
It is also true that there is no member of that generation who could ever have imagined something as low - life as a " slap butt day " in an American middle school .
But that is another matter .
Apparently ex-Raleigh / Durham District Attorney Mike Nifong is not the only D.A. in America who has used his almost unlimited power to hurt innocent boys .
Nifong , it will be recalled , brought phony charges of gang rape against three Duke lacrosse players , lied about having more evidence , withheld critical information from the defense and in sundry other ways did whatever he could to ruin three innocent boys ' lives .
Nifong has since been disbarred .
Nifong has met his match in Oregon , where Bradley Berry has done his best to ruin two innocent boys ' lives .
Perhaps the major difference is that the boys Bradley Berry is abusing are seventh - graders , not college students .
The story is so angering that one can only wonder whether America is suffering from a surfeit of district attorneys who are either incompetent or just lack elementary human decency .
One prays these two district attorneys are exceptions .
But there is only one way to ensure that they are .
Bradley , like Nifong , must be removed from office .
Anyone who believes that seventh - graders who swat girls ' buttocks on " slap butt day " are sex criminals who should be charged with crimes that would permanently label them as sex offenders is a dangerous fool .
A district attorney who believes that is a dangerous fool .
Bradley Berry has acted like Mike Nifong .
He needs to be punished like Mike Nifong .
My show and my listeners have been instrumental in helping getting all the charges against the boys dropped -- this happened just yesterday .
Now we will focus our attention on removing Bradley Berry from office .
A democracy cannot long survive the contempt more and more Americans feel for American law .

With only 3 weeks left in the year , I am simultaneously trying to get ready for the holidays , finishing up one of my jobs , make sure I am covered for taxes in 2007 , and prepping for what I am going to do with my finances comes January 1 .
So while trying to think about all these different things , I started wondering what I had wasted money on during this past year … and figured I would share so you could too !
( Do n’t be shy , none of us know who you are ! )
I will go first – in no particular order , here are some thing that come to mind that I probably should not have bought or paid for this year :
Another year of .
Mac service – I can build my own web pages , I have my own backup service , and I do n’t sync my computers anymore .
So what exactly do I need this for ?
Who knows , but I paid for it anyway .
– $ 79.95
Without noticing , SmugMug charged me for another year of photo storage – even though I have not accessed the account in about 8 months .
I forgot I even had an account there , as I use Flickr to store my photos now .
So I went ahead and closed the account , but not before they kept my $ 29.95 .
Seeing as how I work from home now , I do n’t exactly use my cell phone much anymore .
When I used to actually go outside for extended periods of time , I used a program called Vindigo in my Treo 650 to find restaurants , gas stations , etc .
Well – it ’s another one of those automatic renewals that I did not notice in time … costing me another $ 29.95 .
Although I did my best to avoid doing so , we bought too much coffee outside out of the house this year .
It ’s a problem , believe me .
Cost :
Who the hell knows , but a lot .
What the heck did I need another Swiss Army Knife for ?
Really ?
I did n’t , not at all .
In fact , I have several of them , but this one was on sale !
Into the emergency kit it goes , so my wife and I will be armed to the teeth with small knives in case the SHTF !
Cost : $ 25 .
I bought the most expensive toaster / convection oven ever .
I am a firm believer in buying the best you can afford , as hopefully then it will last longer and need less fixing them some cheapo version of something – but sometimes this gets the better of me and cons me into thinking that I need more than I really do .
Thus , we have a super - duper toaster oven that toasts 6 pieces of bread at one , can cook pizzas and chickens just the same , and takes up 51 % of the kitchen space .
Cost : Too frickin much .
So this brings me back to you …what did you buy this year that you wish you had n’t ?
What did you spend money on that now , looking back , seems like a waste of your hard earned money .
Come on , you can share here !

A Republican senator blocked a vote in the Judiciary Committee on whether to authorize subpoenas to the Justice Department to obtain secret legal opinions and other documents related to the National Security Agency ’s program of domestic eavesdropping .
The action by Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona will block the vote for a week .
After the vote next Thursday , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the committee , can decide whether to issue the subpoenas or use them as leverage in negotiations with the Bush administration over access to the documents .
This past week , the U.S. Senate put on a clown show .
With most Americans wanting troops out of Iraq , Democratic leaders in the Senate failed to get enough Republican votes to overcome GOP filibusters for fairly tepid change - course measures .
They could get only six Republican votes even for a Jim Webb proposal simply requiring that U.S. troops spend as much time at home as they spend deployed in Iraq .
But thanks to 22 Democratic clowns joining a Republican circus , the Senate was able to break the partisan impasse by overwhelmingly passing one bold measure : A defense of Gen. David Petraeus against a MoveOn.org newspaper ad .
The resolution expressed " full support " for the general and condemned " personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus and all members of the United States Armed Forces . "
Cable news networks that cheer - led our country into invading Iraq took a break from their latest all - O.J. - all - the - time binge to make an antiwar ad more controversial than the ongoing slaughter of Iraqis and Americans that the invasion predictably unleashed .
And 22 Democrats were more desperate to distance themselves from the 3 - million - member MoveOn than from less than 50 Republican dead - enders bent on prolonging the killing .
The 22 Democrats can be reached by dialing the Congressional switchboard : 202-224-3121 .
They are Baucus ( MT ) , Bayh ( IN ) , Cardin ( MD ) , Carper ( DE ) , Casey ( PA ) , Conrad ( ND ) , Dorgan ( ND ) , Feinstein ( CA ) , Johnson ( SD ) , Klobuchar ( MN ) , Kohl ( WI ) , Landrieu ( LA ) , Leahy ( VT ) , Lincoln ( AR ) , McCaskill ( MO ) , Mikulski ( MD ) , Nelson ( FL ) , Nelson ( NE ) , Pryor ( AR ) , Salazar ( CO ) , Tester ( MT ) and Webb ( VA ) .
MoveOn's ad in the New York Times - headlined " General Petraeus or General Betray Us ? " - questioned whether the extremely political Gen.
Petraeus would betray the truth and the facts about Iraq , as he had previously in echoing Team Bush .
The ad did n't question his patriotism .
Yet 22 Democrats ( plus , of course , Joe Lieberman ) backed the pro-Petraeus resolution after hearing its rightwing sponsor declare that the MoveOn ad had " crossed a historic line of decency . "
Are these 22 Democrats amnesiacs ?
Have they forgotten the Republican ads calling war - wounded Sen .
Max Cleland a liar unwilling to protect us from Osama bin Laden ?
There was no Senate resolution defending the Vietnam Vet against those ads .
Nor were there Senate resolutions aimed at Disney , Rupert Murdoch , General Electric , Time Warner or Clear Channel for broadcasting the screeds of the O'Reillys , Hannitys , Coulters , Savages and Becks in which Iraq War critics were routinely referred to as treasonous and traitors .
Nor a resolution after Rev. Pat Robertson declared that Democratic criticism of Bush during wartime " amounts to treason . "
Or one condemning Bill O'Reilly for declaring that Democratic - backer George Soros " ought to be hanged . "
Or one denouncing Glenn Beck for wishing on - air for the violent deaths of war critics , including a member of Congress .
The Petraeus / MoveOn resolution had one main purpose :
To get Democratic Senators to run in fear from the party 's antiwar base .
President Bush basically admitted as much in rehearsed remarks at Thursday 's news conference : " I was disappointed that not more leaders in the Democratic Party spoke out strongly against that kind of ad .
And that leads me to come to this conclusion : that most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left - wing group like MoveOn.org - or more afraid of irritating them than they are of irritating the United States military . "
And 22 Democrats fell for this Karl Rovian political ploy - a resolution that fraudulently purported to condemn " personal attacks " on " all members of the United States armed forces . "
During the run-up to the Iraq invasion , I worked in cable news when these networks relentlessly questioned the integrity and patriotism of former Marine officer and Gulf War veteran Scott Ritter .
As the U.N. 's top weapons inspector , Ritter had stood up to Saddam Hussein 's government for years .
But when he forcefully questioned the grounds for invading Iraq , corporate media called him an agent of Saddam .
. . and worse .
No Senate resolution has ever condemned the personal attacks on Ritter .
And unlike Petraeus - who penned a ridiculously over - optimistic Washington Post column ( datelined Baghdad ) extolling Iraq 's security forces , timed just weeks before the 2004 election - Ritter 's accurate analysis was never tailored to please any White House .
There is a struggle for power going on in our country between forces for peace and international diplomacy and open debate and civil liberties and social justice on the one hand - and the forces of intimidation and militarism and corporatism on the other .
The Democratic base is firmly in the first camp .
But not all Democratic leaders are .
When the forces of intimidation and their allies in corporate media cook up one of these obviously phony controversies to bully or distract the public - whether targeting a MoveOn ad or a Michael Moore movie or a liberal politician 's minor misstatement - how should we react to Democratic officeholders so quick to aid the other side ?
Think P.C. - primary challenge .

The first clinical studies of an experimental drug have revealed that obese people who take it for 12 weeks lose weight , even at very low doses .
Short - term studies also suggest that the drug , called taranabant — the second drug designed to fight obesity by blocking cannabinoid receptors in the brain — causes people to consume fewer calories and burn more , researchers report in the January issue of Cell Metabolism , a publication of Cell Press .
Cannabinoid receptors are responsible for the psychological effects of marijuana ( Cannabis sativa ) , and natural “ endocannabinoids ” are important regulators of energy balance .
“ The effects of marijuana on appetite have been known for millennia from its medicinal and recreational use , ” said study author Steven Heymsfield of Merck Research Laboratories .
“ The ingredient responsible stimulates cannabinoid receptors .
When you block the cannabinoid system with an antagonist like taranabant , you suppress appetite . ”
However , the drug , developed by Merck , also comes with an increased risk of adverse side effects at higher doses , the study shows , including mild to moderate gastrointestinal and psychiatric effects .
The first proof of concept that so - called cannabinoid 1 receptor ( CB1R ) inverse agonists might offer an obesity therapy came from studies of another drug , developed by Sanofi - Aventis , called rimonabant .
That drug is now in use for weight loss in several European countries as an adjunct to diet and exercise but has not received FDA approval for use in the United States .
Taranabant is a structurally novel , highly selective , potent CB1R inverse agonist , Heymsfield ’s team said .
Preclinical studies in animals showed that it can cause weight loss at doses that block just 30 percent of cannabinoid receptors .
To extend those findings to humans in the new studies , the researchers first used positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging to identify a dose that would bind about 30 percent of cannabinoid receptors in the human brain .
They found that 4 to 6 milligrams of taranabant was enough to achieve that goal .
A multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial including 533 obese patients showed that the drug induces significant weight loss at doses ranging from 0.5 to 6 milligrams .
“ That was surprising , ” Heymsfield said .
“ We did n’t expect weight loss at all doses . ”
The researchers then conducted separate food intake and energy expenditure studies in overweight and moderately obese people who took a single 4 - or 12 - milligram dose of taranabant .
Those studies showed that people taking 12 milligrams of the drug consumed 27 percent fewer calories than those taking a placebo .
People taking the drug also expended more energy while at rest and appeared to burn more fat .
The studies also found that higher doses of the drug caused two types of adverse events , Heymsfield said .
These negative side effects included gastrointestinal upset , including nausea and vomiting , as well as increased irritability .
Marijuana is often used to combat the nausea associated with chemotherapy drugs , Heymsfield noted , and it also tends to make people mellower .
“ Here , again , [ these drugs ] have the opposite effect . ”
A larger , phase III clinical trial of taranabant is now underway to further explore its effects , Heymsfield said .
“ All we have here is 12 weeks ; we do n’t yet know what will happen at six months or a year . ”

A controversial gay - themed children 's book which just weeks ago was unavailable at most local public libraries is now more widely accessible after a couple 's attempt to have the book removed from the Lower Macungie Library backfired .
Following news coverage of the library 's denial of the request , a local gay activist group sent it a $ 50 donation and purchased the controversial book '' King & King ' ' for four area public libraries that did n't carry it .
At least three of the libraries in Allentown , Bethlehem and Easton have accepted the book into their circulations following reviews ...
News coverage of the issue also led Doylestown 's public library to order '' King & King . ''
" King & King " tells of a prince who , defying his mother 's wish that he marry a princess , instead marries her brother .
The newspaper had a report last November ( archived here ) about the couple 's obsessive campaign to keep this book out of other people 's hands :
The book will remain on the shelf despite the Issas ' complaints and about 40 signatures they 've gathered from residents who agree .
The library 's board of directors on Thursday denied the couple 's request for the second time and the township supervisors , who appoint the library directors , have chosen not to overrule the decision .
'' I just want kids to enjoy their innocence and their time of growing up , '' Jeff Issa said , explaining his persistence .
'' Let them be kids ... and not worry about homosexuality , race , religion .
Just let them live freely as kids .''...
Kathee Rhode , the library 's director , said censoring books based on subject matter is the duty of parents , not the library .
She said the library strives to provide material representing a spectrum of views and ways of life .
'' That 's what a public library does , and you make the choice , '' Rhode said .
'' We certainly want parents to make that decision for their children -- not one parent making that decision for all children . ''
So how did the Issas feel when the library and town council both told them to take a hike , when gay activists turned the tables by ensuring that further copies of the book were made available in area libraries , and when the Morning Call returned to chronicle the sorry collapse of their crusade ?
Somewhat ironically , that information is not available .
The Issas declined to comment for this story .
This particular battle was ridiculously one - sided , though the running war to ban books is no joke .
In recent years , George W. Bush ( that fellow married to the former librarian ) has even aligned himself with one of the nation 's foremost book - banners , Gerald Allen .
This seedy character is well described in a report from 2004 :
Earlier this week , Allen got a call from Washington .
He will be meeting with President Bush on Monday .
I asked him if this was his first invitation to the White House .
" Oh no , " he laughs .
" It 's my fifth meeting with Mr Bush . "
Bush is interested in Allen 's opinions because Allen is an elected Republican representative in the Alabama state legislature .
He is Bush 's base .
Last week , Bush 's base introduced a bill that would ban the use of state funds to purchase any books or other materials that " promote homosexuality " .
Allen does not want taxpayers ' money to support " positive depictions of homosexuality as an alternative lifestyle " .
That 's why Tennessee Williams and Alice Walker have got to go .
Literature on homosexual themes has been subject to censorship for a long time .
But in recent years it has consistently been the leading edge of the book - banning crusade , that perennial attack on freedom of expression led ( as always ) by authoritarian types .
Thus as improbable as it may seem , the children 's book " King & King " has been at the center of controversy from one end of America to the other .
In Oklahoma , for example , its availability in libraries was seen as such a crisis in 2005 that state lawmakers passed a resolution calling on librarians to " confine homosexually themed books and other age - inappropriate material to areas exclusively for adult access and distribution . "
It also states that a child ’s development " should be at the discretion of a child ’s parents free from interference from the distribution of inappropriate publicly cataloged materials " and that public libraries should not expose children to material " that may be deemed harmful and inappropriate . "
The resolution declares that " materials concerning human sexuality and those of an arguably prurient nature " should not be " readily available for consumption by children , nor should the distribution of such materials to children be supported by public finance . "
Sara Fine 's article " How the mind of the censor works " is especially revealing in regard to the censors ' obsession with this up - beat little children 's book :
Personality theory and social psychology research suggest that when we encounter someone whose arguments for censorship are dogmatic and simplistic , we are probably dealing with an authoritarian personality who is reacting to something he / she fears .
Authoritarian personalities are characterized by a strong desire to exert power , an equally strong need to submit to power ( often the power of a social , political or religious group ) , resentment of weakness , fear of ambiguous situations , and an unusual fascination with sex .
Authoritarian personalities are highly moralistic , exhibiting a " conventional " level of morality on Kohlberg 's scale of moral development ( minor rules and social respectability are placed above principles such as equality , freedom of expression , and human rights ) .
Any information which is contrary to their ( or their group 's ) beliefs , stereotypes and rationalizations is perceived as a threat .
The theory of cognitive dissonance tells us that authoritarian personalities will defend their choices most strongly in ambiguous situations , since they want to erase the inner conflict created by the recognition of two positive but conflicting ideals ( such as freedom of speech vs. the preservation of family morals ) .
Censorship is more strongly motivated by the fear of losing control over children than a concern for their moral development , and books which portray young people who defy parental values may especially outrage authoritarian personalities .
The mindset of the censor is one I can scarcely comprehend .
As a child I had the run of a house full of books and like this librarian ...
I was allowed to read what I liked .
It helped me to learn who I was and where I fit into the world .
As a model for socializing other people 's children , censorship is incalculably and disastrously misguided .
Gen Baluyevsky sees a threat from countries seeking global hegemony
Gen Yuri Baluyevsky said Russia had no plans to attack anyone , but it was important that other countries clearly understood its leaders ' resolve .
Correspondents say the general 's remarks do not mark a shift in policy .
But they are the latest in a string of assertive comments from Moscow when relations with the West are strained .
In a speech to a military conference broadcast on state - run cable TV , Gen Baluyevsky said there were potential threats to Russia from international terrorism or countries seeking global or regional hegemony .
" We do not intend to attack anyone , but we consider it necessary for all our partners in the world community to clearly understand ... that to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia and its allies , military forces will be used , including preventively , including with the use of nuclear weapons , " he said .
Conventional decline
President Vladimir Putin approved a new military doctrine in 2000 which stated that Russia might use nuclear weapons against nuclear or large - scale conventional attack .
Analysts say the doctrine reflects the decline in Russia 's conventional forces , which can no longer be relied upon to counter aggression .
But correspondents say it is unusual for a defence official to specifically mention nuclear weapons in remarks on preventive strikes .
The remarks come days after Mr Putin appointed hardliner Dmitri Rogozin as the country 's new ambassador to Nato .
Relations with the West have deteriorated in recent years , most notably with Moscow strongly opposing plans by the alliance to set up missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Russia has responded by suspending the Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) Treaty .
PORTLAND , Ore. -- Greg
Oden 's rookie season with the
Portland Trail Blazers abruptly ended before it began when the
7 - footer had knee surgery on Thursday .
The top pick in the June draft went in for an exploratory
procedure on his right knee and ended up having microfracture
surgery , which means he will sit out the season .
" Greg looked at me as he was coming out of his surgery , and he
and his mom Zoe probably said ' sorry ' 20 times , " Blazers general
manager Kevin Pritchard said .
" I could feel the weight of the
world on his shoulders .
And as a leader and as leaders of this
organization , my first thought was how lucky we were to have a guy
that cares about the organization that much . "
Dr. Don Roberts performed the surgery to repair the damage ,
which Pritchard described as the size of a fingertip .
Oden is
expected to be on crutches for up to eight weeks .
Full recovery
likely will take six to 12 months , the team said .
" At this point in time , we do n't see him coming back this
season , " Pritchard said .
Oden was the No. 1 pick in the June draft out of Ohio State ,
where he averaged 15.7 points and 9.6 rebounds .
The loss of Oden before the season was a blow to the
organization .
There was much fanfare when the Blazers got the first
pick in the draft , and even more when the team chose Oden .
Antonov or AN - 225 is the world ’s heaviest and largest jet ever built with the landing gear system of 32 wheels and a wing span of 291 feet .
It was designed for the Soviet space program in 1988 and able to airlift the Energia rocket ’s boosters , Buran space shuttle or ultra-heavy and oversize freight , up to 250,000 kg ( 550,000 lb ) internally or 200,000 kg ( 440,000 lb ) on the upper fuselage .

String Theory 's Next Top Model
Ernest Rutherford used to tell his physics students that if they could n't explain a concept to a barmaid , they did n't really understand the concept .
With regard to the cosmological implications of string theory , the barmaids and physicists are both struggling — a predicament that SLAC string theorist Shamit Kachru hopes to soon resolve .
String theory is currently the most popular candidate for a unified theory of the fundamental forces , but it is not completely understood — and experimental evidence is notoriously elusive .
Physicists can , however , gain crucial insight into the theory by evaluating how accurately its models can predict the observed universe .
Using this indirect approach , Kachru , in collaboration with theorists at Rutgers University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , sought models that could reproduce inflation — the prevailing cosmological paradigm in which the nascent universe experienced a fleeting period of exponential expansion .
Although there is already a substantial body of literature presenting such models — spawned in part by publications of Kachru and his Stanford and SLAC colleagues Renata Kallosh , Andrei Linde and Eva Silverstein in 2003 — the complexity of the models leaves room for doubt .
" They incorporate inflation , and they 're the most realistic models of string theory , " Kachru said , " but they 're complicated .
They 're fancy .
They have a lot of ' moving parts , ' and we need to fine - tune all of them , so we can't verify anything to a high degree of accuracy .
It forces us to ask — are we confident that we really understand what 's going on ? "
To achieve a comprehensive understanding of how inflation can be embedded in string theory , Kachru and his collaborators employed a pedagogical tactic .
" What we wanted was an explicit ' toy ' model , " Kachru explained .
" The goal was n't to have something realistic , but to allow us to understand everything to every detail . "
" There are deep conceptual questions about how inflation is supposed to work , " Kachru continued .
" In order to understand these issues , it 's best to have a simple model .
There 's so much clutter in the complicated examples , you can't disentangle the conceptual issues from the clutter . "
The group investigated three versions of the simplest formulation of string theory , and found that they were incompatible with inflation .
" This means we 're going to have to consider slightly more complicated scenarios , " said Kachru .
" There are a lot of levels between this and the fancier working models , so we 'll find one eventually . "
Kachru and his colleagues published their work in Physical Review Letters D , providing a framework for others in search of simple inflationary models of string theory .
" There are so many successful models out there that incorporate string theory and inflation , so we 'll undoubtedly find a simpler version .
When we find that ' toy model , ' where all the moving parts are obvious , we can address deep conceptual questions without getting lost in the details . "

Continuing in our series of attempts to imagine how Microsoft Marketing people relate to their fellow men outside work , we give you a glimpse of Microsoft Boy at school , before the start of his splendid career at Redmond .
Scene : The History lesson in school .
The teacher wearily calls Microsoft Boy to his desk to try to discover where his homework is .
_______________________________________________
Teacher :
“ Well , young William , ( looks over his glasses severely ) where is your homework ?
It should have been handed in today , I ’m afraid . ”
Microsoft Boy :
( with a smug ingratiating smile redolent of sincerity ) “ The past week has been an amazing time for the me as I geared up to announce the delivery of my essay .
The response to my announcement from friends and parents has been overwhelmingly positive – in fact , even my aunt Edith wants to read it .
What is catching users ’ eyes ?
Legibility , correctness , conciseness …. the list goes on and on .
Simply put , this history essay is a significant release for me – one that builds on all of the great things that I was able to deliver last year in the Lower fifth .
I see it as a critical step forward for my academic life here , and the foundation of the broader vision for my school career .
Based on what we are hearing from people who have seen the current version of my essay , it seems that everyone agrees . ”
Teacher
( impatiently ) “ Well , that may be the case , but you have n’t actually handed your work in .
Where is it for heavens sake ?
The others have managed to hand their work in ! ”
Microsoft Boy :
( earnestly )
Not surprisingly , one of the top areas of focus for me is always to deliver high quality homework , and in a very predictable manner .
This is vital for my dazzling school career – which is why I ’ve frequently discussed my goal of releasing my history essay within three months of the last one .
I am on track to reach this goal .
( folds his arms with a smile of achievement )
Teacher : ( whilst rustling about , searching on his desk )
“ I do n’t see it , I really ca n’t find your essay on my desk .
It was supposed to have been handed in today . ”
Microsoft Boy : ( sensing something not quite right in his relationship )
“ To continue in this spirit of open communication between us , I want to provide clarification on the roadmap for my essay .
Over the coming months , you , and the other teaching staff here can look forward to significant milestones in the delivery of my homework .
I am excited to deliver a release candidate of the essay in a month ’s time , at Scout Camp , with final Release of the entire homework expected in another couple of months .
My goal is to deliver the highest quality History essay possible and I simply want to use the time to reach the high bar that you , my teacher , has set . ”
Teacher : ( Head in hands , dispairingly )
“ I really do n’t understand .
Have you handed in your homework or not ? ”
Microsoft Boy
“ I have not , in any way , changed my plans for launching the essay today .
What I have done today is to announce to you the delivery of my essay , and I ’m proud to have met this target .
Please keep the great feedback coming and thank you again for your ongoing support of my ‘ best - in - class ’ academic work ! ”

Is Bigger Safer ?
It Ain't Necessarily So
Jim Starkey
Jim Starkey is a Senior Software Architect for MySQL .
DDJ : When it comes to database development , what are the advantages of open source ?
JS : There are three big advantages right up front .
One is that there are umpteen thousand very smart folks reviewing and testing the code .
Another is the knowledge that those umpteen thousand are n't going to take " good enough for government work " as an excuse .
Every line of code I write , I imagine the questions I 'll get on it at the next MySQL User Conference session on Falcon [ a transactional database engine for MySQL ] .
Finally , software types are , by nature , glory hounds .
Open source brings out the best in us .
DDJ : How do you balance performance , security , and ease - of - use in database design ?
JS : The question should be , " How do you balance performance , security , ease - of - use , and Standard conformance ... " because without Standard conformance , it would be a great deal easier !
Take , for example , data types .
The SQL Standard shows its roots in punched cards with nothing but fixed - length typesfixed - size integers , fixed - size strings , and varying strings with fixed limits .
Most engines actually store the data in fixed - length chunks , so the user has to choose between flexibility ( types big enough to handle the worst case ) and performance .
Falcon stores data by actual value rather than declared type .
This removes any performance penalty for over - specifying a field .
The value " 5 " takes the same space whether declared as a tiny integer , small integer , large integer , or really - big - I - mean - it - this - time integer .
But what a bother mapping back and forth between fixed - length declaration and variable - length storage !
If the Standard would let us , the user could just say , " It 's a number Just deal with it . "
Modern languages and frameworks have strings without size .
Why not databases ?
So that 's how I prefer to deal with ease - of - use versus performance :
Make it easy for the user to let the software do the smart thing .
Security is a particularly nasty problem .
The SQL security model was developed before many of today 's database guys were born .
It 's designed for timesharing systems where humans on hard copy terminals shared databases .
Now , virtually all database access goes though application servers .
The server logon does n't represent the actual client , which it wo n't know for a query or two .
Also , access control or visibility needs to be at the row , not table , level .
Is n't it time that the database community recognizes this ?
DDJ : The relational model has held up well .
How come ?
JS : A number of reasons .
One is that the unit of work is big enough to be worth optimizing .
Another is relational operations work on sets of data objects , making it a reasonably good model for remote access .
Finally , it 's a clean model that does n't encourage design cuteness .
I became enamored with the relational model after reading one of Codd 's early papers .
I was working on the ARPAnet Datacomputer project ( the Net was pushing 45 computers at the time , which was pretty exciting ) .
That said , there is a great deal of room for improvement on the relational model .
Much data just does n't fit into rectangular tables .
Shirts , for example , have different attributes than do pants , but both are clothing .
Sometimes you want to see shirts , sometimes pants , and sometimes all clothing .
Handling this within a relational database requires standing on one 's head .
The semantic data model , circa 1978 , is a tiny but elegant extension to the relational model to deal with type hierarchies .
It 's a little embarrassing that we have n't figured this out yet .
DDJ : Other than size , do embedded environments put extra demands on databases ?
Reliability , for instance ?
JS : I think we can agree that context switches or network round trips are bad things for application performance .
On the other hand , modern database engines are getting quite greedy about memory and processors , so having lots of embedded database instances floating around a system does n't make all that much sense .
Rather than embedding the database engine in the application , would n't it make sense to embed the application in the database server ?
A bunch of happy applications each doing super - fast in - thread queries in nice sandboxes disgorging their results in a single blast of data is a pretty good way to structure things .
I think we 've come around a number of circles .
We started with blobs because they were unlimited in size , but soon all fields will be unlimited , so blobs can fade away .
The relational model was good because it was simple , but now needs semantic extensions to keep it alive going forward .
SQL was once good because it worked well on a network , but SQL on the wire is now the limiting factor in system performance .
To save it , we need to get off the wire and into a sandbox within the database server .
To do that , we need to learn to think differently about how applications are designed and deployed .
There 's the old story about a great - grandfather 's axe that had its head replaced twice and its handle three times .
That 's where I think relational databases are going .
We 'll change the data model , the data types , the application topology , and the network interface , but they 'll still be relational databases .
I 'm blessed to be living a bold , beautiful life through helping others .
My goal is to touch , move , and inspire health and healing in a million people by 2010 with my work and clinic .
Maybe you will be one of the Million !
It is worth noting that people literally fought , bled , suffered starve d and died to win an eight hour work day .
Just because we are n't all working in coal mines or canneries does n't make our work any less valuable .
Somehow the idea that we owe the company a little bit more of our free time each day as a condition of employment has has become acceptable .
Just because you are a salaried employee as opposed to an hourly wage employee in the United States does n't mean you are n't entitled to overtime .
Each time someone works a 50 hour week to stay ahead of the guy working a 48 hour week , it 's just like someone who would work for $ 3.75 an hour to stay ahead of the guy who would work for $ 4.00 an hour .
I can already feel my " rant - gland " starting to ooze , so maybe this is enough for now ...
People from different cultures use their brains differently to solve the same visual perceptual tasks , MIT researchers and colleagues report in the first brain imaging study of its kind .
Psychological research has established that American culture , which values the individual , emphasizes the independence of objects from their contexts , while East Asian societies emphasize the collective and the contextual interdependence of objects .
Behavioral studies have shown that these cultural differences can influence memory and even perception .
But are they reflected in brain activity patterns ”
To find out , a team led by John Gabrieli , a professor at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , asked 10 East Asians recently arrived in the United States and 10 Americans to make quick perceptual judgments while in a functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scanner–a technology that maps blood flow changes in the brain that correspond to mental operations .
The results are reported in the January issue of Psychological Science .
Gabrieli ’s colleagues on the work were Trey Hedden , lead author of the paper and a research scientist at McGovern ; Sarah Ketay and Arthur Aron of State University of New York at Stony Brook ; and Hazel Rose Markus of Stanford University .
Subjects were shown a sequence of stimuli consisting of lines within squares and were asked to compare each stimulus with the previous one .
In some trials , they judged whether the lines were the same length regardless of the surrounding squares ( an absolute judgment of individual objects independent of context ) .
In other trials , they decided whether the lines were in the same proportion to the squares , regardless of absolute size ( a relative judgment of interdependent objects ) .
In previous behavioral studies of similar tasks , Americans were more accurate on absolute judgments , and East Asians on relative judgments .
In the current study , the tasks were easy enough that there were no differences in performance between the two groups .
However , the two groups showed different patterns of brain activation when performing these tasks .
Americans , when making relative judgments that are typically harder for them , activated brain regions involved in attention - demanding mental tasks .
They showed much less activation of these regions when making the more culturally familiar absolute judgments .
East Asians showed the opposite tendency , engaging the brain ’s attention system more for absolute judgments than for relative judgments .
“ We were surprised at the magnitude of the difference between the two cultural groups , and also at how widespread the engagement of the brain ’s attention system became when making judgments outside the cultural comfort zone , ” says Hedden .
The researchers went on to show that the effect was greater in those individuals who identified more closely with their culture .
They used questionnaires of preferences and values in social relations , such as whether an individual is responsible for the failure of a family member , to gauge cultural identification .
Within both groups , stronger identification with their respective cultures was associated with a stronger culture - specific pattern of brain - activation .
How do these differences come about ” “ Everyone uses the same attention machinery for more difficult cognitive tasks , but they are trained to use it in different ways , and it ’s the culture that does the training , ” Gabrieli says .
“ It ’s fascinating that the way in which the brain responds to these simple drawings reflects , in a predictable way , how the individual thinks about independent or interdependent social relationships . ”

The War Against Ourselves
[ col. writ .
12/1/07 ]
( c ) '07 Mumia Abu - Jamal
We often think , when we dare to do so , of the Iraq War as a war over there , against ' those ' people - folks other than Us .
Depending on our political perspective , it is either a good war , or an evil war .
But , no matter our political , ideological perspective , time will determine whether it is n't a war against us all , as well .
That 's because for those tens of thousands who survive , who are neither killed nor maimed , they will return to the U.S. , with their minds twisted by an orgy of violence that will not easily be left ' over there . '
It is worthless to listen to any major political figures who speak of this war , for they are speaking with flowery words about unreality , with buzz phrases like , ' support our troops ' , ' they 're fighting for our freedoms ' , and other such nonsense .
Several recent books , written not by brass but by low level non commissioned officers , tells a story that will never make it to CNN , to the networks , or to the daily press .
That 's because these reports , written by line soldiers , are striking in their absence of political jargon , and the illusions usually presented as war reporting .
Do you remember reports about the notorious Iraqi house raids , ostensibly as searches for weapons ?
Paul Rieckhoff , a platoon leader of National Guardsmen describes how he and his men broke down doors , tied up all the men , and ransacked people 's homes .
Of these raids , Rieckhoff wrote , in his book , Chasing Ghosts : Failures and Facades in Iraq : A Soldier 's Perspective ( NAL Caliber : 2007 ) these " were nasty business .
Anybody who enjoyed them was sick .
Sometimes I felt like I was a member of the Brown shirts in Nazi Germany . "
Rieckhoff writes about men in his platoon stealing money from these Iraqi families , something he describes as not uncommon .
In the corporate media 's reflexive war promotion , and its overt message of ' support the troops ' , who knows what they are supporting ?
These books , written from the soldier 's viewpoint , tell of the gratuitous killing of unarmed civilians , both by high level bombings , artillery , and ground level shootings .
Men , women , and children are shot with an abandon that would make a terrorist blush .
One Texan , Marine lance corporal Jeffrey Carazales said , " Do you think people at home are going to see this -- all these women and children we 're killing ?
F - -k no .
Back home they 're glorifying this mo ----f----r , I guarantee you . " *
No politician , right or left , will describe them as modern day Nazis , riding roughshod over the Iraqi people , and indeed , creating a resistance that did n't exist at the time of the US invasion .
That 's how far politics is from the truth , a truth dripping out from soldiers , who are unafraid of self - description .
In the years to come , when people trickle home , they will carry these nightmares into their work lives , and also into their personal lives .
They will be cops , prison guards , politicians , merchants , teachers , and journalists .
Within them will be these silent demons who will not rest in Iraq .
American society was deeply impacted by the return of Vietnam veterans , and not for the better .
We have yet to see the ripples from the war wash against the shores of this land .
We will find that the blood of war , and the perversities of occupation will splash against us all .

Many bomblets fail to explode and continue to endanger civilians
The Israeli army announced there would be no indictments against officers who used them , after a year - long enquiry .
" The use of the weaponry was a concrete military necessity , " a statement said .
The UN called Israel 's cluster bombing " shocking and immoral " , as most were used in the last 72 hours of fighting when a resolution was clearly imminent .
According to the inquiry by the head of the army 's Defence College , the majority of cluster bombs were dropped in open areas and their use in urban areas was an " immediate response " to target areas that were being used as launch pads by Hezbollah guerrillas .
The findings were accepted by the army 's Judge Advocate General Avihai Mandelblit .
The UN says about four million cluster bomblets were dropped on Lebanon during the 34 - day conflict .
Many of them failed to explode on impact , posing a danger to civilians in their homes , gardens and fields .
More than 30 people have been reported killed by cluster bomb and land mine explosions since the 2006 war .
Although cluster bombs are not illegal under the laws of war , campaigners say their use in populated areas constitutes an indiscriminate attack on civilians .

Helium - 3 experiment replicates colliding - brane theory of cosmology .
Can you model what happened after the Big Bang in your lab ?
Can you model what happened in the early Universe in the laboratory ?
Yes , according to one group of physicists .
A team at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom has used liquid helium and a magnetic field to build a finger - sized representation of the early cosmos .
Their findings , published today in Nature Physics1 , could help string theorists to refine their models .
It is thought that shortly after the Big Bang , the nascent Universe underwent a very rapid period of expansion , known as inflation .
But theorists are still debating what drove the rapid growth .
A popular theory amongst string theorists is that inflation was caused by the collision of two ' branes ' .
A brane ( derived from the word ' membrane ' ) is a three - dimensional object suspended in a higher - dimensional space , in the same way that a sheet of paper is a two - dimensional object in a three - dimensional space .
One idea within string theory is that our entire Universe sits on a single such brane , and that it was our brane ’s collision with another that drove inflation .
The question is how to test this theory : finding two Universe - sized objects that you can crash into each other might be slightly difficult .
But a good analogue can be found in a strange concoction of liquid helium , according to Richard Haley , who led the team at Lancaster University .
Superfluid
Haley and his group used an 8 mm by 45 mm cylinder filled with helium - 3 , an isotope of helium that contains two protons and a single neutron .
When cooled to just 150 microkelvin above absolute zero , helium - 3 becomes a superfluid and begins to take on some odd traits : ghostly ' quasi - particles ' are formed that can flit effortlessly through the frigid liquid .
And the entire system can undergo ' symmetry breaking ' — a phenomenon also thought to have led to the creation of every force we see today except gravity .
It also tends to settle into one of two phases , which physicists label A and B .
The team used a magnetic field to create an A - phase slice of helium - 3 sandwiched between two sections of B - phase liquid .
They then decreased the field and watched as the two B - phases collided .
The colliding phases were , believe it or not , good analogues for colliding branes , Haley says .
While helium - 3 is radically different from the vacuum of space , the maths governing the two systems are similar .
Spot the defects
Haley and his team found evidence of defects — similar to those predicted by brane theory — left over from the collision .
Normally , quasi - particles can move with no resistance through superfluid helium - 3 , but have trouble crossing between A and B phases .
Haley ’s team found the quasi - particles still encountered resistance even after the A - phase was completely removed .
The most likely explanation is that their flow was impeded by strange , quantum - mechanical vortices left over from the collision , the team says .
Universe - sized brane collisions are thought to leave behind a tangle of defects called ' cosmic strings ' — massive , spaghetti- like objects that would criss - cross the entire cosmos .
None have been seen to date , but theorists believe that their gravity waves might one day be detected by specialized instruments .
This lab model of brane theory is far from perfect , says Cliff Burgess , a theorist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Canada .
For example , branes on the universal scale move at close to the speed of light and crinkle more easily than helium - 3 branes .
But nevertheless , he says , the liquid helium - 3 analogue could provide some clues about how cosmic defects form and what they might look like .
" Just having these two communities [ condensed - matter physicists and string theorists ] talking may suggest mechanisms to the theorists , " Burgess says .
Haley says his team will now begin trying to characterize the exact nature of the defects created when their little branes collide .
The consequence of that was that he was back into the characteristic mode of being the most un-curious person in the history of the planet .
Might he be the least bit interested in what this information is ?
Liar or un-curious ?
Well , the evidence says .... LIAR !
WaPo today :
Hadley said Bush was first told in August or September about intelligence indicating Iran had halted its weapons program , but was advised it would take time to evaluate .
So will anybody bother to point this out ?
WaPo 's first crack is not promising :
He denied that he knew about the new assessment before his Oct. 17 remarks , saying he was briefed on the latest NIE only last week .
He said the director of national intelligence , John M. McConnell , informed him in August that the intelligence community had " some new information " about Iran 's program .
" He did n't tell me what the information was .
He did tell me it was going to take a while to analyze . "
Surely the librul , out to get Bush NY Times will toss in a zinger :
He said that he had learned of the new intelligence findings only last week , and that no one in the intelligence community had urged him to step back from his tough warning , made in October , that a nuclear Iran could pose a danger of a " World War III . "
Well here 's a two - fer .
Not only is there no reference to an earlier briefing they stick with Dubya 's claim that nobody urged him to step back .
From that anti-Bush website whitehouse.gov :
when the President was told that we had some additional information , he was basically told : stand down ; needs to be evaluated
I realize these are just the initial write - ups after the presser , but this seems like basic information .

Report : Bonuses paid for dropping sick patients David Edwards and Nick Juliano

This A health insurance company serving customers in a half - dozen states set out to drop hundreds of customers and paid lucrative bonuses to an executive in charge of eliminating coverage .
One customer is suing the company , Health Net Inc. , after a company salesman pressured her to switch to a Health Net plan only for the company to cut - off her coverage in the middle of costly cancer treatment .
California small - business owner Patsy Bates was one of more than 1,600 customers who had their Health Net policies rescinded between 2000 and 2006 saving the company $ 35.5 million , the Los Angeles Times reports .
Over the same period the senior Health Net analyst in charge of canceling policies received more than $ 20,000 in bonuses based in part on her meeting annual targets for revoking the coverage .
Bates , who owns a beauty salon outside Los Angeles , is suing the company because it canceled her insurance when she was in the middle of chemotherapy treatments for breast cancer .
She alleges the company acted in bad faith and left her with $ 200,000 in unpaid medical bills while she remains unable to continue the cancer treatment .
Internal company documents made public in the suit " provided an unprecedented peek at a company 's internal operations and marked the first time an insurer had revealed how it linked cancellations to employee performance goals and to its bottom line , " reported Lisa Girion in the LA newspaper .
The documents outline the role played by Barbara Fowler , Health Net 's senior analyst overseeing rescission reviews .
The company set out to cut millions of dollars in costs by denying customer 's care , and Fowler was in charge of that effort , cutting around 300 policies per year .
In 2002 , rescinded 275 policies , nearly 100 more than the company 's goal that she cut 15 policies per month ( 180 in a year ) .
The next year , Fowler cut " $ 6 million in unnecessary health care expenses , " by eliminating 301 policies .
Health
Net called it a " banner year . "
Fowler 's policy - slashing acumen was on display again in 2005 , when she cut $ 7 million worth of coverage by eliminating nearly 300 policies , again exceeding the company 's goal .
" Barbara 's successful execution of her job responsibilities have been vital to the profitability " of individual and family policies , her supervisor wrote at the time .
Fowler 's cost - cutting zeal did not go unrewarded , although the company disputes the notion that she was compensated strictly for cutting off customers .
Over the seven year period , the analyst 's annual bonuses ranged from $ 1,654 to $ 6,310 , but a company lawyer told the Times that just a fraction of that amount was tied to the policy cuts .
Health Net attorney William Helverstine said no more than $ 276 in any year was tied to cancellations .
What Fowler did is hardly unusual in the US healthcare industry .
Insurance companies routinely employ cancellation departments to review customer records as soon as they ask the company to cover a costly procedure .
Once they 're asked to start paying pricey hospital bills , companies will review policies to ensure the clients qualified for coverage when the signed up .
However , the documents in Bates case reveal possible illegality in how Health Net conducted its reviews , according to the Times .
California law forbids insurance companies from tying any compensation for reviewers to their decisions to cut claims .
Health
Net also represents customers in New York , New Jersey , Oregon , Arizona and Connecticut .
Critics say the insurers are more concerned with padding their pockets than protecting policyholders , and several lawsuits have been brought alleging that companies improperly cut - off care , leaving sick customers unable to pay crushing medical bills .
" Insurers love to market the promise , ' We 'll take care of you .
Just sign here , ' " Karen Pollitz , of the Institute for Health Care Research and Policy at Georgetown University , told USA Today earlier this year .
" Then there is all this opportunity for the insurer not to keep the promise , and you do n't find out until it 's too late . "
Health
Net insists it was justified in its sudden elimination of coverage because Bates shaved 35 pounds from her weight when she listed it on an insurance application , and she did not disclose that she had been screened for a preexisting heart condition .
Had it known either of those factors , the policy never would have been approved to begin with .
Bates says a Health Net broker visited her beauty shop in Gardenea , Calif. , in 2003 promising to save her money if she switched from her current health insurance provider .
She says the broker filled out the application the company now claims is inaccurate .
The broker was " asking questions about her medical history as she styled a client 's hair in her busy shop and he talked to another client waiting for an appointment at the counter , " the LA Times reports .
" She maintained that she answered his questions as best she could and did not know whether he asked every question on the application . "
Bates is seeking $ 6 million in compensation and damages from her lawsuit .
The arbitrator in the case , former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Sam Cianchetti , earlier ruled the rescission of Bates coverage invalid ; at the end of a hearing that began Thursday Cianchetti will determine whether the company acted in bad faith and owes Bates any damages .
Bates ' lawyer , William Shernoff , called the company 's behavior " reprehensible " and said Health Net 's linkage of compensation with coverage cuts show it was looking for any excuse to cancel policies and save money .
" I have n't seen this kind of thing for years , " Shernoff told the Timesa .
" It does n't get much worse . "

Two University of Iowa researchers , Robert L. Ohsfeldt and John E. Schneider , reviewed the data for the nations of the OECD to statistically account for the incidence of fatal injuries for the member countries .
The dynamic table above
presents their findings
, showing both the average life expectancy from birth over the years 1980 to 1999 without any adjustment ( the actual " raw " mean ) , and again after accounting for the effects of premature death resulting from a non-health - related fatal injury ( the standardized mean ) .
Without accounting for the incidence of fatal injuries , the United States ties for 14th of the 16 OECD nations listed .
But once fatal injuries are taken into account , U.S. " natural " life expectancy from birth ( 76.9 years ) ranks first among the richest nations of the world .

Stress , to put it bluntly , is bad for you .
It can kill you , in fact .
A study now reveals that stress causes deterioration in everything from your gums to your heart and can make you more susceptible to everything from the common cold to cancer .
Thanks to new research crossing the disciplines of psychology , medicine , neuroscience , and genetics , the mechanisms underlying the connection are rapidly becoming understood .
The first clues to the link between stress and health were provided in the 1930s by Hans Selye , the first scientist to apply the word “ stress ” — then simply an engineering term — to the strains experienced by living organisms in their struggles to adapt and cope with changing environments .
One of Selye 's major discoveries was that the stress hormone cortisol had a long - term effect on the health of rats .
Cortisol has been considered one of the main culprits in the stress - illness connection , although it plays a necessary role in helping us cope with threats .
When an animal perceives danger , a system kicks into gear : A chain reaction of signals releases various hormones — most notably epinephrine ( “ adrenaline ” ) , norepinephrine , and cortisol — from the adrenal glands above each kidney .
These hormones boost heart rate , increase respiration , and increase the availability of glucose ( cellular fuel ) in the blood , thereby enabling the famous “ fight or flight ” reaction .
Because these responses take a lot of energy , cortisol simultaneously tells other costly physical processes — including digestion , reproduction , physical growth , and some aspects of the immune system — to shut or slow down .
When occasions to fight or flee are infrequent and threats pass quickly , the body 's stress thermostat adjusts accordingly : Cortisol levels return to baseline ( it takes 40 - 60 minutes ) , the intestines resume digesting food , the sex organs kick back into gear , and the immune system resumes fighting infections .
But problems occur when stresses do n't let up — or when , for various reasons , the brain continually perceives stress even if it is n't really there .
Stress begins with the perception of danger by the brain , and it appears that continued stress can actually bias the brain to perceive more danger by altering brain structures such as those which govern the perception of and response to threat .
Prolonged exposure to cortisol inhibits the growth of new neurons , and can cause increased growth of the amygdala , the portion of the brain that controls fear and other emotional responses .
The end result is heightened expectation of and attention to threats in the environment .
Stress hormones also inhibit neuron growth in parts of the hippocampus , a brain area essential in forming new memories .
In this way , stress results in memory impairments and impairs the brain 's ability to put emotional memories in context .
Think of it this way :
Too much stress and you forget not to be stressed out .
These brain changes are thought by some researchers to be at the heart of the link between stress and depression — one of stress 's most devastating health consequences — as well as posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) .
Although when we think of stressors we might think of big things like abuse , illness , divorce , grieving , or getting fired , it is now known that the little things — traffic , workplace politics , noisy neighbors , a long line at the bank — can add up and have a similar impact on our well - being and our health .
People who report more minor irritants in their lives also have more mental and physical health problems than those who encounter fewer hassles .
And recent research shows that PTSD may be the result of stressors adding up like building blocks , remodeling the plastic brain in a cumulative rather than a once - and - for - all fashion .
But the best known of stress 's health impacts are on the heart .
The idea that stress directly causes coronary heart disease has been around since the 1950s ; although once controversial , the direct stress - cardiac link is now well - documented by many studies .
For instance , men who faced chronic stresses at work or at home ran a 30 percent higher likelihood of dying over the course of a nine - year study ; in another study , individuals reporting neglect , abuse , or other stressors in childhood were over three times as likely as nonstressed individuals to develop heart disease in adulthood .
Adding insult to injury , stress may even have a selfperpetuating effect .
Depression and heart disease , for example , are not only the results of stress , but also causes of ( more ) stress .
Consequently , the chronically stressed body can appear less like a thermostat than like a wailing speaker placed too close to a microphone — a feedback loop in which the stress response goes out of control , hastening physical decline with age .
Growing evidence shows that our sensitivity to stress as adults is already “ tuned , ” so to speak , in infancy .
Specifically , the amount of stress encountered in early life sensitizes an organism to a certain level of adversity ; high levels of early life stress may result in hypersensitivity to stress later , as well as to adult depression .
A history of various stressors such as abuse and neglect in early life are a common feature of those with chronic depression in adulthood , for example .
At McGill University in Montreal , Michael J. Meaney and his colleagues have studied mother and infant rats , using rat maternal behavior as a model of early life stress and its later ramifications in humans .
The key variable in the world of rat nurturance is licking and grooming .
Offspring of rat mothers who naturally lick and groom their pups a lot are less easily startled as adults and show less fear of novel or threatening situations — in other words , less sensitivity to stress — than offspring of less nurturant mothers .
The same thing is true of offspring of naturally less nurturant mothers who are raised ( or “ cross - fostered ” ) by more nurturant ones .
By the same token , low - licking - and - grooming rat mothers are themselves more fearful than the more nurturant rat moms ; but again , female offspring of those non-nurturant mothers foster - parented by nurturant mothers show less fear and are themselves more nurturant when they have pups of their own .
This indicates that the connection between maternal nurturance and stress responsiveness is not simply genetic , but that fearfulness and nurturance are transmitted from generation to generation through maternal behavior .
The vicious cycle of stress hormones biasing us to perceive more threat and react with an increased stress response might seem like some kind perverse joke played by nature — or at least a serious design flaw in the brain .
But it makes better sense if we take the brain out of its modern , urban , “ civilized ” context .
The stress response is a necessary response to danger .
For animals , including most likely our hominid ancestors , behavioral transmission of individual differences in stress reactivity from parents to offspring makes sense as an adaptation to fluctuating levels of danger in the environment .
Animals raised in chronically adverse conditions ( e.g. , high conflict , material deprivation ) may expect more of the same in the near future ; so in effect , the maternal treatment of offspring attunes them to the level of stress they may expect to encounter in their lives .
As such , a response that seems baffling and counterproductive in a modern , civilized context may make more sense in the context of our distant evolutionary past .
Even depression has been theorized as playing an adaptive role in certain contexts .
The inactivity , lack of motivation , loss of interest in pleasurable activities like sex , and withdrawal from social relationships experienced by depressed people closely resemble “ sickness behavior ” — the energy - saving lethargy activated by the immune system in response to infection .
In a natural setting , the hopeless attitude of depression may be the most adaptive for an organism infected with a pathogen :
The best strategy for survival is not to expend energy fruitlessly and become exposed to predators , but to hunker down , hide from threats , and direct energy to immune processes where it 's needed .
And it turns out that baboons suffer from depression and other stress - related disorders , just like people do .
According to Stanford neuroendocrinologist Robert Sapolsky , who has studied stress in baboon troops , it is the relative safety from predators and high amounts of leisure time enjoyed by some primates — including humans — that has transformed these useful biological coping mechanisms into a source of pointless suffering and illness .
Besides heart disease , PTSD , and depression , chronic stress has been linked to ailments as diverse as intestinal problems , gum disease , erectile dysfunction , adult - onset diabetes , growth problems , and even cancer .
Chronic rises in stress hormones have been shown to accelerate the growth of precancerous cells and tumors ; they also lower the body 's resistance to HIV and cancer - causing viruses like human papilloma virus ( the precursor to cervical cancer in women ) .
The great challenge in stress psychology — and the necessary precursor to developing interventions against stress 's harmful effects — has been understanding the mechanisms by which thoughts and feelings and other “ mental ” stuff can affect bodily health .
For many years , it was believed that the main causal link between stress and disease was the immune suppression that occurs when the body redirects its energy toward the fight - or - flight response .
But recent research has revealed a far more nuanced picture .
Stress is known to actually enhance one important immune response , inflammation , and increasingly this is being seen as the go - between in various stress - related diseases .
Ordinarily , inflammation is how the healthy body deals with damaged tissue : Cells at the site of infections or injuries produce signaling chemicals called cytokines , which in turn attract other immune cells to the site to help repair it .
Cytokines also travel to the brain and are responsible for initiating sickness behavior .
Overactive cytokine production has been found to put individuals at greater risk for a variety of aging - related illnesses .
Cytokines may be an important mediator in the relationship between stress and heart disease .
When the arteries feeding the heart are damaged , cytokines induce more blood flow , and thus more white blood cells , to the site .
White blood cells accumulate in vessel walls and , over time , become engorged with cholesterol , becoming plaques ; these may later become destabilized and rupture , causing heart attacks .
Cytokine action also has been implicated in the link between stress and depression .
People suffering from clinical depression have shown 40 – 50 percent higher concentrations of certain inflammatory cytokines .
And about 50 percent of cancer patients whose immune responses are artificially boosted through the administration of cytokines show depressive symptoms .
The close connection between inflammation and both depression and heart disease has led some researchers to theorize that inflammation may be what mediates the two - way street between these two conditions : Depression can lead to heart disease , but heart disease also often leads to depression .
Sleep may be part of this puzzle too , as disturbed sleep , which often goes with anxiety and depression , increases levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the body .
Not everyone responds the same way to stress .
Personality traits like negativity , pessimism , and neuroticism are known to be risk factors for stress - related disease , as are anger and hostility .
In the late 1950s , Friedman and Rosenman identified a major link between stress and health with their research on the “ Type A ” personality : a person who is highly competitive , aggressive , and impatient .
This personality was found to be a strong predictor of heart disease , and later research clarified the picture :
The salient factors in the relationship between the Type A personality and health are mainly anger , hostility , and a socially dominant personality style ( for example , tending to interrupt other people while they are talking ) .
When negative emotions like anger are chronic , it is as if the body is in a constant state of fight or flight .
There is now evidence that another trait associated with success - striving in the modern world — persistence — may also lead to health problems in some circumstances .
When goals are not readily attainable , the inability to detach from them may produce frustration , exhaustion , rumination on failures , and lack of sleep .
These in turn activate harmful inflammatory responses that can lead to illness and lowered immunity .
Studies also have shown that optimistic people have lower incidence of heart disease , better prognosis after heart surgery , and longer life .
The effects of a positive attitude on immunity were shown in a study by Sheldon Cohen , Carnegie Mellon University , and his colleagues , in which individuals were exposed to a cold virus in a laboratory setting and watched over six days .
Those with a positive emotional style were less likely to develop colds than were individuals with low levels of positive affect .
Positive affect was also found to be correlated with reduced symptom severity and reduced pain .
Personality and environmental factors are not the whole story when it comes to stress .
The next frontier of stress research is the rapidly growing field of behavioral genetics .
Modeling the interaction of genetic and environmental influences is no longer a matter of weighing the relative input of nature and nurture .
The two intertwine in subtle and complicated ways , with environments affecting gene expression , and vice versa , throughout life .
Thus , the current watchword is “ stress - diathesis ” models , in which environmental stressors have varying impact on individuals due to preexisting inherited vulnerabilities .
One major advance in this area was the discovery by Avshalom Caspi , University of Wisconsin , and his colleagues of a link between stress sensitivity and a particular gene called 5HTTLPR .
Findings suggest certain genetic makeup seems to increase the risk for a serious illness through the mechanism of increased sensitivity to stressful occurrences .
Nathan Fox , University of Maryland , and his colleagues subsequently reported that children with two short alleles of the 5HTTLPR gene , whose mothers also reported receiving low social support , were more likely to show behavioral inhibition ( fearfulness and a tendency to withdraw ) at age 7 .
Those receiving high support did not show the tendency , and those with the long alleles but receiving low support also appeared “ protected ” by their genetic makeup .
Genetic predisposition to stress sensitivity may in some cases become a self - fulfilling cycle .
Fox and colleagues found that some very behaviorally inhibited children were regarded by their mothers as hard to soothe and received less care and sensitivity as a result ; this in turn tuned up the child 's sensitivity to stress .
In the model Fox and colleagues propose , genetically influenced temperament in early childhood influences the quality of caregiving children receive , which in turn shapes a child 's attention bias to threat .
But look on the bright side :
The newly refined science of stress could lead to new drug therapies that can control stress or inhibit its effects on health .
Also , depression and anxiety are not only results of stress , but also causes , and existing therapeutic and medical treatments for these conditions can help change how people perceive threats , put their life challenges in context , and cut stressors down to manageable size .
The cycle does n't have to be vicious , in other words .
What 's more , the confirmation that the mind directly affects the body can work as much in our favor as it does to our detriment , as the personality - and - stress research above indicates .
As Carol Dweck , Stanford University , has argued , personality is mutable .
In theory , if our outlooks and beliefs about ourselves can be changed , so can our vulnerability to life 's slings and arrows .
Relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga , for example , have been confirmed to quell stress demons .
Even if you are a determined workaholic glued to your cell phone or a fearful and angry urban neurotic , stress - reduction methods are readily available to cope with stress in the short term and even alter perceptions of stressors in the long term .
The bottom line : Stress is not inevitable .
Current Research on Stress :
At the University of Chicago , APS President John Cacioppo and Louise Hawkley have studied the health effects of social isolation , an increasingly common malady in the modern world .
Among their findings are that lonely older adults show more arterial stiffening and higher blood pressure than their nonlonely counterparts and that the association between loneliness and blood pressure increases with age .
In middle - aged and older adults ( but not young adults ) , loneliness is associated with higher levels of epinephrine in the blood , and lonely people of all ages show elevated levels of cortisol .
By desensitizing the mechanism whereby cortisol turns off more cortisol production , the social isolation frequently experienced by older adults may hasten physical decline .
Lonely individuals of all ages also have poorer sleep than nonlonely people and therefore get less of sleep 's essential restorative benefits .
Humans and other social animals particularly seek the company of others when facing threats — both for safety and for social support .
The general affiliative response — what Shelley Taylor , UCLA , has called “ tending and befriending . ”
Oxytocin rises during times of separation or disrupted social relations .
Just as the familiar “ adrenaline rush ” of epinephrine induces the familiar fight - or - flight reaction , it is oxytocin that causes us to desire company and social togetherness .
It may be especially important in females , reflecting their different reproductive and survival priorities from those of males — i.e. , caregiving ( tending offspring ) and lessening social tensions through friendly overtures ( befriending ) .
The " Live Free or Die " State voting McCain , Huckabee & Democrats over Ron Paul -- they have sent a message loud and clear .
As it stands they are voting for those who want the National ID Card , HR 1955 - Thought Crimes Bill , Gun Restrictions , Continuous War , the never ending Welfare state and Amnesty to Illegal Immigrants .
Change ?
Show me the change !
This country is moving in one direction .
Bankruptcy !
The only change I see is falling out of my wallet when I turn it over and it 's pennies instead of dollars .
Both are worthless .
When people do n't get the concept that oil is $ 100 a barrel in America but the price is n't raising in other countries because our dollar value has gone down and that it takes more dollars to buy oil !..... I guess all we can expect is that they vote for those who will promise to take care of them with socialistic ideals or who want nothing more than continuous war in the name of religion .
They can just print more money , right ?
And lets not forget our traitors to the Constitution ....
How many amendments have we left ?
I really have to wonder about where this country is going .
Have we dumbed down that much ?
Do we want to be taken care of that badly ?
Do we need to have chips in our arms next so that they can keep track of us even more than they already do on our internet , cell phones and credit card usage ?
Will the national id card give away all our secrets when we walk into the US Post Office ?
Live free or die ?
I guess living free means being taken care of while our children die in war !
Problems of Data Access Layers
A nice little summary of the issues involved in writing and using data access layers ( DALs ) on top of databases , by Will Hartung ( I think I saw this on del.icio.us ) :
In Days Of Yore , with ISAM style databases , this was the typical paradigm for processing .
use OrderCustomerIndex Find Order ' CUST001 ' Fetch Order while (order.custcode = ' CUST001 ') use OrderDetailOrderIndex Find OrderDetail order.orderno Fetch OrderDetail while ( orderdetail.orderno = order.orderno ) use ItemItemCodeIndex Find Item orderdetail.itemcode Fetch Item ... Fetch Next OrderDetail end while Fetch Next Order end while
So , if you had 10 orders with 5 lines items each , this code would " hit " the DB library 100 times ( 10 for each order , once for the OrderDetail and once for Item data ) .
When DB calls are " cheap " , this kind of thing is n't that expensive ( since every DBMS ( Relational and Object ) on the planet essentially has an ISAM ( B - Tree ) core , they do this kind of thing all day long ) .
So , if you wrote your code with a DAL , you could easily come up with something like this : ( defun process - orders ( cust - code ) ( let ( ( orders ( find - orders cust - code ) ) ) ( dolist ( order orders ) ( let ( ( details ( find - order - details ( order - no order ) ) ) ) ( dolist ( detail details ) ( let ( ( item ( find-item ( detail - item - code detail ) ) ) ) ( do - stuff order detail item ) ) ) ) ) ) )
But this is a trap , and this is where THE problem occurs with most any relational mapping process .
Naively implemented with SQL , again for 10 orders with 5 line items each , you end up with SIXTY ( !!!)
SQL hits to the database .
( 1 query for the initial orders , 1 query for each order for its detail , 1 query for each detail for the item data ) .
This is Bad .
Round trips to the DB are SLLOOWWW , and this will KILL your performance .
Instead , you want to suck in the entire graph with a single query : SELECT orders .* , orderdetails .* , items . *
FROM orders , orderdetails , items WHERE orders.custcode = ?
AND orderdetails.orderno = orders.orderno AND items.itemcode = orderdetails.itemcode
Then , you use that to build your graph so you can do this : ( defun process - orders ( cust - code ) ( let ( ( orders ( find - orders cust - code ) ) ) ( dolist ( order orders ) ( let ( ( details ( order - details order ) ) ) ( dolist ( detail details ) ( let ( ( item ( detail - item detail ) ) ) ( do - stuff order detail item ) ) ) ) ) ) )
And THAT 's all well and good , but say you wanted to get the total of all canceled orders : ( defun canceled - orders - total ( cust - code ) ( let ( ( orders ( find - orders cust - code ) ) ( total 0 ) ) ( dolist ( order orders ) ( when ( equal ( order - status order ) " C " ) ( setf total (+ total ( order - total order ) ) ) ) ) total ) )
This is fine , but you just sucked the bulk of ALL of the orders , including their detail and item information , to get at a simple header field .
Now , certainly this could have been done with a simple query as well : SELECT sum( total ) FROM orders WHERE status = ' C' AND custcode= ?
The point is that balancing the granularity of what your DAL does , and how it does it , needs to be determined up front , at least in a rough edged way .
This is what I mean by being aware that an RDBMS is going to be your eventual persistent store .
If you do n't assume that , you may very well end up with a lot of code like the first example that will immediately suck as soon as you upgrade to the SQL database .
In my own days of yore ( 1997ish ) , I wrote a pretty complicated data access layer for a big Win32 application — in Visual Basic .
The basic idea , which was Jim Firby 's , was pretty neat , in that it made databases look almost like associative arrays .
Data was addressed with tuples , so [ " books_by_isbn " " 0140125051 " " title " ] would be the address ( we called them “ IGLs ” , for Info Group Locator or something ) of the " title " field of the record whose key field was “ 0140125051 ” in the " books_by_isbn " table . [ " books_by_isbn " " 0140125051 " " * " ] would be the collection of fields for book 0140125051 , and [ " books_by_isbn " " * " " * " ] would be all books in the table .
There was a virtual translation layer , so if you wanted you could have a single " books " table that contained both ISBNs and ASINs , and then define virtual " books_by_isbn " and " books_by_asin " tables that would let you use IGLs that indexed by ISBN or ASIN respectively .
It seems a little insane now , but actually every column of every table went through the virtual translation map , which was just another table in the database .
What can I say , we were Lispers with an AI background , indirection was in our blood .
There was so much to the Datalink , as my DAL was called : 14,000 lines of shared caches , events , rules engines and schema migration support .
But the result for users of the code was that complex database access patterns seemed simple and clean .
But of course we ran into the problem that some combinations of simple , clean Datalink operations would be fast and others would be slow and unless you knew a lot of the details of the Datalink implementation you could n't easily predict which way it would go .
Which is exactly the sort of trap mentioned by Will .
I ended up writing a series of tech notes on how to structure common operations with the Datalink to keep things fast .
It was effective , in that users of the code could then get good performance , but it did n't feel like the most satisfying solution .
But the problem seems to be that nobody knows how to come up with a satisfying solution .

Linux kernel version 2.6.23 Released 9 October 2007 ( full SCM git log )
During the development of 2.6.23 , the 2007 version of the Linux Kernel Developers ' Summit was held on September 5 and 6 in Cambridge , UK .
We only can recommend to read the excellent coverage done by LWN .
1. Short overview ( for news sites , etc )
2.6.23 includes the new , better , fairer CFS process scheduler , a simpler read - ahead mechanism , the lguest ' Linux - on - Linux ' paravirtualization hypervisor , XEN guest support , KVM smp guest support , variable process argument length , make SLUB the default slab allocator , SELinux protection for exploiting null dereferences using mmap , XFS and ext4 improvements , PPP over L2TP support , the ' lumpy ' reclaim algorithm , a userspace driver framework , the O_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag , splice improvements , new fallocate ( ) syscall , lock statistics , support for multiqueue network devices , various new drivers and many other minor features and fixes .
2. Important things ( AKA : '' the cool stuff ' ' )
2.1 . The CFS process scheduler
The new process scheduler , a.k.a CFS ( Completely Fair Scheduler ) , has generated too much noise in some circles due to the way this scheduler has been chosen over its competitor RSDL .
A bit of history is needed to clarify what happened and what CFS does compared to the old scheduler .
During the development of Linux 2.5 , the ' O ( 1 ) ' process scheduler ( PS ) from Ingo Molnar was merged to replace the one inherited from 2.4 .
The O(1 ) PS was designed to fix the scalability issues in the 2.4 PS - the performance improvements were so big that the O(1 ) PS was one of the most frequently backported features to 2.4 in commercial Linux distributions .
However , the algorithms in charge of scheduling processes were not changed that much , as they were considered ' good enough ' , or at least it was n't perceived as a critical issue .
But those algorithms can make a huge difference in what the users perceive as ' interactivity ' .
For example , if a process - or more than one - starts an endless loop and due to those CPU - bound loopers and the PS does n't assign as much CPU as necessary to the already present non-looping processes in charge of implementing the user interfaces ( X.org , kicker , firefox , openoffice.org , etc ) , the user will perceive that the programs do n't react to the users ' actions very smoothly .
Or worse , in the case of music players your music could skip .
The O(1 ) PS , just like the previous PSs , tried to improve those cases and generally , it did a good job most of the time .
However , many users reported corner cases and not - so - corner cases where the new PS did n't work as expected .
One of those users was Con Kolivas , and despite his inexperience in the kernel hacking world , he tried to fine - tune the scheduling algorithms , without replacing them .
His work was a success , and his patches found a way into the main kernel , and other people ( Mike Galbraith , Davide Libenzi , Nick Piggin ) also helped to tweak the scheduler .
But not all the corner cases disappeared , and some new ones appeared when trying to fix others .
Con found that the ' interactivity estimator ' - a piece of code used by the PS to try to decide which processes were more ' interactive ' and hence needed more attention , so that the user would perceive their desktops as ' more interactive ' - caused more problems than it solved .
Contrary to its original purpose , the interactivity estimator could n't fix all the ' interactivity ' problems present in the PS , and trying to fix one would open another issue .
It was the typical case of an algorithm using statistics to try to predict the future with heuristics , and failing at it .
Con designed a new PS , called RSDL , that killed the interactivity estimation code .
Instead , his PS was based on the concept of ' fairness ' : processes are treated equally and are given same timeslices ( see this LWN article for more details on this PS ) , and the PS does n't care or even try to guess if the process is CPU bound or IO - bound ( interactive ) .
This PS improved the user 's perceived " interactivity " in those corner cases as well .
This PS was the one that was going to get merged , but Ingo Molnar ( the O ( 1 ) creator ) created another new PS , called CFS ( alias for ' Completely Fair Scheduler ' ) , taking as one the basic design element the ' fair scheduling ' idea that Con 's PS had proven to be superior .
It was well received by some hackers , which helped Ingo ( and Mike Galbraith , Peter Zijlstra , Thomas Gleixner , Suresh Siddha , and many others ) to make CFS a good PS alternative for mainline .
' Fairness ' is the only idea shared between RSDL and CFS and that 's where the similarities stop , and even the definition of ' fairness ' is very different : RSDL uses a ' strict ' definition of fairness .
But CFS includes the sleep time in the task 's fairness metric : this means that in CFS , sleeping tasks ( the kind of tasks that usually run the code that the user feels as ' interactive ' , like X.org , mp3 players , etc ) do get more CPU time than running tasks ( unlike the ' strict fairness ' of RSDL , where they are treated with a strict fairness ) , but it 's all kept under control by the fairness engine .
This design gets the best of both worlds : fairness and interactivity , but without resorting to an interactivity estimator .
CFS has other differences compared to the old mainline scheduler and RSDL : instead of runqueues , it uses a time - ordered rbtree to build a ' timeline ' of future task execution , to try to avoid the ' array switch ' artifacts that both the vanilla and the RSDL PS can suffer .
It also uses nanosecond granularity accounting and does not rely on any jiffies or other HZ detail ; in fact it does not have the notion of traditional ' timeslices ' : the slicing is decided dynamically , not statically , and there 's no persistency to timeslices ( i.e. timeslices are not ' given ' to a task and ' used up ' by a task , in the traditional sense , because CFS is able to accurately track the full history of the task 's execution via the nanoseconds accounting ) .
Plus it has extensive instrumentation with CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG=y .
Because of all those changes , CFS is a quite radical rewrite of the Linux PS ( ~ 70 % of its code is touched ) , and hence bigger than RSDL ( in terms of patch 's size , not the memory footprint : RSDL patchset weighted 88 K , whereas CFS patcheset weights 290k ) .
Read this LWN article for more details on CFS design .
So CFS was finally chosen as replacement for the current ' O ( 1 ) '
PS over RSDL - surprisingly this choice generated much noise due to Con announcement about quitting from kernel development - but Con has publicly said that it 's not due to that .
It seems like the debate has calmed down now and that there 's no reason to think that CFS was chosen for anything but technical reasons .
It must be noted that both RSDL and CFS are better schedulers than the one in mainline , and that it was Con who pioneered the idea of using the concept of ' fairness ' over the ' interactivity estimations ' , but that does n't mean that CFS did n't deserve to get merged as the definitive replacement of the mainline 's PS ; it does n't mean either that RSDL is n't also great replacement .
NOTE ! : Applications that depend heavily on sched_yield ( ) 's behaviour ( like , f.e. , many benchmarks ) can suffer from huge performance gains / losses due to the very very subtle semantics of what sched_yield ( ) should do and how CFS changes them .
There 's a sysctl at / proc / sys / kernel / sched_compat_yield that you can set to " 1 " to change the sched_yield ( ) behaviour that you should try in those cases .
It must be also noticed that CFS is also available as a backport for 2.6.22 , 2.6.21 and 2.6.20 .

2.2 . On - demand read - ahead
Click to read a recommended LWN article about on - demand read - ahead
On - demand read - ahead is an attempt to simplify the Adaptive read - ahead patches .
On - demand readahead reimplements the Linux readahead functionality , removing a lot of complexity from the current system and making it more flexible .
This new system maintains the same performance for trivial sequential / random reads , it improves the sysbench / OLTP MySQL benchmark up to 8 % , and performance on readahead thrashing gains up to 3 times .
There are more read - ahead patches based in this infrastructure pending and further work could be done in this area as well , so expect more improvements in the future .
Detailed design document and benchmarks can be found here .

2.3. fallocate ( )
Click to read a recommended LWN article about fallocate ( )
fallocate ( ) is a new system call which will allow applications to preallocate space to any file (s ) in a file system .
Applications can get a guarantee of space for particular file (s ) - even if later the system becomes full .
Applications can also use this feature to avoid fragmentation to certain level in many filesystems ( fe : it avoids the fragmentation that can happen in files that are frequently increasing their size ) and thus get faster access speed .
Currently , glibc provides the POSIX interface called posix_fallocate ( ) which can be used for similar cause .
Though this has the advantage of working , it is quite slow ( since it writes zeroes to each block that has to be preallocated ) .
Without a doubt , file systems can do this more efficiently within the kernel , by implementing the proposed fallocate ( ) system call , and this is what 2.6.23 does .
It is expected that posix_fallocate ( ) will be modified to call this new system call first and in case the kernel / filesystem does not implement it , it should fall back to the current implementation of writing zeroes to the new blocks .
In 2.6.23 , only ext4 and ocfs2 are adding support for the fallocate ( ) interface .

2.4 . Virtualization : lguest and Xen
Linux has good virtualization support thanks to the paravirtualization and KVM support .
2.6.23 is improving the support of the trend - of - the - decade by adding lguest and Xen support - both of them based in the paravirt_ops infrastructure .
2.4.1. lguest
Click to read a recommended article about lguest
lguest is a simple hypervisor for Linux on Linux ( in other words , it allows to run linux - only linux - guests ) based in the paravirt_ops infrastructure .
Unlike kvm it does n't need VT / SVM hardware .
Unlike Xen it 's simply " modprobe and go " .
Unlike both , it 's 5000 lines and self - contained .
The goal of his author , Rusty Russell , was not to create the simplest and greatest hypervisor ever , but rather create a simple , small ( 5000 lines of code ) hypervisor example to show the world how powerful the paravirt_ops infrastructure is .
Performance is ok , but not great ( - 30 % on kernel compile ) , precisely because it was written to be simple .
But given its hackability , it may improve soon .
The author encourages people to fork it and try to create a much better hypervisor :
Too much of the kernel is a big ball of hair .
lguest is simple enough to dive into and hack , plus has some warts which scream " fork me ! " .
A 64 - bit version is also being worked on .
Lguest host support ( CONFIG_LGUEST ) can be compiled as a module ( lg.ko ) .
This is the host support - once you load it , your kernel will be able to run virtualized lguest guests .
But kernel guests need to compile lguest guest support in order to be able to run under the lguest host .
The configuration variable that enables the guest support is CONFIG_LGUEST_GUEST - but that option will be enabled automatically once you set CONFIG_LGUEST to 'y ' or ' m ' .
This means that a kernel compiled with lguest host support does also get lguest guest support .
In other words , you can use the same kernel you use to be a host as guest kernel .
In order to load and run new guests , you need a loader userspace program .
The instructions and the program can be found at Documentation / lguest/lguest.txt
Code : drivers / lguest , Documentation / lguest
2.4.2 . Xen
Part of Xen has been merged .
The support included in 2.6.23 will allow the kernel to boot in a paravirtualized environment under the Xen hypervisor .
But support for the hypervisor is not included - this is only guest support , no dom0 , no suspend / resume , no ballooning .
It 's based in the paravirt_ops infrastructure .
Code : ( part 1 , drivers / xen , part 2 , arch / i386/xen )
2.5 . Variable argument length
From a Slashdot interview to Rob Pike : I did n't use Unix at all , really , from about 1990 until 2002 , when I joined Google .
( I worked entirely on Plan 9 , which I still believe does a pretty good job of solving those fundamental problems . )
I was surprised when I came back to Unix how many of even the little things that were annoying in 1990 continue to annoy today .
In 1975 , when the argument vector had to live in a 512 - byte - block , the 6th Edition system would often complain , ' arg list too long ' .
But today , when machines have gigabytes of memory , I still see that silly message far too often .
The argument list is now limited somewhere north of 100 K on the Linux machines I use at work , but come on people , dynamic memory allocation is a done deal !
While Linux is not Plan 9 , in 2.6.23 Linux is adding variable argument length .
Theoretically you should n't hit frequently " argument list too long " errors again , but this patch also limits the maximum argument length to 25 % of the maximum stack limit ( ulimit - s ) .

2.6 . PPP over L2TP
Linux 2.6.23 adds support for PPP - over - L2TP socket family .
L2TP ( RFC 2661 ) is a protocol used by ISPs and enterprises to tunnel PPP traffic over UDP tunnels .
L2TP is replacing PPTP for VPN uses .
The kernel component included in 2.6.23 handles only L2TP data packets : a userland daemon handles L2TP the control protocol ( tunnel and session setup ) .
One such daemon is OpenL2TP .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 ) Documentation : ( commit )
2.7 . Autoloading of ACPI kernel modules
With Linux 2.6.23 , the ACPI modules are exporting the device table symbols in the drivers so that udev can automatically load them through the usual mechanisms .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 )
2.6.23 also adds DMI / SMBIOS based module autoloading to the Linux kernel .
The idea is to load laptop drivers automatically ( and other drivers which cannot be autoloaded otherwise ) , based on the DMI system identification information of the BIOS .
Right now most distros manually try to load all available laptop drivers on bootup in the hope that at least one of them loads successfully .
This patch does away with all that , and uses udev to automatically load matching drivers on the right machines .

2.8. async_tx API
The async_tx API provides methods for describing a chain of asynchronous bulk memory transfers / transforms with support for inter-transactional dependencies .
It is implemented as a dmaengine client that smooths over the details of different hardware offload engine implementations .
The raid5 DM engine has been transformed to use the async_tx API , getting performance improvements ( in the tiobenchmark and with iop342 , it shows 20 - 30 % higher throughput for sequential writes and 40 - 55 % gains in sequential reads to a degraded array ) .

2.9 . ' Lumpy ' reclaim
Click to read a recommended LWN article which touches the ' lumpy ' reclaim feature
High - order petitions of free memory in the kernel ( IOW , petitions of free memory that are bigger than one memory page and must be contiguous ) can fail easily due to the memory fragmentation when there 's very little free memory left :
When the memory management subsystem tries to free some memory to make room for the petition , it frees pages in LRU ( Least Recently Used ) order , and pages freed in LRU order are not necessarily contiguous - rather , they 're freed according to how recently it was used .
So the allocation may still fail .
The ' lumpy ' reclaim modifies the reclaim algorithm to improve this situation :
When it needs to free some pages , it tries to free the pages contiguous to the first chosen page in the LRU , ignoring the recency , improving the possibilities of finding a contiguous block of free memory .
Code : ( commit )
2.10 . Movable Memory Zone
It is often known at allocation time whether a page may be migrated or not .
This feature adds a flag called __ GFP_MOVABLE to the memory allocator and a new mask called GFP_HIGH_MOVABLE .
Allocations using the __ GFP_MOVABLE can be either migrated using the page migration mechanism or reclaimed by syncing with backing storage and discarding .
This feature also creates a memory zone called ZONE_MOVABLE that is only usable by allocations that specify both __ GFP_HIGHMEM and __ GFP_MOVABLE .
This has the effect of keeping all non-movable pages within a single memory partition while allowing movable allocations to be satisfied from either partition .

2.11 . UIO
Click to read a recommended LWN article about UIO
UIO is a framework that allows to implement drivers in userspace .
This kind of thing causes much noise due to " monolithic vs microkernel " topic .
To the surprise of many , the Linux ecosystem has actually supported userspace drivers for cases that had sense for a long time .
libusb allows to access the USB bus from userspace and implement drivers there .
This is why you do n't have specific drivers for , f.e. , your scanner or USB digital camera , programs like sane , gphoto , gnokii , gtkam , hplip , or even some music players like rhythmbox or amarok , use libusb to access the USB bus and talk to USB devices directly .
The 2D X.org drivers that you configure in your x.org file are another popular example of drivers that not only they run in userspace , they also are portable to other unix operative systems ( they 're also an example of why userspace drivers can't avoid hanging your machine due to a bug in the driver that triggers a hardware hang ) .
CUPS and programs accessing the serial port like pppd are yet another example of userspace programs accessing the devices directly - the kernel does n't implement any specific LPT printer or serial modem driver , those userspace programs implement the driver that knows how to talk to the printer .
In other words , userspace drivers are not new .
UIO is not a try to migrate all the Linux kernel drivers to userspace .
In fact , a tiny ( 150 lines in the sample driver , including comments etc ) kernel - side driver to handle some basic interrupt routine is needed as part of every UIO driver .
UIO is just a simple way to create very simple , non-performance critical drivers , which has probably been merged more with a " merge- and - see- if- it- happens - something - interesting " attitude than anything else .
For now UIO does n't allow to create nothing but very very simple drivers : No DMA , no network and block drivers ....

2.12 . O_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag
Click to read a recommended LWN article about the O_CLOEXEC open ( ) flag
In multi - threaded code ( or more correctly : all code using clone ( ) with CLONE_FILES ) there 's a race when exec'ing ( see commit link for details ) .
In some applications this can happen frequently .
Take a web browser .
One thread opens a file and another thread starts , say , an external PDF viewer .
The result can even be a security issue if that open file descriptor refers to a sensitive file and the external program can somehow be tricked into using that descriptor .
2.6.23 includes the O_CLOEXEC ( " close - on - exec " ) fd flag on open ( ) and recvmsg ( ) to avoid this problem .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 )
2.13 . Use splice in the sendfile ( ) implementation
Splice is a innovative I/O method which was added in Linux 2.6.17 , based in a in - kernel buffer that the user has control over , where " splice ( ) " moves data to / from the buffer from / to an arbitrary file descriptor with splice ( ) , while " tee ( ) " copies the data in one buffer to another , ie : it " duplicates " it , or vmsplice ( ) to splice the data from / to user memory .
Because the in - kernel buffer is n't really copied from one address space to another , it allows to move data from / to a fd without an extra copy ( ie , " zero - copy " ) .
For the particular case of sending the data from a file descriptor to a fd socket , there 's been always the sendfile ( ) syscall . splice ( ) however is a generic mechanism , not just limited to what sendfile ( ) .
In other words , sendfile ( ) is just a small subset of what splice can do , splice obsoletes it .
In Linux 2.6.23 , the sendfile ( ) mechanism implementation is killed , but the API and its functionality is not removed , it 's instead implemented internally with the splice ( ) mechanisms .
Because sendfile ( ) is critical for many programs , specially for static web servers and FTPs , performance regressions could happen ( and performance improvements ! ) and the kernel hackers would really like to hear about them both in linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org and / or other usual communication channels .
In other news , 2.6.23 adds splice vmsplice - to - user support .
It must be noticed again that splice ( ) obsoletes sendfile ( ) in Linux , and its mechanisms allow to build further performance improvements in your software .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 )
2.14 . XFS and EXT4 improvements
XFS Lazy Superblock Counters :
When there are a couple of hundred transactions on the fly at once , they all typically modify the on disk superblock in some way . , locking the buffer until the transaction is committed into the incore log buffer .
The result of this is that with enough transactions on the fly the incore superblock buffer becomes a bottleneck .
In 2.6.23 , XFS avoids this bottleneck ( see commit for details ) .
But due the way XFS works , in order to make it work well with this new feature , a new counter was added to track the number of blocks used by the free space btrees .
This is an on - disk format change .
As a result of this , lazy superblock counters are a mkfs option and at the moment on Linux there is no way to convert an old filesystem , although one solution will be developed .
Code ( commit ) Concurrent Multi-File Data Streams :
In media spaces , video is often stored in a frame - per - file format .
When dealing with uncompressed realtime HD video streams in this format , it is crucial that files do not get fragmented and that multiple files are placed contiguously on disk .
When multiple streams are being ingested and played out at the same time , it is critical that the filesystem does not cross the streams and interleave them together as this creates seek and readahead cache miss latency and prevents both ingest and playout from meeting frame rate targets .
This feature creates a " stream of files " concept into the allocator to place all the data from a single stream contiguously on disk so that RAID array readahead can be used effectively .
Each additional stream gets placed in different allocation groups within the filesystem , thereby ensuring that XFS does n't cross any streams .
Code : ( commit )
EXT4 : As it gets developed , ext4 codebase is synced periodically to mainline .
In 2.6.23 , a sync with some features has been done - this does n't mean that ext4 is stable : Fallocate ( ) support ( commit ) , write support for preallocated blocks ( commit ) Change on - disk format to support 2^15 uninitialized extents ( commit ) Enable extents by default ( commit ) , ( commit ) Add nanosecond timestamps ( commit ) Remove 65000 subdirectory limit ( commit )
2.15 . Coredump filter mask
The purpose of this feature is to control which VMAs should be dumped based on their memory types and per-process flags , in order to avoid longtime system slowdown when a number of processes which share a huge shared memory are dumped at the same time , or just to avoid dumping information that you do n't need .
Users can access the per-process flags via / proc / < pid >/ coredump_filter interface .
coredump_filter represents a bitmask of memory types , and if a bit is set , VMAs of corresponding memory type are written into a core file when the process is dumped .
The bitmask is inherited from the parent process when a process is created .
Code : ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 )
2.16 .
Rewrite the x86 asm setup in C
In 2.6.23 the x86 setup code , which is currently all in assembly , is replaced with a version written in C , using the " .code16gcc " feature of binutils .
The new code is vastly easier to read and debug .
It should be noted that a fair number of minor bugs were found while going through this code , but new ones could have been created , due to the extreme fragility of a part of the kernel like this .
During testing , it has showed to be very stable .

Urban Invasion Wily Foxes Embrace Easy City Life
More and more foxes are seeking their fortunes in German towns , where food is ample and people sometimes mistake them for overgrown dachshunds .
But the furry predators come bearing an unwelcome guest -- parasites .

When asked about his three courses — personal finance , social stratification and literature — Ryan joked that there was “ no ballroom dancing at B.C. ”
Two years ago , when the former Southern California quarterback Matt Leinart acknowledged that he took only ballroom dancing during his final college semester , critics and comedians took their shots .
Although his choice of academic study did not spawn a dance craze , it did offer college players a lesson in how to two - step through their final semester of college football .
The former North Carolina president William C. Friday said that allowing players to lighten their courseloads later in their careers was another sign that college athletics was spiraling out of control .
He said universities were already under enough criticism for lowering their admission standards for athletes .
“ I think it ’s wrong , ” Friday said .
“ What we ’re witnessing in the country is that intercollegiate athletics is becoming an entertainment industry . ”
But to some within the athletic world , the lighter load in the final season is viewed as a reward .

The bane of young Bart Collins ' existence is the piano lessons he 's forced to take under the tutelage of Dr. Terwilliker , the only person he detests because of his dictatorial nature .
Bart feels that Dr. Terwilliker has undue influence on his widowed mother Heloise .
Bart constantly daydreams of a place -- the Terwilliker Institute -- at which the evil madman is its overlord .
The mad doctor 's built a piano so immense that it needs 500 children to play it .

I 'm currently reading through Peter Morville 's excellent book Ambient Findability .
It cites some papers that attempt to explain the search behavior of web users , starting with the berrypicking model :
In a 1989 article entitled " The Design of Browsing and Berrypicking Techniques for the Online Search Interface , " Marcia Bates exposed the inadequacy of the classic information retrieval model characterized by a single query .
Instead , she proposed a berrypicking model that recognizes the iterative and interactive nature of the information seeking process .
Bates understood that the query and the information need itself evolve as users interact with documents and search systems .
She also recognized that since relevant documents ( like berries ) tend to be scattered , users move fluidly between search and browse modes , relying on a rich variety of strategies including footnote chasing , area scanning , and citation , subject , and author searching .
In short , Bates described information seeking behavior on today 's Web , back in 1989 .
Google relies on the citations we call " inbound links . "
Blogs support " backward chaining " through trackbacks .
Flickr and del.icio.us allow us to pivot on subject or author .
The Web allows our information seeking to grow more iterative and interactive with each innovation .
The berrypicking model is more relevant today than ever .
Bates ' research was picked up by Peter Pirolli and Stuart Card and folded into their 1995 paper titled Information Foraging in Information Access Environments :
We use the term Information Foraging both to conjure up the metaphor of organisms browsing for sustenance and to indicate a connection to the more technical optimal foraging theory found in biology and anthropology .
Animals adapt their behavior and their structure through evolution to survive and reproduce to their circumstance .
Animals adapt , among other reasons , to increase their rate of energy intake .
To do this they evolve different methods : a wolf hunts ( " forages " ) for prey , but a spider builds a web and allows the prey to come to it .
Humans seeking information also adopt different strategies , sometimes with striking parallels to those of animal foragers .
The wolf - prey strategy bears some resemblance to classic information retrieval , and the spider - web strategy is like information filtering .
So if you 've ever wondered why users behave like animals online , now you know .
There 's real science behind it in information foraging .
Instead of hunting for food , users hunt for information , ruthlessly , and without compunction .
In practice , what this means is that users pursue " information scent " .
Users will click the back button nearly instantly when they do n't catch a whiff of the right information from the current page .
Jakob Nielsen explains :
Information foraging 's most famous concept is information scent : users estimate a given hunt 's likely success from the spoor : assessing whether their path exhibits cues related to the desired outcome .
Informavores will keep clicking as long as they sense ( to mix metaphors ) that they 're " getting warmer " -- the scent must keep getting stronger and stronger , or people give up .
Progress must seem rapid enough to be worth the predicted effort required to reach the destination .
If you think this is all a bunch of trumped - up academic terminology for the basic principle of human laziness , well .. you 're right .
Humans are under less evolutionary pressure to improve their Web use , but basic laziness is a human characteristic that might be survival - related ( do n't exert yourself unless you have to ) .
In any case , people like to get maximum benefit for minimum effort .
That 's what makes information foraging a useful tool for analyzing online media .
Whether you call it " information foraging " or the rather more honest " maximum benefit for minimum effort " , it 's a powerful model of the way people actually work online .
There are billions of web pages , and only a tiny fraction are worth the users ' time .
That 's why informavores are unforgiving .
They will ..
Demand to see what you have to offer in under four seconds .
Form a first impression of your site in just 50 milliseconds .
Give up on your site entirely within two minutes of arriving .
The last point is noted by Nielsen in his new book Prioritizing Web Usability :
In recent years , highly improved search engines have reversed [ the idea of " sticky " web sites ] by emphasizing quality in their sorting of search results .
It is now extremely easy for users to find other good sites .
Information foraging predicts that the easier it is to find good patches [ of information ] , the quicker users will leave a patch .
Thus , the better search engines get at highlighting quality sites , the less time users will spend on any one site .
This theoretical prediction was amply confirmed by the empirical data we collected for this book :
People left the sites they found useless within less than two minutes .
Frankly , I 'm surprised it 's a whole two minutes .
You better hope the information scent is strong on your page , because Informavores ' fingers are always hovering over the back button .
And they have very itchy trigger fingers .
Two scientists have created a mathematical model of the stock market , which shows that chaotic ups and downs happen because of the actions of the traders , not because of any real change in the underlying value of the stocks .
This means that share prices will never be predictable , said Thomas Lux , in the Economics department at Bonn University , Germany , speaking to the BBC .
" Our paper is not about prediction .
On the contrary , in our model you cannot predict future stock prices , because it depends not only on the changes in the fundamental worth of stocks but also on the unpredictable opinions of traders in the market , " he said .
Fundamentals of business
Jeremy Batstone , head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers , told BBC News Online that the research highlights an important truth about the stock market .
" There is a great danger in getting too carried away simply with share price movements .
We have been saying that traders need to concentrate less on share price and more on fundamentals of business .
" People can make money on short - term , knee - jerk reactions and there is an element in the City that if you are making money why change it .
But investors must try and think beyond that .
" The whole point about buying a share is that you should be interested in the underlying business - you should take as much interest as if you were buying a house or a car . "
Noise traders
The model Dr Lux created with Michele Marchesi at the University of Cagliari , Italy , has two types of traders .
" Fundamentalists " try and make money by spotting differences between the share price and what the share is genuinely worth based on real - world events .
" Noise traders " do not care what the genuine value is - they make their money simply by speculating the rise and fall of share prices .
Noise traders make their money more quickly .
But as more join the herd and follow the trend , the share price can be pushed far from its true worth , causing booms or crashes .
At that point , fundamentalists step in and bring the share price back towards it underlying , true value .
The model shows that the market gets volatile when the number of traders acting as noise traders gets to a critical proportion .
The research is published in the journal Nature .
This needed to be said .
This was a long time coming .
In fact , I feel like we should ’ve had this discussion and stopped the stupid practice back when I was knee - high to a grasshopper ( that was many moons ago , ya see ? ) .
But here we are in 2007 and women still expect a diamond ring from a guy as if diamonds were some sort of magical talisman that grants access to her vagina .
And guys know diamonds are like gigantic “ No Trespassing ! ” signs that keep other ( honest ) males away .
Are we really so base and banal ?
Slate ’s running an article about the insidious practice of giving / receiving diamond engagement rings .
O’Rourke goes after the engagement ring in particular because it ’s like giving a “ pre-gift ” gift and it ’s only for their girl ( the price for access ? ) , but I think the whole practice of buying absurdly expensive rings for the purposes of betrothal is antiquated , offensive and stupid .
Let ’s have a look into how this scam by the diamond industry got started :
In fact , the “ tradition ” of the diamond engagement ring is newer than you might think .
Betrothal rings , a custom inherited from the Romans , became an increasingly common part of the Christian tradition in the 13th century .
The first known diamond engagement ring was commissioned for Mary of Burgundy by the Archduke Maximilian of Austria in 1477 .
The Victorians exchanged “ regards ” rings set with birthstones .
But it was n’t until the late 19th century , after the discovery of mines in South Africa drove the price of diamonds down , that Americans regularly began to give ( or receive ) diamond engagement rings .
( Before that , some betrothed women got thimbles instead of rings . )
Even then , the real blingfest did n’t get going until the 1930s , when — dim the lights , strike up the violins , and cue entrance — the De Beers diamond company decided it was time to take action against the American public .
De Beers proceeded to brainwash the public into thinking they needed to buy diamonds , wedding bands , engagement rings , matching trinkets and assorted crap .
Fuck all that status - seeking consumerist bullshit .
Diamonds are not even that precious .
Their value has been greatly inflated by the diamond industry ’s tricks , which have revoked supply and demand through the power of advertising and a monopoly on distribution .
The whole diamond wedding ring “ custom ” is a tradition manufactured and sold to the American public through marketing , PR and Hollywood glamour .
Do n’t believe me ?
Try to sell a diamond .
De Beers proved to be the most successful cartel arrangement in the annals of modern commerce .
While other commodities , such as gold , silver , copper , rubber , and grains , fluctuated wildly in response to economic conditions , diamonds have continued , with few exceptions , to advance upward in price every year since the Depression .
Indeed , the cartel seemed so superbly in control of prices — and unassailable - that , in the late 1970s , even speculators began buying diamonds as a guard against the vagaries of inflation and recession .
The diamond invention is far more than a monopoly for fixing diamond prices ; it is a mechanism for converting tiny crystals of carbon into universally recognized tokens of wealth , power , and romance .
To achieve this goal , De Beers had to control demand as well as supply .
Both women and men had to be made to perceive diamonds not as marketable precious stones but as an inseparable part of courtship and married life .
To stabilize the market , De Beers had to endow these stones with a sentiment that would inhibit the public from ever reselling them .
The illusion had to be created that diamonds were forever — “ forever ” in the sense that they should never be resold .
When you give your loved one a diamond , you give them a symbol of greed , albeit one of ingenius avarice far outpacing your standard , run -of - the - mill greed .
It ’s a pretty fucking impressive pyramid of greed and faux - glamour , I ’ll admit .
But it is fake and empty nonetheless .
Blood Diamonds , they call ’em , and not for nothing .
And what are you saying about each other if you need a diamond to seal the deal ?
Does the man have to be a breadwinner of a certain caliber to merit your hand in marriage ?
Guys , does the girl not sparkle enough without a diamond on her finger ?
If that ’s the case , let her go .
Girls , refuse those rings .
Your affection should not be for sale , and all you ’re accomplishing is putting a guy in debt .
Then you marry him in a lavish ceremony and — bingo ! — you ’re both in debt .
Brilliant .
I know we ’re all concerned about De Beers ’ profits and whether its CEO can afford that third yacht , but try to think of yourself first .
Do you really really need a sparkly rock at the end of your finger ?
If so , might I suggest quartz ?
No one is surprised that CIOs are the highest paid IT professionals , with a projected average annual salary of between $ 126,750 and $ 210,000 in 2008 .
But , 30 other IT titles also are projected to have average annual salaries that will top $ 100,000 next year , according to the just - released Robert Half Technology 2008 Salary Guide .
Robert Half Technology , an IT staffing firm , projects that nine new occupations will for the first time have starting salaries averaging , on the high end of the range , in six figures :
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- John Norris ' family is drinking a lot less milk these days .
He said he considers the higher prices and has cut back on his kids ' milk consumption .
But between work and family obligations , he still drives almost as much as he used to .
" That 's the reason I cut down on milk consumption - so I can drive my car , " said Norris .
And Norris should know .
He 's the director of wealth management for Oakworth Capital Bank and a food price expert .
The Norrises are n't the only family getting pinched at the grocery store .
Prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose 4.7 percent since the beginning of the year through November , outpacing the 4.3 percent increase in the overall cost - of - living , according to the federal government 's Consumer Price Index .
Everyday foods like fruits and vegetables , beef , poultry and cereals are on the rise .
The price of milk is the biggest culprit , with a staggering increase of 23.2 percent through November .
And with basic foods like dairy and wheat driving up the cost of other groceries , almost everyone is feeling the squeeze .
Families with children , who typically go through a couple gallons of milk per week and spend hundreds of dollars on other groceries , are especially vulnerable .
" Kids need a lot more food than we do , " said John Mulhern , a grandfather and one of several shoppers who spoke to CNNMoney.com outside a Key Food grocery in Brooklyn .
" So your hearts go out to young families , especially [ those who ] have multiple children .
They 're the ones who are hurting the most with the rising prices . "
Marie Thompson , a mother from Brooklyn with a couple of kids in tow at the grocery store , said she spends hundreds of dollars a week on groceries , including two gallons of milk .
Wheat prices soar above $ 10 a bushel
" It seems to me that I spend more and more every week on food , " said Thompson .
" It 's hard , because I have three children at home so there are five of us to feed .
Beef is very expensive .
The milk is very expensive .
Even the butter has gone up . "
Even with gasoline prices soaring , milk still tops gas prices .
The nationwide average for a gallon of whole milk is $ 3.80 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .
That dwarfs the nationwide average of $ 2.99 for a gallon of unleaded , according to AAA .
" A lot of basic foodstuffs seem to be going up and dairy products are going through the roof , " said Norris of Oakworth Capital .
It 's not just milk - drinking kids - coffee drinkers are taking a hit from higher dairy prices as well .
Back in August , Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX , Fortune 500 ) chief executive Jim Donald blamed " rising expenses , particularly higher dairy costs " for a 9 - cent rise in the price of coffee drinks .
For the first time in three years , Starbucks reported a 1 percent drop in customer visits to their stores , even as the value per transaction increased 5 percent .
Many retailers , including industry leaders like Wal - Mart ( WMT , Fortune 500 ) , absorb the initial cost increases for basic food items to stay competitive , said Charles Cerankosky , food marketing analyst for FTN Midwest Securities Corp .
" For things that are purchased day after day like milk , retailers take a more judicious view about passing it on , " said Cerankosky .
" You do n't want to be looked at as the guy who started raising prices . "
At first , retailers keep down prices for " high visibility " items like milk and make up for it by increasing the price of other items , like apples , said Cerankosky .
But this is just a temporary measure , and eventually the price of milk will go up anyway , he said .
Of the Brooklyn shoppers interviewed for this story , none of them said that they were eating less , but a couple of them said there will be fewer Christmas presents under the tree this year .
Santa 's tightening his belt , so the kids do n't have to .
But if price increases continue into 2008 , families will have an even harder time stocking their pantries .
" I do expect food prices to keep going up , " said Norris of Oakworth Capital Bank .
" Let 's just keep our fingers crossed that we 're not going to have another year like this year . "
Just the mere thought of money can turn a person selfish , so that he helps others less often and prefers to play alone , according to a study .
The concept of money , they suggest , makes a person feel more self - sufficient and thus more apt to stand alone .
You might be more self - sufficient , but that doesn?t mean you ?ll be happy .
A survey of women found that those with higher incomes devoted more time to working , commuting , childcare and shopping , leading to more stress and tension than women pulling in less cash .
Optimism , it turns out , is best in moderation .
People who have a rosy outlook are more likely than others to make prudent financial decisions , but those who are extreme optimists make riskier investments and save less money than others , a new study finds .
Manju Puri and David Robinson , professors of finance at Duke University in Durham , N.C. , compared statistical and self - reported life expectancies to determine people 's levels of optimism .
Overall , they relied on data on families in the United States , collected in 1995 , 1998 and 2001 as part of the Federal Reserve Board ’s Survey of Consumer Finances ( SCF ) , which included self - reported life expectancies , health factors and demographics .
The SCF typically surveys about 4,500 Americans every three years .
The researchers compared the self - reported life expectancies with statistical ones , grouping participants who expected to live longer than the data predicted as " optimists . "
Participants who expected to live an average of 20 years longer than is statistically likely were labeled " extreme optimists . "
In moderation , optimism can lead to sensible decision making , but extreme optimists “ display financial habits and behavior that are generally not considered prudent , ” the authors write in the October issue of the Journal of Financial Economics .
The results held across demographic , risk - taking dispositions and health - related issues .
They find that compared with others , optimists :
Work longer hours
Invest in individual stocks
Save more money
Are more likely to pay their credit card balances on time
Believe their income will grow over the next five years
Plan to retire later , or not at all
Are more likely to remarry if divorced
In comparison , extreme optimists :
Work significantly fewer hours
Hold a higher proportion of individual stocks in their portfolios
Are more likely to be day traders
Save less money
Are less likely to pay off their credit card balances on a regular basis
Are more likely to smoke
“ The differences between optimists and extreme optimists are remarkable and suggest that over - optimism , like overconfidence , may in fact lead to behaviors that are unwise , ” Puri said .
The researchers liken optimism to red wine .
“ Doctors tell us that one or two glasses of red wine a day can be really healthy , ” Robinson said , “ but no one tells you to drink the whole bottle .
It ’s the same with optimism .
A little bit is really beneficial , but too much can lead to some really bad economic choices . ”
Further research is needed to tease out reasons why moderate and extreme optimists behave differently , the authors say .
Nov.1 , 2007 -- Scientists at Case Western Reserve University have genetically engineered mice that outrun , outlive , and out - eat ordinary mice while staying lean , light , and fertile well into old age .
Chalk it up to a change in a single gene .
That genetic tweak boosted levels of an enzyme called PEPCK -C in the mice 's skeletal muscles , knocking mice 's muscle metabolism into orbit .
" They are metabolically similar to Lance Armstrong biking up the Pyrenees , " researcher Richard Hanson , PhD , says in a news release .
The mighty mice were seven times more active than normal mice .
They showed unusually high levels of activity in their cages from the time they were 2 weeks old .
Running on special treadmills designed for mice , the genetically engineered mice left ordinary mice in the dust .
One treadmill test began at a leisurely pace .
The researchers raised the treadmill 's incline and speed every two minutes until the mice were exhausted and could n't run for 10 seconds .
The genetically engineered mice ran for 32 minutes , while the ordinary mice pooped out at 19 minutes .
The genetically engineered mice ate 60 % more than the ordinary mice , but they were lean and light , weighing half of what normal mice weigh with 90 % less body fat .
The researchers also report that the genetically engineered mice lived longer than other mice and maintained their superior running ability .
For instance , mice that were up to 2.5 years old outran mice that were less than half their age , the study shows .
In addition , a 30 - month - old genetically engineered female mouse had baby mice during the study , well past the typical mouse - bearing ages .
A major unanswered question , Hanson 's team notes , is what brain changes accompany the genetically engineered mice 's hyped - up activity .
Their findings appear in tomorrow 's early online edition of The Journal of Biological Chemistry .
I am getting more convinced every day that communication is , in fact , what makes or breaks software projects .
Programming tools , practices and methods are definitely important , but if the communication fails then the rest is just painting the corpse .
From that point of view , getting the language right is one of the key steps for any software project , because the language provides the foundations for all communication .
The right language does not , of course , guarantee that the correct thing will be built on time and within budget — but the wrong language is practically a guarantee that the project will fail .
The importance of a common language is nothing new or specific to software projects .
The western civilisation has been learning that complex projects have no chance of success without a common language at least for the last two thousand years , but it seems that we have still not taken that message seriously .
In the software world , the language of projects has been getting much more attention recently , especially due to Eric Evans and his book Domain - Driven Design : Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software .
Evans coined the phrase Ubiquitous language to describe the best practice to fight different jargons on project teams .
Using an ubiquitous language requires business analysts , customers and programmers to all have the same names for the same things .
But getting everyone to use common phrases is just one part of the puzzle .
I have stumbled upon a few very interesting conclusions about the language and how important it is to choose good metaphors and names in Douglas Hofstadter ’s book Gödel , Escher , Bach .
That title has intrigued me for a few years , but as a quick look on Amazon told me that is has almost 800 pages , it had to wait for me to change my daily routine before I could even start reading it .
The last few months have been much more quiet than usual , so I finally had some time to dive in .
Although the book deals with something completely unrelated to software projects , it contains some very interesting ideas that we can apply to improve software development .
I especially like the thoughts on how humans understand formal systems and how the meanings of abstractions form in our minds .
Before this starts to sound too philosophical , let me change the direction of this story .
I was recently involved in a project where the common language was chosen and agreed upon , but caused a lot more confusion then I expected .
Even with the definitions written down and published on a wiki site , a lot of time was wasted on misunderstandings of basic concepts and going back to explain the same things over and over again .
The phrases of that common language were OK from the aspect that they made sense , but they were a compromise between business jargon and technical design and somehow fell short of pleasing anyone .
It was a strange situation because all the people involved were techies , and I expected that people with technical education should generally be OK with abstracting things a bit , understanding and using formal definitions even if they do not necessarily bear the same meaning as in common everyday language .
But that has not worked out as expected .
I had a feeling of what went wrong , but I did not have strong arguments to support that opinion .
Hofstadter , however , provides a very nice explanation for that on pages 90 and 91 :
… Therefore , when someone gives a definition for a common word in the hopes that we will abide by that definition , it is a foregone conclusion that we will not do so , but will instead be guided , largely unconsciously , by what our minds find in their associative stories …
In short , redefining a common phrase is not going to work .
Whether we like it or not , our understanding of a common concept gets in the way of applying it in a different context .
“ Gödel , Escher , Bach ” offers some very interesting examples how attempting to impose definitions of common phrases and words was a very hard thing to do throughout history , starting with that Euclid ’s Elements and his attempt to specify what “ point ” , “ straight line ” and “ circle ” mean .
On page 94 , Hofstadter explains another interesting idea :
… The symbols automatically pick up passive meanings in accordance with the theorems they occur in …
So regardless of the actual name used for something , our mind gives it a passive meaning depending on the way in which it is used and cooperates with other concepts .
If a name given to some concept does not match the way it is being used , we will effectively attach a different name and a meaning to it .
The way things are used dictates how we perceive them , regardless of the names that were enforced for those things .
Armed with this new insight , here are some ideas that I will definitely try on my next project :
MONTPELIER , Vermont ( AP ) — President Bush may soon have a new reason to avoid left - leaning Vermont :
In one town , activists want him subject to arrest for war crimes .
Kurt Daims of Brattleboro , Vermont , speaks Friday about his movement against Bush and Cheney .
A group in Brattleboro is petitioning to put an item on a town meeting agenda in March that would make Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney subject to arrest and indictment if they visit the southeastern Vermont community .
“ This petition is as radical as the Declaration of Independence , and it draws on that tradition in claiming a universal jurisdiction when governments fail to do what they ’re supposed to do , ” said Kurt Daims , 54 , a retired machinist leading the drive .

今週のSecurity Check ( 第198回 )
職場，自宅を問わず根付きつつある無線LAN。ただ，そのセキュリティに関しては，ユーザーの意識は意外に高くない。今回では，最も広くユーザーに利用されている無線LANの暗号化技術がどの程度弱いものかを確認しつつ，より安全な無線LANの使い方を改めて解説しよう。
IEEE 802.11a/b/gの無線LANには3種類のセキュリティ規格がある。WEP（wired equivalent privacy ），WPA （Wi-Fi protected access ），WPA2である。データを暗号化することで盗聴から保護し，有線メディアと同等のセキュリティを確保することが目的である。
ただ，2007年末に都内某所で調べたところ，受信できる無線LANの電波のうち，暗号化されていないものが16%，WEPでの暗号化が69%存在し，いまだにWEPが広く使われていることを再認識することになった。WPA/WPA2という最新の仕組みを利用しているケースはわずか15％。WEPのぜい弱性を考えると，多くのユーザーがいつ第三者に不正利用されてもおかしくない状況にある。
WEPはFMS攻撃，PTW攻撃の危険にさらされている
WEP については，これまでにいくつものぜい弱性を指摘されている。例えば暗号化アルゴリズムの扱い方に欠陥があり，WEPキー（パスフレーズ）を容易に解析される可能性がある。
有名なのは，「 Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4 」 という論文で ，S. Fluhrer氏 ，I. Mantin氏 ，A. Shamir氏によって2001年に発表された。これを受けて，Adam Stubblefield 氏，John Ioannidis氏 ，Aviel D. Rubin氏らによっ て 「 Using the Fluhrer , Mantin , and Shamir Attack to Break WEP 」 という論文も発表された。このコンセプトは最初の論文を発表した3氏の頭文字をとってFMS攻撃と呼ばれ，AirSnortなどに実装されている。
さらに2004年にはNetStumblerのユーザー・サイト（netstumbler.org）で，KoreKというハンドルネームのユーザーがchopchopという攻撃ツールを投稿した。このコンセプトもすぐにAirSnortやaircrackなどのツールに取り込まれた。
2007 年に入ると，ドイツの大 学Technical University Darmstadt のErik Tews 氏 ，Ralf - Philipp Weinmann氏 ，Andrei Pyshkin氏らによって 「 Breaking 104 bit WEP in less than 60 seconds 」 というインパクトのあるタイトルの論文が発表された（PTW攻撃）。これはAndreas Klein氏が先に発表したRC4への攻撃をWEPに特化させたもので，WEPキーを1分以内に解析可能とするものである。研究チームにより，aircrack-ngを基にしたaircrack-ptwというツールも公開された。この攻撃手法はその後本家のaircrack-ngにも取り込まれた。2007年12月現在の最新のβ版（1.0-beta1）のデフォルトの攻撃方法はこのPTW攻撃である。
こうした攻撃の可能性を考えると，WEPはもはやセキュリティ対策として通用しないと言っても言い過ぎではないだろう。企業での使用はもちろん，家庭用途での使用も薦められない。後述するWPAやWPA2といったセキュリティ規格に対応している機器であれば，すぐにでもそちらの規格を使うべきである。
実際に1分程度で128bit（104bit）のWEPキーを解析している様子を以下に示す。
図1 WEPキー解析の様子
[ 画像のクリックで拡大表 示 ]
図の上部を見ると1分程度で解析が完了したことが確認できる。実際には図の下部にある「ASCII」部分にパスフレーズが，「KEY FOUND 」部分にその16進表記が表示される。なお，解析には一般的なノート・パソコンとして，Thinkpad X32 （Intel Pentium M 1.80 GHz，メモリー512Mバイト）を使用した。このように，WEPキーは容易に解析できる状況にある。
なお，アクセス・ポイント製品にはMACアドレスでのアクセス制限やSSIDを秘匿する機能も実装されているが，どちらの情報も無線上を流れるパケットに暗号化されずに格納されるため，攻撃者はパケット･キャプチャなどによって容易に情報を入手できる。MACアドレスに関してはソフトウエアやファームウエアで書き換えることができ，本質的な対策にはならない。
South Florida has a motorcycle problem , and lawmakers are introducing legislation to show bikers that they 'll go a long way to punish those who break the rules .
Stunt riding ( including wheelies ) , excessive speeding , and concealable license plates will get you a 10 year ban on your motorcycle license , mandatory jail time , and an impounded bike .
If the punishment sounds like the medieval practice of cutting off the hand of a man for stealing , that 's exactly how State Representative Carlos Lopez - Cantera wants it .
Lopez - Cantera witnessed firsthand a variety of incidents during which reckless behavior was on display , including bikers flying down the highway at 120 mph , high speed wheelies , and more .
Police officers can't even run plates since bikers will often flip them up to avoid detection , and it's very difficult to catch a motorcycle on the open road with a squad car .
We like motorcycles , even though our focus is on cars , and it 's disappointing to see that things have apparently gotten so out of hand in South Florida that draconian enforcement policies are being seriously discussed .

Shopping for a car will never be the same as scientists have developed a new form of auto paint that changes color with the touch of a button .
This revolutionary new paramagnetic paint is a technical wonder and is viewed by Nissan and other auto companies as an amazing innovation that would draw huge traffic to dealerships and will make it easier for consumers to get the exact option level they want on a car without the sacrifice of their favorite color .
Research with this new science of special light reflecting coatings has been going on for years and there have been several different approaches used to achieve the effect but recent breakthroughs have taken it out of the laboratory and into a real commercial product for large scale applications .
The process starts out with a standard galvanized piece of automotive sheet metal steel .
A special polymer is applied to the steel with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles embedded within it .
The nanoscale crystalline particles of magnetite ( iron oxide ) are controlled using a low grade magnetic field which is used to effect the spacing of the colloidal crystals and thereby controlling their ability to reflect light and change color .
I 've had a lot of fun recently with my tiny ( and unofficial ) slice of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
But , though I was one of thousands of IPCC participants , I do n't think I will add " 0.0001 Nobel Laureate " to my resume .
The other half of the prize was awarded to former Vice President Al Gore , whose carbon footprint would stomp my neighborhood flat .
But that 's another story .

( Fortune ) --
Whether the economy improves or weakens over the next year is anyone 's guess , but I 'd like to make a bold prediction for 2008 : by June , white - collar productivity will fall through the floor like a Looney Tunes anvil dropped from a skyscraper .
How can I be so sure ?
I hesitate here only because I worry about the ethics of doing what I am about to do .
In sharing what I know , I could be blamed for the looming meltdown .
Would Einstein have published his theory of relativity had he known it would lead to the bomb ?
Like him , I can't hold back the inevitable .
Three words then : World Golf Tour .
Where I live , in San Francisco 's Bay Area , someone is always gassing on about the Next New Thing or the Killer App .
Increasingly , the Killer Thing they 're buzzing about has to do with gaming .
I 'm not talking about the Wii stuff your kids play in the living room .
I mean games you play online on your computer .
It 's a fast - growing segment of the industry that market research firm Strategy Analytics estimates will generate $ 5 billion in revenue this year - and more than twice that by 2011 .
Internet gaming , after all , is what drove Activision into Vivendi's arms last month , creating one of the largest digital game publishers in the world .
So when a friend sidled up to me and whispered " World Golf Tour " in my ear , I chalked it up to the usual hype .
I mean , digital golf games are as old as Moses and about as much fun .
But then I checked it out one afternoon .
Days later I stumbled away from my computer to eat and , if there was time , bathe .
I 'm not going to give you the web address .
Anyone who wants it can Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) those three magic words and enter at his own risk .
The game is still only a demo ; in its current state , you play nine holes of a closest - to - the - pin competition .
But when the full site goes live , sometime in the next six months , you 'll have access to all 18 holes of the famous Ocean Course at the Kiawah Island Golf Resort .
A half - dozen real courses will be online by year - end .
That 's when business life as we know it grinds to a halt .
World Golf
Tour combines three elements that could prove irresistible to corporate slackers : ( 1 ) It puts you on world - class golf courses in stunning , high - definition color ; ( 2 ) it streams the game through any garden - variety browser without extra downloads ( which means you can play in your cubicle without running afoul of the corporate firewall ) ; and ( 3 ) you 'll be able to play with your pals - to meet up for a virtual foursome or play in a league - from your desktop .
While that last point is n't new to web - savvy teenagers , it 's a pretty radical step for games aimed at older guys .
World of Warcraft , for instance , Vivendi's bestselling multiplayer game , has attracted more than nine - million mostly male combatants who meet online to engage in quests and smite each other with battle - axes .
It 's also a cash machine that generates nearly $ 1 billion a year .
It was World of Warcraft that inspired YuChiang Cheng , co-founder and CEO of World Golf Tour .
He was working for a company that handles back - office systems for casinos and gaming sites last January when he had his big idea .
" I was watching things like World of Warcraft take off and spending way too much time with my fantasy football team , " he recalls .
He started thinking about what " mature men want to play online . "
World Golf
Tour , he says , aspires to be " World of Warcraft for older sports guys . "
Cheng partnered with co-worker Chad Nelson , who had a hand in creating scores of games for the PC ( and who claims to be a scratch virtual golfer ) , and J.F. Prata , the former COO of game companies Westwood Studios and Maxis .
Together they devised a novel way to map the rules of Newtonian physics that drive animation - based video - games onto high - definition photos .
In other golf games that use video , a relatively small number of canned shots are recycled to simulate play .
With World Golf 's technology , however , the video feedback is virtually infinite .
You feel as if you are really there .
Backed by first - round funding from venture firm Battery Partners , the World Golf team has been taking high - resolution pictures of every square inch of far - flung golf courses - from Pinehurst in North Carolina to the Bali Hai Golf Club in Las Vegas - using a small fleet of helicopters and radio - controlled drones .
It takes a dozen people six months and $ 200,000 to make one World Golf course simulation , says Cheng .
But that 's a bargain compared with the millions it can cost to design , animate , and distribute a conventional video or PC game .
Cheng says the site will make money through advertising , sponsorship deals , and various premium offerings .
To date , 100,000 Internet duffers have found the demo site through word of mouth .
One top-rated player is reported to be playing 30 hours a week .
" He 's an adult , and he has a job , " says Cheng .
" His whole office is now playing . "
You 've been warned .

Microsoft and the POSIX Standard .
POSIX defines a set of functions for retrieving information , such as file size , creation date , last modification date , ownership etc about files on disk .
Two commonly used functions in this set are defined as follows :
int stat ( const char * path , struct stat * buf ) ; int fstat ( int filedes , struct stat * buf ) ;
The first operates on the filename , and the second operates on a pre-existing file descriptor .
Both functions interrogate the file system and fill in a bunch of fields of a struct supplied by the caller .
Microsoft also provides these functions in its C run time library and even documents them here and here .
However , stat , the function that is probably more commonly used than fstat , does not always work as expected .
In particular , the following scenario :
Create a new file using the open function .
function .
Write N bytes to the file descriptor returned by open .
.
Call stat on the file using the file name used during file creation .
on the file using the file name used during file creation .
Call fstat on the file descriptor returned by open .
On any sane system , the file length field of the struct filled in by stat and fstat calls in the above scenario should be the same .
On windows however , they are not , fstat returns the correct value N , while stat returns zero .

It was 60 degrees on Thursday in Washington , well above normal , and as I slipped away for some pre-Christmas golf , I found myself thinking about a wickedly funny story that The Onion , the satirical newspaper , ran the other day : “ Fall Canceled after 3 Billion Seasons ” :
“ Fall , the long - running series of shorter days and cooler nights , was canceled earlier this week after nearly 3 billion seasons on Earth , sources reported Tuesday .
“ The classic period of the year , which once occupied a coveted slot between summer and winter , will be replaced by new , stifling humidity levels , near - constant sunshine and almost no precipitation for months .
“ ‘As much as we ’d like to see it stay , fall will not be returning for another season , ’ National Weather Service president John Hayes announced during a muggy press conference Nov. 6 .
‘ Fall had a great run , but sadly , times have changed .’ ...
The cancellation was not without its share of warning signs .
In recent years , fall had been reduced from three months to a meager two - week stint , and its scheduled start time had been pushed back later and later each year . ”
You should never extrapolate about global warming from your own weather , but it is becoming hard not to — even for professionals .
Consider the final report of the U.N. ’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I.P.C.C. ) , which was just issued and got far too little attention .
It concluded that since the I.P.C.C. began its study five years ago , scientists had discovered much stronger climate change trends than previously realized , such as far more extensive melting of Arctic ice , and therefore global efforts to reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions have to begin immediately .
The US army has thrown out the conviction of the only officer court martialled in the Abu Ghraib scandal , ending the four - year investigation and drawing complaints from human rights activists of a Pentagon whitewash .
Barring any new information , the decision means no officers or civilian leaders will be held criminally responsible for the prisoner abuse - which included the photographing of Iraqi prisoners in painful and sexually humiliating positions - which embarrassed the military and inflamed the Muslim world .
Lieutenant Colonel Steven Jordan was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by Major General Richard Rowe , the Washington military district chief .
He was instead given an administrative reprimand .
Jordan , 51 , was acquitted at his court martial in August of charges that he failed to supervise the 11 lower - ranking soldiers convicted for their roles in the abuse .
But he was found guilty of disobeying an order not to talk about the investigation , and the jury recommended a criminal reprimand , the lightest possible punishment .
Jordan told the Associated Press yesterday that he felt victimised by press coverage that seemed eager for an officer to be blamed for the abuse .
He also said he agreed that there were both enlisted soldiers and officers responsible for the abuse who escaped prosecution .
" Everybody that 's seen all the evidence and looked at it , or the lack of it , realises that Steve Jordan had nothing to do with abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib , " Lt Col Jordan said .
Major Kris Poppe , the defence lawyer , argued Lt Col Jordan " faced these very serious charges for a long period of time , that he had been found not guilty of any offence related to the abuse of detainees , and that he had a stellar record . "
Rowe agreed .
" In light of the nature of the offence that Jordan had been found guilty of committing and the substantial evidence in mitigation at trial and in post - trial matters submitted by defence counsel , Rowe determined that an administrative reprimand was a fair and appropriate disposition of the matter , " Joanna Hawkins , a military spokeswoman , said in a statement .
But human rights advocates said the case did not go higher up the chain of command and said the decision sent a troubling message .
" It could not be more clear that prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan resulted from policies and practices authorized by high - level officials , including military and civilian leaders , " said Hira Shamsi , of the National Security Project of the American Civil Liberties Union .
" Although the abuse was systemic and widespread , the accountability for it has been anything but . "
Mila Rosenthal , a director for research and policy for Amnesty International USA , said : " I think we 're emboldening dictators and despots around the world .
We 're saying that it 's OK to allow these kinds of abuses to flourish . "
American Gulag : Petty criminals doing hard time
The United States has achieved the dubious honor of boasting the largest prison and jail population on Earth .
It reached this zenith by surpassing cash - strapped Russia -- long its only rival as a society of mass imprisonment -- after Russia released thousands of inmates so as to save money .
A few years earlier , as America rushed to lock up ever more of its population for ever - pettier offenses , the absolute size of its incarcerated population surpassed that of China -- despite China 's population being more than four times that of America .
According to research by the British Home Office , America now incarcerates over one fifth of the world 's prisoners .
There is something bitterly ironic in this .
America really is a land of liberty , a place where lives , often scarred by injustice elsewhere , can be remade .
How tragic that over the past 20 years , the country 's political leaders have so often decided to deal with many of the most noxious side - effects of poverty -- from chronic drug use and the establishment of street drug markets , to hustling , gang membership and spraying graffiti on public buildings -- through a vast over - reliance on incarceration .
How doubly tragic that this has occurred in tandem with a political assault on the Great Society anti-poverty programs put in place during the 1960s ; that the investments in infrastructure , public education , public health care and job training which might curtail crime more effectively are , instead , being replaced by massive public expenditures on building new prisons .
The numbers buttressing this sprawling prison system are extraordinary .
Approximately two million Americans are now serving either prison or jail time ,
over one million of them for non-violent offenses ( a preponderance of these either for drug use or low - level drug sales ) .
Per hundred thousand residents , the United States has an incarceration rate over five times that of England , six times that of Canada and seven times that of Germany .
Somewhere around 10 percent of African American men in their 20s live behind bars .
In some states , where a single felony conviction is enough to bar the offender from ever being able to vote again , over one quarter of African American males are disenfranchised .
Since 1980 , a virtual " prison industrial complex " has arisen , with phenomenal rates of new - prison construction abetted by lucrative construction and prison - guard union lobbies .
Several states , including California , spend more on prisons than they do on higher education .
Despite dramatically falling crime rates over the last 10 years ( which most criminologists attribute more to demography -- there have simply been fewer young men of late ) , prison populations have continued to soar .
As the number of truly heinous crimes has fallen , increasingly it is small - time hoodlums , drug users , and mentally ill people who have been drawing long spells behind bars .
America today has five times as many prisoners as it did in 1980 .
One of the most dismaying developments is the spread of so - called " three strikes " laws .
California 's version , passed by citizen referendum in 1993 and ratcheted into place by state legislators in 1994 , provides for life imprisonment of a criminal with two previous serious convictions who is found guilty of a third felony .
By the end of last year , there were about 7,000 people serving life sentences in California under this law .
Many thousands of them are serving life for small - time " third strikes " : minor drug crimes , car theft , petty fraud and burglary .
One such man is 58 - year - old heroin addict Billy Ochoa , who is serving 326 years in a supermax ( super maximum security ) prison for $ 2,100 of welfare fraud .
Because he had been convicted of several burglaries over the previous decades , when Ochoa was caught making fraudulent applications for food stamps and emergency housing vouchers in Los Angeles , he was tried under the three strikes law and given sentences on 13 separate counts to be served in one of the toughest , most secure prisons in America .
Ochoa 's sentence , apart from its extravagant cruelty , may ultimately cost taxpayers as much as a million dollars .
In many high security American prisons , inmates are routinely kept in virtual isolation , fed in their cells , allowed out for only half an hour of exercise a day , sometimes denied a TV , a radio , or even decorations for their concrete walls conditions which have been documented to drive many of them into states of serious psychosis .
How can things have come to this America ?
The violence led to extreme hardship for many children in Iraq
Hundreds were killed in violence during 2007 , while 1,350 were detained by the authorities , it said in a new report .
Some 25,000 children and their families had to leave their homes each month to seek shelter in other parts of Iraq .
But Unicef said the fall in violence in recent months was opening a window for more international assistance .
Earlier , the top US military commander in Iraq , Gen David Petraeus , told the BBC that the number of violent attacks in Iraq had fallen to its lowest in two - and - a - half years .
According to recent figures , some 536 Iraqis have died in violence so far this month , compared with more than 2,300 in December 2006 .
' High price '
In a report entitled " Little Respite for Iraq 's Children in 2007 " , Unicef said Iraqi children continued to pay too high a price for their country 's turmoil , and that this year things had got worse .
Iraqi children were frequently caught in the crossfire of conflict throughout 2007
Unicef
The report said an average 25,000 children per month were being displaced from their homes as their families fled violence or intimidation .
By the end of the year , 75,000 children had resorted to living in camps or temporary shelters .
The disruption led to extreme hardship for many children and eroded access to education and healthcare , Unicef said .
Many of the 220,000 displaced children of primary school age had their education affected in a country where around 760,000 children ( 17 % ) were already absent from primary school .
Only 28 % of 17 - year - olds sat their final exams .
Unicef said children in remote and hard - to - reach areas were frequently cut off from healthcare and that only 20 % outside the capital , Baghdad , had working sewerage in their community .
Access to safe water was also a serious issue .
Only 28 % of 17 - year - olds sat their final exams in the summer
But the agency said there had been some progress during 2007 - more than 4 m children were vaccinated against polio and 3 m against measles , and more than 500,000 internal refugees were given medical help , safe water and shelter by relief agencies and local communities .
It also said the current fall in violence provided an opportunity to deliver more aid and to get a clearer view of exactly what the conflict had done to Iraq 's children .
" Iraqi children are paying far too high a price , " said Roger Wright , Unicef 's special representative for Iraq .
" While we have been providing as much assistance as possible , a new window of opportunity is opening , which should enable us to reach the most vulnerable with expanded , consistent support .
We must act now . "
Mr Wright stressed that Iraqi children should be the priority for international investment in Iraq as they would be the " foundation for their country 's recovery " .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , close to one - third of the population in the United States is obese and another third is overweight .
Excessive weight gain is elicited by alterations in energy balance , the finely modulated equilibrium between caloric intake and expenditure .
But what are the factors that determine how much food is consumed ?
Part of the mystery is unfolding in the laboratory of Maribel Rios , PhD , at the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston .
Through their work , Rios and colleagues have demonstrated for the first time that a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) is critical in mediating satiety in adult mice .
Mice in which the BDNF gene was deleted in two of the primary appetite - regulating regions of the brain ate more and became significantly heavier than their counterparts .
" Prior to this study , we knew that the global lack of BDNF and / or its receptor during development leads to overeating and obesity in young mice .
However , it remained unclear and controversial whether BDNF mediated satiety in adult animals .
Our recent findings demonstrate that BDNF synthesis in the ventromedial ( VMH ) and dorsomedial hypothalamus ( DMH ) is required for normal energy balance .
Additionally , because the mice examined in this study were genetically altered in adulthood , we were able to establish that BDNF acts as a satiety signal in the mature brain independently from its putative actions during development of the brain .
This important distinction might help define disease mechanisms and critical periods of intervention for the treatment and prevention of obesity disorders , " says Rios , corresponding author and an assistant professor of neuroscience at the Sackler School .
The obesity exhibited by BDNF - depleted mice appears to arise solely from overconsumption of calories .
" Normal body weight was restored in mutant mice when food access was limited to that of normal mice , indicating that deletion of the Bdnf gene in the VMH and DMH does not affect the expenditure side of the energy balance equation , " adds Rios .
In a series of related experiments , the researchers used advanced molecular and surgical techniques to measure levels of BDNF mRNA , a precursor of active BDNF protein , in relation to nutritional status .
Thaddeus Unger , a graduate student at the Sackler School and the study 's first author , describes the results of these analyses .
" The amount of BDNF mRNA produced decreased during periods of fasting .
However , when the mice were exposed to glucose , a macronutrient , " Unger notes , " we observed a rapid , but transient , increase in the expression of BDNF and its receptor .
These changes occurred specifically in the VMH , which is known to be involved in the regulation of food intake . "
The researchers confirmed that glucose acts directly in the brain , rather than through peripheral pathways , to increase BDNF expression .
" Direct administration of BDNF into the brain , " states Rios , " also led to an immediate increase in the levels of an early - response gene and marker of nerve - cell activation in both the VMH and the DMH .
These results suggest that BDNF is a fast - acting signal inducing neuronal activity within neural circuits involved in appetite control . "
" Mice with site - specific perturbation of BDNF expression did not exhibit behavioral abnormalities typically observed in mice with global deletion of the Bdnf gene throughout the brain , such as hyperaggression , depressive - like behavior , and hyperactivity , " notes Rios .
" The absence of these behaviors suggests that BDNF expression in the VMH and DMH is not required for regulation of non-appetite - related behaviors . "
" Our results establish that BDNF plays a prominent and direct role in the regulation of energy balance in adult mice . " states Rios .
" It appears that this signaling pathway acts , at least partly , through short - term mechanisms and that BDNF synthesis in the VMH and DMH is required for suppression of appetite . "
While she notes that additional studies are needed to further pinpoint the cellular and molecular targets of BDNF action , Rios says , " This work brings us closer to elucidating the brain pathways that rely on BDNF to modulate food intake . "
She adds that " the relevance of the BDNF signaling pathway in human disease is highlighted by the obesity exhibited by certain humans carrying mutations or abnormalities in the genes coding for BDNF or its receptor .
This is bound to be an important area of obesity research as more than a quarter on the American population has been estimated to carry mutations in the Bdnf gene . "
This research was supported by grants from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health .

( Fortune Magazine ) --
Here I go .
I am about to walk into one of the biggest sucker 's games in the whole world of economics : declaring that the U.S. consumer is tapped out , so desperately in hock and troubled about the future that he finally just can't spend like it 's 1999 anymore .
And to be clear , that is what I 'm declaring .
Unless I can talk myself out of it by the end of the column .
I must be nuts .
One of the most reliable ways to look like a business dope over the past several years has been to announce that the consumer spending party is finally over .
Every year , usually in the fourth quarter , assorted boffins prove beyond doubt that U.S. consumers cannot possibly keep spending as they have been .
Consumers then ignore those reports and keep right on spending anyway .
The question of consumer behavior is enormously important because more than 70 % of U.S. economic activity is consumer spending .
Most companies thus depend on our buying , which means that most of the valuation of the U.S. stock market depends on it also .
And because we buy so many imports - almost $ 2 trillion worth last year - plenty of foreign economies depend on us as well .
So it 's easy to see why everybody wonders what U.S. consumers will do next .
It 's also easy to see why all kinds of analysts figured we simply had to stop spending big a long time ago .
A year or two back you could observe that interest rates were rising as the Fed kept ratcheting up , cash - out mortgage refinancings were declining , the housing boom was looking like a bubble , real total pay was flat , credit card debt was ballooning , and the personal savings rate had gone negative for the first time since the Depression .
Sounds alarming , does n't it ?
No way could you expect people to maintain a high level of spending under those conditions .
So why did they ?
A few factors seem significant .
Perhaps most important , people still had jobs .
Even if total pay was n't rising much , employment was growing decently , and the unemployment rate stayed low .
As long as consumers had paychecks coming in , they remained eager to do their duty at the mall .
In addition , it was still possible to believe in the housing boom , that your home - unless it was a condo in Miami or San Diego - was making you richer by the day .
When consumers feel wealthier , they feel like spending .
It did n't hurt that lenders on every street corner were throwing bargain - rate loans at anyone with a checking account ; even if you did n't borrow , it was comforting to know that you could .
What 's new - what gives me the confidence to make my insane prediction - is that all those factors have gone into reverse .
The employment picture is deteriorating .
Jobless claims rose more than expected in September 's final week , and the unemployment rate for the month rose slightly .
The only reason it did n't rise in August as well , says New York University professor Nouriel Roubini , is that " 500,000 discouraged workers left the labor force and did not show up as unemployed . "
That explains in part why Roubini , a former economic advisor in the Clinton administration , is now deeply bearish .
Perhaps more ominous than the job situation is the free - falling real estate market .
Existing - home sales continue to decline .
Home prices , which started sliding a little over a year ago , are now dropping faster , as measured by the S&P / Case - Shiller home price index .
As millions of Americans see their largest asset becoming less valuable rather than more valuable , the wealth effect goes backward .
And while consumers used to know they could always borrow more money , however appalling their finances , the credit markets faced reality in August and began pricing risk properly .
Easy money and the comfortable feeling it supports are gone .
Now add one other factor : $ 80 - a - barrel oil as winter comes on .
Put it all together , and it's no surprise that the Conference Board 's consumer confidence index has fallen sharply for the past two months .
A consumer retrenchment may have even already started .
Same - store sales at retail chains have dropped in recent weeks ; overall retail sales have declined in real terms .
Wal - Mart ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) cut its profit forecast in August ; in September , Target ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Lowe 's ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) forecast weaker sales .
So I have n't talked myself out of my prediction .
I 've talked myself further into it .
Note that I 'm not predicting a recession , though one would n't surprise me .
But I believe the evidence is powerful that , as incredible as it may seem , U.S. consumers are going to start living within their means again .
Brace yourself .
Forever settling the " Which is faster ?
Bikes or cars ? " debate is the Acabion GTBO .
With a top speed of 340 mph , it 's a full 90 mph faster than a Bugatti Veyron .
It accelerates from 0 to 300 mph in 30 seconds .
Oh , and that top speed is limited , not what it 'd actually be capable of reaching in perfect circumstances .
Best of all , Acabion are ready to start production .
Advertisement
The GTBO is capable of more than just jaw - dropping performance figures .
By employing low aerodynamic drag , low weight , and low rolling resistance , it 's extremely economical , too .
Cruising at 100 mph it achieves 100 mpg .
At 250 mph , 25 mpg .
The GTBO is the brainchild of Peter Maskus , who sees it as the ultimate long - distance transport solution .
In the world Maskus envisions , we 'll all be using solar - powered , electric mass - transit for short commutes , creating a need for ultra-fast , ultra- efficient , individual , inter-city , rapid transportation .
The GTBO fills that need .
Advertisement
Maskus realizes that the GTBO could never exist in mass quantities in today 's world ; instead , he pictures the development of an integrated transport network making extremely high speeds both practical and safe .
In the meantime , he 's prepared to produce the GTBO in extremely limited quantities to further both innovation and awareness of his transport solutions .
If you want a GTBO now , it 'll cost you .
€ 1.87 million to be precise .
Then there 's the three - year wait — that 's how long Maskus says it 'll take to build one .

HOW TO CHANGE A TYRE
BY LARRY McREYNOLDS
Knowing where everything is and how to operate it all is the first step .
Get familiar with where the spare tyre , wheel wrench and jack are located and look at the instruction booklet on where to jack up your car .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
If you get a flat tyre on the road , drive the shortest distance you can to prevent irreparable damage to the tyre or damage to the wheel .
Get as far off the road as possible .
If you are forced to change the tyre on the road , get as far off to the side as you can .
Apply the handbrake , and make sure you put your hazard lights on .
Put out a warning triangle , day or night , about 25 m / 75 ft behind the car .
Once in the safest location possible , determine which tyre is flat .
Get out the spare tyre , jack and wheel wrench .
One side of the wrench can be used to take off the hubcap : put it under the back edge of the hubcap and prise it off .
Use the wrench to make the wheel nuts loose by going counterclockwise .
Loosen the nuts ; do n't remove them .
Do not allow anyone to stay in the car while you jack it up .
Place your jack in the proper position - if you jack in the wrong place , you could damage your car .
Once the car is jacked up , never put any part of the body underneath it .
With the car jacked up , remove the nuts the rest of the way , using the wrench .
Take off the flat tyre and set it aside .
Take your spare tyre and place it up on the hub .
Line the spare up with the studs , push it on , and apply your wheel nuts with your fingers .
Then , take the wheel wrench and tighten them as hard as you can with the car still jacked up .
Take the jack down .
Once the car is back on the ground and off the jack , double - tighten all the wheel nuts in an alternating pattern .
Make sure you hit every wheel nut three or four times to make sure it is as tight as possible .
Then put the flat tyre , jack , wheel wrench and hubcap in the boot .
Do n't put the hubcap back on .
Remove your warning triangle , turn off your hazard lights and be on your way .

HOW TO SLEEP
BY JAMES B MAAS
Treating sleep as a necessity rather than a luxury is the secret to being a peak performer .
When you do n't get proper sleep , you experience increased stress , feelings of lethargy , weight gain , reduced immunity and lowered productivity and memory .
How do you know if you are getting proper sleep ?
Answer the following questions :
* Do I need an alarm clock to wake up at the right time ?
* Do I often fall asleep in meetings , after heavy meals or when watching TV ?
* Do I often sleep extra hours on weekend mornings ?
* Do I feel tired during the day ?
If you answered yes to any of these questions , it 's likely you need more sleep .
THE GOLDEN RULES OF SLEEP
1 . Get proper sleep
Identify the amount of sleep you need to be fully alert all day and get that amount every night .
For most adults , it 's eight hours .
For teenagers , it 's nine .
2. Establish a regular sleep schedule
Go to bed at the same time every night , and wake up at the same time every morning - including weekends .
3 . Get continuous sleep
For sleep to be rejuvenating , you should get your required amount of sleep in one continuous block .
Any nicotine or caffeine after 2 pm or alcohol within three hours of bedtime will disrupt your sleep .
4 . Make up for lost sleep
For every two hours awake , you add one hour of debt to your sleep debt account .
It takes eight hours of sleep to restore 16 hours of waking activity .
You can not make up for large sleep losses during the week by sleeping in at the weekend .
Try taking a 20 - minute power nap at midday .
SLEEP STRATEGIES
1. Keep your bedroom quiet , dark and cool
Sleep on a mattress with individual pocketed coils that reduce motion transfer , or a foam mattress designed to support your back properly .
2. Reduce stress
Even if you are sleep - deprived , anxiety can delay sleep onset .
Try relaxation exercises .
Write down your concerns before you go to bed - your worries then wo n't interfere with your sleep .
Do n't watch TV within two hours of bedtime .
Take a warm bath before bed .
Reading for pleasure before turning off the lights will ease you into sleep .

HOW TO BUILD A FIRE
BY JIM PAXON
Ahhh , the warmth and fascination of a campfire !
Building one is easy .
Here are some simple safety steps to remember :
* Always try to use a previously disturbed piece of ground with a rock fire ring .
* Make sure your fire ring is well away from any trees to prevent starting a fire in the tree .
* Carry two 30 cm pieces of wood that you can splinter easily into kindling .
* Shred newspaper for a fire starter and build a tepee around the paper with the kindling .
* Add dry branches and some wood splits to the tepee .
No starter fluid is needed .
* Touch one match to the newspaper , and the fun begins .
* Feed the fire with larger dry bits of wood .
The most important thing is to make sure the campfire is completely out when you leave , so :
* Take a shovel and a 20 - litre bucket of water with you .
* When the fire has died down to only ashes , put water on it and stir with the shovel .
Go deep to the base of your fire pit and water and stir until all smoke and steam have ceased .
* Take the back of your hand and feel for heat .
If it is still warm , then water and stir some more .
You do not want to cause a forest fire that might destroy woods , wildlife and even homes .

HOW TO SHINE SHOES
BY SAL IACONO
You do n't need to be a genius to shine shoes , but the first key is recognising that there 's a difference between shining and cleaning .
For example , it is impossible to shine white shoes - no matter what kind of leather .
You can , however , clean them with a variety of different cleaners and / or a white cream .
If you scratch a pair of white shoes you need to use a white spray to cover the spot .
You should not polish beige or tan shoes either .
Polish may give you a shine , but it does not clean scratches or stains .
Light - coloured shoes need to be cleaned , and the colour reconditioned , by using a spray , available at your local shoemaker .
When dealing with black , brown , medium or dark shades , begin by removing the dust from the shoes with a towel .
If you have mud on the hedge - the continuous edge - of the shoes , use a damp cloth to get it off .
Once the dust , dirt and mud are removed , it 's time to clean - but not yet polish - the shoe .
Work with a cleaner ( liquid , cream or paste ) that matches the colour of the shoes and apply the cleaner with a rag .
For most people , a medium rag should be used .
But a shiner with big hands should use a large rag for greater control .
Once the cleaner is applied , use strong , fluid motions to work the rag up and down the length of the shoe , spreading the cleaner evenly .
This should take about two minutes .
Brush off the cleaner with a horsehair brush .
The combination of the rag followed by the brush brings up the shine .
Never use a nylon brush , which will spoil the leather .
When cleaning the hedge , use a shoe reconditioning product .
If you want a brighter shine , apply Kiwi polish and use the same technique .
As for polishing , you can use a rag , but a small round - shaped brush is preferred because it makes the polish easier to apply and helps keep it off your hands .
It also gives you more control over the amount of polish used , and so provides a more even finish .
A solid shoe shine should take about seven to 10 minutes .
Sal Iacono , aka ' Sole Man ' , owns Continental Shoe Repair , just steps from New York 's City Hall .
He is currently shoe shiner for Mayor Michael Bloomberg and many of Wall Street 's élite .
HOW TO MAKE A MARTINI
BY DALE DEGROFF
You 'll need three dashes of dry French vermouth and 60 ml of London dry gin .
1. Chill the glasses in the freezer .
Fill the mixing glass with ice .
A martini should always be mixed in a glass .
2 . Add the dashes of vermouth first , then the gin .
Stir the ingredients with the ice - 50 times if using large ice cubes , 30 times if using small cubes .
We want water in the drink from the melting ice ; it is a critical ingredient to mellow the alcohol 's attack .
3 . Strain into a chilled , V - shaped 150 ml martini glass .
Garnish with a pitted Spanish olive , and then twist a lemon peel over the top and drop it into the drink .
And please , no more than three small olives in the glass .
Additional olives should be placed on a small garnish dish to the side of the drink .
4. Use dry French vermouth for martinis and sweet Italian vermouth for Manhattans .
5 . Do n't use unfiltered tap water for ice cubes .
If your water is not filtered , use bottled water for ice cubes to avoid off flavours .
6 . Do n't store gin in the freezer .
Although it seems a natural thing to get the coldest possible martini , frozen gin will not melt the ice when stirring or shaking , and a little water in the drink is critical for a smooth martini .
So do we stir or shake a martini ?
I shake drinks with fruit juices and sweet ingredients , and I stir drinks with only spirit ingredients .
Shaking adds air , sparkle and froth , and fruity or sweet drinks need effervescence .
All the air spreads the flavours over the tongue and renders the sweet ingredient less cloying .
On the other hand , the texture of a martini should be cold , silky and heavy .
So I stir .
For the best martinis , make them in front of your guests .
The drink is a social event , and people want to share in the ceremony .

HOW TO APPLY LIPSTICK
BY BOBBI BROWN
* Start by finding a shade that looks great on you even when you 're bare - faced .
For most women , it 's a shade that looks like the natural colour of their lips taken up a few notches .
* Begin with clean , smooth lips .
If they 're chapped , smooth on some eye cream , then use a toothbrush or a flannel to gently exfoliate them .
* Pick the formula based on your needs and your style .
Matte :
This has the longest wear .
Some matte formulas can be drying , so look for a semi-matte version that 's creamy .
Shimmer :
This combines colour with light - reflecting pigments .
Look for sheer finishes and avoid frosted formulas .
Stain : Transparent colour that 's practically mistake - proof .
A good bet for beginners .
* Neutral colours and sheer formulas can be applied directly from the tube .
Start at the centre of the top lip , working your way out to the corners .
Repeat with the bottom lip .
Finish by blotting lips together to blend .
* A lip brush is your best bet for colours that require precise application .
The bristles of the lip brush should be firm .
* Using the lip brush , apply lipstick on the centre of the top lip and work your way outwards .
Use short strokes , brushing colour in thin , even layers .
Follow the shape of your lip and repeat with the bottom lip .
* A lip pencil applied after lipstick gives lips subtle definition .
If your lipstick is dark or bright , use a pencil one shade deeper .
* When lining lips , make sure the pencil tip is softly rounded , and hold the pencil at a slight angle .
Keep your strokes soft .
* To make lipstick longer - wearing , line and fill in lips with the lip pencil , then apply lipstick .
* Experiment by mixing different shades to create new colours .
On days when you want a low - maintenance look , pair lip balm with lip pencil .

HOW TO SCRAMBLE EGGS
BY JEAN - GEORGES VONGERICHTEN
Ten minutes , a saucepan , a whisk , some butter and some eggs - is all you need to make the perfect scrambled eggs .
This recipe is for two people .
If you have only a non - stick pan , switch the whisk for a wooden spoon .
Combine five eggs , 20g butter and salt and pepper in a saucepan .
Turn the heat to medium - high and beat the egg mixture with the whisk , stirring almost constantly but not so fast that it foams .
After the butter melts , the mixture will begin to thicken , and then lump up in small curds .
This will take between three and eight minutes , depending on the thickness of your pan .
If the mixture begins to stick , remove the pan from the heat for a moment and continue to whisk .
When the eggs become creamy , with small curds , they are ready .
Serve immediately so as not to overcook .
Stop the cooking while the eggs are still loose .

HOW TO HANG A PICTURE
BY BARBARA KAVOVIT
Hanging a piece of artwork or a picture is an easy way to change the appearance of a room , and it's a project you can do in under half an hour .
The most time - consuming part is deciding where to hang the art .
First , consider the scale of the room .
Group small pieces together , or use a large piece as a focal point .
And do n't forget about lighting .
Overhead lights at subdued settings emphasise art work and minimise glare .
Valuable art should not be hung in direct sunlight .
Once you 've decided on perfect placement , get your tools .
You 'll need a hammer , adhesive tape , a tape measure , a pencil , a level and a strong picture hook .
If the picture does not already have wire on the back , you 'll also need picture wire that can bear 13.5 kg of pressure and a few small eyelet screws to secure the wire to the frame .
The eye hooks should be placed into the centre of each side ( left , right ) of the frame .
For large pictures , they should be placed 20 cm from the top , for medium , 15 cm from the top , and for small , 5 - 10 cm from the top .
Use your pencil to make a mark on the wall where you will be placing the nail - about 1.5 m from the ground .
But before you land that first hammer blow , put a piece of adhesive tape over that pencil mark .
This will stop cracking .
Then , gently tap the picture hook into place .
Check the hook is secure and hang your picture .
Now step back .
Check the picture is straight by taking the level and resting it on top of the frame and , voilà .

HOW TO ASK FOR A RISE OR PROMOTION
BY LEE E MILLER
* Timing is important .
You have to prepare well .
* When you have an opportunity to talk to your boss about other matters , casually mention your most recent achievements .
* Share credit with your subordinates .
Telling your boss what a great job your team did enables you to brag without looking like you are .
* To ask , you need a reason .
" I have not had a rise in a while , " is not a reason .
" I have been your top producer over the past six months " ; " I took over extra responsibilities and have handled them without a hitch " ; - those are reasons .
* If you can't find a reason , create one .
Doing something that makes your boss look good creates an opportunity to broach the subject .
* The best justification for a rise is having another job offer .
Even if you like your job , you should periodically test your market value by exploring other opportunities .
* Having chosen your moment , meet your boss to discuss your career .
* When you meet with your boss , seek advice rather than asking directly .
Either your boss will get you a rise or promotion , or you will be told what you need to do to get one , in which case you should keep your boss informed .
* If you have another offer , tell your boss .
Say that you like working for the company , but that the offer is for more money and / or has greater career potential .
If you still do n't get a rise , you need to be prepared to leave .

HOW TO IRON A SHIRT
BY MARY ELLEN PINKHAM
* The best ironing tip is to put the board in a convenient place and give it a padded cover .
Padding makes ironing easier .
To iron all - cotton , set the temperature high ; lower for synthetics .
There 's a guide on the iron .
I have n't yet found a modern iron that gets hot enough to scorch a shirt , but some synthetics melt at high temperatures .
* The shirt should be slightly damp .
Remove it from the dryer or the hanger before it 's bone dry .
And if you can't get to it right away , stick it in the freezer .
It wo n't mildew , but it will stay damp .
* If a shirt needs misting , do n't rely on the reservoir built into the iron .
Most need frequent refills , may clog up , and do n't spray very effectively .
I recommend using a separate spray bottle , preferably one filled with a fragrant water .
Finally , you need an ironing plan .
The idea is to start with the smaller sections first , because whatever section you are not working on tends to wrinkle up .
Below is the suggested order :
1. Collar : Lay it flat , wrong side up , pressing from the points towards the centre .
Then press it on the right side .
2 . Yoke :
The yoke is the panel that covers the shoulders .
Lay it over the widest part of the ironing board to do the job .
3. Cuffs : Iron inside , then out .
4. Sleeves : Smooth the sleeve flat and iron it , then flip it and do the other side .
5. Back : Lay it on the wide part of the ironing board , too .
6 . Front panels : Start with the pocket , then do the panels .
7. Finish : Retouch the collar if needed , then hang to dry before you put it away .

HOW TO SHAVE
BY MYRIAM ZAOUI AND ERIC MALKA
On average , men shave about 21,000 shaves in a lifetime .
Unfortunately , many have acquired bad shaving habits that can yield unpleasant results or injuries such as razor burn , ingrown hairs , and nicks and cuts .
But once the right tools and products have been selected , the only thing that stands between you and an ultra-smooth , close , comfortable shave is learning the proper techniques .
Traditional wet shaving will make the shave as smooth and comfortable as possible .
Wet shaving involves shaving cream or soap , shaving brushes , water and a blade .
The principles of wet shaving revolve around hot water , a rich warm lather and the techniques themselves .
STEP 1 . PREPARE
* Always shave after or during a hot shower , never before .
* Before shaving , apply a pre-shave oil treatment to protect the skin and to soften the beard .
* Always use hot water .
It softens the beard , opens pores and cleanses the skin .
STEP 2 . LATHER
* Use a glycerine - based shaving cream or soap .
Avoid products that contain numbing agents like benzocaine or menthol , which can close pores and act to stiffen the beard .
* For best results , use a shaving brush made of badger hair .
It softens and lifts the beard from the face .
STEP 3 . SHAVE
* Select a clean , sharp blade and dip it in hot water .
* Always shave with the grain - in the direction the hair grows .
Shaving against the grain can cause ingrown hairs .
* Check to see whether the hair on your neck grows in the same direction as the hair on your face .
If it does n't , make sure you adjust accordingly .
* Use a razor with a weighted handle to provide proper balance for better control .
* Avoid applying too much pressure on your razor since this is often the cause of razor burn and skin irritations .
Glide the razor gently over your face .
STEP 4 . MOISTURISE
* After shaving , apply an alcohol - free moisturising aftershave balm to nourish , soothe and moisten the skin .
Avoid aftershaves that contain alcohol ; these can irritate and dry the skin and cause ingrown hairs .
* In the event of nicks or cuts , use an alum block or a styptic match to stop the bleeding .

HOW TO HIT A TENNIS BALL
BY JENNIFER CAPRIATI
EQUIPMENT : Having the right equipment is essential .
Your racquet , grip , clothing and shoes should be comfortable and tight , but not too tight .
Choose a racquet that you can control that is n't too heavy .
GRIP : Lay a racquet on your lap with the head of the racquet parallel to the ground .
Place your open hand perpendicular to the top of the handle .
The handle should be in the middle of your palm .
Close your four fingers to grip the handle , thumb wrapped underneath .
Now turn the racquet face up and hold it as if it were an extension of your arm .
With your opposite hand , hold the throat of the racquet gently for support .
Now , slightly adjust your hand to the right of the grip .
Then cock the racquet up to a slight angle .
Just about 20 to 30 degrees .
If you 're left - handed , everything is reversed .
STANCE : Stand with your feet shoulder - width apart , knees slightly bent , and your body leaning slightly forward so your weight is on the balls of your feet .
Stay on your toes so you can be ready to react to the ball .
SWING : Let 's assume the ball is coming to the forehand side .
I 'll assume you 're a righty .
As the ball is coming towards you , take the racquet back and use the left arm to point to the ball to aid in maintaining eye contact with it .
The head of the racquet should not go above your shoulders or below your waist .
When you make your move to hit the ball , turn your shoulders , waist , then feet sideways to adjust to the right distance to make contact with the ball .
The right contact point is just in front of your right hip .
As the ball is coming towards you , rotate your hips slightly and move your arm with them at the same time .
This gives youpower .
As you make contact , the racquet head should be perpendicular to the ground , hitting the ball as close to the centre of the strings as possible .
Finish the swing by bringing your right arm across your body and up over your left shoulder .
Keep your eyes on the ball at all times !
After you finish the swing , turn your body to the net so that you are ready to hit the next shot .
Keep your eye on the ball and stay on your toes .
Tennis can be frustrating , but practise makes perfect .

HOW TO LISTEN
BY LARRY KING
* The key is to focus .
The truest thing I 've ever heard in my life is : " I never learned anything when I was talking . "
* If you do n't understand what you are listening to , simply say : " I do n't understand .
Can you explain it to me further ? "
There is nothing wrong with not knowing .
It is wrong , however , not to admit that you do n't know .
* Sometimes it is hard to get someone to talk , but keep working at it .
Here 's a good case in point .
I was interviewing an award - winning fighter pilot who had shot down 11 enemy planes during the Second World War .
I had one hour with him .
My first question was why he enlisted in the air corps .
His answer was , " I liked it . "
I could immediately tell that not only was this fellow nervous , but I would struggle to get him to speak for an hour .
He was shaking so much that I switched gears and asked him about fear .
Within 10 minutes , he was saying things like , " We dove through the clouds ...
I could see the whites of their eyes . "
In other words , I had moved him into his territory and expression came out .
So the tip here is to look for the person 's comfort zone .
* A conversation requires two people .
Listen to what the other person is saying .

HOW TO ASK SOMEONE OUT
BY TIM SULLIVAN
Making a romantic first move should be 80 per cent instinct and 20 per cent tactics .
The harder the heart pounds , the more doubts that plague your resolve , the more you owe it to yourself to take that chance .
TEN TIPS FOR ASKING SOMEONE OUT
* Boldly declare your intentions .
Simply express your desire to see the person acknowledging attraction , expressing intent : " I loved meeting you and would like to see you again . "
* Get rejected .
If you are n't getting shot down now and then , it means you are n't allowing yourself to take a little romantic risk .
* Avoid pick - up lines and obsessive analysis of the situation .
* Choose honesty over wit .
Save all prospective repartee for the second or third date .
* Let your fingers do the asking .
An online approach enables you to communicate comfortably with your love interest .
* Location ! Location !
Location !
Proposing to meet at a public location - such as a coffee shop , - increases your potential date 's level of security .

HOW TO LEARN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
BY MARK W HARRIS
* Learning to speak a language is like learning a sport - it is a skill , not just an accumulation of knowledge .
* Smile , point , gesture , mimic , use the many means you use when speaking in your own language to communicate .
* Most languages have parts of speech like subjects , verbs , objects and prepositions .
Learn the basic order of these words in common statements and questions .
* Loan words are increasingly common .
Words like rendezvous , parking , train , beer , coffee , OK and hundreds of others are understood by urban dwellers around the world .
* Make a conscious effort to learn new vocabulary every day .
Tear - off calendars with a " phrase of the day " are convenient ways to be certain you get your daily dose .
* Make opportunities to use your language every day .
Once you have become conversant in a language you will never totally forget it , but , like other skills , you must practise .
* Go to a country where your new language is spoken .
Most people will be flattered when you try to speak their language .
Do n't be shy : plough ahead and make mistakes .

HOW TO SHAKE HANDS
BY LETITIA BALDRIGE
The handshake is usually the first physical contact adults have with one another , so , be sure to make your handshakes a positive experience .
The other person will gauge from this greeting what type of person you are .
A successful handshake depends upon how you execute it , when you do it and where you do it .
Nine times out of ten it will make the other person notice you and feel kindly towards you .
We all know it is no fun to suffer a rebuffed handshake ; it 's an out - and - out rejection .
But before you withdraw , red - faced with shame , think about it .
Did you try to shake someone 's hand while he or she was conversing with someone else ?
Did you attempt to shake it when the rejector was standing in a receiving line ?
Common sense should tell you when not to initiatea handshake .
When you first arrive at a gathering , seek out the host and introduce yourself with a handshake .
When you are leaving , shake his or her hand again .
If you are the initiator of a handshake , step forward , put out your right hand and smile while looking the other person in the eyes .
If you are meeting someone for the first time , add your voice : say your name distinctly .
Make sure your handshake is firm and make sure your hands are clean .
And if your palms tend to be sweaty , take a quick , swipe on the back of your trousers or your skirt with your right hand .
If you teach your children how and when to shake hands , , you 're contributing to the socialisation of Britain .

HOW TO BUY A DIAMOND
BY RONALD WINSTON
In choosing a stone , the parameters known as the four Cs are well known .
They are :
COLOUR
There are many differing scales for colour , but the most common is an alphanumeric one starting at the colour D .
This is the whitest colour exhibited by a diamond , and is followed by E and F. Yellowish - white colour begins at J .
CLARITY
The clarity grading , works as follows : internally flawless ( IF ) ; very , very slightly included ( VVS1 , VVS2 ) ; and very slightly included ( VS1 , VS2 ) .
" Included " refers to an imperfection , whether it be carbon or crystal .
The grading then continues with slightly included or imperfect ( SI1 , SI2 ) and noticeably blemished stones ( I1 , I2 , I3 ) .
CUT
The basic shapes or cuts of diamonds are : round brilliant ; square or princess - cut ; emerald - cut ( an elongated rectangle ) ; pear - shaped ; marquise ( a double - pointed pear ) ; oval ; and heart - cut .
CARAT
Carat is the weight of the stone .
A carat is 0.2g and there are 100 points to a carat .
Thus a 50 - point diamond is half a carat and weighs 0.1g .
CHOOSING A JEWELLER
I 'm adding a fifth C. Seek a jeweller of reputation : they will be there when you want to appraise your stone , or for after - sales service , which might include cleaning , or redesigning your jewellery .
SHAPE , SIZE AND SETTING
For a ring , choose a shape of diamond that pleases you .
Stones of VVS or VS are perfect to the naked eye .
Always request a hand - made setting for stones of more than 1.5 carats .
Any colour darker than G should not be purchased in any shape other than round because the colour is more obvious at the points .
COLOURED DIAMONDS
Coloured diamonds are currently popular , prompted in part by the purchase of a pink diamond by Ben Affleck for Jennifer Lopez .
These stones are extremely rare and much more expensive than others .
An internationally recognised certificate for a white diamond is valuable , but with coloured diamonds it is a necessity .

HOW TO CONDUCT A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION
BY TERRY LENZNER
The scenario : you need information on a person a relative is considering marrying .
Or you are negotiating a transaction and need to know the background of the individual (s ) .
The solution : research through the following steps .
1. First Stop : the Web
Start with the search engine Google .
Enter a name , and Google will deliver several listings directly related to that name .
If it is a common one , you may have to associate it with additional details .
2 . Ask questions
Do n't be shy about asking people for details regarding the subject 's education and employment , birth date and location or military service .
These inquiries can be done subtly by inserting into conversations questions pertaining to these personal facts .
3 . Back to school
Educational history can be a great source of additional information on a person .
For example , alumni magazines often provide personal , professional and other relevant information .
4 . The professional
A licensed investigator will have developed ways of legally accessing information that the average person , because of the Data Protection Act , would have difficulty collecting , including a wide array of facts on individualssuch as a lifetime of addressesand employment listings for every job a person has ever held .
5 . The interview
Facts determined from your investigation often make it more difficult to decide a course of action .
The individuals identified by your investigator or through your initial search can help you answer some of the unanswered questions .
But first you must find out as much as possible about the interviewee 's personal and professional history and relationship to the subject .
You do n't want the interviewee 's prejudices or ulterior motives to twist or shade the facts .
6. Additional sources
Before closing the interview , you or your investigator should inquire whether the interviewee can provide additional sources who might have relevant information , as well as their addresses and relevancy to your inquiry .
7 . The successful interviewer
Be a patient listener with a sense of curiosity .
In the interview process , you will acquire the instincts that will help you to translate body language and to identify and squelch attempts to obfuscate the truth .

Supplemental article from Spokane , WA 's Spokesman Review
BY Wendy M. Grossman | Wednesday , April 22 2015
May 7 , 2015 is the date of the next British general election .
On that day , everyone who cares to vote will go to their local polling station , pick up a small piece of paper , and mark on it , with a stubby pencil , their choice of candidate for Member of Parliament .
The person with the most votes in each district wins .
If one party wins a majority of the 650 Parliamentary seats , that party can form a government .
If no party wins a majority , there will be a lot of dickering to form a coalition , as there was at the last election , in 2010 , when the Liberal Democrats emerged as kingmaker and chose to ally with the Conservatives .
By doing so , the LibDems offended so many of their own supporters that their number of Parliamentary seats is expected to drop precipitously this time round .
According to a recent poll by the Guardian , the next government could well be a coalition of Labour and …the Scottish National Party .

The children ’s game rock - paper - scissors has a simple yet elegant structure : rock beats scissors ; scissors beats paper ; paper beats rock .
Of the three possible moves , each defeats one , only to be defeated by the other .
It ’s almost karmic .
Indeed , it ’s a kind of equilibrium that scientists now say may govern conflict throughout the universe .
At least among lizards .
In an article in last month ’s issue of The American Naturalist , a team of biologists described the curious mating strategies that they observed in a species of European lizard .
Some of the male lizards ( call their type “ rock ” ) use force , invading the territory of fellow males to mate with females .
Others ( “ paper ” ) favor deception , waiting until females are unguarded and sneaking in .
Still others ( “ scissors ” ) work by cooperation , joining together to protect one another ’s females .
The three types of lizard , which the scientists monitored over several years in the French Pyrenees , are locked in a cyclical sort of standoff .
For a time , the deceivers flourish at the expense of the intruders , who are too busy marauding to pay attention .
Then the cooperators win out over the deceivers , who ca n’t slink past the guards .
And then the intruders vanquish the cooperators , whose openness exposes them to aggression .
Then the cycle repeats .
It takes about four years .
Barry Sinervo , the lead author of the paper and a biologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz , has seen all this before .
In the ’90s , he came across the same four - year cycle of mating strategies in a genetically distant species of North American lizard .
Even the behavior of the North American lizards was not a complete surprise : in 1982 , the evolutionary game - theorist John Maynard Smith predicted , using mathematical models of conflict , that such arrangements would be found in nature .
Clark Hoyt , the public NY Times said that Bill Kristol should never have been given a job because he wanted to prosecute the NY Times for running the " bank data mining " story .
Here 's Hoyt :
Publication of the article was controversial — my predecessor as public editor first supported it and then changed his mind — but Kristol ’s leap to prosecution smacked of intimidation and disregard for both the First Amendment and the role of a free press in monitoring a government that has a long history of throwing the cloak of national security and classification over its activities .
This is not a person I would have rewarded with a regular spot in front of arguably the most elite audience in the nation .
One would think that journalistic ethics should count for something .
If you 're a warmongering conservative --- those rules need not apply .
( h/t Jason )
UPDATE : Think Progress says that : " New York Times Public Editor Clark Hoyt writes today that Kristol “ refused to talk ” to him about his comments or the controversy over his hiring , which Hoyt calls “ an odd stance for someone who presumably will want others to talk to him for his column . ”

Operation Alberich How the CIA Helped Germany Foil Terror Plot
With the help of the CIA , German investigators foiled what would likely have been the most devastating terror attack of its kind in the country 's history .
The plans of a fanatical group of Islamists trained in Pakistan reveal just how great a risk Europe faces .
After protesters skirmished with police inside and outside New Orleans City Hall on Thursday , the City Council voted unanimously to approve a federal plan to demolish a vast swath of public housing .
The fate of the 4,500 public housing units has become a flash point as this city struggles to piece itself back together after Hurricane Katrina damaged more than 134,000 homes , many of them in poor , mostly black neighborhoods .
Tents line the Interstate 10 underpass and a homeless camp has settled outside City Hall .
Even before New Orleans ’ seven City Council members took their seats for the public meeting , protesters were booing and pumping their fists .

“ Why y’all standing behind the curtains ? ” a woman called out to council members who waited at the back of the council chambers for protesters to calm down .
“ This ai n’t no stage show !
Get out from behind those curtains and tell us why you want to demolish our homes . ”
The hearing was , in many ways , political theater .
Protesters , who complained that many residents had been locked out of the packed public meeting , fought with police almost immediately .
City Council members -- some sipping water , others leafing through file folders -- looked on impassively as a man was tasered , handcuffed and dragged from the council chambers .
Outside , dozens of locked - out people tried to force their way through iron gates and clashed with police , who used pepper spray and stun guns on them .

One woman was taken away on a stretcher after being sprayed .
Inside , once it began , the meeting was orderly -- with a SWAT team standing between the City Council and the residents , lawyers , developers , preachers , rappers and sociologists who had come to voice their opinions on the city ’s public housing .
The six - hour proceeding was briefly disrupted when what appeared to be rainwater began to drip from the ceiling .
“ We ’re having problems with water coming in , ” said Arnie Fielkow , president of the council , when those in attendance complained that City Council members were paying insufficient attention to residents opposed to the demolition .

“ Tear the building down ! ” shouted one unsympathetic activist .
“ Yeah , get HUD to fix it , ” another chipped in .
Rags were used to sop up the growing puddle of water around clerk Peggy Lewis ’ black patent leather shoes .
The razing of public housing projects , part of a broader nationwide move away from public housing and toward mixed - income projects , has been particularly contentious in New Orleans .
Activists and preservationists have sharply criticized the government ’s proposal to raze the city ’s biggest public housing complexes when low - income housing is in short supply .

With rents up 45 % and more than 3,000 former public housing residents scattered across the country , they say officials should quickly renovate and reopen the sturdy , mostly 1940s - era brick buildings , some of which were barely damaged by Katrina .
Many talk of a conspiracy to purge the city of its poorest residents , pointing out the government will not replace all of the 4,500 public housing units it plans to demolish .
“ The question remains : Who ’s in the mix ? ” said Torin Sanders , pastor of the Sixth Baptist Church , near the old St. Thomas housing project , which was razed before Katrina to make way for a mixed - use project .
“ I saw church members with bags packed walking around the city for somewhere to live . ”
Yet many residents came to the meeting to speak in favor of new mixed - income communities .
“ Why can we not go into something that looks good ? ” asked Donna Johnigan , a resident of B.W. Cooper , her voice trembling .
“ It ’s about being able to walk into a little house and be able to say this is a house , it ai n’t a project .
What we ’ve got to demand is better housing . ”

The Housing Authority of New Orleans , which has been under federal control since 2002 , had planned to begin demolition last Saturday , but former tenants and activists sued the federal government to delay further demolition , arguing that the authority had acted without City Council permits .
A judge ruled in their favor .
The hearing Thursday was in response to that ruling -- and the council issued the permits .
In the last few weeks , the campaign against demolition of the housing projects gained momentum and national attention .
Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and John Edwards of North Carolina , as well as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , asked the government to delay demolition .
City Council members , however , said they agreed with the underlying government conclusion that concentrating the poor in mammoth complexes was a failed social experiment that fostered drug abuse , prostitution and other crimes .

The goal is to have mixed - income neighborhoods where former project residents with Section 8 rent subsidies live alongside those who pay market rates .
“ We have the opportunity to make our home a place that all New Orleanians can point to with pride , ” Fielkow said .
“ It ’s my hope that the word ‘ project ’ will never again be used in place of what should be ‘ transitional homes . ’ ”
To activists who pointed out that fewer than 900 of the 3,200 new mixed - use units will be available to former public housing residents , the council offered something of a concession : a unanimous resolution asking the Department of Housing and Urban Development to rebuild every public housing unit it destroys , and to restructure the local Housing Authority ’s board of directors to include a public housing resident .
“ Let ’s be clear :

“ But public housing ought not to be a warehouse for the poor , ” she said .
In order to thrive , Fielkow added , the new complexes must be rigorously maintained , with clear rules requiring upkeep of property , limits on visitors and criminal background checks .
“ Change is hard , and in New Orleans it ’s even harder , ” he said .
“ But I ’m convinced we could do much better . ”

Where Are Tears for GIs , Iraqis ?
Editor ’s Note : The Iraq War has dropped off as a pressing issue in Campaign 2008 , with the important New Hampshire primary going to two candidates , Hillary Clinton and John McCain , who were longtime supporters of the invasion and occupation .
In this guest essay , Mary MacElveen warns that America can expect little real change if the parties do n't reject war enthusiasts : I would have to say that this presidential campaign to date has jaded me .
The catch phrase that is being thrown around by so many of these candidates is that they want to change things , but as we begin to see the results of both the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary , I do believe that things will stay the same .

The only change I do see is another name coming after the title president .
While the war in Iraq is beginning to poll at the bottom of how Americans will vote , it still remains the single most important factor for me .
Yet , many of the candidates who are polling at the top and who are beginning to win these races have either voted for this war and / or continue to vote for any war funding .
While Mike Huckabee did not cast any vote since he is not and was not in the Senate , still he favors this war .
McCain was even a backer of President Bush ’s ‘ surge strategy ’ .
It leaves me to wonder if Americans do want real change or just a change in name .
Do Americans want to really chart a new course for this country or continue the current road in which we all travel ?
If it is the latter ; then God save America from its citizens .
In watching the CNN feed where Marianne Pernold - Young questioned Sen. Hillary Clinton , it brought Clinton to tears .
Her display of said tears sickened me beyond belief .
Clinton stated in that feed that this race was personal instead of political in which she said , “ I see what ’s happening and we have to reverse it . ”
To this I would love to ask Sen. Clinton :
Do you wish to reverse it back to when your husband was our president in which we sanctioned the Iraqi people thereby killing one million of its citizens ?
I keep on harping on this , but former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright -- when asked by 60 Minutes correspondent Leslie Stahl if it was worth over 500,000 innocent Iraqi children dying -- said , “ It was worth it . ”
As an American citizen , my eyes are wide open and their deaths are personal to me , Sen. Clinton .
Many supporters of Sen. Clinton will state that she was President Bill Clinton ’s true partner , so she must be held responsible for these Iraqi deaths .
He saw fit to hold Iraq accountable due to their non-compliance of U.N. resolutions , yet no one is holding Israel accountable for their non-compliance of 71 U.N. resolutions .
As we all know , Sen. Clinton voted for the Iraq Resolution in which I have written consistently does not hold any constitutional and legal powers and does not invoke the war powers act .
She also failed to read the intelligence report proving President Bush wrong , yet folks still voted for her in these races .
I just do not understand this .
Ms. Pernold - Young voted for Sen. Obama after questioning Sen. Clinton , stating his message was “ electric ” , yet he too has consistently voted to fund this abhorrent war .
In a past column written by me in which Obama spoke in front of those gathered at an AIPAC ( American Israeli Public Affairs Committee ) , Obama had this to say of any military action against Iran , “ We should take no option , including military action , off the table , and show strong support for Israel ’s actions in last summer ’s war against Hezbollah . ”
I have written scathing articles against the State of Israel for launching that attack and have even seen through photos our support of that terrorist attack upon Lebanon in this previous article asking who are the terrorists .
You may be saying to yourselves :
Why am I really targeting the Democratic candidates ?
Well , to be honest , I expected better from them being of the opposite party if one believes they are truly different than the Republicans .
I would blast the Republicans and have , but I do not see any change of course only the same should a Republican become our next president .
In a past article commending Rep. Pete Stark embedded are some of the most horrific photos , but not nearly the worst I have seen as I have consistently written and spoken out against this war .
I want every single Democratic voter to take a look at those no longer with us , namely our soldiers and innocent Iraqi citizens and shed tears for them .
I ask that you reject the tears shed by Sen.
Clinton in which she tried to show her human side forgetting humans were killed in Iraq .
Do so if you are truly in wish of a change .
As Obama rails against this war , he has consistently voted to fund it and remember that too .
Yes , the war still is the most important issue for me and I do suspect for many more out there .
It is not a right vs. left issue , but a holocaust that is taken place over in Iraq .
Even the L.A.
Times reported that one million Iraqis have been killed during this war in which I wrote a scathing column asking Speaker Pelosi when impeachment would be back on the table in relation to President Bush .
If you add up those killed in Iraq during the sanctions to the ones killed during this Iraq War , so far two million innocent Iraqis have died and yes , it is a holocaust .
Please tell me what issue is more important .
The other night , I was in midstream of writing my thoughts down concerning the Iowa Caucuses , but stopped .
I just did not understand how Obama came out on top in that race and I cannot even understand how Clinton came out on top after New Hampshire .
It just seems to me that Americans do not really want change .
That is the only way I can explain the outcomes of both races and that includes those who were the winners on the Republican side .
This column is dedicated to all of our soldiers who have lost their lives in Iraq and who have come home maimed .
This column is also dedicated to the countless innocent Iraqis who have been killed at the hands of the United States government .

The “ monthly curse ” may be anything but : menstrual blood appears to be a rich and easily accessible source of adult stem cells , claim two competing research groups .
Each month , after a woman ’s uterine lining is shed , it has to be rebuilt in preparation for a fertilised egg .
This feat involves growing the billions of cells making up the 5 millimetre - thick lining in just seven days .
Recent research has indicated that the uterine lining , or endometrium , is a rich source of adult stem cells .
But retrieving those cells is as invasive as harvesting adult stem cells from other sources , such as bone marrow .
Now two separate groups say they have found these endometrial stem cells in menstrual blood .

Both groups say the cells in question show all the hallmarks of stem cells : they replicate themselves without differentiating , they can be made to differentiate into many different cell types under the right conditions , and they show characteristic cell surfaces of stem cells .
Classic markers
Xiaolong Meng of the Bio-Communications Research Institute , a private research institute in Witchita , Kansas , US , and his colleagues studied cells taken from menstrual blood from two women .
The researchers say they found cells that proliferated more rapidly than mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cords , doubling about every 19.4 hours .
They also showed classic adult stem cell markers , as well as a few embryonic stem cell markers , such as one “ master ” marker called Oct - 4 .
The researchers also found that their cells could be coaxed into differentiating into nine different types of cells , including fat , muscle , bone and nerve .
Julie Allickson , chief scientist at Cryo - Cell International , the world ’s biggest cord blood bank , based in Oldsmar , Florida , US , has also found stem cells in menstrual blood , although the work remains unpublished .
Like Meng , she says the cells are highly proliferative , differentiate into at least five separate lineages and express stem cell markers .
Patented process
What is more , Cryo - Cell has patented a collection , processing and freeze - storage technique , called “ C’Elle ” , which enables women to preserve their own menstrual stem cells .
Although at this point the stored cells are intended for use by only the woman herself , there is speculation that the cells may help others as well .
“ There are indicators that they could be used for first or second degree relatives , or beyond , ” says Allickson .
Caroline Gargett , of Monash University in Victoria , Australia , who first identified endometrial stem cells in the uterine lining , admits she is a little surprised .
“ I ’d always thought the body would n’t want to be shedding too many stem cells , ” she says .
Both sets of findings are “ very interesting and very significant ” , she says .
Cryo-cell has partnered with four outside stem - cell researchers to examine potential use of the cells in treating heart disease , diabetes , and spinal cord injury .
Meng ’s group is also investigating the cells ’ use in diabetes .

Hello , world !
The card powering up for the first time - more pictures
This is the website of Project VGA , a project which aims to develop a Low Budget , Open Source , VGA Compatible video card .
Currently we 're trying to be as open as we can - our goal is that you could build the card at home ( and understand it ) if you wanted to .
Hopefully you 'll be able to buy one though within a few months for under 200 euro from us !
And did we mention it was reprogrammable ?
If you ever dreamed of playing with an FPGA , or building your own processor , this is the card you want !
If you 're looking for the license everything is released under the " GNU General Public License 3.0 " after lengthy discussion and feedback from you guys !
Not all documents reflect this yet though , we 're working on it .
Latest Updates
Motivation
Our motivation has been discussed in detail in the first entry , but we 'll recap it here for clarity .
The idea for this project came from the desire to play with programmable hardware in combination with the goals the Open Graphic Project set out .
Due to some partial impatience from our side due to the progress that this project was making , and more importantly due to the hefty price tag the card in development will have , we started working on a lightweight version .
Do n't get us wrong - we'd love to have an OGD1 card and are amazed by it 's specifications , but for us and a lot of people , this card is simply too much .
So that 's where this card comes in , to give you all the fun of developing on programmable hardware , designing video cards and architectures , for a price that wo n't hurt your wallet .
On our long - term plan we 'll hopefully meet up with the Open Graphics Project and be able to share certain components .
Progress
We 're finished with routing the circuit board .
You can grab the latest version of the schematic , board and library here .
It 's created with Cadsoft Eagle .
If you do n't have Eagle and do n't feel like installing it , have a look at a full - size PNG image of the schematic and of the circuit board .
The first prototype PCB has just been assembled and we 're currently testing it for any errors .
We 're a little busy with planning the steps after that , so stay tuned !
Specifications
Naturally , the questions on your mind right now are something along the lines of ;
What do you mean with low budget ?
What can it do ?
Makes sense .
Without further ado :
PCI bus interface ( 32 bit , 33/66MHz , 3.3/5V compatible )
Xilinx Spartan 3 s400 FPGA ( aiming for ~ 100MHz )
16MB SDRAM ( aiming for ~ 166MHz )
Onboard programmer with USB interface
You can find more information about everything on board as well as the other main components and why we ended up going for these in the project motivation .
If you 're curious how much all these parts cost , and which components you exactly need to build the card , check the parts list .
And if you want to know how everything communicates with eachother , we 've got that documented as well .
You can find it in the communication description .
Project sponsored by the Hogeschool van Amsterdam
I 'm a student of the Institute of Information Technology and Computer Science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam ( the Netherlands ) studying Technical Computer Science .
They 've generously given me the possibility and financial support to initiate this project and to develop this card as part of the Systems and Network Engineering course , which is completely English - taught and open for Exchange students .
If you like the idea of studying for a semester in the Netherlands , why do n't you look around or contact us ?
Weblog
My ' official ' weblog is located here where I ramble on about technical stuff that interests me , problems we should be able to live without , progress on personal projects , and heck , sometimes even some stuff that did n't happen on the net .
More importantly though , if you want to stay up to date with this project , I suggest you keep an eye out on that page since all new information will appear there first !
It 's also where design choices will be discussed , plans will be plotted , and feedback is requested .
See you there !
Mailing list
A preliminary mailing list has been set up .
You can subscribe , unsubscribe , or get help .
Once you 're subscribed you can send email messages to the list .
An archive will hopefully soon be online .
Also , an rss feed is now available .
Comments posted here will periodically be archived to keep this page reasonably sized .

The signs are that , on both fronts , the administration will carry on playing for time .
Bush and his officials are already suggesting they will maintain the surge for another year , and that Petraeus 's report will merely be an interim score card .
It will not use the fateful Vietnam - era language of light at the end of the tunnel , but it will say progress is under way and therefore more congressional patience is needed .
Similarly Ryan Crocker , the US ambassador in Baghdad , is playing down the urgency of the benchmarks .
He has reminded the US media that Congress can take years to make reforms on complex issues such as immigration and healthcare .
He argues it is unfair to expect the Iraqi parliament to do everything as fast as outsiders might wish .
That said , the administration - particularly the vice - president , Dick Cheney - and the oil lobby are enraged that the oil law is stalled .
The main reason is not that the Iraqi government and parliament are a lazy bunch of Islamist incompetents or narrow - minded sectarians , as is often implied .
MPs are studying the law more carefully , and have begun to see it as a major threat to Iraq 's national interest regardless of people 's religion or sect .
This is the second bit of good news from Iraq .
Civil society , trade unions , professional oil experts and the media are stirring on the oil issue and putting their points across to parliament in the way democracy is meant to work .
The oil unions have held strikes even at the risk of having leaders and members arrested .
The pervasive outside image of Iraq as a country in free - fall where violence on a mass scale is an ever - present threat is not wrong .
But it can mask the fact that " normal life " and indeed " normal politics " are still possible .
The real reason why the Bush administration wanted the oil law rushed through was that it feared public discussion , and was worried that the more people understood what the law entails , the greater the chances of its defeat .
Key parties in the Iraqi parliament oppose it , including the main Sunni party - which this week withdrew from government - as well as the Shia Sadrists and Fadhila .
Washington has promoted the law as a " reconciliation " issue , claiming its early passage would show that Iraq 's ethnic and sectarian communities could share revenues on a fair basis .
But this is a trick .
Only one of the law 's 43 articles mentions revenue - sharing , and then just to say that a separate " federal revenue law " will decide its distribution .
The first draft of this other law only appeared in June , and it is clearly unreasonable to expect the Iraqi parliament to pass it in less than two months .
The law that Washington and the US oil lobby really want would set the arrangements for foreign companies to operate in Iraq 's oil sector .
Independent analysts say the terms being proposed are far more favourable for foreign oil companies than those of any other oil - producing state in the region , including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia .
They all impose some safeguards for the national interest , whether it is having a national company that controls production ; specifying in contracts the maximum level of foreigners ' profits ; limiting foreigners to a small number of fields ; or insisting that disputes are arbitrated in local rather than international tribunals .
Other big oil countries , including Russia and Venezuela , insist on parliamentary approval for contracts covering " strategic " fields or for joint ventures .
Platform , an oil industry watchdog , warns that the Iraq oil and gas law could " sign away Iraq 's future " .
Greg Muttitt , its co-director , says : " The law is permissive .
All of Iraq 's unexploited and as yet unknown reserves , which could amount to between 100bn and 200bn barrels , would go to foreign companies . "
Public pressure has already brought some changes .
The first drafts of 2006 talked of production - sharing agreements , a system of concessions like those Russia gave to foreign oil companies in the days of proto - capitalist weakness in the early 1990s , and which Moscow no longer uses .
The latest Iraqi drafts now talk of " exploration risk contracts " .
They could last for 30 years without a chance of revision , and be equally bad .
One of the most significant aspects of Iraqi society 's awakening on the issue is a recent letter to parliament from 106 Iraqi oil industry technocrats , including exiles who fled the Saddam regime .
They argue that there is no need to rush the law , since at a time of insecurity no foreign investment is likely .
They want parliament to have the right of scrutiny of proposed contracts with the national oil company .
They propose passing the revenue - sharing law before the oil law , and not vice versa - an eminently sensible view that Bush should adopt .
Whether the issue came up in Camp David this week is unclear , but the British government 's role - like that of most western governments - has not been good .
Working closely with the Americans , British officials in Baghdad saw drafts of the law before the Iraqi parliament .
Britain supports the IMF line that Iraq 's final tranche of Saddam - era debts cannot be forgiven until Iraq has a law permitting foreigners a role in the oil industry .
As a staunch supporter of the current international financial architecture , Gordon Brown is unlikely to press for a relaxation of these unfair terms .
More 's the pity , since the best way for Iraq to prosper once the occupation is over and it finally solves its sectarian crisis is to have maximum control over its major natural resource .
Most Iraqis believe the invasion of 2003 was largely about oil .
Peace is also about oil , and it surely makes sense not to let the panic and distraction of the current security crisis be used as a cover for handing the country 's wealth to foreigners .

I ’ve been looking for a good real - world example to compare the traditional “ debt snowball ” approach to the approach of paying off the high - interest loan first above all .
Today , I received a note from a reader named Bryan :
I just graduated college this year , and am starting job where I ’ll make $ 47,000 .
I ’ve got significant student debt , which I will try to pay off as much as I can the next couple years ( while my responsibilities are minimal ) .
My question is this : I have 3 loans :
– $ 5000 @ 3.75 %
– $ 11000 @ 6 %
– $ 40000 @ 8 % Which one do I focus on paying off first ?
It seems like the largest one with the high interest .
But I could “ snowball ” it , and pay off the smaller ones ( while paying minimum on the large one ) , and then use that money to hit the large one hard after the small ones are paid off .
What are your thoughts ?
In order to see what the minimum payments would be on each loan , I headed over to Bankrate.com ’s amortization calculator .
I assumed that each debt was for ten years , so given that assumption , here are Bryan ’s minimum payments :
The $ 5,000 debt has a minimum payment of $ 50.03 per month .
The $ 11,000 debt has a minimum payment of $ 122.12 per month .
The $ 40,000 debt has a minimum payment of $ 485.31 per month .
These debts total up to $ 657.46 a month .
Let ’s also assume Bryan is going to devote 25 % of his pre-tax salary to taking care of this debt , $ 11,750 a year , or $ 979.17 a month .
The Debt Snowball Method
Using the traditional debt snowball method , Bryan would focus on paying off the smallest debt first while just making minimum payments on the rest .
The first debt Bryan takes the $ 321.71 extra each month and applies it to the smallest debt .
He would have this first debt paid off in fourteen months .
The second debt
At the fourteen month mark , Bryan takes the extra $ 371.74 each month and applies it to the $ 11,000 debt , which because he ’s been making the minimum payments , now has only $ 10,029.12 to be repaid .
He would have this second debt paid off at the thirty six month mark .
The third debt
At the thirty six month mark , Bryan takes the extra $ 493.86 each month and applies it to the $ 40,000 debt , which because he ’s been making the minimum payments , now has only $ 31,137.16 to be repaid .
He would have this third debt paid off at the seventy two month mark .
The “ Highest Interest ” Method
Using the highest interest method , Bryan would focus on paying off the highest interest debt first while just making minimum payments on the rest .
The first debt Bryan takes the $ 321.71 extra each month and applies it to the highest interest debt , the $ 40,000 debt .
He would have this first debt paid off in sixty one months .
The second debt
At the sixty one month mark , Bryan takes the extra $ 807.02 each month and applies it to the next highest interest debt , the $ 11,000 debt , which because he ’s been making the minimum payments has only $ 6,226.32 to be repaid .
He would have this second debt paid off at the sixty eight month mark .
The third debt
At the sixty eight month mark , Bryan takes the extra $ 929.14 each month and applies it to the remaining debt , which because he ’s been making the minimum payments has only $ 2,397.76 remaining to be paid .
He would have this final debt paid off at the seventy one month mark .
Which Method Wins ?
The “ highest interest ” method obviously gets the debts paid quicker , which means that Bryan would pay less in overall interest by going that route .
However , with that method , the “ successes ” do n’t start happening for more than five years .
With the debt snowball method , the successes occur more regularly through the process , meaning it ’s better for keeping your encouragement up as you repay .
For me , I would still go with the “ highest interest ” method – it simply puts more cash in your pocket in the end .
I would also advise Bryan to never make more than the minimum payment on that 3.75 % debt , because he ’s cash ahead by even putting money in a high - yield savings account than making early payments on that one .

Representative Dave Hobson is a Republican in the old mold .
Stocky , silver - haired , and congenial , the 71 - year - old Ohio congressman is a fiscal hawk and a gun-rights supporter but has no truck with the religious right .
He works hard in the legislative trenches tending to the arc of suburban and rural counties near Columbus that he ’s represented since 1991 .
Like his home territory , the legislative terrain Hobson occupies is solid if unexciting ; he ’s the guy you might catch on c-span picking through a military construction bill .
Two things color Hobson ’s views on policymaking : his success as a small businessman — he became wealthy from commercial real estate — and the four military bases in his home district .
He is strong on defense , but in a nuts - and - bolts , look - after - the - troops way .
He ’s proud of his efforts to privatize military housing , for instance , and his fight to get more armored Humvees to the troops in Iraq .
( He ’s been there several times . )
He also believes in tight budgets — a sign on his desk reads , “ It ’s the national debt , stupid ” — though he is n’t dogmatic about it .
“ Dave ’s a businessman who also happens to be a politician , ” says John Kasich , a powerful former Ohio congressman and Fox News commentator who is one of Hobson ’s closest friends .
“ Dave ’s not anti-pork , believe me , but the spending has to make sense . ”
Hobson frequently wo n’t sign off on a measure unless it has , in a phrase he often uses , “ a business plan ” — a clear set of achievable goals and a sensible way of reaching them .
Which is why this respected conservative has emerged , to his own surprise , as one of the toughest opponents of the Bush administration ’s extraordinarily ambitious attempts to expand the nation ’s nuclear weapons complex .
The irony is that Hobson strongly believes the United States should have a state - of - the - art nuclear capability and a credible nuclear deterrent ; he ’s even crafted a program that he believes would ensure this .
Yet on nuclear policy , he says , President Bush has committed a cardinal legislative sin : putting forth grand ideas without a business plan or even a coherent notion of their impact on national security .
But that is n’t what most disturbs Hobson .
During conversations in his House office , decorated with military mementos — flags , a musket , an Army helmet , mounted swords and scabbards — the otherwise easygoing congressman becomes stern , even angry , as he recounts the White House ’s record of outright dissembling and abysmal planning .
His complaints evoke the familiar criticisms of the president ’s handling of the war in Iraq .
But , Hobson says , his experience was particularly troubling because it involved a debate about real weapons of mass destruction — perhaps the most sensitive security issue facing any president .
Once a true believer , Hobson has come to a stark conclusion about the administration ’s approach to nuclear weapons : “ They lied . ”
Shortly after he became chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development in early 2003 , Hobson came across a curious item in the proposed budget for the nation ’s nuclear weapons program .
( As part of the Department of Energy , the program fell under the subcommittee ’s purview . )
At the time , Hobson admits , he did n’t know much about this dense , sobering subject .
“ Only senators were supposed to get involved in nuclear weapons issues , ” he explains .
But he was ready to influence an issue larger than the opening of a new veterans clinic in his district .
Ever confident in his ability to wield a sharp red pencil , he settled down with the $ 6 billion weapons budget .
The item that gave him pause was something called the Modern Pit Facility , a proposed factory for manufacturing a critical nuclear weapons component — grapefruit - sized , hollow plutonium spheres that are encased in high explosives to form the triggers of thermonuclear bombs .
Even with 6,000 warheads deployed , more than 4,000 kept in reserve , and thousands of additional pits in storage , the Bush administration was insisting that a new pit production line was essential for upgrading the stockpile .
Hobson was worried that restarting pit production might push countries like Iran and North Korea to speed up their nuclear efforts , or even prod Russia and China to boost their warhead programs .
More than that , though , the proposal ’s sheer scale and redundancy bothered him .
For years , the nation ’s weapons labs had certified that the existing stockpile was in perfect working order , and weapons planners said they needed only small numbers of new pits for making specialized warheads .
Pileup Nuclear Warheads , 2007 North Korea Fewer than 10 Pakistan * 50 India * 75 Israel * 100 United Kingdom 200 France 350 China 410 United States 10,300 Russia 16,000 Estimated totals .
* Indicates lowest estimate .

Pit production had stopped in 1989 when the government ’s plant in Rocky Flats , Colorado , was shuttered due to major safety lapses and leaks of plutonium and other lethal materials .
President Bush himself had declared that he wanted to shrink the nuclear stockpile to a minimum , and had recently negotiated with Russia to slash each country ’s deployed warheads by more than half — to 2,200 or fewer — by 2012 .
Yet the Modern Pit Facility would fabricate as many as 450 pits a year — roughly the same number being produced during the 1980s , in the era of mutually assured destruction .
Hobson voiced his concerns to Linton Brooks , the newly appointed head of the National Nuclear Security Administration ( nnsa ) , an Energy Department unit that oversees the weapons complex .
“ I said , ‘ First of all , I do n’t think you need 450 pits a year , ' ” Hobson recalls .
“ What kind of signal does that send to all these other countries ?
Second of all , I did n’t think we had that kind of money . ”
Sensing that the nuclear priesthood was not going to take direction from a small - town congressman , Hobson was not prepared for a cakewalk .
And yet , “ without any consultations or questions , they just came back to us and said , ‘ Okay , we do n’t need that capacity .
We ’ll cut it , ' ” says Hobson .
“ I thought , ‘ Gosh , this is an easy job . ' ”
Today , Brooks says that the administration was never actually set on fabricating 450 pits a year .
“ It was the high end of the range , ” he says .
For Hobson , though , this unexpected reversal was an epiphany .
“ These were nuclear weapons we were talking about , and they had n’t given it more thought than that ? ”
Few of the ideological blueprints from the foreign - policy hawks who swept into office with George W. Bush were as ambitious as those for reenergizing the idle nuclear weapons production complex .
The United States still had its massive Cold War arsenal , but the bombs ’ role in defense planning was waning .
Nuclear weapons were the ultimate dumb bombs , so indiscriminately destructive that many military planners regarded them as largely useless .
During the Clinton years , some officials had even argued for their abolition , though the hawks prevailed and set up an expensive “ stockpile stewardship ” program to maintain the weapons and nourish the politically influential weapons labs .
In early 2001 , the National Institute for Public Policy , a right - leaning think tank , issued a policy paper by a group of prominent neoconservatives who argued for a radical new strategy .
The United States might be able to make do with a smaller nuclear force , they said , but it urgently needed new types of warheads for specialized missions such as destroying deeply buried bunkers .
But the real novelty of the proposal was its rationale :
New warheads were required not to deal with specific threats such as the Soviet Union , but to prepare for unknown threats that might one day materialize .
It was a “ what if ” strategy , a dramatic example of the neoconservative mantra that American military power needs to be essentially unfettered and boundless .
Three months after 9/11 , the Bush administration issued a new Nuclear Posture Review , a sweeping policy statement that radically redefined nuclear strategy precisely along the lines urged by the National Institute for Public Policy .
( The document was classified , but large portions were leaked . )
This was not surprising , since six of the think - tank study ’s authors had assumed key positions in the new administration , including then - deputy national security adviser Stephen Hadley , dod deputies Stephen Cambone and Keith Payne , and nnsa head Brooks .
The new policy fully embraced the “ what if ” doctrine .
No expense would be spared in creating a “ revitalized defense infrastructure . ”
No longer would nuclear bombs be kept in reserve as history - altering weapons of last resort ; the new nuclear ideologues were envisioning a strategy in which low - kiloton nuclear bombs could be used as actual war - fighting tools , a means — they claimed — of deterring the likes of Iraq , Iran , and North Korea .
A year and a half later , the Republican - controlled Congress repealed the part of the 1993 Spratt - Furse amendment that had prohibited research on weapons with a yield of less than five kilotons ( roughly a third as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima ) .
It appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars for refurbishing warheads and researching so - called bunker busters as well as new types of smaller warheads labeled “ advanced concepts . ”
There were even suggestions that the administration might lift the ban on underground testing put in place by the first President Bush in 1992 , widely regarded as one of the most important nonproliferation measures of the past two decades .
The more Rep . Hobson learned about this ambitious nuclear vision , the more he saw the administration ’s efforts as an ill - advised prelude to a new arms race .
Eventually , he approved the funding , but he inserted requirements that limited advanced concepts to the drawing board and insisted that the entire enterprise be subject to close congressional oversight .
“ We thought it was going to be just a research type of thing , ” he says .
The nnsa and the labs heard a different message .
In December 2003 Brooks wrote to the heads of the Lawrence Livermore , Los Alamos , and Sandia nuclear labs , telling them they were now “ free to explore a range of technical options … without any concern that some ideas could inadvertently violate a vague and arbitrary limitation . ”
Hobson got a copy of the letter , and his heart sank .
“ I ’d been had , ” he says .
Hobson was growing skeptical , but he had not lost his faith in the administration .
It would take the bunker - buster debacle to change that .
The idea behind the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator ( rnep ) was to use nuclear weapons to destroy subterranean bunkers where Kim Jong Il or Saddam Hussein might conceal command centers or caches of wmd .
In theory , by detonating a low - kiloton bomb underground , it would be able to crush a reinforced target buried hundreds of feet beneath the surface , and its blast would be contained — making it more like a precision munition than a doomsday weapon .
The Bush administration decided that it needed bunker busters that were more accurate and could go deeper than existing “ earth penetrators , ” specially modified warheads that can burrow no more than 20 feet into hard rock .
There was just one problem :
Every independent assessment found that a new generation of bunker busters could not possibly perform as hoped .
A March 2003 article in Arms Control Today by a group of respected nuclear weapons advisers concluded that no bomb could penetrate more than 50 feet without destroying the warhead itself , and that crushing a hardened bunker 1,000 feet underground would require an explosion of more than 100 kilotons — seven times the size of the Hiroshima bomb .
Even a one - kiloton bomb , detonated at 20 to 50 feet down , “ would eject more than 1 million cubic feet of radioactive debris from a crater about the size of ground zero at the World Trade Center . ”
A report issued by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that instead of vaporizing any biological or chemical agents inside the bunker , the blast actually might disperse them .
“ Technically you ca n’t go deep enough to contain the blast , ” says Bruce Tarter , the former head of the Livermore lab and a member of the National Academy of Sciences panel .
“ It was not even close under any circumstance one can imagine .
It did n’t have technical or military credibility . ”
Such scientific concerns reinforced Hobson ’s skepticism of the new bombs .
“ The physics of it did n’t work and they sent the wrong signal to the world , ” he says .
“ It gave people a lot of reasons to build their own weapons . ”
He also found it puzzling that while civilian Pentagon officials were clamoring for the new weapon , their uniformed colleagues seemed uninterested in it .
Hobson visited the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha , the nuclear - war nerve center , to see what its staff would say about the concept .
“ They never mentioned it , like it just did n’t matter , ” he recalls .
In October 2004 , he convinced his subcommittee to kill funding for the bunker buster .
The message to the White House , he thought , was clear .
A few weeks later , one of the subcommittee ’s senior staffers , Scott Burnison , stumbled upon a routine work authorization from the Sandia weapons lab showing that researchers there were spending thousands of dollars building a concrete wall for a crash test of the rnep ‘s hardened shell .
Hobson was furious .
He called Energy secretary Samuel Bodman and demanded that the test be stopped .
“ They tried to go around me , ” he says , still visibly angry about it .
“ They lost their credibility . ”
Brooks confirms the episode , but says the administration saw the test as harmless background research : “ It never occurred to us that this would be an issue . ”
Hobson , he insists , “ overreacted . ”
By now , news of Hobson ’s failure to rubber - stamp the administration ’s agenda was getting attention at the top .
Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld summoned Hobson to see him , alone ; the congressman politely replied that he would only come with key aides .
On March 15 , 2005 , Hobson and two subcommittee staffers sat down for a breakfast meeting at the Pentagon .
Waiting for them were Rumsfeld and Bodman , as well as General Joseph Cartwright , the head of the Strategic Command , and a phalanx of senior defense officials .
Rumsfeld , according to several of those who attended , was calm but insistent :
The Pentagon needed the bunker buster , and it was going to get it — one way or another .
Recalls Hobson , in an account confirmed by others , “ I said to him , ‘ Look , you ’re not going to be able to do this , and if you want to take this to a vote and embarrass the president of the United States , fine .
I ’ll beat you .
Because one thing I do know how to do is count votes . ’
Rumsfeld said , ‘ Bah , you might win this year but you wo n’t win next year . ’
And I said , ‘ We ’ll see . ' ”
“ Here ’s the thing you ’ve got to know about Dave , ” explains Kasich , Hobson ’s former Ohio colleague .
“ I ’ve never met anyone more interested in encouraging other people ’s success .
But if you screw with him , that ’s a big mistake .
And they misled him .
They treated him like any other congressman .
He is n’t any other congressman . ”
Despite Rumsfeld ’s show of obstinacy , Hobson succeeded in killing the bunker buster , as well as the advanced concepts program .
He was still irked , though .
The president had gone to war in Iraq , in part , to shut down Saddam Hussein ’s purported nuclear weapons program , and one of the few things that Bush and John Kerry agreed on in the 2004 campaign was that nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism were the gravest threats facing the country .
Yet the administration ’s weapons policies seemed likely to make proliferation worse while actually accomplishing very little in terms of revitalizing the American weapons complex .
Linton Brooks , a respected master of weapons minutiae , now acknowledges that he was sent out to sell the bunker buster with little planning and almost no official backing .
“ It seems hard to imagine we could be so dumb , ” he says , “ but we thought of this as not particularly contentious . ”
He says that he was ordered to follow a contradictory script that left him , the administration , and its nuclear weapons policy tied in knots .
Brooks still believes in the administration ’s overall goals , but he is sympathetic to Hobson ’s sense that its policy was adrift .
“ rnep was a throwaway program , ” he says .
By the time the bunker buster and advanced concepts were killed , Brooks concedes , “ I do n’t know that we had a plan ” for what would be done instead .
Hobson was convinced he should step into the vacuum and design the coherent nuclear policy the White House had failed to deliver .
So he gathered the support of a few key members of Congress and slipped a single sentence into a conference report on the 2005 energy appropriations bill , taking the $ 9 million once reserved for advanced concepts to create something called the Reliable Replacement Warhead ( rrw ) program , which would improve “ the reliability , longevity , and certifiability ” of the existing nuclear stockpile .
It was the most significant new nuclear weapons initiative since the end of the Cold War , snuck into law like an unassuming earmark .
As Hobson conceived it , the rrw program would provide both cost savings and a comprehensive arms - control policy .
Since the end of the Cold War , billions of dollars had been spent on maintenance and piecemeal fixes for the nation ’s warheads .
Hobson wanted the labs to come up with safer , more modern , and more durable weapons .
In addition , he wanted to refurbish the production complex by consolidating and modernizing some of its far - flung facilities .
This was a minimalist policy , and it would result in significant arms reductions .
Deploying more reliable weapons would reduce the need for the thousands of warheads that are currently kept as backups .
Perhaps most important , the redesigned warheads would have no new capabilities such as bunker busting , making them less provocative to other countries .
Hobson also insisted that there would be no underground testing .
“ I wanted to make sure that nobody could play around with these things and come up with new capabilities , ” he says .
“ You just knew they wanted to . ”
Sure enough , the weapons complex and the administration saw Hobson ’s rrw plan as an open - ended mandate for many new generations of weapons .
In congressional testimony last spring , a senior official outlined 11 major aims for the program ; the Congressional Research Service has counted 20 .
Yet as its nuclear wish list became ever more bloated , the administration never gave Hobson the details he demanded — precisely how many warheads it wanted to build , what types , or what they would cost .
To fill in some of the blanks , Hobson had insisted that the Energy Department set up a task force to examine the nation ’s nuclear weapons infrastructure .
After months of research , the team , which was chaired by scientist and defense consultant David Overskei , released a detailed report that affirmed Hobson ’s vision of modernization , cost cutting , and consolidation .
But here too the nnsa and the labs appeared to embrace the blueprint for downsizing , only to hijack it as a call for an expanded weapons complex .
Philip Coyle , a former senior weapons official at the Pentagon and Livermore , and now an adviser at the Center for Defense Information , says that , in hindsight , the nuclear complex was motivated by self - preservation .
“ I think they saw rrw as a path to a more sustainable future when they were n’t sure if they had much of a future , ” he says .
“ They got carried away without thinking through the arms - control implications . ”
The wasted opportunity for change still has Overskei feeling bitter .
The administration , he says , “ has no policy on nuclear weapons .
That is the crux of the whole problem . ”
Today , the Bush administration ’s nuclear ambitions have unraveled .
Following a string of security and safety lapses at the weapons labs , Brooks was fired last January .
In April , an expert analysis by the American Association for the Advancement of Science destroyed nearly every claim the White House made for its version of the Reliable Replacement Warhead program , observing dryly that “ it does not respond to a new military capability or mission need . ”
The report said the old warheads and their plutonium pits may last longer than expected — contrary to one of the administration ’s arguments for why they urgently needed to be replaced .
In May , the replacement warhead program budget was zeroed out by Hobson ’s subcommittee , now chaired by a Democrat , Pete Visclosky of Indiana .
Paradoxically , the Bush administration ’s nuclear misadventure has done something that even the collapse of the Soviet Union did not accomplish : opening nuclear disarmament for debate among foreign - policy conservatives .
Recent reports from the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the Sandia lab have concluded that a new nuclear program could encourage proliferation and harm American credibility on arms control .
Earlier last year , George Shultz , William Perry , Henry Kissinger , and Sam Nunn — all former Cold War hawks — wrote an essay for the Wall Street Journal urging the United States to lead a new disarmament initiative .
“ Reassertion of the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons and practical measures toward achieving that goal would be , and would be perceived as , a bold initiative consistent with America ’s moral heritage , ” they wrote .
Its plans thwarted , the administration has resorted to bullying .
In July , the secretaries of Energy , Defense , and State issued a statement urging quick funding of the rrw program , warning that any delays could force a resumption of underground testing .
Hobson and Visclosky wrote an angry letter rejecting the threat as “ irresponsible . ”
( The Senate kept the program alive , but with reduced funding . )
For his part , Brooks seems mystified by how badly the administration has handled nuclear weapons policy .
Talking at length at a diner near his home in Virginia , he recalls how , as the chief American arms control negotiator in 1991 , he concluded the final draft of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , a 700 - page document nine years in the making that all but ended the arms race with the Soviet Union .
“ It was on the front page of the New York Times when we signed it in July , ” he says .
“ By Christmas the country I signed it with was gone and I never saw it coming . ”
Watching Bush ’s nuclear weapons program run off course was just as startling , he says .
“ I do think the White House was absent , ” Brooks says .
“ There ’s no organizational focus on nuclear issues today .
I ’ve been complaining about that for some time . ”
Hobson , who plans to retire in 2009 , agrees that the real problem with Bush ’s nuclear policy — once it came to shaping reasonable , practical plans , as opposed to making grand promises — was simple neglect .
From the dawn of the nuclear era more than six decades ago , every administration , whether in peaceful or violent times , has maintained a solemn focus on its policies for the only weapon that can end civilization .
But not this one .
Hobson observes that even as he blocked the White House ’s rearmament efforts , he never faced consistent pressure from the administration or the Republican leadership to fall in line .
“ The president of the United States knows me well enough that if he was concerned about what I had been doing , he would have gotten me on the plane and gotten in my face , ” says Hobson .
“ He never did anything .
Nobody called . ”
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday that it was lending $ 20 billion to banks in the first of four special auctions designed to help alleviate the credit crunch on Wall Street .
The Fed said that it received requests for $ 61.6 billion in loans from 93 bidders - illustrating strong demand by banks that need short - term funds .
The winning bidders will receive their loans , which will mature in 28 days , on Thursday .
Stocks seesawed throughout the day Wednesday and finished mixed .
The Dow and S&P 500 fell while the Nasdaq rose slightly .
Bonds rallied , pushing the yield on the benchmark 10 - year U.S. Treasury note down to 4.07 percent .
Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions .
One market expert said the auctions will do little to ease the pain in the financial markets .
" This is a crisis of confidence , not of liquidity or rates .
The problem is that people made bad loans this year .
There 's nothing the Fed can do to fix this .
All they can do is try and reduce anxiety , " said Barry Ritholtz , director of equity research for Fusion IQ , an asset management firm based in New York .
The Fed last week announced the auction plan in conjunction with central banks in Canada and Europe .
A senior Fed official said at the time that the central bank was hoping banks that needed funding would be less hesitant to ask for money through the new anonymous auction process than they were to borrow directly from the Fed .
Many banks had been wary of borrowing money at the Fed 's so - called discount rate of 4.75 percent because it is higher than the federal funds rate of 4.25 percent .
The federal funds rate is what banks charge each other for overnight loans .
The Fed lowered both rates last week by a quarter of a percentage point .
In addition , market observers feel that there is a stigma attached with borrowing at the discount rate because it may be a sign that banks are so desperate for short - term cash that they are willing to pay the higher interest rate for the funds .
But the Fed said last week that it expected the loans would be made at a lower rate than the discount rate and this bore out .
The Fed said Wednesday that the the lowest rate for the loans was 4.65 percent .
One fund manager said that the auction may help banks somewhat but that the results were not that significant since the rate on the loans is still above the fed funds rate .
" The Fed is trying to do its job .
This was a reasonable thing for them to do and it 's ultimately good for banks that do n't want to go to the discount window .
But the rate is at the middle of the road , " said Jamie Jackson , a portfolio manager with RiverSource Investments in Minneapolis .
The Fed said last week that the minimum rate offered in the auction would be 4.17 percent and that maximum loan amount to an institution would be $ 2 billion .
The second of the four auctions will take place on Thursday .
The Fed has said it will offer up to $ 20 billion in this auction .
The loans will mature in 35 days and banks will receive the money on Dec. 27 .
The results of the Fed auction come a day after the European Central Bank announced it would lend an unlimited amount of money to banks bidding at least 4.2 percent for loans .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and other central bankers across the globe have been attempting to inject more liquidity into the financial system in order to make sure that banks do n't run into even more difficulties resulting from the supbrime mortgage meltdown .
Many large banks in the United States and Europe have been forced to write down billions in assets because of bad bets on mortgage loans .
And the concern is that without access to more capital , banks may tighten lending standards .
In turn , this could accelerate a slowdown in the economy and possibly even send the U.S. into a recession if banks are no longer interested in loaning as much money at attractive rates to consumers and businesses .
But Fusion IQ's Ritholtz was skeptical that the new loans would cause banks to loosen their credit standards .
" The problem that the Fed is facing is not an issue of rates being too high and an inadequate amount of liquidity .
It 's that banks have gone from being willing to lend to a corpse to lending to nobody , " said Ritholtz .
Still , the Fed is in a tough spot .
It is trying to make sure the woes in the financial services industry do n't spill over into the broader economy .
The Fed said last week when it lowered interest rates that " economic growth is slowing , reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending . "
But at the same time , the Fed said it remained concerned about rising inflation pressures .
That spooked Wall Street , which interpreted the Fed 's inflation worries as a sign that the central bank may not lower interest rates as aggressively in 2008 as many had hoped .
These fears intensified later last week after the government reported that wholesale prices and retail prices both rose more than expected in November .
And that has sparked fears on Wall Street of " stagflation , " a period of rising inflation and slowing growth .
In a speech Wednesday , Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said he was " uncomfortable with the inflation picture " and that the Fed needed to be concerned not just with so - called " core " inflation - which excludes the effect of oil and food prices - but overall inflation .
" If energy prices fail to decline , monetary policy decisions will be that much more difficult in 2008 , " said Lacker , an avowed " inflation hawk " who voted for a quarter - point rate hike at the last four Fed meetings of 2006 .
Lacker , who is not a voting member this year , was the only one to vote for a hike at those meetings , which all concluded with the Fed keeping rates steady .
But he is not alone in fearing inflation .
Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan used the term " stagflation " on an appearance on ABC's " This Week " on Sunday .
With all this in mind , one fund manager said the Fed should tread cautiously .
" The Fed has to maintain price stability and keep the economy moving forward without jeopardizing growth , " said Ted Parrish , co-manager of the Henssler Equity fund , which owns shares of big financial firms Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) and AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
" Yes , the Fed has to give some help to banks , " Parrish said .
" But they are not here to just to appease and bail out Wall Street . "
To answer your question :
Yes , that pretty much puts them in the running for the most ridiculous moments in the history of non-pornographic cinema .
8 He 's the Juggernaut , bitch
As Seen In :
X - Men : The Last Stand
Why It Sucks :
The awesomeness of a comic book movie tends to be directly proportional to how seriously the director takes the source material .
So , it was a little troubling when the X - Men franchise handed the reins to Brett Ratner , a director who built his career on films like Money Talks and the Rush Hour franchise , in which black people talk differently than white people , and that fact is deemed hilarious .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Pretty much every fan 's fears were confirmed by one piece of cinematic chimp fuckery that earned Ratner a place in the comic world 's Hall of Douchebags .
Before the film went into production , a meme called " The Juggernaut Bitch " was sweeping the Web , in which an X - Men cartoon is overdubbed so that the characters talk like pimps and other insulting black stereotypes , while teenagers giggle audibly in the background .
Ratner was apparently inspired by the video's zero - effort popularity , and decided to insert the line into the fucking film as a nod and wink to its fans .
So , we get the once momentously badass Juggernaut breaking the fouth wall to deliver this line that makes no goddamned sense in the context of the scene .
But , why worry about things like that , right , Brett ?
After all , it 's just a comic book movie , right ?

As appreciative as the hip kids in the Family Guy demographic were that Ratner decided to throw them a bone , it probably was n't worth ruining what should have been the best of the X - Men trilogy .
" Worst Ever " Meter :
Every story has an impact , whether socially or individually , but the story of Sonkorey Mohamed , as reported by the Irin News , has not only touched us , but prompted us to action and long term commitment in doing everything necessary to stop the illegal Ethiopian occupation in Somalia .
Sonkorey Mohamed was not raped , nor tortured , but the tragedy she has faced due to the horrific internal displacement outweighs everything else as she experienced the perfect ordeal of being pregnant in the ninth month , and then delivering her first child in the open roadside who died in the process due to lack of a knowledgeable midwife to assist , thus causing her to bleed and eventually lose her ability to control urine .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
That was not the end .
Instead of her husband offering vital moral or otherwise support , he abandoned her because of her bleeding and the subsequence infection that presumably engulfed her .
In her own words , the young 20 - years old Sonkorey said , " My husband has left me because he said I smell very bad and he could not stand it .
Other people do n't want to be near me . "
This is a glimpse of the brutality of Ethiopia 's 11 - month occupation in Somalia .
They did n't only expel people in large proportions from the densely populated Capital by artillery shelling and shoot - by - sight , but they also slaughtered innocent civilians with knives as horrific pictures of such inhumane atrocities were shown by the local independent Shabelle Media .
The U.S. and the International Community has forsaken the Somali people in Mogadishu and elsewhere in Somalia .
The International Community failed its collective moral responsibility by being complicit when the US supported warlords and used the vicious Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi , who ranks 17 in the list of world 's worst dictators of last year as its proxy , to replace the six - months peace and order that had prevailed last year in Mogadishu , with what we have today of genocide , deliberate starvations , the arbitrary mass imprisonments of our elders and youth as terrorists for the awesome crime of speaking against the ugly truth of the occupation !
Sonkorey is now among the one million - plus Mogadishu residents who are confined in the harshest concentration camps in the outskirts of the Capital , mainly in Afgoye , under trees as shelters , and near the area of the water - treatment reservoirs , having no access to health facility , adequate food and clean water .
The international aid agencies could n't reach to those people with any help since the so - called TFG government - which purely consist of criminal warlords and murderers that is hated by all Somalis , but supported by our beloved U.S. government and the U.N. - ordered its militias to halt the food delivery as well as the outside media exposure to the irreversible humanitarian tragedy of the population .
So far , the scrutiny is on the war , ( the so - called war on terror ) , and the support that the international community has bestowed upon the Ethiopian mercenaries to win over the resistance of the people , who are regarded in the circles of the U.N. and the U.S. State Department as terrorists , but to us , the Somali people , we consider them our only hope and means for survival .
Our people 's determination for peace and freedom was tested by the unprecedented systematic calamity against us , but with it was also tested in their values and leadership as the civilized world , by their sheer duplicity and evil policies towards the world 's poorest nations .
As an immigrant to this domestically great nation of America , in terms of its good treatment to me and others , I find very saddened by the actions of the U.S. government against my people .
We , as Somali immigrants in the U.S. appreciate the assistance and the opportunity that was extended to us , but we will never appreciate the genocidal treatment of our people in Mogadishu that was carried out by the inexperienced U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Affairs , Miss Jendai Frazer .
With the unjust U.S. involvement in Somalia comes with a huge loss of an already tarnished U.S. global standing that is leaning towards duplicity and recklessness .
Instead of helping the Somali people overcome the criminal warlords that had victimized the Somali population for 16 years throughout Somalia , the U.S. policy along the AC - 130 gunship is driving our people to choose death over the debilitating state of life in Mogadishu as Sonkorey cries out , " I 'd rather die than live like this . "
I am sure the American people that I 've seen are not in line with such hostile policies that deliberately destroy and shatter the lives of innocent people , like that of Sonkorey , but we want them to know that we 're suffering because of their taxes that are enabling the Ethiopia 's dictator and military to kill as much Somalis as possible .
WHILE there are , admittedly , figures more deserving of sympathy than unemployed pool players , the demise of the hustler is an occasion to be mourned .
As recently as 10 years ago , it was possible for a pool player to earn a living hustling , provided he was armed with the requisite chops and disposition .
Plenty of “ roadmen ” made plenty of money with scores at Chelsea Billiards in Manhattan or Mikey ’s 24/7 in Oklahoma City or the Sports Palace in Columbia , S.C.
Odds were good that there was at least one unsuspecting local in the joint with an inflated impression of his talent for pocketing balls , and thus a willingness to throw down “ big timber ” against the out - of - towner .
Today , pool hustlers have joined American heavyweight boxing champs , complete - game pitchers , hockey goons and drug - free cyclists as relics in sports .
Endearing bit players in the cast of American culture , hustlers have been written out of future episodes .
“ It used to be that you had to turn down action ; then you had to look hard for action ; and now there ’s no action , ” Bucky Bell , a Cincinnati - based pool wizard , lamented to me .
“ A lot of guys who play real good pool are having to look for real jobs . ”
The pool hustler was n’t murdered by any single suspect , but the last man holding the knife was Kevin Trudeau , the bestselling author of the “ Natural Cures ” series who once served a prison term for felony larceny .
Mr. Trudeau out - hustled the hustlers — and killed off a national archetype in the process .
But even before Mr. Trudeau , hustling was on its deathbed .
The Internet did n’t help .
Time was , a player would score big in , say , Cheyenne , Wyo. , and by the time word got out over the pool transom , the hustler was already in Lexington , Ky. , or Laredo , Tex .
But then came the popular online forum AZBilliards.com .
Suddenly a player would score big and his exploits would be publicized by sunrise .
SAN FRANCISCO , Jan 17 ( Reuters ) - Google.org , the philanthropic arm of Google Inc
GOOG .O
, said on Thursday it is expanding beyond funding for alternative energy to focus on projects in health and combating poverty and climate change .
Google.org is working with partners in five fields who will get $ 25 million in new grants and investments and help from Google employees .
Three of the projects are new , including one that will use of information technology to " predict and prevent " ecological , health or social crises in vulnerable regions .
Its initial focus will be on Southeast Asia and tropical Africa .
" We want to take the advantages of Silicon Valley to the Rift Valley , " said Dr. Larry Brilliant , executive director of Google.org , referring to support for projects in East Africa , in a conference call to discuss his group 's plans .
Google.org mixes the star - power of the world 's biggest Internet company with a change - the - world idealism that aims to inject new energy and activism into the world of philanthropy .
But critics question whether the tiny percentage of its $ 200 billion market capitalization Google has committed to good works is more than just a publicity stunt .
At time of its initial public offering in 2004 , founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin pledged employee time and about 1 percent of Google Inc 's equity -- or 3 million shares -- plus 1 percent of profits to philanthropy .
In 2006 , Google converted 300,000 shares into about $ 90 million to set up Google.org .
Sheryl Sandberg , who heads global online sales as well as philanthropic efforts for Google , said it has committed " real time and real money " to Google.org and the goal is to have " as much or more impact as Google itself has had on the world . "
" You should hold us accountable for real spending and real results , " said Sandberg , a former World Bank economist .
TARGETS : ENTREPRENEURS , HEALTH , ENERGY
It also funds projects that back small and medium - sized business in developing countries as a way to alleviate poverty and overcome the limits of both microlending -- grants usually under $ 500 to groups of villagers -- and conventional aid , involving grants of several - million dollars , Brilliant said .
Google.org began working in 2006 with TechnoServe to support local entrepreneurs in Ghana and Tanzania .
As part of its " predict and prevent " push , Google.org is donating $ 2.5 million to respond to biological threats to the Global Health and Security Initiative ( GHSI ) , a group set up by the Nuclear Threat Initiative run by U.S. Senator Sam Nunn .
The grant seeks to strengthen national and sub-regional disease surveillance systems in the Mekong Basin area stretching from Vietnam and Myanmar to southwestern China .
InSTEDD ( Innovative Support to Emergencies , Diseases and Disasters ) will receive $ 5 million to strengthen early warning systems in Southeast Asia and build local capacity to prevent a new pandemic on the scale of SARS or a bird flu epidemic .
These projects join two Google.org efforts begun last year .
RechargeIT , launched in June , will provide $ 500,000 to $ 2 million in funding to for - profit projects to support widespread commercialization of plug - in electric hybrid vehicles .
In November , it launched Renewable Energy Cheaper Than Coal to support potential breakthroughs in geothermal , solar thermal power , wind power and other alternative energy technology .
On Thursday it pledged $ 10 million to eSolar , the Pasadena , California - based developer of a utility - scale solar thermal generator that can replace a traditional power plant boiler .
Brilliant said in an interview that Google.org did not want to be judged by traditional foundation measures of the size of its grants , but by its ability to help solve serious problems .
" If we do not provide an early warning about the next pandemic , then we have failed , " he said .
" It does n't matter how much money we have given , " adding , " We are looking at this in a very business - like way in terms of performance . "

The announcement would see India join an elite club of countries that have such military capabilities - with the US , Russia and Israel .
It came just days after Pakistan tested a cruise missile capable of carrying nuclear weapons .
India 's top military scientist , Dr VK Saraswat of India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation , said : " If I keep quiet and wait for [ a missile ] to fall on my city and then start sending my own deterrent missile ... a lot of damage is done .
It is essential you have a system which will first take on that kind of a threat .
" Because we have a ballistic missile defence system ... a country which has a small arsenal will think twice before it ventures , " he added , in an apparent reference to nuclear - armed rival Pakistan .
Last week the Indian military demonstrated its missile defence systems by shooting down a warhead off its east coast .
Saraswat said that within three years , major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai would be under a protective shield .
India is also beefing up its armoury .
It has announced a nuclear - capable missile with a range of 3,700 miles - far enough to hit Beijing or Rome .
Analysts say Pakistan 's rapid build - up of short - and medium - range missiles is of special concern to India despite an ongoing peace process between the two .
K Subrahmanyan , a writer on defence issues , said that India needed to raise the " uncertainty levels for Pakistan " .
" Pakistan is acquiring advanced missile technology from China .
No missile defence system is perfect , but if we can knock out three out of every five warheads , it means our adversary has to fire more rockets .
It is a means of deterrence . "
Analysts in Pakistan say such thinking is hastening an arms race .
" The first impulse is to ask how does Pakistan get [ a missile defence system ] , " said Ayesha Siddiqa , a defence analyst .
" The next will be to increase the number of missiles to make sure it has enough to evade the shield . "
Other countries are also racing to develop " Star Wars " technologies .
This year , after Tokyo saw North Korea test ballistic missiles and conduct a nuclear test , Japan 's parliament authorised $ 2.5 bn ( £ 1.3 bn ) to develop a missile defence system .
The US , which has run 36 missile defence tests since 2001 , has authorised an annual spend of a half a trillion dollars on a missile shield .
There are no indications of the cost of the Indian missile defence system , but many analysts say there are better uses for India 's money .
" The US can afford such follies , but a developing country like India cannot , " said Bharat Karnad from Delhi's Centre for Policy Research .
" We should be getting more missiles , not finding ways of shooting them down . "
There has recently been a claim that in the post - peak oil world , life will go on pretty much as normal .
For a while , as the world squeezes inefficiencies out of the economic system and fuel switching occurs , this is true .
But one can not seriously believe that the world economy is infinitely elastic with regards to energy .
With regard to the agricultural system , there is data which shows the limits to this inelasticity and these limits are due to the laws of physics .
I became fascinated with the connection between our food supply and energy when I first learned of the problems that North Korea was having feeding itself .
( see here ) .
This data showed me something amazing about modern society , we do n't live in the information age , we do n't live in the industrial age , we live in the agricultural age .
Without food , we have no industry or information .
Unfortunately many do n't understand this .
Nor do they understand that today the modern farming system is merely a means to turn petroleum into food , via mechanized planting and harvesting , and the use of petroleum based insecticides and fertilizers which consume huge amounts of energy in their manufacture .
According to Wikipedia , who gets it from Science , 1 % of the world 's energy goes into the manufacture of chemical fertilizer ( here ) .
The USDA provides information on the economics of farming .
The data comes in the form of dollars spent on various items .
I will focus on the dollars spent for fuel , chemical sprays and fertilizer .
These three items are directly related to petroleum , and using the cost of the day and the price of oil of the day , one can convert these numbers into barrels of oil spent .
For instance , in 1975 wheat farmers spent an average of $ 11.44 per acre on fertilizer .
As noted above , fertilizer is an energy intensive product and its value is largely determined by the amount of energy used .
Since the price of oil in 1975 averaged $ 11.53 / bbl , this means that the wheat farmers spent .99 bbl / acre on fertilizer .
The farmer spent only $ 1.19 on chemical sprays per acre meaning he spent .1 bbl / ac .
Fuel is much more directly ( although not perfectly ) convertable to barrels .
In 1975 farmers spent $ 4.02 / ac . on fuel and lube , which is converted to .35 bbl / ac .
With this methodology I studied the energy expenditures on wheat , corn , rice and barley farming .
These four crops are the major food - grains of the world .
How the farming community responds to high oil prices is of immense interest to the world community .
If , as that author , mentioned above , claims the world will have 25 - 30 % less oil in 2030 with no ill effects , this can only be true if agriculture has the elasticity to handle such a reduction .
Sure we can drive less , take buses to work , drive motor scooters etc .
This will seriously reduce the demand for energy .
But , can we drive a tractor plowing a field 25 % less ?
I do n't think so .
This is because of the laws of physics .
The energy used to move a tractor across a field is Work = force x distance .
The distance is constant , and so is the force ( or nearly so ) .
The force here is actually the frictional forces the tractor experiences .
They must be over come .
If there were no friction , then Newton 's first law , that a body in motion remains in motion would come into play and a tractor once set moving could continue to move in a straight line .
But because the plow against the dirt , the tires against the dirt , the internal friction of the engine all operate to slow the tractor down , there is a minimal energy which must be expended if one expects to plow that field .
The question is , can we see that limitation in the data from the USDA ?
In plotting the oil price , yields and fuel costs of wheat farmers over time , I noticed that there does appear to be a minimum energy expenditure in the data .
The inflation adjusted price of oil is scaled to fit onto this graph , and both the uninflated and inflated oil prices come from the 2007 BP Statistical Review of World Energy .
One immediately sees that when the price of oil is high , the fuel use drops to approximately .3 bbl / ac. .
When the price of oil is low , the fuel use rises .
One can find a similar thing for rice , corn and barley .
I wo n't show the same thing set of charts for the other grains ( although corns minimum effective fuel use seems to be rising ) , because one can display the data more effectively in another format .
By making fuel use a function of inflation adjusted oil price , one sees the elasticity of fuel use on wheat farms .
Below $ 40 / bbl , the use of fuels to drive equipment rapidly rises .
Clearly the farmers are having few pangs of guilt about driving any equipment when the prices is below $ 40 .
But the behavior is quite different when the price reaches $ 40 / bbl .
Fuel use flattens out , as if almost all of the elasticity has been removed from the system .
Only at the $ 90 level is there any evidence of further restrictions in fuel use .
I would conclude from this that at $ 75 / bbl , wheat farming has already squeezed out the inefficiencies and given a 20 - 30 % drop in future supplies as is expected , the only way to accommodate this is to not drive as much ( although , fertilizer and chemical use will turn out to be more elastic )
Here is the same for corn , rice and barley
What about fertilizer use ?
Looking at these charts we see more elasticity in the higher oil price regions .
The use of fertilizer with wheat , rice and barley continue to drop as the price of oil goes up .
Corn is a bit more complex and it is n't clear why .
One sees two behaviors below the $ 45 oil price .
But one thing is clear on all four graphs .
Below $ 45 the application of fertilizer goes way up .
This is not a phenomenon related to long term changes in the practices of fertilizer application .
Even in the mid-1990s , the use of fertilizer rose more rapidly as the price of oil fell .
It is clear that farmers are reluctant to go down in fertilizer use too rapidly as the oil price rises , but , this is the second place that they can cut when oil prices are high .
The next four charts show the elasticity of chemical usage .
This includes insecticide .
Clearly its use is even more elastic than is fertilizer .
And once again we see a split behavior .
Rapid rise of usage below $ 40 / bbl and linear reduction above that value .
We see this for each of the grains .
One surprise in this data , at least it was surprising to me .
One can't easily correlate yield ( bu / ac ) with oil price .
Nor can one see a correlation between farm profits and oil price .
The best reason for this that I can think of is that both yield and profits are subject to so many other variables than oil price .
Rainfall ( and when it occurs ) , temperature , crop disease , all play a role in both yield and profitability .
The oil price signal gets swamped .
Another surprise was that crop yield did n't correlate with fertilizer use in the USDA data .
One can have high expenditures on oil based items , only to have the crop fail ; conversely , one can have spend little and have the other conditions simply perfect for maximizing yield .
That may not be comforting when one looks at controlled experiments with fertilizer .
This site reports tests of nitrogen fertilizer on 3 test plots in Montana .
One test plot did n't respond to nitrogen , but the other two did .
Here are the results from the other two .

Studies in Kentucky also show a 3.5 bu/ac increase in wheatyield with nitrogen fertilizer .
And for corn , one can find this abstract
Proper fertility management in corn production is important both from an economic and environmental standpoint .
A field study was conducted to investigate the effect of starter fertilizer on corn yield northern Great Plains .
The experiment was established within a two - year corn / soybean rotation , with four replications .
The experiment was carried out for four years ( 2000 - 2003 ) .
Starter fertilizer treatments consisted of four nitrogen ( N ) rates ( 0 , 7 , 14 , and 21 lb N ac - 1 ) .
These N starter treatments contained phosphorus ( P ) and potassium ( K ) .
An additional treatment of no starter fertilizer ( no N , P or K ) was also incorporated into the experiment .
All starter fertilizer was applied at planting in a band 2 inches below and 2 inches to the side of the seed furrow .
An additional 75 lb N ac - 1 was applied side - dress at the V6 growth stage to all plots .
Although the magnitude of grain yield varied for the four different growing seasons , largely due to rainfall , the yield trend was consistent with respect to treatment differences regardless of year .
Comparison between the no starter ( no N , P or K ) treatment and the P and K treatment ( no N + P and K ) resulted in the largest yield increases , with yield increasing up to 36 % for the 2003 growing season .
There was a significant positive response to increases in N rate for all years except the 2002 growing season , which was the lowest yielding year out of the four .
Application of starter fertilizer can have a significant positive impact on yield and quality of corn grown in the northern Great Plains .
Experiments tell us that lack of fertilizer will reduce crop yields and that is exactly what oil prices cause -- reduction in fertilizer .
Why the difference ?
Precision application of fertilizer rather than the spray - it - all - over - the - place techniques have begun to come into play , minimizing the effect of lessened fertilizer application -- so far .
Eventually , even that might not be enough to avoid a drop in crop yield .
With corn , one of the interesting realizations is that a 19th century farm grew about 30 bushels per acre , while today , with our machinery we can grow up to 160 bushels per acre .
How this is done needs some explanation .
The first thing is that on a modern farm , 30,000 corn plants grow per acre .
This is about 1.5 square feet per plant .
This simply can't be done without machinery .
I am in the process of purchasing a 100 - acre farm .
Let 's say I wanted to plant corn by hand and achieve those densities .
At 5 seconds per seed , it would take 41 hours to do one acre .
And 173 days to do the farm .
Of course , by having lots of children I can put them to work .
With 10 children , I could do it in 17 days .
This shows that without machinery , the plant densities will drop .
A modern wheat field has 1.3 million plants .
Clearly , without machinery , this is a throw - the - seed - out - there - and - hope - the - birds - don 't - eat - it - all exercise .
So , having shown the problem of planting without machinery , we can see that any reduction of oil is likely to cause a serious drop in crop yield , leading to famine .
When we can only drive our tractors 80 % as much as we do today , it will effectively mean only 80 % of the land will be under cultivation .
And like everything else , we are being squeezed from two sides .
The population increase requires a higher rather than a lower yield per acre .
In a recent article The Telegraph spoke of this problem .
After pointing out that since the 1950s , there has been an 11 percent increase in cultivatable land , yields have gone up 120 per cent .
As they say , ' they are n't making new land anymore ' .
Ferguson further states :
“ But can world food production keep pace ?
Plant physiologist Lloyd T Evans has estimated that " we must reach an average yield of four tons per hectare … to support a population of 8 billion " .
But yields right now are , as we have seen , just three tons per hectare .
And a world of eight billion people may be less than 20 years away . ” ( Ferguson , 2007 )
Irrigation
Many areas of the world are involved with irrigation to support the agricultural efforts .
My former sister - in - law lives on a farm in western Nebraska .
They tap the Ogallala reservoir to water their land .
Over the many years , the water level has dropped forcing wells to go deeper .
This has happened throughout the world as the farmers try to get water to grow their crops .
Vacuum pumps ( the ones with the handle ) can only bring water up from less than 32 feet deep .
If you go deeper , you need either a bucket system or electricity .
And therein lies the rub .
As energy supplies grow scarce , electricity will begin to become less and less reliable .
Consider these guys from India .
Notice the depth of their water wells .
" Since the 1990s , India has been a major net exporter of rice , shipping nearly 4.5 million tons last year .
" But annual yield increases began to slow over the past decade .
Farmers cranked up fertilizer and water use , draining the water table .
Many began planting two crops a year , taxing the soil .
Punjabi area officials discouraged farmers from planting two crops and in some places outlawed it , but many farmers ignored them . "
" I 'm doing mischief against the government , ' concedes Kanwar Singh , a second rice crop recently on a stretch of flooded land near the northern India city of Karnal .
He says he now has to pump water from 300 feet below the surface , compared with 70 feet 10 years ago . "
' In a year or two , maybe it will be finished , ' he says . "
( Barta , 2007 , p. A10 )
and
" Lakhbir Singh , 35 , this year planted aerobic rice for the first time .
He says his costs have tripled over the past decade .
His well was about 60 feet deep 10 years ago ; now , it 's down to 450 feet , and he has to use a special submersible engine to help haul the water to surface .
The health of his soil has deteriorated , so he 's using more fertilizer . "
( Barta , 2007 , p. A10 )
If electricity becomes problematical , as it must in a post peak - oil world , pumping water from those depths will become difficult but not impossible .
There is the tried and true wind mill .
At this site one can find a table on vertical distances one can lift water with a given size windmill .
To lift water 450 feet , as Lakhbir Singh requires , one needs a 14 ft - blade windmill and a 15 - 20 mph wind .
With this , and an estimated 4 - 5 hours per day of pumping , he could raise 190 gallons per hour during the pumping time for a daily 1000 gallons per day .
This is 231,000 cubic inches of water , or enough water to cover an area 231,000 sq. in .
in area one inch deep in water .
That is 1600 sq feet or 4 % of an acre and one inch is n't enough water for most rice varieties .
This would hardly be classified as large scale agriculture and I wonder if he could feed his family , much less feed mine .
It can't happen in the U. S. , right ?
Wrong .
There was a recent report in the Wall Street Journal talking about how Texas will begin to experience the electricity problems that California is now experiencing .
Why ?
Because we wo n't build coal - fired electrical plants .
For the farmers in the drier parts of Texas , pumped irrigation is the only way they can grow the food we eat .
Thus , the effects of peak oil will spread even to our ability to obtain water for irrigation .
Agriculture and Slavery
In discussing these issues with a statistics professor friend of mine , he made a comment that made me think .
I had told him my favorite statistic ( Price 1995 )
“ Today , the extrasomatic energy used by people around the world is equal to the work of some 280 billion men .
It is as if every man , woman , and child in the world had 50 slaves .
In a technological society such as the United States , every person has more than 200 such " ghost slaves . "
I also told him that the energy in one gallon of gasoline represents the physical labor of one human for 3 weeks .
After hearing this , my friend then asked me if the modern world does n't have slavery because of cheap energy .
I must admit that was something I wish I had thought of .
Slavery still exists in the world , but it exists in the poorer parts of the world .
Looking at the calculation about planting corn above , one can understand the need for cheap labor , whether that labor is one 's children or property .
I must make it clear that I think this is absolutely horrible , but every society in the past was a slave - holding society .
If we lose our energy and have to live the life they lived , are we naive enough to think our descendants will avoid the mistakes they made ?
Conclusion
Peak oil represents a grave threat to our food supply , in my opinion .
Few are aware of how important the petroleum industry is to the agricultural revolution in which we live .
This is why I am currently trying to buy a farm .
Consider this , prior to the agricultural revolution , estimates of hunter - gatherer population sizes , based upon anthropological data show that humans were quite few in number . :
" Measures of world population size on the eve of the transition to agriculture , some 12 000 to 10 000 years ago , come from estimates of the maximum population density that this way of life could sustain .
These generally range from 5 to 10 million people , and the highest figure -- calculated on the assumption that the world was ' saturated ' with hunter - gatherers -- is only 15 million . "
( Landers , 1992 , p. 402 )
Agriculture based only upon animal energy allowed the human population to grow to about 750 million by 1750 ( Cavali - Sforza , 1994 , p. 68 ) .
Peak oil will do several bad things to the world 's energy supply .
It will force us to use coal , and if one uses coal to replace oil , because coal will be used at a faster rate , the US turns its 200 year supply of coal into a 44 year supply ( assuming that there really is a 200 year supply to start with ) .
This implies that by the end of this century , we will no longer have fossil fuels with which we can foster global warming .
Nor will we have fossil fuels with which to run our tractors and we will return at the very least to the 1750s .
Going back to an animal - energy based economy means that approximately 5/6ths of us must die .
The post fossil fuel world , lacking some new energy source , will consist of not many more than 750 million souls .
What an ugly century this will be .
While there are some long - shot grasps - at - straws possible replacements for fossil fuels , the political turmoil resulting from mass starvation may preclude their development and implementation .

GOP presidential candidate Huckabee pushed for release of rapist and murderer during his term as Governor Nick Langewis
Published : Saturday December 8 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Ascending in the Iowa caucus polls , Former Arkansas Governor and GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has come under intense scrutiny over his involvement in the early prison release of recidivist rapist and murderer Wayne DuMond in 1999 .
" There were no letters sent to the governor 's office from any rape victims , " said Huckabee spokesperson Alice Stewart to the Huffington Post .
In addition , Huckabee told CNN on Sunday , December 2 : " None of us could 've predicted what [ DuMond ] could 've done when he got out . "
Documents and personal accounts obtained by the Huffington Post directly contradict the above two statements .
As the Huffington Post details in its Tuesday exposé , Huckabee had been repeatedly warned , including from DuMond 's victims themselves , that DuMond was likely to be a continued threat to society if he were to be released from prison .
DuMond had been sentenced to life in prison plus twenty years , which was reduced to 39.5 years under Governor Jim Guy Tucker , for the 1984 rape of 17 - year - old Ashley Stevens , a distant cousin of then - governor Bill Clinton .
Clinton 's ties to the victim , which prompted him to recuse himself from the case , was ultimately used to help fuel an aggressive campaign to release DuMond .
On his release in September of 1999 , DuMond moved to Missouri and proceeded to rape and murder 39 - year - old Carol Sue Shields , a crime for which he would eventually perish in prison , but not before allegedly claiming one more victim , 23 - year - old Sara Andrasek , in the same fashion in June of 2001 .
While Huckabee denies ever receiving letters from DuMond 's victims , staffers say that the letters did exist , but were considered politically damaging and hidden away accordingly .
Huckabee and the Arkansas Parole Board have refused to release any letters they may or may not have received .
However , Parole Board members have gone on record .
One New York Times report has a member insisting that Huckabee actively lobbied the Board to release DuMond .
" He expressed his concerns about DuMond 's guilt , " says former member Deborah Suttlar .
" He felt he deserved to be released . "
As did Baptist pastor Rev Jay D. Cole , a personal friend of Huckabee 's , who enlisted his help in lobbying for DuMond 's release after DuMond was said to have " found God , " after also forcibly losing his testicles , supposedly to a band of attackers ; the story was taken by some as a self - inflicted ploy for sympathy .
Suttlar abstained from the vote that released DuMond , after years of rejections , out of disgust .
In addition , Huffington Post editor Nico Pitney appeared with two Arkansas Parole Board members , Ermer Pondexter and Dr. Charles Chastain , on MSNBC's Abrams Report to discuss repeated claims by Huckabee that the Board , rather than himself , were responsible for DuMond 's 1999 release .
" There 's no question that the Governor brought up the issue of releasing Wayne DuMond , " counters Chastain , the only Board member to vote against DuMond 's 1999 release .
" I do n't know who initiated the meeting , but we were told that the Governor [ wanted ] to come and meet with various boards and commissions . "
Chastain says that Huckabee specifically brought up the DuMond case in an executive session , portraying DuMond as a " guy from the wrong side of the tracks who got a raw deal . "
" I responded , " says Chastain , " by saying : ' Governor , If you rape a cheerleader in a small town like that , you 're going to get a long sentence if you 're convicted .
And , furthermore , that sentence had been changed by former governor Tucker to 39 1/2 years . "
" When I was called for the next board meeting , " adds Pondexter , " I was informed by board members that the Governor had appeared before them , asking them for support in the release of parole in DuMond . "
Huckabee told NBC's Meet the Press on November 28 that the Parole Board asked his personal advice on whether DuMond should be paroled , and he , in turn , said that it ought to be given a " serious look . "
Dr. Chastain disagrees : " If you think about it , there 's no reason why the Parole Board would be asking the governor for advice about a given individual . "
He continues : " [ Huckabee has ] met with a lot of people like me many , many times all day .
I met with the Governor one time while on the Parole Board in seven years . "
Concludes Chastain , " I remember it very clearly . "

African Greys are often considered the best speakers among parrots
Suzy Collins had been meeting ex-work colleague " Gary " for four months in the Leeds flat she shared with her partner Chris Taylor , according to reports .
Mr Taylor apparently became suspicious after Ziggy croaked " Hiya Gary " when Ms Collins answered her mobile phone .
The parrot also made smooching sounds whenever the name Gary was said on TV .
New home
Mr Taylor , 30 , a computer programmer , confronted the woman he had lived with for a year who admitted the affair and moved out , several newspapers reported .
He also gave up his eight - year - old African Grey parrot after the bird continued to call out Gary 's name and refused to stop squawking the phrases in his ex-girlfriend 's voice .
" I was n't sorry to see the back of Suzy after what she did , but it really broke my heart to let Ziggy go , " he said .
" I love him to bits and I really miss having him around , but it was torture hearing him repeat that name over and over again . "
Ms Collins , 25 , said : " I 'm not proud of what I did but I 'm sure Chris would be the first to admit we were having problems . "
Ziggy - named after David Bowie 's former alter ego Ziggy Stardust - has now found a new home through the offices of a local parrot dealer .
