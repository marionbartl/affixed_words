Should you vote for the candidate who 's your first choice ... or the second choice you think has a better chance of actually winning ?
That 's a common question about campaigners who trail in the polls , like Rep. Dennis Kucinich .
During a campaign event in New Hampshire , voter David Jonas asked the question .
Kucinich and his wife , Elizabeth , answered .
Did they persuade Jonas ?

PARIS ( Reuters ) - Most French people in the region bordering Belgium would like to see France re-unite with Belgium ’s francophone region if the country breaks apart , according to an opinion poll published on Saturday .
Talks to form a new government in Belgium have dragged on for some 150 days since elections in June , and the absence of an agreement has prompted speculation that the country might split along linguistic fault lines .
A poll released before Sunday ’s publication of Le Journal du Dimanche said that 54 percent of those questioned wanted the mainly French - speaking southern Belgian region of Wallonia incorporated into France if a breakup occurred .
The region was briefly absorbed into the French empire after the 1789 revolution , but it has few happy memories for France because it was there , at Waterloo , that Napoleon suffered his final defeat in 1815 by a British army and its German allies .
The land was subsequently attached to the Netherlands until modern Belgium took shape in 1830 .
The Journal du Dimanche survey , carried out by Ifop pollsters , showed that 66 percent of French people living along the border with Belgium wanted to see Wallonia become part of France against 53 percent in the rest of the country .
Some 41 percent were against the idea of unification and five percent declined comment .
In a study which has examined forms of ill treatment during captivity , researchers have found that psychological torment and humiliation can inflict as much terror and trauma as physical torture .
The study was carried out by psychologists at King 's College , University of London , and the Clinical Hospital Zvezdara in Belgrade , on 279 former prisoners from the former Yugoslavia including Bosnians , Croatians and Serbians .
All had experienced at least one form of physical torture such as beatings as well as mental torture , and of the 241 men , 192 had been in detention camps , with the torture experiences occurring roughly eight years earlier .
The men were asked which of 54 war - related stressors and 46 different forms of torture they had experienced and how distressed or out of control they felt overall during the torture .
The researchers say it was hard to distinguish between the psychological damage exerted by mental versus physical forms of torture .
The study authors say the findings indicate a need for a broad definition of torture , because techniques such as sham executions , threats of rape , sexual advances , humiliating treatment , sleep deprivation and witnessing the torture of others , were as distressing as physical torture .
The authors say the unpredictability and loss of control created by mental torture can produce similar levels of anxiety , fear and helplessness as physical torture and leave comparable long - term psychological scars .
The findings come at a time when interrogation techniques have stirred controversy in the United States after evidence has emerged of detainee abuse in Guantanamo Bay , Iraq and Afghanistan , and revelations that the CIA ran secret prisons outside the the United States for terrorism suspects .
Study author Metin Basoglu of King 's College says the United Nations define torture as severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental .
However the U.S. torture policy appears to advocate a narrower definition of torture that excludes mental pain and suffering caused by various acts that do not cause severe physical pain .
It excludes detention and interrogation procedures which include blindfolding and hooding , forced nudity , isolation and psychological manipulations .
Based on the detainees ' scoring of how stressful each method of torture was , and the incidence of mental illness and post - traumatic stress disorder resulting from the experience , the authors say there was no substantial difference between mental and physical torture .
In an accompanying editorial Dr. Steven H. Miles , of the University of Minnesota , Minneapolis says the distinction between torture and degrading treatment is not only useless , but also dangerous .
Dr. Miles says the study demonstrates that the severity of long - lasting adverse mental effects is unrelated to whether the torture or degrading treatment is physical or psychological .
According to Dr. Miles the wrongness of the inflicted harms is compounded by the fact that most abused prisoners , including those in the present war on terror , are innocent or ignorant of terrorist activities , but guilty or innocent , torture survivors rarely get the mental health treatment they need .
Dr. Miles urges human rights –respecting nations and medical societies to unite to reinforce international authority against torture .
It is impossible to say how many gay men and women face persecution in Iraq .
According to an Iraqi gay rights group , run by a former disc jockey in Baghdad named Ali Hili who now lives in London , 400 people have been killed in Iraq since 2003 for being gay .
Set against the many thousands of civilians and soldiers killed in the war , the number is small .
But for Mr. Hili , and Mohammed and his friends , it is a painful barometer of just how far Iraq has shifted from its secular past .
For a brief , exhilarating time , from the mid-1980s until the early 1990s , they say , gay night life flourished in Iraq .
Whereas neighboring Iran turned inward after its Islamic revolution in 1979 , Baghdad allowed a measure of liberation after the end of the Iran - Iraq war .
Abu Nawas Boulevard , which hugs the Tigris River opposite what is now the Green Zone , became a promenade known for cruising .
Discos opened in the city ’s best hotels , the Ishtar Sheraton , the Palestine and Saddam Hussein ’s prized Al - Rasheed Hotel , becoming magnets for gay men .
Young men with rouged cheeks and glossed lips paraded the streets of Mansour , an affluent neighborhood in Baghdad .
“ There were so many guys , from Kuwait , from Saudi Arabia , guys in the street with makeup , ” said Mr. Hili , who left Iraq in 2000 .
“ Up until 1991 , there was sexual freedom .
It was a revolutionary time . ”
Then came the Persian Gulf war , and afterward Saddam Hussein put an end to nightclubs .
Iraq staggered under the yoke of economic sanctions .
While antigay laws were increasingly enforced , Mohammed and Mr. Hili said they still felt safe .
Homosexuality seemed accepted , as long as it was practiced in private .
And even when it was not tolerated , prison time could be evaded with a well - placed bribe .
The American invasion was expected to usher in better times .
“ We thought that with the presence of Americans , life would become paradise , that Iraq would be Westernized , ” Mohammed said .
“ But unfortunately the way things were before was so much better than where we are now . ”
Search categories related to music and technology continue to be among the most dangerous , according to a new McAfee report .
In its ' The State of Search Engine Safety ' report , McAfee points out that one of the riskiest terms to search for on the Web is ' screensavers ' .
It is learnt that nearly 42 percent of search results on the term ' screensavers ' got a ' Red ' warning flag or a ' Yellow ' cautionary flag from McAfee SiteAdvisor .
SiteAdvisor even said that music - and technology - related Web sites have a negative impact on computers , since they often leave spyware and other malware , which could lead to a massive increase in the amount of spam generated .
Interestingly , the study revealed that while browsing porn Web sites through search engines carries an approximately 9 percent risk of infecting PCs with spyware , adware , and spam ; the risk quotient jumps to nearly 19 percent when searching digital music Web sites .
Other sites found to harm computers are those related to electronic gadgets , and those that offer background wallpapers .
In a statement , Mark Maxwell , Senior Product Manager for SiteAdvisor , said that the lesser risk posed by porn Web sites is due to the fact that they are already raking in a lot of money , and have no reason to indulge in such practices .
On the other hand , faced with a slow electronics market , people related to such industries tend to look for additional ways to promote their products .
The study further found that queries related to file - sharing software such as ' BearShare ' , ' LimeWire ' , and ' Kazaa ' posed a significant risk for computers .
In fact , ' BearShare ' was found to be the riskiest search term , with over 46 percent of search results marked as dangerous .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Rupert Murdoch sketched out his plans for the Fox Business Network on Friday , saying he will spend years nurturing the new channel to win over more than half of the business news audience .

N chairman and chief executive confirmed media reports that his media conglomerate intended to invest $ 150 million to $ 200 million over three years in FBN , including about $ 70 million in fiscal 2008 .
Aiming to repeat the success of the Fox News Channel , which unseated CNN as the top cable news network four years after its launch , FBN is part of Murdoch ’s ambitions to build a global financial media powerhouse in print , the Internet and TV .
“ I view FBN ’s growth in terms of years , not months , ” he told reporters following News Corp ’s annual shareholders meeting .
The 76 - year - old mogul said he aimed to chip away at the competition -- the market leader for cable business news is CNBC -- while forging a broader audience beyond day traders and finance professionals .
“ We ’d like to take some of their viewers , ” he told reporters , referring to CNBC .
“ Our objective is to have more than half of it , ” he said , referring to business news viewers .
While some critics question whether there was room for a third cable business news channel after CNBC and Bloomberg TV , Murdoch pointed out that his investments pay off .
He said the company ’s $ 900 million investment in the Fox News Channel is expected to earn at least as much annually .
Its value , he said , is to exceed $ 10 billion .
Longer term , News Corp aims to launch local versions of Fox Business in other countries .
It ’s “ somewhere down the road .
We ’ll come to that , ” he said .
News Corp 's more than $ 70 billion market capitalization slipped past Time Warner Inc TWX.N to steal the title of the world 's largest media company for a brief moment this month .
Its market value has slipped back down below Time Warner 's this week , but Murdoch 's ambition has not .
His recent $ 5 billion deal to buy The Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N is expected to bolster News Corp 's coverage around the world and Murdoch repeated a commitment to invest in the newspaper and its Web properties .
“ There ’s a real hunger , not just in the United States , but across the globe for financial news with the huge worldwide expansion and globalization of business , ” he said .
“ We are set to become the premier provider of the accurate and credible financial information they demand . ”
Murdoch said he expected to expand digital editions of the Wall Street Journal worldwide and launch new “ vertical ” sites around specific sectors of interest .
He did not elaborate .
“ Senior management has formulated a long term plan to integrate the unique properties of Dow Jones with our complementary assets and overall corporate and digital strategies , ” Murdoch said .

World Lung Day 2020 : In the midst of a worldwide pandemic , no better time than now to promote lung awareness
In the absence of clearly defined goals , we become strangely loyal to performing daily acts of trivia .
— Unknown
So you ’ve finally figured out your goal in life :
To become a successful entrepreneur .
You ’ve never liked working for others .
You would love the freedom that comes with working for yourself .
You know your wealth prospects are staggering .
You visualize yourself reading the paper in your private jet , while sipping on champagne served to you by a Playboy Bunny .
You see yourself sailing on your luxurious yacht , driving golf balls into the ocean with your new set of irons .
You can almost feel yourself filling the sleeves of your custom - tailored Armani suits .
You imagine weekend getaways to secluded European locations with your supermodel girlfriend .
You ’re a man on a mission , baby .
There ’s just one minor detail you ’ve omitted from your grand plan :
What the hell does “ successful entrepreneur ” mean ?
Make It Measurable
Some of the most exciting choices we make are in figuring what to do with our lives .
Setting goals helps us chart a path into the unknown , where the action is .
The only thing more exhilarating than watching the mental movie of your ideal life is realizing that you are the producer , director , and lead actor in this film , and the cameras are rolling right now .
But for our goals to be effective , they need to be specific .
Defining your desired outcome in precise terms will help you figure out exactly where you need to focus your energy and attention , and make it easy to determine , at any given moment , whether your actions are bringing you closer to what you want or just distracting you from your real purpose .
To crystallize your intentions , ask yourself :
Is my goal actionable ?
Is the output of my goal measurable ?
How will my external world change when I achieve this goal ?
Here are some examples of goals that are insufficiently defined :
Learn to speak Spanish
Overcome social anxiety
Get in shape
Get better with women
Get better marks at school
How do you know when you can speak Spanish ?
At what point will you consider yourself better with women ?
Try stating your goals in terms of the exact output you desire , for example :
Spend 30 days speaking only Spanish
Say “ Hi ” to 100 strangers
Run for 30 minutes , four times per week , for at least three months
Go on one date per week , every week , for two months
Get at least 3
A’s this semester
The above goals are measurable .
Even an outside observer can easily tell when you ’ve reached them .
They ’re also carefully worded to ensure you achieve what you ’re really after .
For example , running four times per week for only one week does n’t necessarily mean you ’re “ getting in shape ” , but adding “ for three months ” as part of the goal ’s requirements emphasizes your commitment to lasting change .
So how do you go from fuzzy dreams to concrete desires ?
Define Success in Your Own Words
People often set goals using words like “ expert ” , “ successful ” , “ good at ” , “ better at ” .
What do these words mean to you ?
Is being interviewed on CNN what you need to feel like an “ expert ” ?
Does “ good at ” mean being ranked in the top 10 or the top 1,000 ?
All of these terms are subjective , so take some time to write your own rules of proficiency .
A great way to refine your definition of success is to observe what others in your field are doing .
What are the most impressive attributes of those you admire ?
How can they be measured ?
What kind of revenues are they generating ?
What ’s their batting average ?
What kind of clients are buying their work ?
For example , at one point my primary goal was to become a Ruby on Rails expert .
( For non-computer geeks , Rails is an Open Source framework for building websites . )
For this goal to be truly useful to me , I had to define the word “ expert ” in this context .
Did it mean speaking at a Rails conference ?
Nah , doing presentations does n’t require expertise .
Landing a Rails web development contract at an insane hourly rate ?
Hm , that ’s more about negotiating skills .
What about writing a book ?
Nope .
Eventually , I came up with a definition that suited me :
Get a “ commit bit ” to the core Rails repository , which would allow me to make changes to the Rails source code itself .
If the core Rails development team would entrust me with this privilege , I could definitely call myself a Rails ninja .
It turns out that while pursuing this goal , my interests shifted .
After landing a few Rails contracts , I decided to shift my focus from wanting a “ commit bit ” , to building my own website using Rails .
I used the skills I had acquired while pursuing Rails expertise to build 30 sleeps .
So , even though my priorities changed , I still greatly benefited from learning Rails .
Notice the impact that a clear objective has on where you direct your energy .
Had I defined “ Rails expert ” as “ someone who speaks at Rails conferences ” my actions would have been completely different from those required to gain change access to the Rails project itself .
Target the Side Effects
Some goals are tricky to nail down .
How do you precisely measure “ getting out of depression ” or being “ happy with who you are ” ?
Emotional states are difficult to quantify , and many skills are subjective .
In these cases , think about how to turn the subjective into the objective .
How would your external world change if you were “ happier ” ?
Would you go out with friends more ?
About how many times per week ?
Maybe it would include having “ zero arguments this month ” with your spouse .
The more you ask these questions , the more you discover that even the most feel - good internal changes do manifest themselves in many ways in the external world .
This one could take some practice , so let ’s consider more examples .
If a major source of your unhappiness is that you hate your job , then “ get out of depression ” might just mean “ find a new job ” .
If you ’re trying to overcome your fear of heights , make it your goal to stand in the observation deck of a tall skyscraper for 15 minutes , at an average heart rate under 80 beats per minute .
Being “ happy with who you are ” might just mean feeling really comfortable talking to people , so why not refine this goal to be “ Say ‘ Hi ’ to five new people every day for a month . ”
Remember , targeting the side effects does not mean ignoring the underlying issues .
It just means that if your goal is to “ be happier ” , for example , you ’ll get there much quicker if you give yourself something tangible to strive for .
It might seem funny to define these things in such concrete terms , but who cares ?
Be creative .
Have fun with it .
You can always redefine your goal at a later time , especially if it ’s no longer pointing you in the right direction .
It all comes down to results .
Use Short Time Frames
If you give yourself six months to get a date with a hot girl , you could easily spend the first five on aimless internet reading and movie rentals .
Constraints force you to take immediate action , and use your time productively .
When you aim too far ahead , you make decisions and commit to things when you have the least information to do so .
For example , it ’s almost impossible for me to set useful and specific revenue goals for this site in three years ’ time .
I have no idea what my numbers will look like that far in the future .
But I can look at my current revenue and traffic growth patterns and set realistic targets to push me forward over the next couple of months .
Do n’t Be Too Specific
While effective goal setting requires precision , you do n’t want to box yourself in .
Rather than setting your sights on dating a specific girl , define a profile of what you ’re looking for in a woman .
Instead of putting all your hopes on getting hired by one company , focus on what kind of work you want to do , what kind of talent you want to work with , and a salary range that suits you .
If your goals are too detailed , it ’s easy to get discouraged when your results do n’t match up exactly with what you want .
Being flexible will expose you to more opportunities .
Rather than putting all your eggs in one basket , define boundaries within which to operate and keep an open mind .
Setting goals is the first step in paving the pathway to a better life .
Goals give us motivation and direction to explore who and what we are .
Effective goals are not only exciting , but specific .
A clear description of our desires helps us focus our efforts on the right things and makes it easier to see whether we ’re moving toward or away from what we really want .
Setting clear goals sometimes requires creativity .
In some cases , the best way to pursue a goal is to aim for its side effects .
But by making it measurable we make it actionable , and turn our fuzzy daydreams of success into exciting challenges we can take on in the present .

Russia , India to join in moon mission
The leaders of veteran allies Russia and India agreed Monday to launch a joint unmanned mission to the moon during Kremlin talks on boosting military and trade ties .
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the plan after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which the two discussed projects for a more than twofold increase in trade by the end of the decade .
" The symbol of our cooperation is the joint agreement to send an unpiloted space ship to the moon for scientific investigation , " Singh said in comments broadcast on Russian state television after the meeting .
Russia 's space agency Roskosmos said it had signed an agreement with the Indian space agency for joint lunar exploration through 2017 , including the construction of a module that will orbit the moon " for peaceful purposes . "
" Russia and India will jointly build a space ship .
Under the project we plan to send an entire laboratory to the moon , " Roskosmos head Anatoly Perminov said in a statement .
During the talks the Russian and Indian leaders also " paid particular attention to cooperation in nuclear energy and in military - technical cooperation , " Putin said .
Russia accounts for 70 percent of Indian military hardware while India currently accounts for 30 percent of Russian arms sales , Interfax reported , citing Russian officials .
Agreement was finalised on a joint project to develop a new military transport plane , the Il - 214 , as well as cooperation on a fifth - generation fighter jet .
The deals " open new prospects for our scientific , technical and production cooperation in sensitive areas , " Putin said .
Singh thanked the Russian president for assisting in efforts to lift international restrictions on nuclear cooperation with India .
" We look forward to expanding our cooperation with Russia in the civil use of nuclear energy in the future , " he said .
Nuclear trade with India is still banned as it has refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
New Delhi is currently vying for approval from the 45 - member Nuclear Suppliers Group for a contentious nuclear deal with the United States under which it can get nuclear fuel and technology .
Singh said an intergovernmental agreement to build four nuclear reactors in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu was being prepared .
Under an existing deal , Russia has agreed to install two reactors in Tamil Nadu with a capacity to produce 1,000 megawatts of atomic energy a day .
The two regional powers promised cooperation , in particular between the BRIC grouping of huge , developing nations : Brazil , Russia , India and China .
" I see big prospects in active ties on the trilateral format : Russia - India - China and on the four - sided BRIC format , " Putin said .
" In this increasingly interdependent world in which we live in we have an obligation to explore areas of convergence between " Russia , India and China , Singh said .
The two sides also managed to bring their positions closer on Afghanistan , Iraq , the Iranian nuclear programme , Putin said .
And they reached agreement on settling Indian debt to Russia from the Soviet era .
The two countries aim to boost bilateral trade to 10 billion dollars ( 6.8 billion euros ) per year by 2010 from four billion dollars in 2006 , Singh said .
UN representative expresses “ grave concern ” over CIA torture , Guantánamo hearings
By Naomi Spencer
19 December 2007
Following a visit earlier this month to the US military prison at Guantánamo Bay , a United Nations human rights representative reported ongoing abuse , drumhead judicial proceedings , and other violations of international law .
The report by the UN official , charging the US government with widespread criminality , has been almost entirely ignored by the US media .
In a report to the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva December 13 , Special Rapporteur on human rights and counterterrorism Martin Scheinin said he believed the CIA continues to engage in so - called “ extraordinary rendition , ” secret detentions and torture .
Scheinin suggested that hundreds of detainees held at Guantánamo were not being prosecuted to keep revelations of abuse from emerging .
During his visit , he was not allowed to have unmonitored interaction with detainees .
Of the 305 Guantánamo detainees , about 80 have already been put through combatant status review tribunals ( CSRT ) and declared not to be “ enemy combatants , ” although they have not been released .
The military has announced that it plans to hold these hearings for another 80 detainees , after which they could ostensibly be convicted by military trial .
But for 150 so - called “ high value ” prisoners , Scheinin said , “ There is not enough evidence that could be presented , even to a military commission chaired by a military judge .
Partly there may not be evidence and partly the risk of issues of torture being raised is too high . ”
“ Bringing them to court would bring to the court ’s attention the method through which the evidence , including the confessions , were obtained , ” Scheinin told the press following his report .
In addition to the recent revelations that the CIA had destroyed interrogation tapes , he said the indefinite detention without trial “ is one further affirmation of the conclusion that the CIA or others have been involved in methods of interrogation that are incompatible with international law . ”
The CIA , Scheinin stated , “ has been involved and continues to be involved in the use of interrogation techniques that violate the absolute prohibition against torture . ”
The destruction of the CIA interrogation tapes showing the torture of at least two prisoners underscores the basic fact that egregious human rights violations by the US are not isolated events .
On the contrary , torture and illegal detentions have been the standard operating procedure for the CIA , with the cooperation of military brass and the support of the entire political establishment .
Scheinin said that in a meeting with representatives of the CIA during his visit to the United States , “ the CIA refused to engage in any meaningful interaction aimed at clarifying the means of compliance with international standards of methods of interrogation and accountability in respect of possible abuses . ”
He also said the CIA refused to meet with him a second time .
This stonewalling is yet further evidence of the lawlessness of the US government .
Significantly , Scheinin noted that behavior by CIA officials “ supports the suspicion that the CIA has been involved and continues to be involved in the extraordinary rendition of terrorism suspects and possibly other persons . ”
Moreover , the report concluded , “ It is unlikely that the CIA would be able to run a global programme of rendition and detention of terrorist suspects without at least logistical support by the United States military authorities . ”
Although the Bush administration declared that it held no other “ high value ” detainees in secret detention after transferring 14 to Guantánamo Bay from around the world in 2006 , it reserved the possibility of resuming the practice whenever it wished , and has rendered at least one other detainee since then .
Other suspected detainees remain missing .
It should not be forgotten that , in addition to those detainees being held at Guantánamo , the US continues to hold some 700 detainees in Afghanistan and approximately 18,000 detainees in Iraq .
Many of these are classified by the US as “ unlawful enemy combatants ” in order to deny them fundamental legal rights .
While at the Guantánamo Bay prison , Scheinin observed the pre-trial military proceedings against Salim Ahmed Hamdan , the alleged former driver of Osama bin Laden .
Hamdan , captured in Afghanistan in 2001 , has been held at Guantánamo since 2002 .
The drumhead character Hamdan ’s CSRT was evident .
“ The hearings provided graphic illustrations of the practical difficulties in providing fair trials at a distant military base , and confirmed the difficulties or even impossibility of the defense to provide evidence , ” Scheinin told the press .
“ Neither witnesses from abroad or high - value detainees from the Guantánamo detention facility next door could be heard , at least on this particular occasion . ”
The written report is more specific : “ These are administrative processes rather than judicial ones .
Detainees are not provided with a lawyer during the course of hearings . ”
Even if all charges are dropped , “ the most that a reviewing court may do is to order reconsideration of a decision , not release . ”
This violates international prohibitions on arbitrary detention , habeas corpus rights , the right to a timely trial , and other fundamental legal protections .
As could be expected , US media coverage of the report and the Hamdan CSRT has been nonexistent .
Neither the New York Times , Washington Post , nor Los Angeles Times published an article on the topic , with the main coverage in the US coming from brief wire reports from the AP and Reuters .
Also typical , the response of the US government to the report has consisted largely of the attempt to dismiss and discredit it .
Melanie Khanna , a US legal adviser , was quoted in both the AP and Reuters articles at some length .
Khanna said that sections of Scheinin ’s report dealing with legal violations by the US “ simply catalogue well - known criticisms and fail even to acknowledge that there are multiple ways of approaching the difficult issues discussed ... ”
“ We hope that in future the work of the Special Rapporteur proceeds differently , ” Khanna said , claiming Scheinin ’s description of the combatant status reviews was “ in part misleading about the facts of the process , and revisits well - worn , ill - informed criticisms of military commissions hearings .
The unfortunate fact is that a large part of the report again repeats unfair and oversimplified criticisms of the United States . ”
However , the “ well - worn ” arguments against the military tribunals have also been made by the US Supreme Court — specifically in regard to the case of Hamdan — before this decision was scuttled by Congress in the 2006 Military Commissions Act .
In that case , Hamdan v. Rumsfeld , the court ruled that President Bush did not have the authority to establish military commissions , and found them to be illegal under military law and the Geneva Conventions .
When Hamdan was subject to another military commission in June 2007 , charges of conspiracy and supporting terrorism were thrown out by the military judge , who ruled that the commission lacked jurisdiction because Hamdan had not been officially classified as an “ unlawful enemy combatant . ”
The government appealed this decision , asking a military court to declare Hamdan an “ unlawful enemy combatant ” so he can be tried once again .
A ruling has not been issued as of this writing .
During the hearing , the defense was denied the request to call three “ high value ” detainees held at Guantánamo for testimony on the spurious grounds that the request was not timely because of the clearance required to access such prisoners .
The detainees , Khalid Sheik Mohammed , Ramzi Bin al - Shib and Abu Faraj al - Libi , have all been subjected to CIA interrogations and torture .
In his book “ Communication strategies for governments ” , Roberto Izurieta explains that communication for governments needs an interlocutor – these are the media .
Both need to produce news in an era of entertainment .
The relationship between them must be symbiotic – based on trust and mutual respect ; symbiotic in the sense that both are needed but in democracy , can and should collaborate with each other beyond their own limitations for the development of the societies in which they operate .
The objective of the PR is to inform the public of positive but complex matters of State that the media do not have space , nor are they experts to report them .
Public Relations are specialists in communication , and therefore , the middle - man who has the function of ordering the information through an honest and effective relationship with journalists .
The most effective way to get attention is the bad news since it is something that comes out of the normal and has a greater impact and power to influence the audience .
Bad news has huge impact on the public and governments .
Those elements that appear in the media influence decision - making and government reactions for a quick resolution of the authorities .
In many places around the globe , the media have a great influence , up to the point of attributing to the power to overthrow governments .
In some parts of the world are monopolistic or controlled by the ruling classes of those countries .
Currently , the media have largely replaced or displaced the functions that the political parties once had .
Before , parties were the most important instruments to win an election campaign .
Now , everyone turns to the media because they are the only effective resource for politicians to convey their message quickly to the public .
Both the media and governments have an obligation to the public , and both are powerful although with an independent power base .
Each one needs the other and none really dominates .
Although they are independent , governments influence the media through the news they produce , through propaganda , subsidies and legal reasons .
Almost all the news that goes to the public is actually a co-production between the media and the government .
The ability to generate and communicate news is the main resource of government power against the media .
Social or economic policies need media coverage and media coverage influences policies ; it is impossible to separate them .
When the government ’s agenda is established exclusively by the government itself , it often tends to change its priorities .
When this becomes more constant , the government tends to lose its course and hence the fight to control the agenda .
To control the agenda it is needed to pass the decision to a political level where more influence can be exercised : from the media , the street or the corridors of power .
The main communication resource of governments is the president .
And the president ’s best communication resource is to go to the public taking advantage of many opportunities .
The national chain is the main instrument , although if overused , the public gets tired and can end up being counterproductive .
Press conferences produce great coverage deployment .
The big fear is the questions .
The interview with the media and especially the exclusive interviews are a very efficient resource .
The president ’s agenda and the development of a message of the day are strong communication resources , as is political advertising that is mainly unidirectional .
On the other hand , communication in Congress differs from the communication of the president .
According to Mr. Izurieta , there are three main reasons why Congress has greater difficulty communicating their work than the Executive .
The first , in the Executive there is clearly a leading figure , while in Congress it is a collegiate body that makes it more difficult and less attractive for the media that are very attracted to cover personalities .
The second is that Congress concentrates much more on processes than on results , and the processes do not interest the media or the public .
The third is the time it takes for a law to produce results .
Congress has a different PR dynamic compared to the Executive .
While in general in the Executive almost nobody wants to talk to the media , in Congress , everyone wants to talk .
Congress is a political function much closer to the people .
And although it has lower popularity than the Executive , Congress maintains greater contacts , more direct ; and throughout the national territory with its voters .
This is the main reason why many of its members get re-elected easily , something that does not happen in the case of the Executive .
Local or municipal governments have the same advantage as Congress : they are closer to the people .
In addition , another advantage is added : they have the possibility of solving specific and direct problems of the people .
Another advantage is that they have a broader call to the public .
Municipalities are decentralized in their actions and in their way of communicating .
Nonetheless , their main problem in getting the attention of the media is that they are less political entities with fewer conflicts .
This is offset by their more direct communication and because sectional governments are closer to the people , their problems and their solutions .
The key to success in PR for a government is its openness to the media .
The PR of a government helps create or package the news , control the media and government agenda , and above all – persuade .
Among its functions are :
media training
clipping
searching for different media
evaluating the press and media
managing communication in times of crisis
maintaining communication with the community and the environment
maintaining internal communication
It is essential that PR maintains a reputation for honesty and reliability .
The media needs government information as much as the government needs the media to report on what it does .
The main function of PR is to influence people favorably .
Therefore , it is essential that PR has the freedom to talk with the media permanently .
The PR listens more than it communicates , and for that reason , it fulfills another function : to think about what the authorities are not thinking , then , it must give guidance and support in decision making .
It ’ll come as a surprise to most , but Republicans try marijuana at a higher rate than Democrats .
A Gallup poll found that 33 % of Republicans have tried America ’s favorite ( and safest ) illicit drug while a slightly lower 31 % of Democrats have inhaled the celebrated herb .
Thinking back , I remember when it was learned that House Speaker Newt Gingrich , Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , Minnesota Senator Norm Coleman and other Republicans had enjoyed marijuana in their pasts , and I recall the 2002 Republican congressional page scandal in which eleven pot smoker pages sponsored by Republican House members were dismissed subsequent to the discovery of marijuana in their Capitol Hill dormitory .
I guess I should have put two and two together .
Politically speaking , the obvious question is “ Why does n’t this translate into more Republican support for marijuana decriminalization or legalization ? ”
Only 21 % of Republicans want the herb legalized while 37 % of Democrats do .
Do Republicans experience different effects ?
Do they feel guilty after imbibing ?
Maybe we just need more Republicans to bring their views on marijuana laws out of the closet .
Take Gary Johnson for instance .
The former Republican governor of New Mexico supported the legalization of marijuana in a very public way when he was in office , in fact , he was eager to make it part of his legacy .
He also wanted people to understand that he did n’t just “ experiment ” with the weed : “ In running for office during my first term , I offered up the fact that I smoked marijuana .
And the media was very quick to say , ‘ Oh , so you experimented with marijuana ’
… No , I smoked marijuana .
This is something that I did .
I did it along with a lot of other people .
But me and my buddies , you know …we enjoyed what we were doing , ” said Johnson in 1999 .
Of course , there ’s another high - profile Republican not shying away from telling people marijuana should be legal -- Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul ( R - TX ) who has served in Congress for almost 20 years .
And , heck , he just recently set the GOP ’s one - day fundraising record of $ 4.3 million .
Hmmm , it sure does n’t seem like his supporters are afraid of his marijuana legalization spiel .
George Shultz , former Secretary of State under Ronald Reagan , also wants marijuana legalized .
Almost 20 years ago , he coined an op -ed in the Wall Street Journal to tell people “ ... We need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled legalization of drugs . ”
Another of Reagan ’s most trusted aides , Lyn Nofziger , who also worked for Nixon and shares responsibility for unleashing the Reagan drug war on America , joined Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R - CA ) at a 2002 Capitol Hill press conference to support a federal medical marijuana bill and to push President Bush and other Republicans to get onboard .
“ I 've become an advocate of medical marijuana… It is truly compassionate .
I sincerely hope the administration can get behind this bill , ” he said .
And then there are some of the Republican Party ’s luminaries .
Highly respected and influential ultra-conservatives like William F. Buckley , Jr. and Milton Friedman have called for marijuana legalization at least since Nixon famously visited Beijing , Hangzhou , and Shanghai in 1972 .
I suppose the appropriate question is “ When will the Republicans decide to take the high road to China on this one ? ”
Note :
It is interesting and important to realize that all of the conservatives whose viewpoints on drug policy were discussed above , save Nofziger , go much further than only wanting marijuana to be legal .
In fact , they have either explicitly called for all drugs to be legalized or have strongly alluded to the idea they should be .
The House version of the military bill includes 1,337 earmarks totaling $ 3 billion , the most Congressional earmarks in any of the spending bills passed this year .
A conference committee is now reconciling House and Senate versions .
The Senate added $ 5 billion in earmarks , but it is difficult to determine the sponsors because it has no disclosure rules .
About half of the House military earmarks go to universities , military bases and other public institutions ; the other half to businesses and nonprofits .
For the first time , members submitted written requests for each project and statements attesting that they had no personal financial interests in them .
Previously , earmarks often were inserted anonymously .
The New York Times analysis of earmarks used data compiled by the Washington - based watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense along with campaign contribution and lobbying records .
Democrats consider earmark reform a success , since they have significantly reduced their cost and brought “ disclosure so constituents can see what their members have asked for , ” said Brendan Daly , a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi .
“ That ’s one of the things we wanted to change , to bring more openness . ”
But the House Republican Conference contends that Democrats still use earmarks as a secretive slush fund to reward contributors .
Mr. Murtha has drawn much attention this year , first as he bitterly opposed the legislation requiring disclosure of earmarks , then continued his habit of submitting dozens of requests , most benefiting his hometown of Johnstown , Pa . ( He asked for 47 earmarks . )
Two Republicans said he threatened to block them from getting any earmarks when they questioned one of his requests .
“ You ’re not going to get any , now or forever , ” he warned Representative Mike Rogers , a Michigan Republican who eventually received a written apology from the Pennsylvania congressman .
The Republican Conference chairman , Adam H. Putman of Florida , said Mr. Murtha ’s behavior has been “ like watching a throwback in time . ”
“ He ’s a classic old - bull appropriator , basically showing a level of arrogance in which he breezily dismisses House rules , dismisses public inquiry and defies the spirit of disclosure , ” Mr. Putnam said .
About $ 111 million of Mr. Murtha ’s earmarks are for businesses and nonprofits closely aligned with him .
He recruits defense firms and jobs to his economically depressed district and often pushes earmarks for them .
WASHINGTON -- Falcons quarterback Michael Vick " is not a
victim " and should be held responsible for his actions involving a
dogfighting ring in Virginia , the national president of the NAACP
said Thursday .
" He absolutely must account for what he has done , " Dennis
Courtland Hayes , interim president and CEO of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said in an
interview with The Associated Press .
He had earlier given similar
comments to NBC's " Today " show .
But Hayes cautioned against condemning the Atlanta star too
quickly .
" It 's real clear that Mr. Vick himself would acknowledge that
he has made a mistake , " Hayes said .
" I think there is reason to
believe in his redemption . "
Hayes ' comments came a day after the head of the NAACP 's Atlanta
chapter said Vick should be allowed to return to football after the
case is resolved .
" As a society , we should aid in his rehabilitation and welcome
a new Michael Vick back into the community without a permanent loss
of his career in football , " Atlanta NAACP President R.L.
White
said .
Hayes said
White and others who have come to Vick 's defense are
expressing an overarching frustration with disparities in the
criminal justice system .
" People need to understand the backdrop as some in the
African - American community make their expressions of support , "
Hayes said .
" That backdrop includes anger and distrust with the
criminal justice system that disproportionately pays attention to
African - Americans and Hispanics .
" While no dog deserves to be mistreated , the backdrop includes
the perception among some African - Americans that the criminal
justice system treats them like animals and that nobody seems
willing to do anything about the disparity . "
Hayes , who said the national group did not have an official
position on the case , said he did n't want to speculate about
whether Vick was being treated differently because he is black .
" He may in fact be being treated better than some
African - Americans and Hispanics who do n't have the resources and
financial means that he has , " Hayes said .
" On the other hand ,
there might be some of a different race or different ethnicity who
might be treated a bit differently . "
On Monday , Vick said through a lawyer that he will plead guilty
to a federal charge of conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce
in aid of unlawful activities and conspiracy to sponsor a dog in an
animal fighting venture .
Three Vick associates have pleaded guilty to the conspiracy
charge and say Vick provided virtually all the gambling and
operating funds for the " Bad Newz Kennels " dogfighting
enterprise .
Two of them also said Vick participated in executing at
least eight underperforming dogs , raising the possibility of the
animal cruelty charges .
GreyThumb.blog offers an interesting analogue between research on animal breeding and the fall of Enron .
Before 1995 , the way animal breeding worked was that you would take the top individual performers in each generation and breed from them , or their parents .
A cockerel does n't lay eggs , so you have to observe daughter hens to determine which cockerels to breed .
Sounds logical , right ?
If you take the hens who lay the most eggs in each generation , and breed from them , you should get hens who lay more and more eggs .
Behold the awesome power of making evolution work for you !
The power that made butterflies - now constrained to your own purposes !
And it worked , too .
Per -cow milk output in the US doubled between 1905 and 1965 , and has doubled again since then .
Yet conjuring Azathoth oft has unintended consequences , as some researchers realized in the 1990s .
In the real world , sometimes you have more than animal per farm .
You see the problem , right ?
If you do n't , you should probably think twice before trying to conjure an evolution to serve you - magic is not for the unparanoid .
Selecting the hen who lays the most eggs does n't necessarily get you the most efficient egg - laying metabolism .
It may get you the most dominant hen , that pecked its way to the top of the pecking order at the expense of other hens .
Individual selection does n't necessarily work to the benefit of the group , but a farm 's productivity is determined by group outputs .
Indeed , for some strange reason , the individual breeding programs which had been so successful at increasing egg production now required hens to have their beaks clipped , or be housed in individual cages , or they would peck each other to death .
While the conditions for group selection are only rarely right in Nature , one can readily impose genuine group selection in the laboratory .
After only 6 generations of artificially imposed group selection - breeding from the hens in the best groups , rather than the best individual hens - average days of survival increased from 160 to 348 , and egg mass per bird increased from 5.3 to 13.3 kg .
At 58 weeks of age , the selected line had 20 % mortality compared to the control group at 54 % .
A commercial line of hens , allowed to grow up with unclipped beaks , had 89 % mortality at 58 weeks .
And the fall of Enron ?
Jeff Skilling fancied himself an evolution - conjurer , it seems .
( Not that he , like , knew any evolutionary math or anything . )
Every year , every Enron employee 's performance would be evaluated , and the bottom 10 % would get fired , and the top performers would get huge raises and bonuses .
Unfortunately , as GreyThumb points out :
" Everyone knows that there are many things you can do in any corporate environment to give the appearance and impression of being productive .
Enron 's corporate environment was particularly conducive to this : its principal business was energy trading , and it had large densely populated trading floors peopled by high - powered traders that would sit and play the markets all day .
There were , I 'm sure , many things that a trader could do to up his performance numbers , either by cheating or by gaming the system .
This gaming of the system probably included gaming his fellow traders , many of whom were close enough to rub elbows with .
" So Enron was applying selection at the individual level according to metrics like individual trading performance to a group system whose performance was , like the henhouses , an emergent property of group dynamics as well as a result of individual fitness .
The result was more or less the same .
Instead of increasing overall productivity , they got mean chickens and actual productivity declined .
They were selecting for traits like aggressiveness , sociopathic tendencies , and dishonesty . "
And the moral of the story is :
Be careful when you set forth to conjure the blind idiot god .
People look at a pretty butterfly ( note selectivity ) and think : " Evolution designed them - how pretty - I should get evolution to do things for me , too ! "
But this is qualitative reasoning , as if evolution were either present or absent .
Applying 10 % selection for 10 generations is not going to get you the same amount of cumulative selection pressure as 3.85 billion years of natural selection .
I have previously emphasized that the evolution - of - foxes works at cross-purposes to the evolution - of - rabbits ; there is no unitary Evolution God to praise for every beauty of Nature .
Azathoth has ten million hands .
When you conjure , you do n't get the evolution , the Maker of Butterflies .
You get an evolution , with characteristics and strength that depend on your exact conjuration .
If you just take everything you see in Nature and attribute it to " evolution " , you 'll start thinking that some cute little conjuration which runs for 20 generations will get you artifacts on the order of butterflies .
Try 3.85 billion years .
Same caveat with the wonders of simulated evolution on computers , producing a radio antenna better than a human design , etcetera .
These are sometimes human - competitive ( more often not ) when it comes to optimizing a continuous design over 57 performance criteria , or breeding a design with 57 elements .
Anything beyond that , and modern evolutionary algorithms are defeated by the same exponential explosion that consumes the rest of AI .
Yes , evolutionary algorithms have a legitimate place in AI .
Consult a machine - learning expert , who knows when to use them and when not to .
Even biologically inspired genetic algorithms with sexual mixing , rarely perform better than beam searches and other non-biologically - inspired techniques on the same problem .
And for this weakness , let us all be thankful .
If the blind idiot god did not take a million years in which to do anything complicated , It would be bloody scary .
3.85 billion years of natural selection produced molecular nanotechnology ( cells ) and Artificial General Intelligence ( brains ) , which even we humans are n't going to get for a few more decades .
If there were an alien demideity , morality - and - aesthetics - free , often blindly suicidal , capable of wielding nanotech and AGI in real time , I 'd put aside all other concerns and figure out how to kill it .
Assuming that I had n't already been enslaved beyond all desire of escape .
Look at the trouble we 're having with bacteria , which go through generations fast enough that their evolutions are learning to evade our antibiotics after only a few decades ' respite .
You really do n't want to conjure Azathoth at full power .
You really , really do n't .
You 'll get more than pretty butterflies .
Was man über Brustverkleinerungen wissen sollte
Eine Mamareduktionsplastik , häufig auch Brustverkleinerung genannt , ist ein operativer Eingriff , bei dem eine Volumenreduktion der Brust vorgenommen wird .
Frauen , die unter der Größe ihrer Brust leiden entscheiden sich häufig zu dem , der plastischen Chirurgie zugeordneten Eingriff und gewinnen auf diese Weise mehr Lebensqualität .
Oft spielen auch gesundheitliche Aspekte bei der Entscheidung zu einer Brustverkleinerung mit ein .
Entsprechende Risiken sollten vor dem Eingriff genau abgewogen werden , wobei der Eingriff heute als relativ sicher und komplikationslos gilt .
Mögliche Indikationen
Die hauptsächliche Indikation für eine Brustreduktion ist ein Übermaß an Fettgewebe und Drüsenkörper .
Hierbei geht man von einem
Wert über 500g aus , wobei dies hauptsächlich am Empfinden der Frau festgemacht werden sollte .
Auch eine nach unten gerichtete Mamille in Kombination mit einem gedehnten Hautmantel ist oft ausschlaggebend für den Schritt zur Mammareduktionsplastik .
Bedingt durch eine sehr große Brust können chronische Verspannungen und Schmerzen im Bereich der Brust - und Halswirbelsäule entstehen .
Eine Reduktion des Gesamtgewichtes mindert die Beschwerden und ermöglicht Betroffenen ein schmerzfreies Leben .
Entsprechende Einschränkungen können sich auch bei täglichen Arbeiten im Haushalt , im Beruf oder während des Sports zeigen .
Darüber hinaus werden tief einschneidende BH - Träger als schmerzhaft und störend empfunden .
Neben dem gesundheitlichen Aspekt spielt für viele Frauen vor allem die Ästhetik eine Rolle : Asymmetrische Brüste , eine Brustgröße , die in keiner Relation zu den restlichen Körperproportionen steht und eine insgesamt schlaffe Brust werden von wenigen Frauen angenommen .
Insbesondere nach einer Schwangerschaft und eine , durch das Alter der Patientin bedingte Gewebserschlaffung , ist hierbei ursächlich .
Nicht zuletzt geht mit den entsprechenden Beschwerdebildern eine massive psychische Belastung einher , die die Lebensqualität noch einmal senken kann .
Spätestens an diesem Punkt besteht Behandlungsbedarf , indem eine Brustreduktion vorgenommen oder der seelische Zustand behandelt wird .
Mit einer überdurchschnittlich großen Brust gehen häufig Hohlwarzen einher , wobei die Brustwarzen nach innen gestülpt sind .
Ein zu kurzes Milchgangsystem ist hierbei für die nach innen gerichteten Brustwarzen verantwortlich .
Häufig wird dieses Leiden im Zuge einer Brustreduktion behoben , wobei hierbei die Milchgänge durchtrennt oder die verantwortlichen Bindegewebsfasern gelöst werden .
Letzteres gilt als schonendere Methode , da die Patientin nach dem Lösen der Bindegewebsfasern nach wie vor problemlos stillen könnte .
Bei einer Durchtrennung der Milchgänge ist dies hingegen nicht mehr möglich .
Zusammenfassend lässt sich also sagen , dass zum einen Fett - und Drüsenanteile verkleinert werden , zum anderen der Hautüberschuss reduziert wird .
Infolgedessen erfolgt eine Anhebung der Mamilla .
Hierbei wird vor allem Narben sparend vorgegangen und eine ausreichende Blutversorgung des sogenannten Mamillen - Areolen - Komplexes gewährleistet .
Methoden einer Brustreduktion
Heute gibt es zahlreiche Verfahren , die zur Brustreduktion eingesetzt werden und vor allem in Sachen Schnittführung zu unterscheiden sind .
Vor allem der L - Schnitt , das Benelli - Verfahren , die Strömbeck - Methode und eine Narben sparende Methode nach Lejour haben sich bewährt .
Die Vielzahl an Operationsmethoden liegt den unterschiedlichen Brustformen und - größen zugrunde .
Auch die Verteilung des Fett - und Drüsengewebes und die Größe und Position der Brustwarzen müssen hierbei berücksichtigt werden .
Zu guter Letzt spielt auch die Erwartung der Patientin eine Rolle , die zuvor mit dem plastischen Chirurgen eine Idee des bestmöglichen Ergebnisses entwickelt .
Bei einer einfachen Volumenverkleinerung geringen Ausmaßes in Kombination mit wenig Hautüberschuss reicht bereits ein einzelner Schnitt rund um die Brustwarze herum und ein weiterer senkrecht nach unten aus .
Ein zusätzlicher Schnitt kann bei starken Verkleinerungen an der unteren Brustfalte erfolgen .
In der Regel wird eine Mammareduktionsplastik stationär durchgeführt und nimmt zwischen zweieinhalb und vier Stunden in Anspruch .
Risiken und Nachwirkungen
Grundregel ist , dass das Risiko bei einer Mammareduktionsplastik mit der Menge an zu entfernendem Gewebe steigt .
Zu den gesundheitlichen Risiken und Spätfolgen zählen Wundheilungsstörungen und nicht nachlassende Sensibilitätsstörungen im Bereich der Mamilla .
Letzteres liegt bei dem Eingriff geschädigten Nerven zugrunde , was dazu führt , dass in der Brustwarze kein Gefühl mehr wahrgenommen wird .
Insbesondere das Sexleben betroffener Patientinnen kann hierdurch beeinträchtigt werden .
Bei einer Verletzung der Mamilla kann darüber hinaus die Stillfähigkeit völlig oder stark beeinträchtigt werden .
In dramatischen und vergleichsweise seltenen Fällen liegt eine Durchblutungsstörung vor , die mit einem kompletten Absterben der Mamilla einhergeht .
Wundheilungsstörungen führen zu einer verzögerten Abheilung , was gleichzeitig die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Entzündungen und Infektionen steigert .
Hinzu kommen allgemeine OP - Risiken , die bis zum Exitus reichen können .
Die Entstehung von Thrombosen und Embolien gehört hierbei zu den seltenen aber maßgeblichen Komplikationen .
Neben den gesundheitlichen Risiken liegen vor allem welche im Bereich der Ästhetik vor , die gleichzeitig prozentual am häufigsten vorkommen .
Unterschiedlich hoch platzierte und schielende Brustwarzen und asymmetrische Brüste stellen in diesem Bereich die häufigsten Komplikationen dar .
Direkt nach der Operation muss mit entsprechenden Nachwirkungen gerechnet werden , zu denen vor allem Wundschmerzen zählen , die in der Regel nach wenigen Tagen nachlassen .
Schmerzmittel und das Tragen eines Kompressionsverbandes wirken in der Heilungsphase unterstützend .
Über diese Phase hinaus gehören für Patientinnen Spannungsgefühle und eine hohe Empfindlichkeit der Brust zum Alltag , wobei auch diese Beschwerden nach einigen Wochen komplett nachlassen .
Auch Schwellungen , Nachblutungen und Blutergüsse gehören zu den Nachwirkungen einer Mammareduktionsplastik .
Haltbarkeit
Das Ergebnis an sich verfügt über kein Ablaufdatum , allerdings muss beachtet werden , dass die weibliche Brust auch nach einer Verkleinerung und Straffung dem natürlichen Alterungsprozess unterliegt .
Somit senkt sich auch eine verkleinerte Brust mit den Jahren und verliert an Straffheit und jugendlichem Aussehen .
In der Regel fällt dies aber deutlich schwächer aus als vor dem Eingriff , da eine kleinere Brust auch generell weniger dazu neigt abzusacken .
Auch eine Gewichtszunahme und damit einhergehende Vergrößerung der Brust und eine Schwangerschaft können das Ergebnis des Eingriffes beeinflussen .
Generell gilt aber , dass eine kleine Brust nicht nur über Jahre formstabiler ist , sondern ein hohes Brustwachstum im höheren Alter vergleichsweise selten ist .
Somit ist mit leichten Veränderungen zu rechnen , diese fallen in der Regel aber so gering aus , dass die Brust auch nach leichten Veränderungen in ästhetischer Hinsicht dem Zustand vor dem Eingriff überlegen ist .
Nach einem positiven Ergebnis können Patientinnen in der Regel auf einen BH verzichten , da die Brust nicht nur kleiner , sondern auch straffer als zuvor ist .
Kostenübernahme durch Krankenkassen
Nur in besonderen Fällen übernehmen die Krankenkassen die anfallenden Kosten für eine Brustreduktion .
Mindestens fünfhundert Gramm Fett- , Haut - und Drüsengewebe müssen hierbei entfernt werden .
Auch seelische und körperliche Folgeschäden , die durch eine große Brust auftreten können , finden hierbei Berücksichtigung .
Leidet die Patientin unter der Größe ihrer Brust , etwa durch damit einhergehende Rückenschmerzen oder psychischen Schmerz , übernimmt die Krankenkasse in Einzelfällen die Kosten .
Wichtig ist auch , dass kein Übergewicht vorliegt , da die Brustgröße in diesem Fall bereits durch eine Gewichtsabnahme reduziert werden kann .
Entsprechende Atteste und Bescheinigungen des behandelnden Arztes sind Grundlage , um der Krankenkasse entsprechende Voraussetzungen nachzuweisen und einen Antrag stellen zu können .
In the muted light of the maternity ward , photographer Sandy Puc’ works steadily , composing portraits of David .
She focuses on his tiny toes , his curled fists , his mother gently stroking his cheek .
“ I think I got everything , ” she says at last .
Then she turns with her Canon .
“ If you want to put your lips right on the top of his head ? ” she asks David ’s father .
“ There .
That ’s beautiful . ”
There is always a final kiss to capture .
David was stillborn early this morning , without kidneys or working lungs .
His parents , Gina and Rob Harris , will take home his plastic hospital bracelet and his blue blanket , embroidered with stars .
They will try to hold onto their memories , but those will blur , and they will turn to these portraits : Gina nuzzling David ’s hair , so dark and curly , just like his dad’s .
Rob bending to dress his son .
Sandy knows what the pictures will mean ; that ’s why she has come and stayed all night .
A photographer who teaches portraiture worldwide , she also runs a volunteer network dedicated to photographing dead and dying infants .
Many hospitals offer bereavement photography when a newborn dies ; typically , a nurse will snap a few pictures and package them into a memory box , along with a lock of the baby ’s hair , a plaster cast of her hands and inked footprints .
For some families , that ’s enough , or too much .
But many parents want more .
Scores of calls each week come into Sandy ’s nonprofit network of more than 3,000 professional photographers from all 50 states .
The photographers donate their time and work , leaving each family with dozens of images :
A girl leaning in to kiss her brother .
A mother cupping premature twins in her hands .
A father holding his baby girl against his shoulder for one last dance .
The first time she was asked to photograph a dead baby , Sandy wanted to say no .
A couple she ’d never met , Mike and Cheryl Haggard , had called her portrait studio to ask that she photograph their failing newborn , Maddux .
A mother of four , Sandy , 37 , had spent a year in the hospital with her youngest son , who suffered from a breathing disorder at birth .
“ I could n’t let a parent in that situation down , ” she said .
When she got to the hospital , Mike and Cheryl told her they planned to disconnect Maddux from life support .
They would hold their son until he died .
Then the Haggards would bring in Sandy to take his portrait .
“ I felt like a wrecking ball hit me , ” Sandy said .
She was n’t sure she could hold herself together .
An hour later , a nurse called her to the Haggards ’ room .
Sandy entered to see Cheryl holding Maddux to her chest , skin to skin , grieving , but at peace .
Focusing through eyes blurred with tears , Sandy took frame after frame .
“ Do you know what you ’ve given me ? ” Cheryl asked her later , when she ’d seen the portraits .
“ You ’ve given me my son . ”
Cheryl , a stay - at - home mom , and Mike , who runs a business removing dents from cars , had taken a few pictures of their son during his six days of life .
Those images , Cheryl said , are raw .
They show Maddux ’s yellowish skin tone , and the wires that snaked around him as doctors fought to keep him alive despite an underdeveloped brain .
“ They ’re not pictures I go back and look at often , ” Cheryl said .
“ Those photos are reality .
I do n’t need reality .
I ’ve lived it . ”
Sandy and the other volunteers retouch their portraits to smooth skin tone and hide bruises , though they will not airbrush out deformities .
Their portraits , in black and white , are soft and luminous , elegiac .
The infants look as though they are sleeping .
On the network ’s website , parents say that approach helps them remember their children the way they want to remember them : “ Like the angelic babies that they are , ” one mother wrote .
“ Perfect in our minds , ” another said .
Sandy ’s portraits of Maddux , who died Feb. 10 , 2005 , hang in the Haggards ’ house , alongside framed photos of his three siblings .
“ He has a place in our family , ” Cheryl said , “ now and always . ”
Three weeks after Maddux died , Sandy got a call from one of her longtime clients , pleading with her to photograph a newborn nephew in critical condition .
Sandy took the pictures but the baby was tethered to tubes and IVs ; he looked frail and alone .
She did n’t know how to tell the parents that she could take more tender portraits after he died .
“ I felt like I was cheating them , ” she said .
She talked about the experience with Cheryl , who had become a friend .
Both decided they wanted to find a way to spread the word about bereavement photography .
Sandy already did charity work , holding regular events at her studio to benefit Children ’s Hospital , but this felt like a more personal way to give .
In April 2005 , two months after Maddux ’s death , she and Cheryl launched a nonprofit .
They called it “ Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep , ” after Cheryl ’s favorite bedtime prayer .
Sandy took her pictures of Maddux to hospitals across Denver .
The calls began coming at once .
She remembers a blur of sweet faces , and the babies ’ names : Daniel , George , Giselle , Maria , Michael , Samantha , Faith , Heaven , Hope .
After six calls in one two - day period , Sandy realized she could n’t do it all alone .
She began recruiting professional photographers at the portraiture seminars she teaches nearly every weekend .
As the network took off , she sent brochures to hospitals in every major city and promoted the service at medical conferences .
Sandy worries , sometimes , that her photography sessions have become too routine .
“ I do n’t want to become calloused , ” she said .
That first time , with Maddux , she took every angle she could imagine , so she would n’t miss a shot his parents might cherish .
Now , she knows which poses work best ; she can wrap up a session in 15 minutes , though if the family is comfortable , she may spend longer .
She no longer grieves over each baby .
“ But sometimes , ” Sandy says , “ it just hits you . ”
One recent morning , she was in her studio taking portraits of a chubby 6 - month - old .
The little girl was gurgling , playing with her toes , and Sandy thought of the still , silent babies she has photographed .
She had to put down her camera .
Sandy found photography by chance :
She was 17 and working as a nanny , and the parents asked her to take snapshots of their kids .
To her surprise , she was so good at it that her employers ’ friends began hiring her to take portraits of their children .
Over the years , Sandy married and raised her own children , and continued to take portraits for fun .
After their youngest was born , her husband , Edward , a chef , told her he would take a turn at home so she could build her hobby into a career .
Eight years later , Expressions Photography occupies a 20,000 - square - foot studio in the Denver suburb of Littleton .
Sandy employs a staff of 26 ; assistants hold her strobe light and arrange props when she shoots .
On a warm October afternoon two months before their due date , Gina and Rob Harris arrived at the studio , looking dazed as they took in the baroque decor : gold walls , maroon drapes , portraits everywhere , in ornate gilded frames .
“ I ’m a nervous model , ” Gina said , staying close to her husband .
A mid-pregnancy ultrasound had revealed a fatal kidney disorder in David , their first child .
Gina ’s doctor recommended abortion .
She remembers her response : “ I believe in a God bigger than that . ”
“ We want the opportunity to hold our baby , ” said Gina , 32 , who runs an abstinence education program .
“ He ’ll have a face and a name instead of being a ‘ what if . . . , ’ ” said Rob , 35 , who coaches football at a Christian high school .
A friend told the couple about Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep .
Rob could n’t look at the photos on the website .
But Gina studied them , and decided to call .
When Sandy suggested she come in for a free maternity shoot -- glamorous shots of her rounded belly -- Gina was hesitant , but she agreed .
She ’d have David for such a short time , she felt she should preserve every memory .
A whirl of energy who favors black clothes and burgundy toenail polish , Sandy ushered the Harrises into her studio , cluttered with props : silk flowers , a rocking horse , a blue velvet couch , satin angel wings , a fake fireplace .
“ We ’re going to have a little fun with this , ” she said .
She positioned Gina against a white backdrop .
“ You ’re going to go tummy - to - tummy , ” she instructed Rob .
“ Do we smile ? ” Gina asked anxiously .
“ In this situation , we want to keep it nice and soft , ” Sandy said .
“ Look down toward your tummy .
Chin out . . . that ’s beautiful . ”
Three weeks later , on Oct. 24 , Sandy got a late - night call .
Gina had gone into labor .
By 11:30 p.m. , the photographer and her assistants had arrived at Exempla Saint Joseph Hospital in downtown Denver .
Gina asked that they photograph David as soon as he was born because he was expected to live only a few minutes .
Sandy promised to be ready .
Then her team retreated to a conference room .
They organized their 2008 appointment books .
They played a few desultory games of tick - tack - toe .
By 2:15 a.m. , Sandy had given up trying to stay awake .
She stretched out on the floor , her leather jacket wrapped around her , a “ Law and Order ” rerun on TV .
An hour later , a nurse woke her to say Gina was about to deliver .
Standing in the hall outside Room 10 , waiting , Sandy and associate photographer Helen Noakes talked about their hospital calls , remembering other babies who did n’t go home .
“ She was just beautiful , perfect in every way , ” Sandy said , her voice low .
“ Her parents put her in a yellow dress , ” Helen said .
“ I remember that yellow dress . ”
It was nearly 4 a .m. when a nurse came out to tell them David had been stillborn .
His parents were taking some time alone with him .
Twenty minutes later , the nurse beckoned the photographers to begin .
Helen held the strobe light while Sandy circled the hospital bed , taking pictures .
The camera sounded loud in the hush , but Gina barely glanced up .
“ So cute , ” she whispered , kissing her son .
“ Look at his cheeks . ”
A nurse leaned in to gently close the baby ’s open mouth .
“ Can I get a picture of his backside ? ”
Sandy asked , and the nurse helped position David on his stomach , curled up in the blue blanket .
Drawing on the bond she felt with Gina after the maternity session , Sandy worked for nearly an hour , taking more than 150 images of David .
“ Beautiful , ” she kept saying .
“ He ’s beautiful . ”
Dawn was breaking when Sandy packed up her camera .
She ’d have to head to the studio soon ; the day was booked solid with families requesting holiday portraits .
She ’d be making a lot of little kids giggle .
But she ’d have to find time , too , to edit her images of David .
She wanted Gina and Rob to have those portraits before they buried their son .

Remaining Questions about HAppS
This is a list of questions I need answered about HAppS ’ MACID monad before I can decide to use it for a large - scale application .
It ’s a long list , but I do n’t mean to imply that the answers are bad ; indeed , I ’m hopeful they will turn out okay .
I ’m making the list in the hopes someone can point me in the right directions , as just reading the source code is slow going so far !
Is it feasible ( even by extending the HAppS framework , if needed ) to load balance a HAppS application across multiple servers ?
I ’ve got performance problems already with the old version of this application ; I ’m hopeful that many of them can be solved by dropping this Java object - relational mapper – which generates SQL that I never see – with Haskell code for which I can use smart data structures and algorithms and fix the problems .
Still , the hope is that more people use this in the future , and I ’d hate to permanently give up the option of clustering or load balancing .
Although it would n’t be immediately needed , it remains worthwhile to have the choice .
Is it feasible ( even by extending the HAppS framework , if needed ) to have HAppS store only part of its data at a time in memory ?
While servers are getting more and more powerful over time , applications are using more and more data as well .
The data backup files for the application I ’ve currently porting to Haskell are 9 GB in size , after compression .
I ’m hoping that this increases over time .
While most of this data could potentially be moved into auxiliary files outside of the HAppS MACID monad , it ’s still a little questionable whether I ’d want to limit the data to the size of the server ’s RAM .
The web site says that everything has to fit in RAM ; but I do n’t know if that ’s because of something fundamental about the way the system works , or just because that ’s what is implemented today .
The talk of moving to S3 and EC2 seems to indicate the latter ( more promising ) state of affairs .
Is it feasible ( even by extending the HAppS framework , if needed ) to tie HAppS ’ MACID transactions to transactions in external information systems via a two - phase commit protocol ?
One of the key goals of the software I ’m developing is integrating with other systems seamlessly , and that likely means allowing changes to HAppS - controlled data to participate in a distributed transaction .
When I change the data structures for a HAppS application , it fails to load with the old state .
Is there an easy technique for migrating data when one needs to change the data tracked by the application ?
What is the best way to manage ( i.e. , interactively query and update ) live data from a HAppS application outside of the pre-planned application functions ?
For example , if I ’m asked by my boss how many people with a first name of Tiffany have used the application after midnight since 17 days ago , I can currently throw together some SQL and find out .
Now , can I throw together some Haskell and find out ?
How would I do that ?
The only thing that comes to mind is something like lambdabot , which uses hs - plugins to compile and then dynamically load some code and run it .
I can do this , but it ’s a little odd and it seems like there ’s be an easy answer to this .
The group , most often referred to as RAM , has sent health expeditions to countries like Guyana , India , Tanzania and Haiti , but increasingly its work is in the United States , where 47 million people — more than 15 percent of the population — live without health insurance .
Residents of remote rural areas are less likely than their urban and suburban counterparts to have health insurance and more likely to be in fair or poor health .
According to the Department of Health and Human Services , nearly half of all adults in rural America are living with at least one chronic condition .
Other research has found that in these areas , where hospitals and primary - care providers are in short supply , rates of arthritis , hypertension , heart ailments , diabetes and major depression are higher than in urban areas .
And so each summer , shortly after the Virginia - Kentucky District Fair and Horse Show wraps up at the fairgrounds , members of Virginia Lions Clubs start bleaching the premises , readying them for RAM ’s volunteers , who , working in animal stalls and beneath makeshift tents , provide everything from teeth cleaning and free eyeglasses to radiology and minor surgery .
The problem , says RAM ’s founder , Stan Brock , is always in the numbers , with the patients ’ needs far outstripping what his team can supply .
In Wise County , when the sun rose and the fairground gates opened at 5:30 on Friday morning , more than 800 people already were waiting in line .
Over the next three days , some 2,500 patients would receive care , but at least several hundred , Brock estimates , would be turned away .
He adds : “ There comes a point where the doctors say : ‘ Hey , I gotta go .
It ’s Sunday evening , and I have to go to work tomorrow . ’ ”

Hundreds of our genes turn on just one copy , rather than both .
The random switching off of gene copies could create extra genetic variation between identical twins .
Getty
The textbook rule that says activated human genes almost always express both of their copies — the one inherited from mum and that inherited from dad — seems not to be true .
Instead , a good chunk of our genome could prefer the ' single life ' , according to new research .
Whether the maternal or paternal copy gets switched on in such cases seems to be random .
But the result could have a big impact on disease susceptibility and other biological traits .
It had been thought that there are only a handful of situations in which just one of a pair of gene copies is used .
But a new screen of 4,000 human genes has uncovered 371 that sometimes play favourites , suggesting that this phenomenon is far more pervasive than had been thought .
“ What we ’ve shown violates general rules about what we think about genes : if a gene is turned on you express both the maternal and paternal copy , ” says Andrew Chess , a biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , who led the study along with colleague Alexander Gimelbrant .
This kind of selective gene expression could create an extra source of variation between people , even when some of their genes are identical .
“ I like the idea that we 're all mosaics , and this might contribute to differences , ” says Steve Henikoff , a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington .
Coalition of the expressed
Researchers have long known that some cells express just one version of certain genes , but this is for a specific purpose .
Females have two X chromosomes but always shut down one copy , for example , to prevent making a double dose of some gene products .
Immune cells designed to recognize the fingerprint of a specific disease turn off one set of immunoglobulin genes to optimize their specialist behaviour .
And during development , embryos chemically flag one parent ’s version of a set of known genes for silencing .
This handful of instances accounts for hundreds of genes known to turn off a copy in a controlled way .
To hunt for more genes that behave similarly , Chess and Gimelbrant planted single human immune cells in dishes , and let the cells multiply .
They analysed the millions of cell copies using a gene chip to distinguish between the maternal and paternal version of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) produced by 3,939 genes .
They found that about 9 % of the genes sometimes turned on just one copy .
They publish their findings today in Science1 .
Even though the cells were all genetically identical , some turned on maternal versions , some paternal , and others activated both .
" Even identical twins would make different choices , " says Gimelbrant .
The team noticed a similar pattern in a much smaller subset of genes that they examined from specimens of donated human placenta and white blood cells .
“ This is not something weird that happens only in cell culture , ” says Chess .
Nor does it happen only in immune cells , although the researchers ' further work on other cell types has not yet been published .
Sloppy genome
These differences could potentially help an organism to regulate gene expression and affect disease risk .
Higher expression of a gene called APP is linked to early onset of Alzheimer ’s disease , for example .
And Chess ’s team found that cells in which just one copy of APP was turned on made about half as much mRNA as the cells with both copies turned on .
At this point , the connection to Alzheimer ’s remains speculative , he says .
The random gene inactivation that Chess 's team has found could be a spillover from more controlled forms of silencing , such as shutting down an X chromosome , says Huntington Willard , a geneticist at Duke University in Durham , North Carolina .
" I tend not to think of it as some grand evolutionary plan , but simply as the sloppiness of gene regulation . "
ADVERTISEMENT
Chess does n’t know just when cells switch off a gene copy , but he suspects it happens during development .
Unanswered , too , is how the cells turn off one copy while keeping the second copy active .
Chess ’s lab is now digging into this question .
The team next plans to survey the rest of humanity 's 20,000 genes for signs of similar deactivation .
If his team ’s sample is representative of the whole genome , more than 1,000 genes should sometimes go it alone .
When I was a kid , my class would have to write cards to soldiers in Vietnam during the holidays , our teachers reminding us that these men and women were far from home and all the comforts of the holidays .
I remember hearing how much it meant to the troops to get these little packages with childish scrawls and pictures , along with the socks and chocolate and other treats we would send along to bring them a little bit of home in the Vietnamese jungle .
Maybe that 's why this seems so simultaneously poignant and pathetic .
Hundreds of thousands of holiday cards and letters thanking wounded American troops for their sacrifice and wishing them well never reach their destination .
They are returned to sender or thrown away unopened .
Since the Sept. 11 attacks and the anthrax scare , the Pentagon and the Postal Service have refused to deliver mail addressed simply to " Any Wounded Soldier " for fear terrorists or opponents of the war might send toxic substances or demoralizing messages .[..]
USO spokesman John Hanson said that like the military , the nonprofit service organization does not deliver unopened mail to unspecified recipients .
He said the USO worries about security as well as hateful messages from war critics .
" We just want to make sure it 's not , ` Die , baby killer , ' " he said .
" There are people out there who act irrationally , and we do n't want anyone to get a message that would be discouraging . "
That 's right ... you can put your life on the line , but we think you 're too delicate for bad words on a card ... as if people who are against the war are calling the troops baby killers .
It 's a disgusting slur on both the troops and those of us who want them out of harm 's way .

Life , the Universe , and Everything : An Interview with Douglas Adams
by David Silverman from American Atheists
First , a note about me .
I ’m a very conceited person .
I see myself as a damn good writer who is quite eloquent and proficient at making points about Atheism and related issues .
Fortunately for the rest of the population , there are some people out there who keep my ego in check .
Every once in a while I am reminded of my limitations by certain individuals who so obviously surpass my abilities that I am forced to admit that I still have lots of work to do .
Many of these people are part of American Atheists , and all serve the purpose of making the rest of me strive for self - improvement .
Then there are people like Douglas Adams : talented writers so brilliant in their prose as to give even the most conceited writer - wannabe an inferiority complex .
Many of these people are Atheists , but few will take the time for an interview for their fans .
When they do , well , the result is something you save for future debates and arguments .
For the rare reader who does not already know all about him , Douglas Adams is the creator of all the various manifestations of The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy , which include a radio series , a TV series , a stage play , record albums , a computer game , a series of internationally best - selling books , a set of graphic novels , and a bath towel .
In a long and varied career Mr. Adams has also written the Dirk Gently novels , a non-fiction book ( Last Chance to See ) on endangered species , worked as a chicken - shed cleaner , a bodyguard for an Arab royal family , and played guitar for Pink Floyd .
He ’s brilliant , he ’s witty , he ’s an Atheist , and he has quite a bit to say about Atheism , Agnosticism , and religion .
THE INTERVIEW
AMERICAN ATHEISTS : Mr. Adams , you have been described as a “ radical Atheist . ”
Is this accurate ?
DNA : Yes .
I think I use the term radical rather loosely , just for emphasis .
If you describe yourself as “ Atheist , ” some people will say , “ Do n’t you mean ‘ Agnostic ’ ? ” I have to reply that I really do mean Atheist .
I really do not believe that there is a god - in fact I am convinced that there is not a god ( a subtle difference ) .
I see not a shred of evidence to suggest that there is one .
It ’s easier to say that I am a radical Atheist , just to signal that I really mean it , have thought about it a great deal , and that it ’s an opinion I hold seriously .
It ’s funny how many people are genuinely surprised to hear a view expressed so strongly .
In England we seem to have drifted from vague wishy - washy Anglicanism to vague wishy - washy Agnosticism - both of which I think betoken a desire not to have to think about things too much .
People will then often say “ But surely it ’s better to remain an Agnostic just in case ? ”
This , to me , suggests such a level of silliness and muddle that I usually edge out of the conversation rather than get sucked into it .
( If it turns out that I ’ve been wrong all along , and there is in fact a god , and if it further turned out that this kind of legalistic , cross - your - fingers - behind - your - back , Clintonian hair - splitting impressed him , then I think I would chose not to worship him anyway . )
Other people will ask how I can possibly claim to know ?
Is n’t belief - that - there - is - not - a - god as irrational , arrogant , etc. , as belief - that - there - is - a - god ?
To which I say no for several reasons .
First of all I do not believe - that - there - is - not - a - god .
I do n’t see what belief has got to do with it .
I believe or do n’t believe my four - year old daughter when she tells me that she did n’t make that mess on the floor .
I believe in justice and fair play ( though I do n’t know exactly how we achieve them , other than by continually trying against all possible odds of success ) .
I also believe that England should enter the European Monetary Union .
I am not remotely enough of an economist to argue the issue vigorously with someone who is , but what little I do know , reinforced with a hefty dollop of gut feeling , strongly suggests to me that it ’s the right course .
I could very easily turn out to be wrong , and I know that .
These seem to me to be legitimate uses for the word believe .
As a carapace for the protection of irrational notions from legitimate questions , however , I think that the word has a lot of mischief to answer for .
So , I do not believe - that - there - is - no - god .
I am , however , convinced that there is no god , which is a totally different stance and takes me on to my second reason .
I do n’t accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view .
My view is that the moon is made of rock .
If someone says to me “ Well , you have n’t been there , have you ?
You have n’t seen it for yourself , so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid ” - then I can’t even be bothered to argue .
There is such a thing as the burden of proof , and in the case of god , as in the case of the composition of the moon , this has shifted radically .
God used to be the best explanation we ’d got , and we ’ve now got vastly better ones .
God is no longer an explanation of anything , but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining .
So I do n’t think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is .
I do n’t think the matter calls for even - handedness at all .
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
How long have you been a nonbeliever , and what brought you to that realization ?
DNA : Well , it ’s a rather corny story .
As a teenager I was a committed Christian .
It was in my background .
I used to work for the school chapel in fact .
Then one day when I was about eighteen I was walking down the street when I heard a street evangelist and , dutifully , stopped to listen .
As I listened it began to be borne in on me that he was talking complete nonsense , and that I had better have a bit of a think about it .
I ’ve put that a bit glibly .
When I say I realized he was talking nonsense , what I mean is this .
In the years I ’d spent learning History , Physics , Latin , Math , I ’d learnt ( the hard way ) something about standards of argument , standards of proof , standards of logic , etc .
In fact we had just been learning how to spot the different types of logical fallacy , and it suddenly became apparent to me that these standards simply did n’t seem to apply in religious matters .
In religious education we were asked to listen respectfully to arguments which , if they had been put forward in support of a view of , say , why the Corn Laws came to be abolished when they were , would have been laughed at as silly and childish and - in terms of logic and proof - just plain wrong .
Why was this ?
Well , in history , even though the understanding of events , of cause and effect , is a matter of interpretation , and even though interpretation is in many ways a matter of opinion , nevertheless those opinions and interpretations are honed to within an inch of their lives in the withering crossfire of argument and counterargument , and those that are still standing are then subjected to a whole new round of challenges of fact and logic from the next generation of historians - and so on .
All opinions are not equal .
Some are a very great more robust , sophisticated and well supported in logic and argument than others .
So , I was already familiar with and ( I ’m afraid ) accepting of , the view that you could n’t apply the logic of physics to religion , that they were dealing with different types of ‘ truth ’ .
( I now think this is baloney , but to continue ... )
What astonished me , however , was the realization that the arguments in favor of religious ideas were so feeble and silly next to the robust arguments of something as interpretative and opinionated as history .
In fact they were embarrassingly childish .
They were never subject to the kind of outright challenge which was the normal stock in trade of any other area of intellectual endeavor whatsoever .
Why not ?
Because they would n’t stand up to it .
So I became an Agnostic .
And I thought and thought and thought .
But I just did not have enough to go on , so I did n’t really come to any resolution .
I was extremely doubtful about the idea of god , but I just did n’t know enough about anything to have a good working model of any other explanation for , well , life , the universe and everything to put in its place .
But I kept at it , and I kept reading and I kept thinking .
Sometime around my early thirties I stumbled upon evolutionary biology , particularly in the form of Richard Dawkins ’s books The Selfish Gene and then The Blind Watchmaker and suddenly ( on , I think the second reading of The Selfish Gene ) it all fell into place .
It was a concept of such stunning simplicity , but it gave rise , naturally , to all of the infinite and baffling complexity of life .
The awe it inspired in me made the awe that people talk about in respect of religious experience seem , frankly , silly beside it .
I 'd take the awe of understanding over the awe of ignorance any day .
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
You allude to your Atheism in your speech to your fans ( “ ... that was one of the few times I actually believed in god ” ) .
Is your Atheism common knowledge among your fans , friends , and coworkers ?
Are many people in your circle of friends and coworkers Atheists as well ?
DNA : This is a slightly puzzling question to me , and I think there is a cultural difference involved .
In England there is no big deal about being an Atheist .
There ’s just a slight twinge of discomfort about people strongly expressing a particular point of view when maybe a detached wishy - washiness might be felt to be more appropriate - hence a preference for Agnosticism over Atheism .
And making the move from Agnosticism to Atheism takes , I think , much more commitment to intellectual effort than most people are ready to put in .
But there ’s no big deal about it .
A number of the people I know and meet are scientists and in those circles Atheism is the norm .
I would guess that most people I know otherwise are Agnostics , and quite a few Atheists .
If I was to try and look amongst my friends , family , and colleagues for people who believed there was a god I ’d probably be looking amongst the older , and ( to be perfectly frank ) less well educated ones .
There are one or two exceptions .
( I nearly put , by habit “ honorable exceptions , ” but I do n't really think that . )
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
How often have fans , friends , or coworkers tried to “ save ” you from Atheism ?
DNA : Absolutely never .
We just do n’t have that kind of fundamentalism in England .
Well , maybe that ’s not absolutely true .
But ( and I ’m going to be horribly arrogant here ) I guess I just tend not to come across such people , just as I tend not to come across people who watch daytime soaps or read the National Enquirer .
And how do you usually respond ?
I would n’t bother .
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
Have you faced any obstacles in your professional life because of your Atheism ( bigotry against Atheists ) , and how did you handle it ?
How often does this happen ?
DNA : Not even remotely .
It ’s an inconceivable idea .
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
There are quite a few lighthearted references to god and religion in your books ( “...2000 years after some guy got nailed to a tree ” ) .
How has your Atheism influenced your writing ?
Where ( in which characters or situations ) are your personal religious thoughts most accurately reflected .
DNA : I am fascinated by religion .
( That ’s a completely different thing from believing in it ! )
It has had such an incalculably huge effect on human affairs .
What is it ?
What does it represent ?
Why have we invented it ?
How does it keep going ?
What will become of it ?
I love to keep poking and prodding at it .
I ’ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing .
AMERICAN ATHEISTS :
What message would you like to send to your Atheist fans ?
DNA : Hello !
How are you ?
Norman Mailer , the greatest literary conscience of our time , passed away this morning .
Here he is in one of his most dynamic interviews :
Norman Mailer on democracy :
Democracy is a grace .
Democracy is something essentially splendid because it 's not at all routine or automatic .
Democracy in fact depends on the concept , the notion that there are more people who are good than bad .
And that 's a very large notion .
Norman Mailer on the right wing
And the right wing -- the right wing which is perfectly willing for the most part to give up the joys of intelligence , to give up the joys of free thinking , the joys of following your thoughts to where it leads .
Here 's the entire interview , where Norman talks about Iraq , Neo Cons , violence , and existential fear .

If your girlfriend does n’t make you feel good about yourself and bring joy to your life , fire her .
That ’s what girlfriends are for .
20 .
Do n’t bother with “ emotional affairs . ”
They are just a vehicle for women to flirt and have someone make them feel good about themselves .
That ’s the part of a relationship they want .
For you it is a lot of work and investment in time .
If they are having an emotional affair with you , they ’re probably fucking someone else .
21 .
Becoming a woman ’s friend and confidant is not going to get you into an intimate relationship .
If you have n’t gotten the girl within a reasonably short period of time , chances are you wo n’t ever get her .
She ’ll end up confiding to you about the sexual adventures she ’s having with someone else .
22 . Have and nurture friendships with women .

You ’re going to see some girl and feel like you ’ll die if you do n’t get her .
If she rejects you , move on to the next one .
It ’s her loss .

Do n’t be an internet troll .
Got out and live life .
There is not a cadre of beautiful women advertising on Craigslist to have NSA sex with you .
Beautiful women do n’t need to advertise .
The websites that advertise with attractive women ’s photos and claims of loneliness are baloney .
All they want is your money and your personal information so that they can market to you .
The posts on Craigslist by young “ women ” seeking NSA sex , and asking for a picture are just a bunch of gay troll pic collectors .
This is especially true if the post uses common gay lexicon like “ hole ” as in “ fuck my hole ” or seeks “ masculine ” men , or uses the word cock ( except in the context of “ Do n’t send a cock shot . ” )
There are women on Craigslist .
They are easily recognizable by their 2 - 5 paragraph postings .
Most are in their 30's or older .

When you become a man in full , know that people will get in your way .
People who are attracted to you will somehow manage to step in your path .
Gay guys will give you “ the look . ”
Old people will somehow stumble in front of you at the worst time .
Do n’t get frustrated .
Just step aside and go about your business .
Know that these are passive aggressive methods to get you to acknowledge their existence .
26 .
Do n’t gay bash .
Do n’t mentally or physically abuse people because of who they are , or how they present themselves .
It ’s none of your business to try to intimidate people into conformity .
27 .
If your gay , admit it to yourself , your parents , your friends and society at large .
Be prepared to get harassed .
See rule 14 .
If someone threatens you or assaults you , call the cops .
Have them arrested .
You have no obligation to self sacrifice because of who you are .
As a gay person , you ’ll have more social freedom than straight men .
Use it to protect yourself .
Be prepared to get out of Dodge if your orientation makes your life unbearable .
Move to San Francisco , New York , Atlanta , or New Orleans .
You ’ll find a welcoming community there .

Do n’t believe the crap about the patriarchy .
More women are accepted and attend college .
More degrees are awarded to women than men .
Women outlive men .
More men commit suicide .
Men are twice as likely to be victims of violence , including murder .
If you consider sexual assaults in prisons , twice as many men are raped as women ( society thinks prison rape is funny ) .
The streets are littered with homeless men , sprinkled with a few homeless women .
Statically , women are happier than men .
The myth that girls are being cheated by are educational system is belied by the fact that schools are bastions of femininity , mostly run by and taught by women .
Girls outperform boys in school .
It is the boys in school getting fucked over , and prescribed ritalin for being boys .

In his article , " Linux for Suits : The No- Party System " , Doc Searls makes an observation about Linux that can help us understand why we might want to tweak the performance of Linux desktops .
Referring to Linux as raw material with which people can build distributions , he says :
As one Linux programmer once told me , " Linux ca n 't sue anybody . "
In fact , Linux is n't even a platform of the sort defined by Windows and Mac OS .
Instead , Linux is a form of building material that grows in the wild and naturally is suited for making foundations and frameworks .
The wild in this case is fertile human mentation , which is why it evolves and improves in the course of being put to use .
People distribute Linux rather than build it .
Unlike traditional operating systems , anyone with some knowledge of Linux can pull the pieces together and create a distribution .
So , although many different distributions of Linux are available , they come from the same building materials .
The differences among distributions take the form of tweaks here and there or various ways in which users perform the same tasks and what kind of themes are used .
But as many have said , " Linux is Linux " -- and it has flavors .
Distributors create those flavors , and underlying these flavors are default configurations .
For most of its existence , people have distributed Linux as a workstation or a server rather than as a desktop .
In effect , the default workstation that has evolved has existed mostly for developers .
So , when you install a Linux distribution with a graphical interface , it generally looks like what a developer might want .
It performs similar to many UNIX workstations , which can seem slow for many knowledge workers .
In this article , we look at the Linux desktop in a slightly different light .
We think of it as a computer system that maximizes its strength as a consumer product .
When we optimize Linux for the consumer , it becomes a fast interface .
If you have complained about the speed of OpenOffice.org or Firefox or about the amount of time Linux takes to boot up , this set of optimizations should change your perception .
Linux can boot up quickly , the word processor can spring open and the browser can fly .
So , let 's make these adjustments so your computer can fly .
Note :
We use the two most popular Linux distributions for this article , Fedora Core 3 and Ubuntu 5.04 .
Red Hat builds and releases Fedora using an RPM - based package management system .
The Ubuntu developers base their distribution on the deb package management system .
Mandriva , SUSE and Red Hat Enterprise Linux , among others , use the RPM package management systems .
Linspire and Xandros , among others , use the deb package management system .
Where the Speed Goes Many points exist in a PC where an operating system can bottleneck and slow down .
One of the most common places for this to happen lies between random access memory ( RAM ) and the hard drive .
Even if your system does have an ample supply of fast RAM , it might decide to conserve it and use virtual disk memory , which is contained in the swap file on the hard drive .
The hard drive runs 100 times slower than RAM , so that 's one place system speed goes .
You can fix this problem with system speed by adding more RAM .
A few years ago , I often bought computers and added memory that doubled and tripled the price of the base system .
I had to do this because as a writer I used graphics programs , and they used a lot of RAM .
Fortunately , RAM does n't cost much any more .
You can buy a 1GB stick of generic RAM for most desktop computers for about $ 150 .
If you use a laptop , the memory costs more .
Still , the increased performance of your computer makes the cost seem insignificant .
If you have enough RAM available , Linux uses that instead of the hard drive .
In Figure 1 , you can see a screenshot of Fedora 's performance monitor on a system containing 768 MB of RAM .
Notice in a couple of places how the CPU jumped up while the memory remained steady .
The monitored system is an AMD Sempron 2200 with a 1.5GHz processor .
This system came from the Micro Center with 256MB of RAM and sells for approximately $ 250 .
It 's a PowerSpec SBB1 .
I added 512MB of memory for $ 70 .
Figure 1 . Fedora 's System Monitor
To keep this system from immediately accessing the swap drive , I utilized one of the features of the Linux kernel and reduced its propensity for immediately looking for the swap file .
People call this kernel aspect swappiness .
It 's a run-time tunable available through the proc interface for anyone needing to adapt kernel behavior to his or her own requirements .
The higher the parameter , the more the computer uses the disk .
So , if you compile a large piece of software , you might want to use RAM for other things while you let the computer sit and compile .
But , if you want to write a proposal and need to get to the Internet to do research , answer e-mail and use instant messaging , you probably want to use RAM instead of the disk .
On my system , I reduced the tendency for the kernel to use the swap file .
I did so by running this command : $ sudo cat / proc / sys / vm / swappiness and found the setting at 60 .
That 's the default set by the kernel developers .
I wanted a lower number , so I ran : $ sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=10 and ran the cat command again and it registered 10 .
I added vm.swappiness=10 to /etc/sysctl.conf
I put this on the last line .
No comments existed for that entry , so it looks naked in the configuration file .
I noted an immediate improvement in responsiveness , and with the entry in /etc / sysctl.conf , the system booted up with the value of 10 as the new default .
Freeing More Memory
On a default Linux configuration , distributors provide six text - mode virtual consoles .
You can access each console by pressing Ctrl + Alt +F1 through Ctrl + Alt +F6 ; Ctrl + Alt +F7 switches to the graphical desktop .
Each virtual console consumes memory .
Virtual consoles attracted me to Linux and they are one of my favorite features .
But , I do n't use those consoles much .
I like having an extra one so I can get to a graphic terminal if I need , but as a desktop user , I do n't need six .
I edit /etc / inittab ( see Figure 2 ) and commented out four or so of the six lines that spawn gettys .
This allows me to free up more memory to use with my OpenOffice.org productivity suite , which we 'll reconfigure in a few moments .
Figure 2 . Disabling Virtual Terminals
Speeding Up OpenOffice.orgs '
Launch
One of the major complaints that I hear is how long it takes the OpenOffice.org applications to launch .
You can add a quickstart applet to GNOME by installing the program ooqstart - gnome , which may help some .
However , an internal adjustment to OOo Writer can improve the entire suite 's performance .
To accomplish this , you need to start the word processor , Writer .
Next , you need to open the Tools drop - down menu and select options .
Once you open the options box , you are ready to adjust the memory and speed up your Linux productivity suite .
Let 's look at Figure 3 . Figure 3 . OpenOffice.org Options
In the above figure , you can see that we selected the first expansion box and then clicked Memory with our mouse .
This exposed the window you see in Figure 3 .
I changed the default values under the Graphics cache for Use for OpenOffice.org and Memory per Object .
I increased the first value from 6 to 128MB .
I also increased the second value from .5 to 20 MB .
After clicking OK , I closed the word processor and reopened it two times .
On each occasion , the application took less time to open .
Under Ubuntu , I found that OO Writer opened in three seconds , and in Fedora it opened in less than six seconds .
Previously , it took 30 and 26 seconds , respectively , for the word processor to launch .
Muhammad Cartoon Redux Danish Party Threatened by Palestinian Militants
A right - wing Danish political party has been threatened by the Palestinian terror group al - Aqsa Martyr 's Brigade for using an image of the Prophet Muhammad in its campaign literature .
The party wanted to show its commitment to free speech .

A man addicted to violent porn websites has been convicted for the second time of murdering a teacher .
Legislation to ban such sites is going through Parliament , but a small group of otherwise law - abiding people say the changes will criminalise them .
Coutts lied throughout police interviews and two trials Jane Longhurst 's killer Graham Coutts admitted he was addicted to violent pornography websites .
The 39 - year - old musician had downloaded hundreds of images of women being raped and strangled as well as pictures purporting to show necrophilia .
Coutts was found guilty of murder in 2004 but the conviction was quashed on a technicality .
' Acting out a fantasy '
His second trial at the Old Bailey , which jailed him for life , heard he was a regular visitor to websites depicting extreme material .
He accessed these sites only hours before killing Miss Longhurst and again in the weeks that he kept her body in a self - storage facility in Brighton .
Jane would still be here if it was n't for the internet
Malcolm Sentance , boyfriend
Man guilty of teacher murder His barrister , Christopher Sallon QC , asked him at one point : " The suggestion is you were acting out a fantasy from a pornographic image that you accessed with the internet ?
Were you charged up and sexually aroused by Jane Longhurst , dead , with a ligature on ? "
Coutts denied it .
But then he had lied about so much else , including his claim she had agreed to sex on the day she disappeared and acquiesced when he suggested a sex game involving her being partially strangled with a pair of tights .
After the original trial Miss Longhurst 's mother , Liz , organised a petition of 50,000 people and succeeded in persuading the home secretary to introduce legislation banning the downloading and possession of violent or " extreme " pornography .
The current fears around the possible impact of ' violent pornography ' on the internet seem very similar to previous ' moral panics '
Dr Meg Barker
She said : " I feel pressure should be brought to bear on internet service providers ( ISPs ) to close down or filter out these pornographic sites , so that people like Jane 's killer may no longer feed their sick imaginations and do harm to others . "
Ms Longhurst 's former partner Malcolm Sentance said at the time : " Jane would still be here if it was n't for the internet . "
The ban was included in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill , details of which were announced by the government last week .
The Bill has yet to be debated by Parliament but there is growing opposition to the clause among a small but vociferous community who say they will be criminalised .
The community , comprising people involved in bondage , domination and sado - masochism ( BDSM ) , has organised a petition against the new legislation , which 1,800 people have signed .
Deborah Hyde , of the pressure group Backlash , argues that perverted predators like Coutts will always exist and no amount of " kneejerk " legislation would prevent them from killing .
' Not good law '
She said the vast majority of BDSM people believed in consensual activities and would not wish to inflict actual harm on their partners .
They did not want to view snuff movies or actual cruelty but would be criminalised for watching pornography which was acted out by actors .
Ms Hyde said the government had already widened the description of " extreme " pornography to include some gay porn .
She said : " The government is trying to put us in the same category as rapists , murderers and paedophiles .
" I want to make the world a safer place but this law will not help .
It is not good law and it is being rushed through .
There is a lot of research which says that giving access to this sort of material actually reduces crimes against women . "
Liz Longhurst does not want another family to suffer as she has Helen and John , who live in the Midlands , are opposed to the legislation .
They say they are in a loving relationship which just happens to involve domination and submissiveness .
Helen said the government was overreacting to the Jane Longhurst case : " The supply of BDSM stuff has gone up hugely but there is no killing spree .
If all this violent pornography is causing people to go psycho where are all the damaged people ?
" Do you ban alcohol just because some people are alcoholics ? "
Dr Meg Barker , a senior lecturer in psychology at London South Bank University , said : " The current fears around the possible impact of ' violent pornography ' on the internet seem very similar to previous ' moral panics ' there have been from penny dreadfuls in Victorian times , to horror comics in the 1950s , to video nasties in the 1980s . "
" Images of consensual , or fictitious , acts between adults should not be criminalised , " she said , adding that there was evidence that " kinky " and S&M activities were on the increase among " normal " heterosexual couples .
But Labour MP Martin Salter , who has worked closely with Mrs Longhurst in pushing the legislation , rejected the BDSM community 's claims their civil liberties were being undermined .
' Unbalanced mind '
He said : " No - one is stopping people doing weird stuff to each other but they would be strongly advised not to put it on the internet .
" At the end of the day it is all too easy for this stuff to trigger an unbalanced mind . "
The legislation is designed to tackle porn in the internet age Mr Salter , MP for Reading West , said : " These snuff movies and other stuff are seriously disturbing .
Many police officers who have to view it as part of their job have to undergo psychological counselling . "
He insisted the law did not ban anything which was not already illegal under the Obscene Publications Act .
" It simply plugs a hole in the law because the Obscene Publications
Act is about as much use as a chocolate fireguard as far as the internet is concerned .
This new law is designed to meet the challenge of the internet . "
But Ms Hyde said the Obscene Publications
Act targeted the producers while the new act would criminalise the consumers .

What are these ?
LOS ANGELES  Paramount Pictures is lurching onto the Web with its “ Jackass ” franchise , with what it says will be the first studio - backed feature film to have its premiere online .
And the studio hopes the result will be considerably more pleasurable than the old MTV show ’s trademark shot to the groin  perhaps by paving the way for more profit - making Web - only material .
On Dec. 19 , the studio will make “ Jackass 2.5 ” available in connection with Blockbuster ’s Movielink service .
The hour - plus film has original material and previously unseen outtakes from the second “ Jackass ” movie in 2006 .
The new movie , made for less than $ 2 million , will stream for free but will have 15 - or 30 - second commercials before and after it plays .
At the same time , the studio ’s fellow subsidiary of Viacom , MTV Networks , and the creators of the “ Jackass ” franchise are using the new film to attract traffic to jackassworld.com , now under construction .
The site is billed as an online community offering blogs , original video content and an archive of the 24 episodes of “ Jackass , ” which ran on MTV in 2000 and 2001 , as well as its longer - running spinoff “ Wildboyz . ”
The US government is attempting to halt a lawsuit that could establish whether any of the Central Intelligence Agency 's so - called rendition flights have been partly planned on British soil .
Lawyers representing a number of men who have been held at Guantánamo are suing Jeppesen Dataplan , a subsidiary of the Boeing Corporation , accusing Jeppesen of involvement in the flights that took the men to secret prisons around the world .
Once there , the men say , they were tortured .
The lawyers say they strongly suspect that at least some of the logistic support for the CIA 's flights was arranged at Jeppesen 's office in Crawley , West Sussex , a few miles from Gatwick airport .
However , the US government is asking a federal court to dismiss the lawsuit because " to proceed would risk the disclosure of highly classified information " about the agency 's methods .
According to Washington 's arguments , that information would include " whether any private entities or other countries assisted the CIA " , as well as the locations of any secret prisons and " the methods of interrogation employed " .
The men's lawyers at Reprieve , a London - based legal charity , say that if the case is dismissed , they may sue Jeppesen for damages in the English courts .
Reprieve is seeking unspecified damages on behalf of six men , including Benyam Mohammed , an Ethiopian national who grew up in Notting Hill , west London , who was first arrested in Pakistan before being flown to Morocco on a flight allegedly facilitated by Jeppesen .
In Morocco he was subjected to severe physical and psychological torture , according to Reprieve 's complaint .
" He was routinely beaten , suffering broken bones and , on occasion , loss of consciousness due to the beatings .
His clothes were cut off with a scalpel and the same scalpel was then used to make incisions on his body , including his penis .
A hot stinging liquid was then poured into open wounds on his penis where he had been cut .
He was frequently threatened with rape , electrocution , and death . "
Another plaintiff is Bisher al - Rawi , an Iraqi citizen who had lived in Britain for 19 years when arrested in the Gambia in 2002 , and who was freed from Guantánamo last March after it emerged that he had acted as a go - between for MI5 and the radical cleric Abu Qatada .
Rawi says he was flown to Afghanistan , where he was " punched and badly beaten " , deprived of food , warmth or light , and subjected to loud noise around the clock .
According to Jeppesen 's publications , its international trip planning services are arranged by two offices , with San Jose in California managing the western hemisphere , and Crawley managing the eastern hemisphere .
Papers filed by Reprieve and the American Civil Liberties Union at a US district court in San Jose say that " publicly available records demonstrate that Jeppesen facilitated more than 70 secret rendition flights over a four - year period to countries where it knew or reasonably should have known that detainees are routinely tortured or otherwise abused " .
Last June , Dick Marty , a Swiss senator who investigated the CIA 's use of European territory and airspace during prisoner operations , also concluded in his report to the Council of Europe that Jeppesen had falsified flight plans .
A spokesman for Jeppesen said : " We manage the logistics and planning of international operations for thousands of organisations and people operating aircraft .
It is not necessary for us to know the specific nature of a customer 's flight .
In the event that we learn something about the purpose of a flight , our customers have the reasonable expectation that it will be held in confidence . "
Clive Stafford Smith , legal director of Reprieve , said : " There seems to be little doubt that these rendition flights were planned on British soil .
The US government has intervened to prevent their dirty laundry from being washed in public , which is reprehensible . "
Dr. Rubin Cross - posted this story last night on DailyKos , but it fell off the list with little attention .
It 's worth a second shot .
This year , on August 28 , President Bush spoke to another veterans ' group , the American Legion .
He called Iran " the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , " whose " active pursuit of technology that could lead to nuclear weapons threatens to put a region already known for instability and violence under the shadow of a nuclear holocaust . "
He concluded :
Iran 's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere .
And that is why the United States is rallying friends and allies around the world to isolate the regime , to impose economic sanctions .
We will confront this danger before it is too late .
But this apparently is just test marketing , like Cheney 's 2002 speech .
After all " from a marketing point of view , you do n't introduce new products in August . "
Today I received a message from a friend who has excellent connections in Washington and whose information has often been prescient .
According to this report , as in 2002 , the rollout will start after Labor Day , with a big kickoff on September 11 .
My friend had spoken to someone in one of the leading neo-conservative institutions .
He summarized what he was told this way :
They [ the source 's institution ] have " instructions " ( yes , that was the word used ) from the Office of the Vice - President to roll out a campaign for war with Iran in the week after Labor Day ; it will be coordinated with the American Enterprise Institute , the Wall Street Journal , the Weekly Standard , Commentary , Fox , and the usual suspects .
It will be heavy sustained assault on the airwaves , designed to knock public sentiment into a position from which a war can be maintained .
Evidently they do n't think they 'll ever get majority support for this -- they want something like 35 - 40 percent support , which in their book is " plenty . "
Of course I cannot verify this report .
But besides all the other pieces of information about this circulating , I heard last week from a former U.S. government contractor .
According to this friend , someone in the Department of Defense called , asking for cost estimates for a model for reconstruction in Asia .
The former contractor finally concluded that the model was intended for Iran .
This anecdote is also inconclusive , but it is consistent with the depth of planning that went into the reconstruction effort in Iraq and Afghanistan .
I hesitated before posting this .
I do n't want to spread alarmist rumors .
I do n't want to lessen the pressure on the Ahmadinejad government in Tehran .
But there are too many signs of another irresponsible military adventure from the Cheney - Bush administration for me just to dismiss these reports .
I am putting them into the public sphere in the hope of helping to mobilize opposition to a policy that would further doom the efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and burden our country and the people of the Middle East with yet another unstoppable fountain of bloodshed .
Muslim girl banned from soccer game for wearing headscarf

Officials with the United Soccer Association have apologized to a Muslim girl who was sidelined from a soccer game in Florida on Saturday when a referee mistakenly ruled that her headscarf violated league regulations .
CNN 's Florida affiliate reports that 15 year old Iman Khalil was kept out of the game even after league officials told the referee that her headscarf was acceptable .
Regulations prescribe a standard uniform , but a 2002 memo explicitly allows objects such as head coverings to be worn for religious purposes .
League Vice President Michael Gann explained , " The referees are expected to make discretionary calls .
Unfortunately , sometimes they stick too far to the letter of the rule . "
" I never thought I 'd have to deal with that kind of thing in soccer , " said Khalil .
She also stated , " I felt really bad because I felt like I sort of let the team down . "
The following video clips are from CNN's Newsroom and WFTV 9 News , broadcast on October 15 , 2007 .
When people say : " I built my own computer " , they mean they buy a motherboard , drives , CPU , cooling system , RAM , power supply , case and screw and plug it all together .
So I always have to explain that when I say : " I built my first computer myself " I mean that I had to actually solder all components onto the motherboard .
( The empty motherboard of my Acorn Atom came with a bag of resistors , IC's , capacitors and connectors ) .
Still I should not say : " I built my computer myself " , for I know a guy that has
done so .
He lives in Tbilisi , Republic of Georgia and he showed me his self - made computer .
It was unique .
He designed the hardware using " Soviet " IC's , and he hand - designed and etched the motherboard in an acid bath .
He drilled the holes for the component 's wires with a dentist 's drill .
He wrote the BIOS .
He wrote the OS .
He wrote the compiler .
He wrote the system utilities .
Tbilisi had rationed electricity in the early nineties so he powered his computer from old car batteries .
Those batteries were refurbished .
He had emptied them of battery acid , collected the best plates , washed and cleaned them , hammered them flat again and put them back in the battery casing and filled it up with new acid .
If I would really build my own computer today , I would add a very important thing for computer scientists : A crappy carbon resistor or a crappy Germanium diode .
In fact I am prepared to pay more for a system that has it .
The thing is , crappy carbon resistors or crappy Germanium diodes
(
) .
The DAI had one .
( The DAI hails from the same era as the Acorn Atom , the TRS 80 and the Exidy Sorcerer , around 1980 ) .
Such " Johnson " noise is produced by the random movement ( Brownian motion largely caused by thermal effects ) of electrons in the component ( PN junction noise in case of a [ Zener ] diode or transistor ) .
This is real quantum - randomness .
Mathematicians will start to drool at this point .
People that use Zobrist hashing will salivate as well .
John von Neumann said : " Anyone who considers arithmetic methods of producing random digits is , of course , in a state of sin . "
The DAI used quantum noise to generate truly random numbers .
You do this by amplifying the noise , Schmitt - triggering it , feeding the pulse train into a shift register and clocking the resulting machine word out .
Highly cool .
Strange that this is not integrated into modern CPU's .
Hundreds of millions of transistors , but nobody thinks of using a handful of them ( downgraded to be " noisy " ) to generate real random numbers fast .
But yet , really good hardware random generators are unwieldy and expensive .
Thermal noise - based random is slow compared to generating " random " numbers with a shift register , but this can be augmented by giving each bit its own random generator , hashing the bits to compensate for the fact that some generators will have an asymmetric duty cycle , and having a constantly filled - up " random cache " with a capacity of a few thousand 64 - bit random numbers , to be used as either integers or floats by the CPU .
Random numbers would be
random and load into a register in a single clock cycle !
This would be near - trivial to do for AMD , Motorola , IBM or Intel .
And I want royalties .
Why would you need a " perfect " random ?
I am not a statistician or some kind of dogmatic purist , but I do need one .
I make pattern recognizers for " Artificial Intelligence " purposes , excusez le mot ;)
I started with the random generator in Delphi .
That one sucked .
When you plotted the random on a 1024 x 1024 field , entire patches remained empty .
So my pattern recognizer sometimes shot an old lady because it mistook it for a tank ( this is a metaphor , it would go too far to explain what my stuff actually does , and why some forms of pattern recognition need
) .
I then decided to generate random numbers myself , ensuring they all were in a certain Hamming distance range from each other .
That 's allegedly very useful for Zobrist ( xor ) hashing , to get an even spread ( minimize collisions ) .
But then a discussion on the computer
Go newsgroup made me have doubts , and I now use a Mersenne Twister .
The verdict on that one is still pending .
Note how none of the modern mainstream CPU's / PC 's provide functions to decrypt quickly ( popcount ) or encrypt well ( true random ) , but that older CPU's / PC's
provide this functionality ..
Get your luck with Lucky Leprechaun !

Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries -- Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- share Western concerns that Iran ’s nuclear energy program will lead to it acquiring atomic bombs , a claim Tehran denies .
“ We have proposed a solution , which is to create a consortium for all users of enriched uranium in the Middle East , ” Foreign Minister Prince Saud al - Faisal told the Middle East Economic Digest ( MEED ) .
“ The U.S. is not involved , but I do n’t think it ( would be ) hostile to this , and it would resolve a main area of tension between the West and Iran , ” he told the London - based weekly .
“ ( We will ) do it in a collective manner through a consortium that will distribute according to needs , give each plant its own necessary amount , and ensure no use of this enriched uranium for atomic weapons , ” Prince Saud said , according to MEED ’s Web site .
Prince Saud , speaking on Thursday during a visit to Britain , said Iran was considering the offer , which envisages building a plant in a neutral country .
“ We believe it should be in a neutral country -- Switzerland , for instance , ” said Prince Saud .
“ Any plant in the Middle East that needs enriched uranium would get its quota .
I do n’t think other Arab states would refuse .
In fact ... other Arab countries have expressed a desire to be part of the proposal . ”
“ They ( Iran ) have responded that it is an interesting idea and they will come back to us .
We hope the Iranians will accept this proposal .
We continue to talk to them and urge them not only to look at the issue from the perspective of the needs of Iran for energy , but also in the interests of the security of the region . ”
There was no immediate comment on the proposal from Tehran , which has consistently refused to heed U.N. demands to halt its own nuclear enrichment .
The six Gulf Arab states have announced plans to start their own nuclear energy program , raising concern over an arms race in the world ’s top oil exporting region .
MEED said that under the plan , the facility would produce nuclear fuel that the consortium would supply to Middle East states seeking to use atomic energy .
Many countries in the region say they are looking to nuclear energy to help them meet growing electricity demand .
S. 1959 ( 110th ) was a bill in the United States Congress .
A bill must be passed by both the House and Senate in identical form and then be signed by the President to become law .
Bills numbers restart every two years .

The most important habit I ’ve formed in the last 10 years of forming habits is meditation .
Hands down , bar none .
Meditation has helped me to form all my other habits , it ’s helped me to become more peaceful , more focused , less worried about discomfort , more appreciative and attentive to everything in my life .
I ’m far from perfect , but it has helped me come a long way .
Probably most importantly , it has helped me understand my own mind .
Before I started meditating , I never thought about what was going on inside my head — it would just happen , and I would follow its commands like an automaton .
These days , all of that still happens , but more and more , I am aware of what ’s going on .
I can make a choice about whether to follow the commands .
I understand myself better ( not completely , but better ) , and that has given me increased flexibility and freedom .
So … I highly recommend this habit .
And while I ’m not saying it ’s easy , you can start small and get better and better as you practice .
Do n’t expect to be good at first — that ’s why it ’s called “ practice ” !
These tips are n’t aimed at helping you to become an expert … they should help you get started and keep going .
You do n’t have to implement them all at once — try a few , come back to this article , try one or two more .
Sit for just two minutes .
This will seem ridiculously easy , to just meditate for two minutes .
That ’s perfect .
Start with just two minutes a day for a week .
If that goes well , increase by another two minutes and do that for a week .
If all goes well , by increasing just a little at a time , you ’ll be meditating for 10 minutes a day in the 2nd month , which is amazing !
But start small first .
Do it first thing each morning .
It ’s easy to say , “ I ’ll meditate every day , ” but then forget to do it .
Instead , set a reminder for every morning when you get up , and put a note that says “ meditate ” somewhere where you ’ll see it .
Do n’t get caught up in the how — just do .
Most people worry about where to sit , how to sit , what cushion to use … this is all nice , but it ’s not that important to get started .
Start just by sitting on a chair , or on your couch .
Or on your bed .
If you ’re comfortable on the ground , sit cross -legged .
It ’s just for two minutes at first anyway , so just sit .
Later you can worry about optimizing it so you ’ll be comfortable for longer , but in the beginning it does n’t matter much , just sit somewhere quiet and comfortable .
Check in with how you ’re feeling .
As you first settle into your meditation session , simply check to see how you ’re feeling .
How does your body feel ?
What is the quality of your mind ?
Busy ?
Tired ?
Anxious ?
See whatever you ’re bringing to this meditation session as completely OK .
Count your breaths .
Now that you ’re settled in , turn your attention to your breath .
Just place the attention on your breath as it comes in , and follow it through your nose all the way down to your lungs .
Try counting “ one ” as you take in the first breath , then “ two ” as you breathe out .
Repeat this to the count of 10 , then start again at one .
Come back when you wander .
Your mind will wander .
This is an almost absolute certainty .
There ’s no problem with that .
When you notice your mind wandering , smile , and simply gently return to your breath .
Count “ one ” again , and start over .
You might feel a little frustration , but it ’s perfectly OK to not stay focused , we all do it .
This is the practice , and you wo n’t be good at it for a little while .
Develop a loving attitude .
When you notice thoughts and feelings arising during meditation , as they will , look at them with a friendly attitude .
See them as friends , not intruders or enemies .
They are a part of you , though not all of you .
Be friendly and not harsh .
Do n’t worry too much that you ’re doing it wrong .
You will worry you ’re doing it wrong .
That ’s OK , we all do .
You ’re not doing it wrong .
There ’s no perfect way to do it , just be happy you ’re doing it .
Do n’t worry about clearing the mind .
Lots of people think meditation is about clearing your mind , or stopping all thoughts .
It ’s not .
This can sometimes happen , but it ’s not the “ goal ” of meditation .
If you have thoughts , that ’s normal .
We all do .
Our brains are thought factories , and we ca n’t just shut them down .
Instead , just try to practice focusing your attention , and practice some more when your mind wanders .
Stay with whatever arises .
When thoughts or feelings arise , and they will , you might try staying with them awhile .
Yes , I know I said to return to the breath , but after you practice that for a week , you might also try staying with a thought or feeling that arises .
We tend to want to avoid feelings like frustration , anger , anxiety … but an amazingly useful meditation practice is to stay with the feeling for awhile .
Just stay , and be curious .
Get to know yourself .
This practice is n’t just about focusing your attention , it ’s about learning how your mind works .
What ’s going on inside there ?
It ’s murky , but by watching your mind wander , get frustrated , avoid difficult feelings … you can start to understand yourself .
Become friends with yourself .
As you get to know yourself , do it with a friendly attitude instead of one of criticism .
You ’re getting to know a friend .
Smile and give yourself love .
Do a body scan .
Another thing you can do , once you become a little better at following your breath , is focus your attention on one body part at a time .
Start at the soles of your feet — how do those feel ?
Slowly move to your toes , the tops of your feet , your ankles , all the way to the top of your head .
Notice the light , sounds , energy .
Another place to put your attention , again , after you ’ve practice with your breath for at least a week , is the light all around you .
Just keep your eyes on one spot , and notice the light in the room you ’re in .
Another day , just focus on noticing sounds .
Another day , try to notice the energy in the room all around you ( including light and sounds ) .
Really commit yourself .
Do n’t just say , “ Sure , I ’ll try this for a couple days . ”
Really commit yourself to this .
In your mind , be locked in , for at least a month .
You can do it anywhere .
If you ’re traveling or something comes up in the morning , you can do meditation in your office .
In the park .
During your commute .
As you walk somewhere .
Sitting meditation is the best place to start , but in truth , you ’re practicing for this kind of mindfulness in your entire life .
Follow guided meditation .
If it helps , you can try following guided meditations to start with .
My wife is using Tara Brach ’s guided meditations , and she finds them very helpful .
Check in with friends .
While I like meditating alone , you can do it with your spouse or child or a friend .
Or just make a commitment with a friend to check in every morning after meditation .
It might help you stick with it for longer .
Find a community .
Even better , find a community of people who are meditating and join them .
This might be a Zen or Tibetan community near you ( for example ) , where you go and meditate with them .
Or find an online group and check in with them and ask questions , get support , encourage others .
My Sea Change Program has a community like that .
Smile when you ’re done .
When you ’re finished with your two minutes , smile .
Be grateful that you had this time to yourself , that you stuck with your commitment , that you showed yourself that you ’re trustworthy , where you took the time to get to know yourself and make friends with yourself .
That ’s an amazing two minutes of your life .
Meditation is n’t always easy or even peaceful .
But it has truly amazing benefits , and you can start today , and continue for the rest of your life .

Tom Cruise Building $ 10 M Scientology Bunker ?
Tom Cruise is planning to build a $ 10 million bunker underneath his Colorado mansion in preparation for the end of the world , according to a bizarre new report .
The Top Gun star and Scientology nut is said to be taking the costly precaution in order to out - smart an evil intergalactic ruler called Xenu who , he believes , will attack Earth .
A source told Star magazine : “ Tom is planning to build a $ 10 million bunker under his Telluride estate .
“ It ’s a self - contained underground shelter with a high tech air - purifying system where up to ten people can survive for years . ”
Better safe than sorry !
This may seem like a bold statement .
Apple 's just released iPhone is not only very attractive as we would expect from an Apple product , but includes some impressive features and specifications .
It 's probably unrealistic to claim that anything currently available on the market competes with this offering .
However , is it really a revolution in mobile communication devices ?
Maybe not if there still is something that can overshadow it , and do it very soon .
It is something that follows a paradigm painfully different from the one of Apple , pretty much completely opposite of it actually .
It is a phone which rivals Apple 's iPhone as a technological concept and is yet based on completely open technologies , fully extensible by anyone and fully under control of its user .
Enter OpenMoko , an attractive phone which may not currently be much of a competitor in terms of specifications alone , but beats Apple hands down on openness and therefore the disruptive potential .
It is based on open hardware specifications and uses a Free Software operating system platform known as GNU / Linux which means that all the hardware and software code is open to developers , engineers and designers to build on and potentially create things even far more exciting than the current Apple iPhone .
The current situation in the mobile phone market is n't very flattering if you care about standardization and openness .
Basically every manufacturer has their own proprietary platform .
If you want to extend your mobile phone with new features and software you are generally dependable solely on the phone manufacturer itself .
The vision behind OpenMoko describes a completely different world .
It is a world where there is a common standard platform for mobile phones which is open and therefore friendly to developers .
It is a world where once you buy your phone you can install or remove software from it as you wish , customizing the phone and its capabilities in much the similar manner you can customize your PC .
It is a world which is , thanks to the visionaries and enthusiasts behind the OpenMoko project , near .
This is the real mobile communications revolution we should be expecting .
It is not merely about creating a technologically superior mobile phone that looks good .
It is about creating an open common environment which welcomes innovators of all kinds to converge and create technological superiority not dependable on one vendor .
It is the mirror of the Free Software ecosystem that produced things like GNU / Linux , Mozilla Firefox , Apache , PHP , Drupal and other impressive software technologies .
It is the concept which we may , in the trendy " web 2.0 " jargon , rightfully call " Mobile 2.0 " — reinventing the mobile communications industry .
This said , I would rather wait for OpenMoko to become available for purchase than shell out high bucks for iPhone .
Just like with any Apple product , it is like an awesome looking golden cage .
I always preferred freedom to control my own digital devices than to be mostly dependent on one vendor for everything .
I refer you to this presentation PDF for an attractive summary of the revolutionary OpenMoko concept .
You can see a feature comparison here .
In the true open fashion , you can talk about and ask questions about OpenMoko in an #openmoko IRC channel at irc.freenode.net .
Thank you

Comments made by justices in an ongoing landmark case , which seeks to address the very meaning of the second amendment , have been heralded as a " victory " for the individual right to bear arms , but in reality the second amendment is being completely eroded altogether .
Individual Right to Bear Arms Wins Favor in Court Argument , the headline from the New York Law Journal , was typical of the media output yesterday after most of the nine Supreme Court justices hinted that the right to bear arms is a " general right . "
However , the case is likely to conclude with the introduction of several new regulations on hand gun ownership at the very least , and , if the government gets its way , a total ban on handguns .
The outcome will set the precedent for gun laws nationwide .
The NY Law Journal writes :
Justice Kennedy ’s comments appeared to spell trouble for efforts by the District of Columbia to revive its strict handgun ban , although lawyers for both the Bush administration and gun-rights advocates acknowledged that some lesser regulation of the right would be acceptable .
Counting Justice Kennedy , it appeared that five or more justices were ready to recognize some form of an individual right to keep and bear arms that is only loosely tethered , if at all , to the functioning of militias .
What kind of regulation of that individual right will be allowed by those justices is uncertain . [… ]
When the arguments were over , gun-control advocates seemed less pessimistic than before the session began , though they did not predict victory .
Joshua Horwitz , director of the Education Fund to Stop Gun Violence , who filed a brief in the case and watched the arguments , conceded he cannot count five votes for a strictly militia - rights view of the Second Amendment that would allow for almost unlimited regulation of firearms .
But he could conceive of five justices adopting an individual - rights view that will mean " a lot of regulations will be OK .
The outcome is not necessarily poor for us . "
The case , DC v. Heller , stems from proceedings filed by lawyers for security guard Mr Dick Anthony Heller , which state that the District ’s categorical restrictions are so broad that they cannot comply with the Second Amendment ’s protection of the right to bear arms .
An amicus curiae brief filed by U.S Solicitor General Paul D. Clement , on behalf of the Bush administration and the government , says that federal gun control measures should not be limited and proposes that a court may determine that a full scale ban on almost all self - defense firearms may be upheld as constitutional if it constitutes a “ reasonable ” restriction of constitutional rights .
Lawyer Alan Gura , opposing the law and representing Mr Heller said " We have here a ban on all guns for all people in all homes at all times in the nation ’s capital . "
Read the transcript of yesterday ’s argument .
Read briefs in D.C. v. Heller .
Advocates of the ban and the representatives of the District of Columbia have attempted to argue that the history and context of the second amendment applies to the rights of militias and not to individuals .
However , there are thousands of quotes from the founding fathers that pour water on this weak argument .
The founders said over and over that when a government seeks to take away individual weapons it constitutes tyranny and that government must be removed .
Here are a few choice quotes :
A strong body makes the mind strong .
As to the species of exercises , I advise the gun .
While this gives moderate exercise to the body , it gives boldness , enterprise and independence to the mind .
Games played with the ball , and others of that nature , are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind .
Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks .
— Thomas Jefferson to Peter Carr , 1785 .
The Writings of Thomas Jefferson , ( Memorial Edition ) Lipscomb and Bergh , editors .
We established however some , although not all its [ self - government ] important principles .
The constitutions of most of our States assert , that all power is inherent in the people ; that they may exercise it by themselves , in all cases to which they think themselves competent , ( as in electing their functionaries executive and legislative , and deciding by a jury of themselves , in all judiciary cases in which any fact is involved , ) or they may act by representatives , freely and equally chosen ; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed ;
— Thomas Jefferson to John Cartwright , 1824 .
Memorial Edition 16:45 , Lipscomb and Bergh , editors .
No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms .
— Thomas Jefferson : Draft Virginia Constitution , 1776 .
[ The Constitution preserves ] the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation …( where ) the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms .
— James Madison , The Federalist Papers , No. 46 .
To suppose arms in the hands of citizens , to be used at individual discretion , except in private self - defense , or by partial orders of towns , countries or districts of a state , is to demolish every constitution , and lay the laws prostrate , so that liberty can be enjoyed by no man ; it is a dissolution of the government .
The fundamental law of the militia is , that it be created , directed and commanded by the laws , and ever for the support of the laws .
— John Adams , A Defence of the Constitutions of the United States 475 ( 1787 - 1788 )
Furthermore , even if you argue that the second amendment applies to militias , the very definition of the militia , according to the founders and their contemporaries , is THE PEOPLE :
Who are the militia ?
Are they not ourselves ?
Is it feared , then , that we shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom .
Congress have no power to disarm the militia .
Their swords , and every other terrible implement of the soldier , are the birthright of an American … [ T ]he unlimited power of the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments , but , where I trust in God it will ever remain , in the hands of the people .
— Tenche Coxe , The Pennsylvania Gazette , Feb. 20 , 1788 .
Before a standing army can rule , the people must be disarmed ; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe .
The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword ; because the whole body of the people are armed , and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be , on any pretence , raised in the United States .
A military force , at the command of Congress , can execute no laws , but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional ; for they will possess the power , and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination , to resist the execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive .
— Noah Webster , An Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal Constitution ( Philadelphia 1787 ) .
Last month a majority of the Senate and more than half of the members of the House issued a brief in which they urged the Supreme Court to uphold it ’s previous ruling that the District ’s handgun ban violates the second amendment .
The brief asked the Supreme Court to uphold the lower courts decision and allow the precedent of applying a stricter standard of review for gun control cases to stand .
In a separate letter , other representatives , including Congressman Ron Paul , called for the Clement / Bush administration brief to be withdrawn as it sets a precedent for further erosion of individuals ’
Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms .
Citing Constitutional concerns the letter stated :
“ If the Supreme Court finds that the D.C. gun ban is a “ reasonable ” limitation of Second Amendment rights , the Court could create a dangerous precedent for the nation in the future .
Such a decision could open the door to further regulation on American citizens ’
Second Amendment rights on a large scale . ”
Essentially the government is saying " You have the right to bear arms , unless we say so . "
Where there is individual ownership of weapons there is liberty , where there is not there is tyranny because powerful organizations and governments will have a monopoly on it .
The latest developments in this case are not a " victory " for the second amendment , on the contrary , they constitute its very undoing .

Larry King dances in bikini for CNN / YouTube debates
David Edwards and Will Menaker
Published : Friday July 20 , 2007 Print This Email This
For those looking to be haunted for the rest of the day look no further , for those of stronger mettle , behold : Larry King dancing in a bikini .
In a bizarre manner of self - promotion , Anderson Cooper 's 360 aired an animated clip that pasted Larry King 's head and trademark suspenders on a buxom bikini clad body while promoting CNN 's upcoming YouTube debate , where people can submit questions via YouTube to be asked of the 2008 presidential candidates .
Either embarrassed or feigning shock , Cooper promised that , " whoever put that in there will be dealt with . "
He then played a clip of a single teenage mother asking who will raise the minimum wage so she can support her child .
The following video is from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 , broadcast on July 19 .
When Cody Cawood was 3 years old , he knew all his colors and proudly boasted that he could count to 20 .
His grandmother , Mary Beth Staab — “ Beth ” to her friends — a bright woman with more energy than a Kansas tornado , would hop the few short blocks to her grandson ’s house to help him practice his numbers and his letters every single day .
Cody delighted in a mischievous game of reciting all the way up to 19 only to announce 20 as “ 20 - teen , ” whereupon he would burst into uproarious laughter , even after the joke had been repeated for weeks .
Beth would then pretend to protest , Cody would laugh some more , and they would ritualistically start all over from the very beginning .
Born two and a half months premature , and with cerebral palsy , Cody overcame his challenges , according to Beth , “ with a little bit of his mom and dad ’s stubbornness . ”
At Kids ’ Cove , a local school for children with disabilities , Cody was curious , loved to talk , and made fast friends .
“ He had an infectious personality , ” Beth recalls .
It was shortly after Cody ’s fourth birthday , in October 2000 , that Sara , his mother , found Cody lying in a pool of his own vomit .
First his mother suspected that it was the flu .
Without real reason for alarm , Sara simply catered to Cody , as any mother would her sick child .
But a week later , when the episode repeated itself , Sara noticed a distinct and troublesome characteristic in his behavior .
It was understandable that a sick child would be lethargic , but he also had a glassy , distant look in his eyes , and he was not speaking , just staring and dazed .
Sara urged her son to try to go to school , but the only response he could offer was his lazy , hollow gaze falling upon hers .
When she called Cody ’s new pediatrician and relayed the problems , she was told not to worry .
After all , children with cerebral palsy were prone to stomach difficulties , the doctor said .
Cody would be fine .
This clearly was n’t the case .
Over the next two weeks , Sara and Beth began to notice a change in Cody ’s speech .
Sentences were now replaced with a single word , a distinct regression for a chatty 4 - year - old .
Instead of his usual “ I want a Coke , ” he would just say “ drink ” ; “ want to go outside and play ” was replaced with “ bye , ” and “ I want to go to sleep ” was now one single word : “ nightie . ”
The third week of Cody ’s strange illness brought them more mornings of sickness , sweating , and lethargy .
Suddenly now , there was an added feature , frightening and horrific .
When asked what was wrong , Cody would turn and bang his head against a wall .
If asked a question , he would stop , cry , and start beating himself with force .
By December of that same year , Cody did n’t utter a single word .
His only modes of expression were violence , confusion , and tears .
Auspiciously , Beth worked for a pediatric neurologist , Samira el - Zind , who performed an EEG , an MRI , and a series of other tests on Cody .
The MRI showed no changes ; the EEG showed the same abnormal electrical impulses in the left occipital region that had been there ever since he ’d suffered a stroke in utero .
The doctor did notice some abnormal right and left central spike wave activity , and in addition to Cody ’s prescribed anticonvulsant medication Depakote , she put him on Tegretol .
But nothing seemed to work .
Cody ’s behavior worsened quickly .
The hitting became more rageful , and now no one could get close to Cody without being punched or even bitten .
That January and February saw a desperate course of trial and error as Cody visited a round of doctors and specialists who prescribed a number of different medications , none of which brought Cody closer to his old self .
Schooling was now becoming a serious obstacle , as teachers did n’t know how to handle him , and he had to wear a helmet at all times to protect himself from his own furious , beating fists .
By March , Cody seemed to have no memory of language and meaning and would only occasionally parrot a random word he ’d heard in the conversations around him .
His family took advantage of their quiet time with Cody and would try to ease him into the same conversations he ’d had just six months earlier : “ What ’s your favorite color ?
Do you want to count to 20 ? ” But Cody seemed incapable of ever responding verbally .
A look of confusion would fall over his sad face , followed by the inevitable hitting , screaming , and biting .
There was no such thing as an ordinary day for those who cared for Cody .
Once when Sara was driving him to school , he beat himself so badly that blood ran down his face .
Sara pulled the car over , got into the backseat , and held his hands to try to calm him down .
Meanwhile , some onlookers were watching , suspicious of her actions , as though she ’d harmed her own child .
Within minutes , a police officer arrived .
“ My son hits himself , ” she told the officer .
But he did n’t believe her and ordered Sara to let go of Cody .
When she did so , Cody exploded in a fit of fury .
Even so , the officer was n’t convinced .
Sara urged him to follow her to Kids ’
Cove , where the officer interrogated the principal about Cody and his mother and , after being assured of Cody ’s condition , told Sara he would “ let it go . ”
In September of 2000 , Sara had just entered nursing school , and the combination of classes and Cody ’s illness brought her to the point of exhaustion .
There seemed to be no preventing his rages .
At one point , Sara and Beth considered handing Cody over to the state of Kansas so that his medical bills would be taken care of , but in the end Sara just could n’t bring herself to give up her only child .
On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , Cody bit a nurse ’s finger so hard he broke the bone , and he would n’t stop screaming and beating himself , even through the early afternoon .
Beth arrived at school to pick him up and said he was like a “ crazed animal . ”
Sara and Beth held Cody down and tried to calm him all evening , but by 9:30 that night they were out of options .
Beth , still working for the pediatric neurologist Samira el - Zind , called the doctor in hysterics , asking to be seen right away : “ Something has to be done for this poor child !
He ’s going mad right in front of us ! ”
When they met the doctor at Wesley Medical Center , Cody was immediately put on the sedative Ativan , without any results .
Doctors then tried a heavier sedative , Nembutal .
There seemed to be no stopping the biting , hitting , and screaming .
The next morning happened to be Sara ’s final exam in nursing , and so Beth sent her home just after midnight , as the doctors were administering a heavy dose of Thorazine .
The Thorazine , without effect , was followed up by lithium , which also proved futile .
At 2:30 a.m. the doctors finally found an effective medication , the tranquilizer Haldol .
The doctor was worried that all these medications might make Cody unable to breathe on his own , but by 6:30 Cody was up and fighting , just as before .
The hospital called in Mark Romereim , a pediatric psychiatrist , who ordered Cody to be put on Risperdal , eventually increasing Cody ’s dosage to that of an average adult .
Kore Liow , an epileptologist , was then called in to consult .
He ordered a video EEG at the Epilepsy Center and , after five days of monitoring Cody , diagnosed him with Landau - Kleffner syndrome .
No one in Cody ’s family had heard of Landau - Kleffner syndrome ( LKS ) .
A disorder in children often occurring between the ages of 3 and 7 , LKS affects the child ’s ability to understand and use language .
All children with LKS suffer from abnormal electrical brain waves , just like those in Cody ’s EEG .
These children may suffer epileptic seizures at night , hence Cody ’s awakening sick and dazed .
Hypersensitivity and aggression can accompany the disorder .
Before there was LKS , there was William M. Landau , neurologist , and Frank R. Kleffner , speech pathologist , two doctors who observed six children with acquired aphasia and convulsive disorder at the Central Institute for the Deaf .
Landau and Kleffner studied the effects of drug and speech treatment on the children , noting in their summary : “ In all cases a severe paroxysmal electroencephalographic abnormality , usually diffuse , is observed ; electroencephalographic improvement tends to parallel improvement in speech re-education . ”
“ Syndrome of Acquired Aphasia With Convulsive Disorder in Children ” was published in 1957 — 50 years ago this month — and caused quite a stir , opening the door for some 160 diagnoses between 1957 and 1990 .
It was Landau , along with John F. Mantovani , M.D. , who published a follow - up study in 1980 of nine patients evaluated 10 to 28 years after the onset of LKS ; the first six were from the original Landau - Kleffner study .
Landau , who is still practicing at Washington University School of Medicine , wishes more progress had been made over the past five decades .
“ I ’m glad to have survived the past 50 years , ” he says , wryly , but adds : “ I ’m very discouraged — we have n’t learned much at all .
We know nothing about cause yet . ”
In terms of what went wrong , he says : “ I think research has not been done adequately .
We need multi-institutional organization of research programs that will examine potential causes and potential treatment in a systematic way .
I ’d like to tease the current population of potential investigators to get off their butts . ”
“ The hallmark feature of Landau - Kleffner syndrome is a loss of receptive and expressive speech and language skills , ” says Sharon Willig , associate director of speech - language pathology for the American Speech - Language - Hearing Association ( ASHA ) .
The inability of those affected to understand the spoken word eventually hinders their own language skills , thereby rendering most of these children gradually or suddenly mute .
It ’s for this reason that LKS children are often misidentified as developmentally delayed or possibly hearing impaired .

As with many other epileptic syndromes , LKS children often resume normal brain activity around age 15 , when the brain cells are reaching toward maturation , perhaps spurred by hormonal change .
Unlike similar conditions , children with LKS are often left with neurological impairments , even after the electrical abnormalities have returned to normal .
The neurological effects of LKS on a child can range anywhere from minimal to severe .
For their parents , it ’s the hardest waiting game they ’ll ever have to play .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s mysterious , but it sure is obscure , ” says Kleffner , who prefers to be called “ Frank . ”
Retired since 1991 , Kleffner , now 82 , moved on from LKS years ago and now finds it “ at times a nuisance . ”
Of his famed publication he says with humility , “ I really did n’t think at the time it was any great accomplishment . ”
He credits Landau as being the foreseer of its impending significance , the real pioneer .
“ A few years after our paper , we got labeled a syndrome , ” he says , emphasizing the last word of his sentence with slight disdain .
“ I got a call from Landau one day asking me if I ’d heard of Landau - Kleffner syndrome , and I thought he was kidding .
Apparently he ’d found it in a medical journal ! ”
Kleffner now considers LKS “ a badge of eponymic ignorance [ the title of a paper by Landau ] .
We do n’t know much more now than we did then . ”
To even attempt to research and write an article of this kind just “ opens up a can of worms . . . you ’re only going to come up with loose ends . ”
Decades of continuous speculation have caused many scientists to refrain from offering opinions on LKS ’s cause and curability .
One doctor who remains undeterred is Josiane LaJoie , a pediatric neurologist specializing in epilepsy surgery and treatment at New York University Medical Center .
LaJoie has treated patients with LKS since 1999 and believes these children have an “ inherent brain susceptibility .
There is activation of abnormal circuits in the brain that prevent the normal function of the affected brain cells .
The presence of these abnormal circuits may also inhibit the natural process of removal of unnecessary developing brain cells known as pruning .
While we are asleep , the events and the experiences of the day are recorded as memory .
The abnormal brain circuitry of LKS patients renders the brain incapable of imprinting memory , further impairing brain function .
The areas affected are primarily responsible for speech . ”
The past 50 years of study and research have brought few concrete answers .
“ Much has changed since that landmark paper was published in 1957 , ” LaJoie says .
“ We have subsequently learned that similar EEG findings can be found in a variety of patients with different clinical symptoms .
Because of this , the margins of what defines a clear - cut LKS patient have been blurred . ”
Kleffner himself , in his interview for this article , agreed , expressing concern that many LKS children were actually misdiagnosed .
“ Some use the term LKS to describe any patient with either language regression and / or EEG findings similar to those in LKS , ” LaJoie continued .
“ These patients may also have other symptoms not found in the typical patient with LKS .
It is well known that children on the autistic spectrum can also undergo a similar regression and have EEG findings similar to those found in LKS patients .
There is much debate about whether these patients should be classified as LKS or a variant of LKS .
Just as with any medical condition , there is a spectrum of clinical symptoms among LKS .
With increased awareness of vast possibilities of presentation of these patients , more patients are properly diagnosed and treated .
However , not every patient will follow exact guidelines , making clinical decisions and classifications more difficult . ”
LaJoie believes that steroids are the best treatment for a patient ’s language issues .
“ If unsuccessful , ” she adds , “ other options include intravenous immunoglobulin therapy or possibly surgery .
Multiple subpial transections [ MSTs ] are a type of disconnection procedure that allows the preservation of function of brain cells but prevents the spread of abnormal electrical impulses .
MSTs have been found to be helpful in the recovery of language in LKS patients .
Although MSTs are as invasive as they are controversial , it is sometimes a child ’s best chance at a functional recovery . ”
As for the future , LaJoie believes that magnetoencephalography , a technique that records the magnetic activity in the brain and helps determine the origin of the seizures , may be beneficial .
“ Well - ­designed research protocols are needed in order to better evaluate the effectiveness of various therapeutic interventions , ” she says .
“ With more research we will be better able to determine which patients should be referred for surgery quickly .
I believe that we will be more aggressive in treating these patients and possibly intervening surgically much sooner , thereby optimizing their neurological outcome . ”
The outcome for LKS kids is decidedly varied , but aggressive speech and language treatment is a course of action that all specialists seem to agree on .
The later the onset of LKS , and the more language development they achieve in their early years , the better .
Children who have learned to read and write before the onset of aphasia can sometimes continue reading and writing even after their verbal skills seem to have disintegrated .
Some children develop communication akin to sign language .
“ For children who are nonverbal as a result of Landau - Kleffner syndrome , ” says Sharon Willig of ASHA , “ speech - language pathologists can recommend and provide assistance with the use of augmentative or alternative forms of communication , such as sign language , communication boards , or speech - generating devices .
These communication systems are used in conjunction with verbal language treatment . ”
Patricia Prelock , professor and chairwoman of the Department of Communication Sciences at the University of Vermont , conducts treatment research for children with autism spectrum disorders , focusing on supporting their social skill development , a theory of mind , and peer interactions .
Her approach is to avoid a prescribed therapy for every child and make things personal .
“ As opposed to looking at LKS alone , we found it very useful to consider who the child is in the context of their family , school , and community and what the child ’s strengths and unique challenges are , building on their strengths while accommodating their challenges . ”
The enigmatic nature of LKS leaves parents scrambling for answers their doctors can’t provide .
Working to alleviate that problem is Friends of Landau - Kleffner Syndrome ( FOLKS ) , a U.K. - based nonprofit organization dedicated to providing information and promoting research studies , which they publish online .
Run by a volunteer committee of parents with LKS children , FOLKS aims to fulfill the need for LKS information among parents and medical professionals worldwide , serving about 300 members .
Richard Budnyj took over as the secretary of FOLKS in 2003 .
“ The biggest issue , ” Budnyj says , “ is that unlike with many illnesses , our children look ‘ normal ’ and therefore are mistaken as children with a behavioral problem . ”
Budnyj should know .
His own son ’s LKS was diagnosed at age 3 .
He went through four regressions of speech and language , losing every word he knew .
To control the boy ’s severe epileptic seizures , doctors put him into a coma .
It seemed to help .
Four years later , he ’s a happy sports lover with a fantastic sense of humor .
“ He may still be behind about two years on speech and language , and he may never end up being the brightest child , ” says Budnyj , and then , gratefully , “ but he has gone four years without further regressions .
His next few years will be crucial to his development and what the future holds .
All we can do is hope he continues to progress . ”
Budnyj believes in accentuating the positive : “ I do n’t know what the future holds for any of the children with LKS , but we can look to examples that give us hope . ”
Somewhere in the middle of Montana , a 52 - year - old mother of two is proudly in the midst of her second career , as a cattle rancher .
Her first , motherhood , garnered two accomplished children now in their midtwenties ; the elder , a daughter , is now a practicing attorney , and the younger son is still in law school .
“ I ’ve had a very lucky life , ” she says in a strong , affable tone .
Though she prefers to remain unnamed , LKS researchers would know her best as “ patient # 7 ” from Mantovani and Landau ’s follow - up study .
At 5 years old she was a talkative child , but then at 5½ , at the onset of LKS , she began to stutter .
“ It ’s strange , ” she says , her voice clear with an enviable resonance , like that of a broadcaster , “ this ‘ brain thing ’ happened so long ago , and it ’s still a part of my life . ”
She remembers that time as mere “ snatches ” of memory and sensations .
“ It was as though I could hear things — they would come in , and come out garbled , ” she describes .
Performing the EEGs then was a “ very pokey ” process — harsh tips were pressed into her young scalp .
Her treatment took place at the Central Institute for the Deaf , where she attended weekly sessions to learn how to read , write , and talk , a frustrating challenge she remembers well .
“ I still have the notebooks and the flashcards with pictures of a chair or meatloaf — I had to relearn how to speak , ” she says .
She was treated by Landau until she was about 16 , then attended a Missouri state school and married her college sweetheart .
“ I had a relatively normal life , ” she says , and then , introspectively , “ but I knew I was different .
I felt different from the other kids I went to school with . ”
Truth be told , LKS children are different .
They are as mysterious as they are rare , stumping medical science and allowing half a century to race by with few definitive answers .
However , there ’s a lot to be learned from these children and the saintlike disposition required to treat , approach , and care for them .
“ We all take spoken language for granted , ” says LaJoie .
“ We wake up , say good morning to our family , and are able to express our wants , needs , and emotions .
Communication allows us to form connections with one another .
Imagine that one day you were unable to connect with your loved ones with spoken language .
Think of the feeling of being locked in without any clue how to get out .
Think of the anxiety and frustration that you would feel .
This is what these children go through .
Often , these children are dismissed too quickly .
However , with a modicum of time and attention , one can see a young child who desperately wants to be heard .
The impact of the depth of their impairments not only on the child but on their entire family underlines the need to find a permanent treatment and cure for this condition . ”
As for Cody , seven years after the onset of LKS , doctors have n’t noticed any significant progress , and as of now , his family is planning to put him in adult handicapped housing when he finishes school at age 21 .
“ I have a picture of Cody when he was a little boy at Kids ’
Cove climbing up the big chain - link fence that surrounded the playground , ” Beth says .
“ Now he does n’t even know what a fence is . ”
It ’s still too early to determine if Cody will follow in the footsteps of many LKS kids or if his EEG will return to normal around age 15 and , even if it does , what the effects of living with LKS will be .
For now , those who love Cody are remaining hopeful and taking each day in stride .
“ At 11 years old , he still loves for me to rock him on my lap , just like when he was a baby , ” says his grandmother with a smile .

So , my family ’s car - buying saga continues .
Last we left off , my husband and I had walked away from purchasing a used Volkswagen Passat station wagon to replace our 15 - year - old Honda Accord , rather than sign a contract waiving our right to sue the car dealer and finance company in court if they ripped us off .
The car salesman warned us that we would n’t be able to buy a car anywhere without signing a contract containing this arbitration clause , as it ’s known .
Even so , we were indignant and vowed to shop on Craigslist .
As it turns out , the salesman knew what he was talking about .
Craiglist is great so long as you ’re looking for a car as old as the one we ’re trying to get rid of .
But the car we wanted , a Toyota Highlander Hybrid , can scarcely be found used .
( We dropped our search for a Passat after Consumer Reports downgraded it for reliability reasons . )
So we returned to the car dealer world , vowing not to set foot into any dealership that used an arbitration clause in its sales documents .
I contacted a half - dozen car dealerships in the Washington , D.C. area and asked them in advance if their contracts included an arbitration clause , and if so , if they ’d take it out .
All the dealers used the clause , and none would remove it .
In response to my queries , I received emails like this one :
“ I am sure you already know that we cannot take the arbitration clause out …. sorry …. but one thing I can tell you …Koons has been in the ‘ car business ’ for many many years …we want to be professional and fair … and we do not have very many instances where arbitration has been exercised .
We want HAPPY and LOYAL customers …. and you have to take care of people THE RIGHT WAY to have happy and loyal customers !
I have been here nearly seven years now …and I have MANY repeat customers …… people who want a Toyota …. and do not shop ANYWHERE ELSE !! ”
Or this one :
“ I honestly do n’t think your going to find a dealership that will eliminate the arbitration clause . ”
After another month of searching for our car , we were less indignant and more despondent .
Finally , during my daily check of cars.com , I came across a regular guy who was selling the car we wanted .
The only catch was that he lived in West Virginia , more than 100 miles away .
But we figured it was worth it .
My husband drove out to see the car on a Sunday morning .
It seemed fine , the price was right , and the seller seemed far more honest than any of the dealers we ’d talked with .
So we arranged for a loan through our bank , shopped around for new insurance — which I learned is also a racket — and were ready to purchase our new wheels .
Or so we thought .
Later that week , the seller drove the car into D.C. and met my husband at our bank .
Not long afterwards , I got a call from my husband .
“ There ’s an arbitration clause in the loan documents , ” he said .
“ What should I do ? ”
I half - joked that he should tell the bank he was in the National Guard .
Congress passed legislation limiting such clauses in lending contracts with military members , but it only applies to loans with interest rates above 36 percent , which this definitely was n’t .
A lawyer had once told me you could get around an arbitration clause by scribbling it out , initialing it , and hoping the bank did n’t notice .
But the vast majority of the loan document was the arbitration clause , making such a stealth move virtually impossible .
Arguing with the bank officer was equally useless .
She had no power to even get the paperwork out of Atlanta , or Charleston or wherever it was coming from , much less negotiate new terms .
The bank agreement was worse than the sales contract we ’d walked away from a month earlier at the dealership .
You can read the whole thing here ( PDF ) .
Essentially , if we signed it , we would be forced to submit to mandatory binding arbitration through a private firm hired by the bank , should a dispute arise .
We would n’t be able to sue SunTrust if the bank defrauded us or illegally repossessed our car .
We ’d have to give up our right to be part of a class action against the bank over any future rip - offs , and we would n’t have any of the usual rights to discovery and appeal .
Most importantly , we ’d never get to have a jury hear our case .
As former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes testified before Congress in October , a mandatory arbitration clause is “ a contract for a crime . ”
It ’s a sign that the bank knows it ’s going to rip us off in some fashion , or if not us specifically , people like us , and it does n’t want to pay if it gets caught .
Talking to my husband on the phone , I pictured the guy from West Virginia sitting there , thinking we were nuts for making a big deal out of this .
He had a divorce to finalize and just wanted to sell his car .
I started to rationalize .
The bank , SunTrust , is not likely to be as scummy as the car dealerships , right ?
They were n’t going to be messing with the odometer .
But they could mess with our credit , nickel and dime us on hidden and potentially illegal fees , or illegally repo our car .
In the end , though , it did n’t matter what I thought , because we did n’t have a choice .
Aside from a few small credit unions , of which we are not members , there are no banks left that will loan money without requiring borrowers to sign an arbitration clause .
And , competition in banking really does n’t exist .
In D.C. , a mere three banks , including SunTrust , dominate more than 60 percent of the market , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
When I had inquired about a car loan from another bank , PNC , they tried to talk me into taking out a home equity loan to pay for the car , so they could take my house if I missed a few car - payments , hardly an appealing alternative .
In legal terms , we were discovering that there is no meaningful choice in the marketplace .
There was nowhere else for us to go .
It is practically impossible to buy a car or borrow money without signing away your right to have a dispute heard by a jury , a right so fundamental to American democracy that it ’s in the 7th Amendment .
The Founding Fathers almost did n’t ratify the Constitution because the original version did not include the right to a civil jury trial .
But large corporations have all but wiped out the 7th amendment through contract language that never was put to a legislative body for vote .
We the people did not ask for this .
Market purists argue that consumers like arbitration clauses because they make goods and services cheaper by reducing the cost of litigation to the company .
While I do n’t have any data , my gut tells me that the arbitration clause did not reduce the cost of my car loan , which at 8.99 percent was no bargain .
Free market legal scholars like Ted Frank of the American Enterprise Institute also defend arbitration clauses by saying that this is a free country , an enormous economy .
There are choices .
After all , we could buy an old , cheaper car from an individual seller , for cash , if we looked hard enough .
But is that really a choice ?
The only reason we were buying a new ( used ) car is because the old one is simply not safe enough .
It runs just fine , gets decent mileage , and has an enormous trunk that comfortably holds all our stuff .
But it does n’t even have a passenger - side airbag .
The driver death rate for a 1993 Honda Accord is 60 per million registered cars , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety ( PDF ) .
The fatality rate for the car we were about to buy is only 14 .
This purchase for us was , literally , a matter of life and death .
If someone in my family were to get seriously injured or killed in a car accident that could have been avoided had we signed an arbitration clause , I would never forgive myself .
So we signed .
We traded a constitutional right we hope we ’ll never need for multiple air bags we also hope to never need .
Soon you ’ll be able to find our old car on Craigslist ( $ 2500 as is ) .
But I promise :
If you buy it , we wo n’t make you sign an arbitration clause .
Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers have developed a small molecule that can turn the survival signal for a variety of cancer cells into a death signal .
The molecule mimics the activity of Smac , a protein that triggers the suicide of some types of cancer cells .
The researchers say their findings suggest that Smac- mimetic compounds could be useful as targeted cancer treatments for lung and other cancers .
Such therapy may be less toxic to healthy cells than current compounds used in cancer chemotherapy .
The researchers , led by Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator Xiaodong Wang , published their findings in the November , 2007 , issue of the journal Cancer Cell .
Wang is at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center .
Cells that are defective or that become unnecessary during growth and development are induced to commit suicide through a finely balanced process known as apoptosis , or programmed cell death .
A protein called Smac , which is a shortened version of " second mitochondria - derived activator of apoptosis , " is a part of the cell 's programmed cell death machinery .
When that machinery is switched on , Smac is released from the mitochondria and triggers the pathway that kills damaged or abnormal cells .
Cancer cells , however , can survive Smac 's death signal by switching off the apoptotic machinery .
To see if they could get around this problem , Wang and other researchers have developed small - molecule mimetics of Smac that can enter the cell and trigger apoptosis .
These mimetic molecules do their damage without the need for the Smac signal from the mitochondria .
In earlier studies , Wang and his colleagues found that a Smac mimetic that they developed in the lab could kill cancer cells in culture .
But they found that the cancer cells are only killed when the mimetic molecule is introduced in conjunction with another component of the apoptotic machinery known as TNFá .
In the new studies published in Cancer Cell , Wang and his colleagues found that a significant percentage of human non-small - cell lung cancer cell lines were sensitive to treatment by the Smac mimetic alone .
When the researchers introduced those sensitive cells into mice and allowed them to produce tumors , they found that the Smac mimetic caused the tumors to regress and , in some cases , even disappear .
" These findings made us wonder what it was about these cell lines that made them sensitive to the Smac mimetic alone , " said Wang .
" Cancer cells are hard to kill , but these cell lines seemed to have already become sensitized to apoptosis . "
The researchers ' studies revealed that the sensitive cell lines produced their own TNFá , so they were already " primed " for apoptosis .
The paradox , said Wang , is that TNFá signaling is also part of a complex pathway that gives cancer cells a " survival " signal , offering them a growth advantage .
The researchers also found that some breast cancer and melanoma cell lines were sensitive to the Smac mimetic alone .
" Thus , in these cancer cell lines , the TNFá survival advantage turns out to be a fatal flaw , because the same pathway can be switched to apoptosis by Smac mimetics , " said Wang .
" So , for some cancers , we might be able to use Smac mimetics as a single treatment agent .
And we can use the presence of TNFá as a marker to tell us which tumors will respond to the Smac mimetic alone . "
" People have been suspecting for a long time that some cancer cells may somehow turn on their apoptotic pathway already , " said Wang .
" And now we know what pathway they turn on and why .
We can take advantage of this phenomenon for potential cancer therapy by switching a signal into a deadly one with Smac mimetics . "

Twice As Many Die
Bush 's Duplicitous New AIDS Plan
Brook K. Baker
This article is from the Spring 2007 issue of Dollars & Sense : The Magazine of Economic Justice available at http://www.dollarsandsense.org
This article is from the July / August 2007 issue of Dollars & Sense magazine .
The United States , the rest of the G - 8 group of industrialized nations , and the U.N. General Assembly have all committed to achieving virtually universal access to AIDS treatment worldwide by 2010 .
This means providing antiretroviral therapy to 9.8 million people by that date .
To do so , and to maintain universal access for those newly needing treatment each year thereafter , will require nearly tripling the number of new patients entering treatment annually : from 700,000 to 2 million .
Meeting this goal will , in turn , require major investments in health care capacity , especially in Africa .
In contrast to this bold but achievable goal , President Bush has announced a misleading plan to �double� spending on the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) : from $ 15 billion in total from 2004 - 2008 to $ 30 billion from 2009 - 2013 .
Bush 's simple math tells a complex lie .
Not only does the president 's new plan fail to double spending compared to the first five years of PEPFAR .
It also fails to meet the president 's stated promise to double the number of people on treatment , and comes nowhere near the United States ' fair contribution to the global sum necessary to make the commitment to universal access a reality .
The only number that truly doubles under Bush 's PEPFAR II proposal is the number of people who will die of AIDS from 2007 through 2013 �from a tragic - enough 11 million under the internationally recognized universal access scenario , to an unforgivable 22.4 million under the Bush plan .
For example , far from doubling U.S. spending on AIDS prevention and treatment abroad , Bush 's PEPFAR II offer of $ 30 billion over five years represents only about a 59 % increase over the United States ' actual international AIDS spending over the five years of PEPFAR I , which have come to about $ 18.85 billion .
In fact , his plan flatlines the current U.S. spending level : Congressional committees have proposed $ 5.95 billion for international AIDS programming for fiscal year '08 ( Senate appropriations may bring the total even higher ) , and Bush 's PEPFAR II proposal keeps annual spending at $ 6 billion a year from 2009 to 2013 .
Likewise , the PEPFAR II proposal can hardly be said to double the number of people on treatment .
True , Bush 's press release talked about more than doubling the current number on treatment , 1.1 million , to 2.5 million by 2013 , but Bush 's original promise for PEPFAR I , which still has a year and a half to go , was that 2 million people would receive treatment by the end of 2008 .
Thus , Bush 's bold plan for 2009 - 2013 is to add a paltry half million to that number !
Here 's how to calculate the additional number of people with AIDS who will die prematurely under Bush 's new proposal , in comparison with the promise of universal access .
As of the end of 2006 , two million people with AIDS in low - and middle - income countries were receiving antiretroviral treatment .
Typically , patients need to begin treatment eight to ten years after they first become infected with HIV .
So we can estimate the number who will need to enter treatment annually from 2007 to 2013 based on estimates of how many people a year became infected in the late 1990s : four to five million .
( I 'll use the more conservative four million figure . )
To compare Bush 's proposal with universal access , we need to spell that scenario out .
Pragmatically , universal access will not mean 100 % coverage , but rather 75 % to 80 % coverage because of the stark realities of identifying people with late - stage AIDS and difficulties convincing people to accept treatment .
A reasonable scenario for building up to universal access by 2013 ( matching the final year of PEPFAR II ) would entail initiating treatment for 50 % of the people newly needing it each year from 2007 to 2010 and for 75 % beginning in 2011 .
This would put a cumulative total of 19 million people into treatment as of 2013 .
Assuming that premature death rates are close to 100 % for those who do not receive treatment , about 11 million people with AIDS in low - and middle - income countries would die over the seven - year period under this scenario .
In contrast , I estimate that under Bush 's plan for PEPFAR II , about 22.4 million people with AIDS in these countries will die over the same period .
Under the president 's PEPFAR II proposal , with its minuscule new investments , the number of people being placed on treatment will likely grow at a snail 's pace : from the current rate of 700,000 per year to 800,000 per year .
Moreover , Bush 's low - ball commitment will depress global expectations ; other donors and developing countries will probably match Bush 's half - measures .
Initiating treatment for only 800,000 new patients a year would put a cumulative total of 7.6 million into treatment as of 2013 .
Thus , about 11.4 more people with AIDS can be expected to die prematurely over the 2007 - 2013 period under Bush 's plan than under a pragmatic universal access scenario .
According to this real math , the death toll under the Bush plan doubles �and each of those extra 11.4 million deaths is not only regrettable , but preventable .
Obviously , these are oversimplified scenarios .
The U.N. HIV / AIDS Program ( UNAIDS ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) need to provide more accurate and sophisticated analyses .
For instance , these calculations do not take into account the fact that some people on treatment will die nonetheless , either because they start treatment too late or because of eventual treatment failure .
Likewise , they do not take into account slow uptake in testing , the impact of treatment on HIV transmission , or the eventual impact of stronger prevention campaigns .
At the same time , these scenarios do not take into account some factors that could significantly boost estimates of the number of people needing treatment , including a growing scientific consensus that treatment should start earlier in the course of the disease , before a critical cell count falls to the currently used benchmark .
This change alone could require a one - time boost in estimates of treatment need from the current estimates of 7.1 million now and 11 million in 2010 , to 10 million now and nearly 16 million in 2010 , according to a June 2007 UNAIDS report .
Likewise , future treatment may prove even more effective in suppressing replication of the virus , thus extending patients ' lives even longer .
A Real AIDS Agenda
Universal access faces real challenges .
People need to know their status and they need to know it earlier so that treatment can be started before the disease is too advanced to respond .
Developing countries need to make major investments in expanding human resources for health and in strengthening health systems .
Africa alone needs over a million new doctors , nurses , and midwives , and it needs a new cadre of paid community health workers as well .
Treatment rollout must extend from the easier - to - reach urban areas to harder - to - reach rural areas .
In addition , health facilities , health sector management , and procurement and distribution systems all have to be improved .
Sustaining treatment initiatives will require addressing the high cost of second - line therapies , which already threaten budgets in Brazil , Thailand , and other countries that succeeded early in providing relatively wide access to treatment .
Beyond these treatment - related challenges , AIDS - afflicted countries need to implement comprehensive structural and behavioral prevention programs that really work , and those programs have to expand in scope from the 20 % coverage typical today to 100 % coverage .
Unfortunately , instead of having the financial and technical resources and the political commitment to focus on these real problems �the true dilemmas of universal access �the people battling AIDS on the ground and their allies have to waste time responding to misleading pronouncements from politicians like George Bush who try to trick the press into thinking that twice as many deaths represents a doubling of the U.S. global AIDS effort .
According to UNAIDS , AIDS funding needs will rise from $ 22 billion in 2008 to $ 30 billion by 2010 , and , according to WHO , massive new investments are needed in health systems and in health personnel .
To really contribute to universal access , the United States must pay its true one - third fair share ( based on the size of the U.S. economy as a share of the global economy ) through PEPFAR II , its other bilateral AIDS programs , and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria .
Activists have to redouble our efforts to champion universal access and to condemn lies that undermine its achievement .
Instead of acquiescing to Bush 's let - them - die proposal , we need a five - year PEPFAR II that truly doubles global AIDS spending by the United States to over $ 50 billion and that commits to providing prevention , care , and treatment support for one - third of those in need .
In particular , we need presidential candidates and congressional leaders who will not blink at an $ 8 billion , then $ 10 billion , then $ 12 billion a year price tag , roughly what the United States spends in one week on the military .
Rather than being satisfied that Bush 's simple math and condition - ridden PEPFAR II proposal solves the global AIDS pandemic , U.S. leaders should step up to the plate and work with developing country partners to fund a sustainable and robust response to the world 's long - lasting and worst health crisis .

DAHUK , Iraq / CIZRE , Turkey ( Reuters ) - Turkish warplanes attacked a village in northern Iraq on Wednesday , an Iraqi Kurdish security official said , but Turkey said it wanted to hold back from a major incursion to give diplomacy a chance .
The Iraqi official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a Kurdish village in mountainous country near Shiranish Islam , 25 km ( 15 miles ) northeast of the northern town of Dahuk , had been heavily bombed at midday .
He gave no details of damage .
The Turkish government is under great domestic pressure to strike separatist PKK ( Kurdistan Workers Party ) guerrillas in northern Iraq who killed 12 Turkish soldiers on Sunday as part of an intensified campaign against government troops .
Washington and Baghdad fear a major Turkish incursion into northern Iraq could destabilize the whole region .
Turkish security sources said earlier that Turkish warplanes had flown a series of sorties 20 km ( 12 miles ) into Iraq in the past three days , while some 300 troops had advanced about 10 km ( 6 miles ) into northern Iraq .
A total of 34 PKK rebels were killed and all the Turkish troops had returned , a Turkish official said .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Wednesday that Turkey needed better intelligence about the location of Kurdish rebels before launching major strikes into north Iraq , and the State Department said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice would visit Turkey to try to reduce tension between Turkey and Iraq .
Rice will be in Turkey on November 2 and 3 for meetings with President Abdullah Gul and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said in Washington .
ECONOMIC MEASURES
Turkey ’s powerful National Security Council , comprising political leaders and army top brass , met for six hours on Wednesday and said it had recommended that the government take economic measures against groups which aid the PKK .
It gave no details of possible measures , but northern Iraq depends heavily on Turkey for power , water and food supplies .
Turkey , which has NATO ’s second biggest army , has deployed up to 100,000 troops , backed by tanks , artillery , fighter jets and helicopter gunships along the mountainous border in case it decides on a large - scale strike .
State - run Anatolian news agency said Turkish warplanes and helicopters had bombed PKK positions in southeast Turkey on Wednesday .

The troop build - up was aimed at keeping pressure on Baghdad to honor promises to crack down on the estimated 3,000 PKK rebels who use northern Iraq as a base .
A Turkish official quoted Iraqi President Jalal Talabani as saying Iraq might hand over PKK militants to Turkey , but Talabani denied this .
“ We have said many times that the PKK leadership does not exist in Kurdish cities but are living with thousands of their fighters in the Qandil mountains , so it is not possible for us to arrest and hand them over to Turkey , ” he said in a statement .

LAST CHANCE FOR DIPLOMACY
The Turkish official said a planned visit to Ankara by an Iraqi delegation on Thursday was a “ final chance ” for diplomacy .
At Turkey ’s request , the team will be headed by Iraqi Defense Minister General Abdel Qader Jassim .
It will also include Iraqi National Security Minister Shirwan al Waeli .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer added to the calls on Ankara to stay its hand .
“ ... I think the Turkish government is showing restraint -- remarkable restraint under present circumstances , ” he told reporters at a meeting of the alliance ’s defense ministers .
Rice told the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday she had told Erdogan on Sunday that she took the situation “ extremely seriously ” .
“ Iraq should not be a place where terrorism can hurt Turkey , ” she said .
“ We have a list of things that we believe , if they are undertaken , will help to deal with this situation , ” she added , citing Iraq ’s pledge to close PKK offices there .
U.S. troops are largely absent from northern Iraq .
Ankara is skeptical about Baghdad ’s ability to crack down on the PKK as northern Iraq is a mainly Kurdish region where the central government has little clout .
The publication of photographs said to show eight Turkish soldiers captured by the PKK has added to pressure on Ankara to act .
The PKK said the soldiers were in good health but no decision had been made on whether to release them .
Ankara blames the PKK for the deaths of more than 30,000 people since the group launched its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984 .
Senate passes intelligence bill after Democrats back down on presidential briefings , CIA jails Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Friday October 5 , 2007

After a stalemate of over two years , the Senate passed the 2008 Intelligence Authorization bill Wednesday , with Democrats ceding a key provision regarding pre-war Iraq intelligence that Republicans had decried .
Sources close to the Senate Intelligence Committee say one of the compromises Democrats made to ensure the bills passage was to remove language demanding the White House turn over all Presidential Daily Briefings on Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion .
Democrats are said to have been hoping to establish whether President Bush mischaracterized intelligence in the lead - up to the conflict .
 The provision on the PDBs was dropped because Republicans objected and were blocking consideration of the bill ,  a Senate source said Wednesday .
The request for the PDBs , which also included briefings for President Clinton on Iraq , was part of what is known as Phase II of the Senate investigation into Iraq prewar intelligence , the source added .
Phase I of that investigation , which was released in 2004 , focused primarily on intelligence failures by the CIA , while Phase II focused on five specific areas of inquiry , only two of which have been released .
The PDBs were requested to determine whether public statements by the White House , as well as testimony and reports regarding Iraq 's alleged WMD program , were substantiated by intelligence information .
The inability of the Senate to pass the authorization bill in 2005 was the first time that had occurred in the nearly 30 years since the creation of the Intelligence Committee in 1975 following President Nixon 's resignation and the investigations that followed .
The 2006 version of the bill was blocked from Senate consideration by then - Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R - TN ) .
The main point of contention for Senate Republicans was , as now , the provision to require the White House to provide the PDBs on the Iraq war .
Another Senate source familiar with the bill said that the Democrats felt this was the only way they could get the bill passed , and avoid yet another failure of intelligence oversight .
Democrats also dropped a demand for the Director of Central Intelligence to identify and hand over documentation related to secret prisons run by the US government around the world and operations involving extraordinary rendition .
Sources tell RAW STORY that although Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell was not willing to provide the information to relevant oversight Senate committees , the Committee felt comfortable in removing the requirement from the authorization bill because the Director of Central Intelligence , General Michael Hayden , had given them everything we needed .
Effects of climate change on national security Another provision removed from the bill was a requirement for the Intelligence Community to study the effects of climate change on national security .
A Senate source close to the Intelligence Committee explained Thursday that the Committee had received a letter several weeks prior from the Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis , Dr. Thomas Fingar , assuring them that the Director of National Intelligence had begun the study .
Fingar purportedly said that they expect to publish their findings in early 2008 , Senate Democrats believe that they were given enough assurance that this matter was being looked into ,  said the source .
Dr. Fingar was not immediately available for comment .
The Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , Jay Rockefeller ( D - WV ) , issued praise late Wednesday for the passage of the bill , which now goes to the House - Senate Conference Committee .
 Intelligence Authorization bills are the most important way for Congress to weigh - in and have a voice on sensitive national security programs .
Given the controversial nature of some of these programs in recent years , it was absolutely critical for Congress to maintain its oversight , " Rockefeller said in a release .
" Sadly , for nearly 3 years , we were blocked from providing this important guidance and giving our intelligence officers the support they deserved .
The 2005 version of the authorization bill was blocked from being brought before the Senate by a hold by an anonymous  Republican Senator .
The main reason why Senate Republicans blocked the authorization from coming to the floor involved two key provisions in the language of the bill .
The first of those provisions , introduced by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) in an amendment , required the White House to turn over all Presidential Daily Briefings on Iraq WMD capabilities starting with the Clinton administration and going up to March of 2003 , when " Operation Iraqi Freedom " -- the Iraq war -- began .
Other provisions :
The provisions that made it into the final Senate version of the current authorization bill focused by and large on administrative and budgetary concerns .
The key provisions include language that : Changes the way personnel levels are authorized and gives the DNI the ability to exceed those ceilings by as much as five percent ;
Enables the DNI to fund information - sharing efforts that span across the Intelligence Community ;
Changes the requirements for reprogramming funds to make it easier to address emerging needs ;
Authorizes the DNI to use interagency funding to establish national intelligence centers ;
Establishes a contingency fund for the DNI to react to emergencies or unforeseen opportunities ;
Gives the DNI the authority and responsibility to conduct accountability reviews across the Intelligence Community if he deems it necessary or if requested by Congress ;
Creates a strong , independent Inspector General for the Intelligence Community confirmed by the Senate within the office of the DNI , and establishes statutory Inspectors General at the NSA , NRO , DIA and NGA ;
Requires Senate confirmation of the directors of the NSA , NRO and NGA establishing a Senate confirmed Deputy Director for the CIA ;
Requires the DNI to report on the implementation of the Detainee Treatment Act ;
Calls for an annual assessment of personnel levels across the Intelligence Community to include a statement that those levels are supported by adequate infrastructure , training and funding , and a review of the appropriate use of contractors ;
Requires a vulnerability assessment for all major acquisition programs ; and
Curbs cost overruns and schedule delays by creating an annual reporting system on all major Intelligence Community acquisitions similar .

There are a lot of Version Control Systems out there , and one of the biggest criteria in selecting one to use is who else uses it .
I ’ll try to quickly summarize what I have learned about the adoption of various VCSes .
There are many people who know more than me , but here ’s some of the bits that I ’ve picked up .
Perceived adoption from lots of reading
I have read many blog posts , comparisons , tutorials , news articles , reader comments ( in blogs and at news sites ) , and emails ( including various VCS project archives ) about version control systems .
In doing so , it is clear to me that some are frequently mentioned and deemed worthy of comparison by others , while many VCSes seem so obscure that they only appear in comparisons at sites that attempt to be exhaustive or completely objective ( e.g. at wikipedia ) .
Here are the ones I hear mentioned more frequently than others :
First rung : cvs , subversion , bazaar - ng ,
mercurial , tla/baz , and
git .
Though bazaar perhaps belongs in a rung below ( more on that in a minute ) .
There are also several VCSes that are still mentioned often , but not as often as the ones above :
Second rung : svk , monotone , darcs ,
codeville , perforce , clearcase ,
and bitkeeper .
tla / baz died a few years ago ( with both developers and users mostly abandoning it for other systems , though I hear tla got revived for maintenance - only changes ) .
Also , bazaar - ng really straddles these two levels rather than being in the upper one , but I was one of the early adopters and it has relatively strong support in the GNOME community so it ’s more relevant to me .
Perforce , clearcase , and bitkeeper are proprietary and thus irrelevant to me ( other than as a comparison point ) .
Adoption according to project records
Of the non -dead open source systems , here ’s a list of links to who uses them plus some comments on the links :
bazaar - ng – WhoUsesBzr – wiki page name is inconsistent ; it should be “ Projects UsingBzr ” ( compare to wiki page names below ) :-) .
The page is also slightly misleading ; they claim drupal as a user but my searches show otherwise ( turns out to just be a developer with an unofficial mirror ) .
Hopefully there are n’t other cases like this .

codeville – NoPage – I was n’t able to find any list of projects using codeville anywhere .
In fact , I was n’t able to find any projects claiming to use it either .
It must have shown up in other peoples ’ comparisons on the basis of its interesting merge algorithm .

cvs – NoPage – I do n’t have a good reference page , and it ’d likely go out - of - date quickly .
However , while CVS is no longer developed and projects are switching from CVS in droves these days , it was n’t very many years ago that cvs was ubiquitous and a near universal standard .
Nearly everyone familiar with at least one vcs is familiar with cvs , making it a useful reference point .
Also , it still has a pretty impressive installed base ; I ’m even forced to use it occasionally in the open source world as well as every day at work .

svk – Projects UsingSVK – claims WINE , KDE , and Ruby on Rails as users ; my simple searches showed otherwise ( likely svk developers just knew of developers from those projects hosting their own unofficial svk mirrors ) .
I do n’t know if their other claimed users are are accurate or not ; I only checked these three .
Some adoption pages point to both the project home page and the project repositories , which is very helpful .
The other adoption wiki pages should adopt that practice too , IMHO .
Adoption by “ Big ” users
Looking at the adoption pages listed above , each of the projects other than svk and codeville seem to have lots of users .
Mostly small projects , but most projects probably are are small and it is also easier for small projects to switch to a new VCS .
The real test is whether VCSes are also capable of supporting large projects .
I ’d like to compare on that basis , but I ’m unwilling to investigate how big each listed project is .
So , I ’ll instead compare based on ( a ) if I ’ve heard of the project before and know at least a little about it , and ( b ) I think of the project as big .
This results in the following list of “ big ” users of various VCSes :
bazaar - ng – This is kind of surprising , but Ubuntu is the only case matching my definition above .
As an added surprise , they are n’t in bzr ’s list of users .
( samba and drupal only have some unofficial users ; and in the case of samba , I know they also have unofficial git users .
Official adoption only for my comparison purposes ; otherwise GNOME and KDE would be in lots of lists . )

I would have possibly said none here , noting gaim , er , pidgin , as the closest but their stats suggest two projects ( Xaraya and OpenEmbedded ) are big…and that pidgin is bigger than I realized .
I guess I ’m changing my rules due to their cool use of stats .

Brief notes about each system
As a quick additional comparison point for those considering adoption , I ’ll add some very brief notes about each system that I ’ve gathered from my reading or experience with the system .
I ’ll try to list both a good point and a bad point for each .
Free / Open source VCSes bazaar - ng ( bzr ) – Developed and Evangelized by Canonical ( backers of the Ubuntu distribution ) .
Designed to be easy to use and distributed , and often gets praise for those features .
It received a bit of a black eye in the early days for being horribly slow ( it made cvs look like a speed demon in its early days ) , though I hear that the speed issues have received lots of attention and changes ( and brief recent usage seems to suggest that it ’s a lot better ) .
Annoyingly , it provides misleading and less - than - useful results when passing a date to diff ( the implemented behavior is well documented and apparently intentional , it ’s just crap ) .
codeville – Designed by Bram Cohen ( inventor of bittorrent ) .
People seem to find the merge algorithm introduced by codeville interesting .
Does n’t seem to have been adopted much , though , and it even appeared to have died for a while ( going a year and a half between releases , with other updates hard to find as well ) .
Seems to be picking back up again .
cvs –
The VCS that all other VCSes compare to , both because of its recent ubiquity and because its well known flaws are easy to leverage in promoting new alternatives .
The developers working on cvs decided its existing flaws could not be fixed without a rewrite , and thus created a new system called subversion .
cvs is inherently centralized .
darcs – Really interesting and claimed easy to use research system written by David Roundy ( some physicist at OSU ) that is based on patches rather than source trees .
I believe this allows , for example , merging between source trees that do not necessarily have common history ( touted as an advanced cherry - picking algorithm that no other VCS can yet match ) .
However , this design has an associated “ doppelganger ” bug that can cause darcs to become wedged and which requires care from the user to avoid .
From the descriptions of this bug , it sounds like something any big project would trigger all the time ( it ’s an operation I ’ve seen happen lots in my GNOME maintainence even on modestly sized projects like metacity . )
However , developers apparently can avoid this bug if they know about it and take steps to actively avoid triggering it .
I think this is related to “ the conflict bug ” , which can cause darcs to be slow on large repository merging , but am not sure .
git – Invented by Linus Torvalds ( inventor of the linux kernel ) .
It has amazed a lot of people ( including me ) with its speed , and there are many benchmarks out there that are pretty impressive .
I ’ve heard / seen people claim that it is at least an order of magnitude faster than all other VCSes they ’ve tried ( from people who then list most all the major VCSes people think of as fast among the list of VCSes they ’ve tried ) .
It also has lots of interesting advanced features .
However , versions prior to 1.5 were effectively unusable , requiring superhuman ability to learn how to use .
The UI warts are being hammered away and git > 1.5 is much better usability - wise ; it ’s now becoming a usable system once users first learn and understand a few differences from other systems , despite its few remaining warts here and there .
The online tutorials have transformed into something welcoming for new users , though the man pages ( which double as the built in “ –help ” system ) still remind me more of academic research articles written for a community of existing experts rather than user documentation .
Also , no official port to windows ( without cygwin ) exists yet , though one is apparently getting close .
Interestingly , git seems to be highly preferred as a VCS among those I consider low - level hackers .
GNU Arch ( tla / baz ) – Invented by Tom Lord ( who also tried to replace libc with his own rewrite ) .
Both tla and baz are dead now with developers and users having moved on , for the most part .
Proponents of these systems ( particularly Tom ) loudly evangelized the merits of distributed version control systems , which probably backfired since tla / baz were so horribly awful in terms of usability , complexity , quirkiness , and speed that these particular distributed VCSes really did n’t have any redeeming qualities or even salvagable pieces .
( baz was written as a fork designed to make a usable tla which was backward compatible to tla ; the developers eventually gave up and switched to bzr since this was an impossible goal . )
I really wish I had the part of my life back I wasted learning and using these systems .
And no , I do n’t care about impartiality when it comes to them .
mercurial ( hg ) – Written by Matt Mackall ( linux kernel developer ) .
Started two days after git , it was designed to replace bitkeeper as the VCS for the kernel .
Thus , like git , it focused on speed .
While not as fast as git in most benchmarks I ’ve seen , it has received lots of praise for being easier to learn , having more accessible documentation , working on Windows , and still being faster than most other VCSes .
The community behind mercurial seems to be a bit smaller , however : it does n’t have nearly as many plugins as bzr or git ( let alone cvs or svn ) .
Also , it annoyingly does n’t accept a date as an argument to diff , unlike all the other major VCSes .
monotone ( mtn ) – Maintained by Nathaniel Smith and Graydon Hoare ( who I do n’t know of from elsewhere ) .
The main thing I hear about this system is about it ’s ideas to focus on authentication of history to verify repository contents and changes .
These ideas influenced and were adopted by git and mercurial .
On the con side , it appears getting an initial copy can take an extraordinarily large amount of time ; for example , if you look at the developer site for pidgin you ’ll note that they provide detailed steps on how to get a checkout of pidgin that involves bypassing monotone since it ’s too slow to handle this on its own .
subversion ( svn ) – Designed by former cvs maintainers to “ be a better cvs ” .
It does n’t suffer from many of the same warts as CVS ; e.g. commits are atomic , files can be renamed without messing up project history , changes are per-commit rather than per - commit - per - file , and a number of operations are much faster than in cvs .
Most users ( myself included ) feel that it is much nicer than CVS .
Like CVS , svn remains inherently centralized and has no useful merge feature .
Unlike CVS , half the point of tagging is inherently broken in svn as far as I can tell [ *]
( you ca n’t pass a tag to svn diff ; you have to search the log trying to find the revision from which the tag was created and then use whatever revision you think is right as the revision number in svn diff ) .
svk – Invented by Chia-liang Kao and now developed by Best Practical Solutions ( some random company ) .
Designed to use the subversion repository format but allow decentralized actions .
I know little about their system and am hesitant to comment as I ca n’t think of any good comments I ’ve heard ( nor more than a couple bad ones . )
However , on the light side of things , I absolutely love their SVKAntiFUD page .
On that page , in response to the question “ svk is built on top of subversion , is n’t it over - engineered and fragile ? ” an additional note to the answer ( claimed to have been added in 2005 ) states that “ Spaghetti code can certainly not be called over - engineered . ”
While the history page of their wiki suggests it has been there for at least a year , I ’m guessing the maintainers do n’t know about this comment and will remove it as soon as someone points it out to them .
Proprietary ( i.e. included only for comparison purposes ) VCSes bitkeeper – A system developed by BitMover Inc. , founded by Larry McVoy .
Gained prominence from its usage for a few years by the linux kernel .
“ Free Use ” ( as in no monetary cost ) of the system by open source projects was revoked when Andrew Tridgell started reverse engineering the protocol ( by telnetting to a server and typing “ help ” ) .
Most users of this system seem to like it technically , but the free / open source crowd understandably often disliked its proprietary nature .
I have n’t used the system , but think of it as being similar to mercurial ( though I do n’t know for sure if that ’s the best match ) .
clearcase – Developed by ( the Rational Software division of ) IBM .
Clearcase is an exceptionally unusual VCS in that I ’ve never heard anyone I know mention a positive word about it .
Literally .
They all seem to have stories about how it seems to hinder progress far more than it helps .
There has to be someone out there that likes it ( it seems to have quite a number of users for a proprietary VCS despite being exceptionally expensive ) , but for some reason I have n’t run across them .
Very weird .
I believe it is actually lock - based instead of either distributed or inherently centralized , meaning that only one person can edit any given file at a time on a given branch .
Sounds mind - bogglingly crazy to me .
perforce – Developed by Perforce Software , Inc .
It seems that users of the system generally like it technically , and it has a free - of - charge clause for open source software development .
My rough feeling is that Perforce is like CVS or subversion , but has a number of speed optimizations over those two .
It is apparently even worse than cvs or svn for offline working , making editing not - already - opened files in the working copy problematic and error - prone unless online .
The major VCSes
Based on everything above , I consider the following VCSes to be the “ major ” ones :
cvs , svn , bzr , hg , and git .
I ’ll add an “ honorable mention ” category for monotone and darcs ( which bzr nearly belongs in as well , but passes based on the Canonical backing and much higher than average support by developers within the GNOME community ) .
These five VCSes are the ones that I ’ll predominantly be comparing between in my subsequent posts .
Update
[ *]
Kalle Vahlman in the comments points out that you can diff against a tag in svn , though it requires using atrocious syntax and a store of patience :
As much as I agree with [ the claim ] that SVN is just a prettier CVS , [ it ] is n’t really true .
You can [ run ] : svn diff http://svn.gnome.org/svn/metacity/tags/METACITY_2_21_1
http://svn.gnome.org/svn/metacity/trunk to get differences between the tag and current trunk .
If it looks horribly slow to you , it ’s because you are on a very fast connection .
IT IS SO SLOW IT MAKES LITTLE KITTENS WEEP .
But it is possible anyway .
There are a number of other good posts in the comments too , pointing out project adoption cases I potentially missed and noting additional issues with some systems that I wo n’t be comparing later .
I have some pretty strong reservations about the mythical “ hydrogen economy ” mostly because of the way the hydrogen is made .
For a successful hydrogen economy we will have to be able to make hydrogen out of waste material ( not fossil fuel ) , and make it locally .
Which is why I found it pretty interesting that by adding a few modifications to their successful wastewater fuel cell , researchers have been able to coax common bacteria to produce hydrogen in a new , efficient way .
Bruce Logan and colleagues at Penn State University had already shown success at using microbes to produce electricity .
Now , using starter material that could theoretically be sourced from a salad bar , the researchers have coaxed those same microbes to generate hydrogen .
By tweaking their design , improving conditions for the bacteria , and adding a small jolt of electricity , they increased the hydrogen yield to a new record for this type of system .
“ We achieved the highest hydrogen yields ever obtained with this approach from different sources of organic matter , such as yields of 91 percent using vinegar ( acetic acid ) and 68 percent using cellulose , ” said Logan .
In certain configurations , nearly all of the hydrogen contained in the molecules of source material was converted to useable hydrogen gas , an efficiency that could eventually open the door to bacterial hydrogen production on a larger scale .
“ Bruce Logan is a clear leader in this area of research on sustainable energy , ” said Bruce Hamilton , National Science Foundation director of the environmental sustainability program at NSF and the officer overseeing Logan ’s research grant .
“ Advances in sustainable energy capabilities are of paramount importance to our nation ’s security and economic well - being .
We have been supporting his cutting - edge research on microbial fuel cells for a number of years and it is wonderful to see the outstanding results that he continues to produce . ”
Other systems produce hydrogen on a larger scale , but few if any match the new system for energy efficiency .
Even with the small amount of electricity applied , the hydrogen ultimately provides more energy as a fuel than the electricity needed to drive the reactor .
Incorporating all energy inputs and outputs , the overall efficiency of the vinegar - fueled system is better than 80 percent , far better than the efficiency for generation of the leading alternative fuel , ethanol .
Even most electrolysis techniques , methods to extract hydrogen from water using electricity , pale in comparison to the new method .
“ We can do that by using the bacteria to efficiently extract energy from the organic matter , ” said Logan .
By perfecting the environment for the bacteria to do what they already do in nature , the new approach can be three to ten times more efficient than standard electrolysis .
“ The energy focus is currently on ethanol as a fuel , but economical ethanol from cellulose is 10 years down the road , ” says Logan , the Kappe professor of environmental engineering .
“ First you need to break cellulose down to sugars and then bacteria can convert them to ethanol . ”
Logan and Shaoan Cheng , used naturally occurring bacteria in a microbial electrolysis cell with acetic acid â€ “ the acid found in vinegar .
Acetic acid is also the predominant acid produced by fermentation of glucose or cellulose .
The anode was granulated graphite , the cathode was carbon with a platinum catalyst , and they used an off - the - shelf anion exchange membrane .
The bacteria consume the acetic acid and release electrons and protons creating up to 0.3 volts .
When more than 0.2 volts are added from an outside source , hydrogen gas bubbles up from the liquid .
“ This process produces 288 percent more energy in hydrogen than the electrical energy that is added to the process , ” says Logan .
Water hydrolysis , a standard method for producing hydrogen , is only 50 to 70 percent efficient .
Even if the microbial electrolysis cell process is set up to bleed off some of the hydrogen to produce the added energy boost needed to sustain hydrogen production , the process still creates 144 percent more available energy than the electrical energy used to produce it .
For those who think that a hydrogen economy is far in the future , Logan suggests that hydrogen produced from cellulose and other renewable organic materials could be blended with natural gas for use in natural gas vehicles .
“ We drive a lot of vehicles on natural gas already .
Natural gas is essentially methane , ” says Logan .
“ Methane burns fairly cleanly , but if we add hydrogen , it burns even more cleanly and works fine in existing natural gas combustion vehicles . ”
The range of efficiencies of hydrogen production based on electrical energy and energy in a variety of organic substances is between 63 and 82 percent .
Both lactic acid and acetic acid achieve 82 percent , while unpretreated cellulose is 63 percent efficient .
Glucose is 64 percent efficient .
Another potential use for microbial - electrolysis -cell produced hydrogen is in fertilizer manufacture .
Currently fertilizer is produced in large factories and trucked to farms .
With microbial electrolysis cells , very large farms or farm cooperatives could produce hydrogen from wood chips and then through a common process , use the nitrogen in the air to produce ammonia or nitric acid .
Both of these are used directly as fertilizer or the ammonia could be used to make ammonium nitrate , sulfate or phosphate .
Most fertilizers are currently made from oil , this new system would help reduce use of oil .
I find it pretty interesting that they are able to use commend tools , and easy to find bacteria to do this very interesting process .
The electricity could be added from a small solar cell ( like the kind in solar toys and calculators ) .
Would everyone have a little hydrogen factory running in the basement ?
Would you feed it your lawn clippings to power your home ?
The future is going to be an interesting place .
SPIEGEL Interview with Former US Diplomat John Bolton ' Bush 's Foreign Policy Is in Free Fall '
Former US Diplomat John Bolton is no longer in office , but he still has a lot to say about American foreign policy .
SPIEGEL spoke to him about Bush 's softness abroad , Rice having been taken hostage by the liberal State Department , and why it does n't matter that the world hates the US .
I read some interesting feedback on reddit.com .
Although I havent seriously looked into it , IronLisp would ideally compliant to some form of LISP .
That leaves me 2 choices : Common LISP and Scheme .
As for the former , there are just under 1000 functions in the ‘ spec ’ .
Learning them and implementing them would be ongoing venture beyond my expected lifetime .
As for the latter ( Scheme ) , it presents a much cleaner approach , with almost a tiny ‘ core ’ and using that as building block .
Another aspect mentioned was library support .
Again , learning the entire LISP library (s ) to get an idea of the implementation will be too great task for me .
Having worked ( almost exclusively ) on the .NET Framework ‘ library ’ for the last 6 years , it is pretty much the only library I am really comfortable with .
My idea with IronLisp is to let the .NET framework provide all the common libraries , and hence any .NET user can just learn a new syntax to use it practically .
That will also keep IronLisp small and manageable .
Getting back to Scheme .
Ideally IronLisp at some future time , will support / comply to some degree of Scheme , or will have a compatibility mode , or have macros to make it syntax ( and functionally ) compatible .
With this in hand , hopefully IronLisp would be capable of running Scheme libraries .
Unfortunately , Scheme has no defined test suite , but the specification is rather unambiguous , and smaller in total than the Common LISP ’s index !

JUAN GONZALEZ : Despite the best efforts of the Democratic leadership , impeachment was indeed on the table this week in Washington .
On Tuesday , Congressmember and presidential hopeful Dennis Kucinich nearly forced the full House to vote on his measure to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
House Resolution 333 accuses
Cheney of deliberately manipulating intelligence and deceiving the public to build support for the invasion of Iraq and now towards a possible attack on Iran .
Twenty - one House Democrats have supported the bill , but it ’s met fierce opposition from the Democratic leadership .
Democratic leaders were able to send the bill to the House Judiciary Committee , where they expect it to languish .
In a bizarre sequence , Republican lawmakers initially voted against tabling the bill after their leadership apparently decided a House debate would embarrass the Democrats .
The bill was eventually sent to committee after a back - and - forth wrangling between Kucinich and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer .
Democratic leaders have famously declared that impeachment is off the table .
But their view does not fall in line with recent polling figures .
An American Research Group poll in July found that fifty - four percent of Americans support beginning impeachment proceedings against Vice President Cheney .
Seventy - four percent of Democrats were also in favor .
Congressmember Dennis Kucinich of Ohio introduced the measure .
He joins me now from Washington .

AMY GOODMAN : Democratic leaders have famously declared impeachment is off the table .
But their view does not fall in line with recent polling figures .
An American Research Group poll in July found 54 % of Americans support beginning impeachment proceedings against Vice President Cheney .
74 % of Democrats were also in favor .
Congressmember Dennis Kucinich of Ohio introduced the measure .
The presidential candidate joins us now from Washington , D.C. We welcome you to Democracy Now ! , Congressman Kucinich .
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : Good morning .
Good morning , Amy .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain exactly what you did this week .
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH :
The articles of impeachment that were introduced under a privileged resolution cite the Vice President ’s persistent lies relating to Iraq .
He claimed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction , that necessitated the US response .
He claimed that Iraq somehow was connected to al - Qaeda ’s role in 9/11 .
He has been beating the drums for war against Iran .
Those are the elements of the articles of impeachment that were introduced into the House this week .
JUAN GONZALEZ : And why introduce your resolution in regards to Vice President Cheney and not to President Bush ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : Well , certainly President Bush also has to be held accountable .
However , I think that any constitutional process that begins for the removal of an official , when you have the Vice President , who led the effort to deceive this country with respect to a war against Iraq , it ’s appropriate that he be dealt with first , so that you do n’t create a condition where you remove the President first and then Mr. Cheney becomes his successor , and then you have to have an impeachment of two presidents consecutively .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain the leadership ’s position and why you chose to do what you did this week .
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : I think it ’s very difficult to explain their position , because I do n’t think their position is defensible .
I think when you consider that our whole nation is at risk , our constitutional form of government has been undermined by lies , by illegal war , by massive debt , how can you explain the position of Democratic leaders ?
I think that the American people and their response is becoming more and more powerful , and we ’re seeing that there being rising discontent among Democrats in Congress about the direction that our leaders have said is not possible .
I think that people want to see this administration held accountable .
After all , what could be more important than having an opportunity to get to the truth of what happened in Iraq , that the war was based on lies ; that over almost 4,000 of our brave young men and women who represent this country have lost their lives because of those lies ; that over a million innocent Iraqis , noncombatants , civilians , have lost their lives because of those lies ; that we will spend between one and two trillion dollars for this war , even borrowing money from China ?
And our whole domestic agenda is being capsized by this war .
And the administration is preparing still to take us in another war against Iran , similarly lying about a cause for war .
So what can be more important ?
Our country is at risk , and it ’s time for our Democratic leaders to take a stand .
JUAN GONZALEZ : What do you say to those who will argue that even though they may agree with you on a lot of your concerns , that the impeachment process itself would drag out for so long that it may as well — people should just move forward toward the elections and elect a new president ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : Right , well , you think about that .
You know , the administration will be in office for at least fourteen more months .
They can cause a lot of damage in that time .
They ’re planning to attack Iran .
When you think about the defense authorization budget including a provision that would retrofit Stealth B - 2 bombers so they can carry 30,000 - pound bombs , which would then be dropped on nuclear research labs , creating an humanitarian and ecological disaster , “ What are we waiting for ? ”  is the question , not “ Why do n’t we wait for the election ? ” 
AMY GOODMAN :
The other argument that the leadership has used is that they ’re concerned about losing in a landslide vote against them , that that is bad strategically , Congressman Kucinich .
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH :
Since when does it become unfashionable to stand up for the Constitution , to stand up for our nation ’s laws , to stand up for international law , to stand up for moral law ?
Since when does it become inconvenient to take a stand that would help secure our democracy once again ?
I mean , we ’re really — it ’s all at risk right now , and it ’s time that the Democratic leadership exerted an effective influence .
As a coequal branch of government , Congress cannot stand by and let this administration continue to undermine our Constitution .
That ’s why I introduced those articles of impeachment .
AMY GOODMAN : What happens now ?
Is it over ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : Not at all .
I mean , Representative Wexler , who ’s a member of the committee , sent a note to the members of the committee two days ago saying that we ought to proceed with hearings .
Members have been talking to John Conyers on a regular basis since the impeachment resolution was introduced , asking him to take this up , and I ’m hopeful that he will .
AMY GOODMAN : Do you feel Conyers has changed his position from , when he was in the minority , calling for impeachment , and then , when he became head of the House Judiciary Committee , stepping back with pressure from the House leadership ?
REP .
DENNIS KUCINICH : I think John Conyers wants to do the right thing , and I ’m hopeful that he will .

While researching my talk on usability for ESWC2007 I came across this article I wrote some years ago .
It has quite a lot of material I would have liked to have included , but there is only so much you can fit into a 60 minute talk .
I am putting it here as a supplement to the talk and as a tribute to the late lamented EXE magazine which first published the article in June 1998 .
EXE went under in 2000 and I can’t find anyone to ask permission to republish it .
I think they would n’t have minded .
It is quite a long article and may be truncated by feed readers .

It has been said that if users were meant to understand computers they would have been given brains .
But , in fairness to users , the problem is often that interfaces are not designed to take account of their strengths and weaknesses .
I have struggled with my fair share of dire user interfaces , and I ’m supposed to be an expert user .
An interface is , by definition , a boundary between two systems .
On one side of a user interface is the computer hardware and software .
On the other side is the user with ( hopefully ) a brain and associated sensory systems .
To design a good interface it is necessary to have some understanding of both of these systems .
Programmers are familiar with the computer side ( it is their job after all ) but what about the other side ?
The brain is a remarkable organ , but to own one is not necessarily to understand how it works .
Cognitive psychologists have managed to uncover a fair amount about thought processes , memory and perception .
As computer models have played quite a large role in understanding the brain , it seems only fair to take something back .
With apologies to psychologists everywhere , I will try to summarise some of the most important theory in the hope that this will lead to a better understanding of what makes a good user interface .
Also , I think it is interesting to look at the remarkable design of a computer produced by millions of years of evolution , and possibly the most sophisticated structure in the universe ( or at least in our little cosmic neighbourhood ) .
The human brain is approximately 1.3kg in weight and contains approximately 10,000,000,000 neurons .
Processing is basically digital , with ‘ firing ’ neurons triggering other neurons to fire .
A single neuron is rather unimpressive compared with a modern CPU .
It can only fire a sluggish maximum of 1000 times a second , and impulses travel down it a painfully slow maximum of 100 meters per second .
However , the brain ’s architecture is staggeringly parallel , with every neuron having a potential 25,000 interconnections with neighbouring neurons .
That ’s up to 2.5 x 10 ^14 interconnections .
This parallel construction means that it has massive amounts of store , fantastic pattern recognition abilities and a high degree of fault tolerance .
But the poor performance of the individual neurons means that the brain performs badly at tasks that cannot be easily parallelised , for example arithmetic .
Also the brain carries out its processing and storage using a complex combination of electrical , chemical , hormonal and structural processes .
Consequently the results of processing are probabilistic , rather than deterministic and the ability to store information reliably and unchanged for long periods is not quite what one might hope for .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the brain has a similar multi-level storage approach to a modern computer .
Where a computer has cache , RAM and hard - disk memory ( in increasing order of capacity and decreasing order of access speed ) the brain has sensory memory , short - term memory and long - term memory .
Sensory memory has a large capacity , but a very short retention period .
Short - term memory has a very small capacity but can store and retrieve quickly .
Long - term memory has a much larger capacity , but storage and retrieval is more difficult .
New information from sensory memory and knowledge from long - term memory are integrated with information in short - term memory to produce solutions .
A simple model of memory and problem solving [ 1 ] .
Sensory memory acts like a huge register , retaining large amounts of sensory data very briefly so that it can be processed into a meaningful form , e.g. to recognise a face , which is transferred to short - term memory .
The sensory data is then quickly replaced with new incoming data .
Short - term memory acts like a very small queue with a limited retention period .
It can hold only 7±2 items of information , with new items added into short - term memory displacing older ones once this limit has been reached .
Items disappear after approximately 30 seconds if not rehearsed .
The items of information in short - term memory act as ‘ pointers ’ to arbitrarily large and complex pieces of information stored in long - term memory .
For example the seventh of January is one chunk for me ( its my birthday ) , 2 chunks to you ( one for each familiar word ) and 14 chunks for a non-English speaker familiar with our alphabet ( one for each character ) .
The number 7±2 may seem rather arbitrary , but experimentation shows it is remarkably consistent across a wide range of individuals and cultures .
Short - term memory acts as a workspace for problem solving .
The more items that are held in short - term memory the longer it takes to process them .
It is important not to overload short - term memory .
The limited size of short - term memory is a critical bottleneck in problem solving and one of the main constraints to consider for any user interface ( designed for human users at least ) .
Do n’t force the user to try to hold lots of items in short - term memory .
If they have to think about more than 7±2 items then new items will displace old ones .
Also the more items that are in short - term memory the slower their response time will be .
Having lots of ‘ open ’ tasks puts a big burden on short - term memory , so tasks should be grouped into well - defined ‘ transactions ’ .
Complex tasks can almost always be broken down into simpler sub - tasks .
Long - term memory acts like a huge network database .
It has a complex structure and massive capacity , but storing and retrieving information is slow and not always reliable .
Items of information are apparently interconnected and accessed by some form of pointer .
Some psychologists believe that long - term memory may be permanent , and only the ability to retrieve it may be lost ( a bad case of ‘ dangling pointers ’ perhaps ? ) .
Dreaming may be a side - effect of routine re-structuring of long - term memory ( garbage collection ? ) while we are asleep .
Transferring information to long - term memory seems to be a process of encoding the memory and creating pointers to access it .
The more often an item of information is accessed the easier it becomes to access in future .
Each item of information may be accessible by many different routes .
Consequently the context in which information is presented can be important factor in remembering .
The more context cues that are available the easier it is to retrieve an item from long - term memory .
For example , experiments show that students perform better in exams held in the classroom where they learnt the information than elsewhere .
So if an item was presented in a particular font , colour and size , it will be easier to remember its meaning if the same font , colour and size are used .
There is some evidence that image and verbal memories are stored in different parts of the brain .
We can often remember the faces of people we have met better than their names .
Experiments show that it is easier to remember an image than a concrete word , for example it is easier to remember ‘ car ’ when shown an image of a car than when shown the word ‘ car ’ .
It is also easier to remember a concrete word than an abstract word , for example it is easier to remember the word ‘ car ’ , than the word ‘ transport ’ .
This implies that the iconic representation of commands on toolbars has value beyond just looking nice .
Also keywords used in a command line interface should where possible be concrete , rather than abstract .
The different types of memory are stored using different physical mechanisms , probably electrical , chemical and structural .
As proof of this you can train an animal to run a maze , cool it down to the point where all brain activity ceases and then warm it up again .
It will have forgotten how to run the maze , but remember things it learnt days before ( I do n’t recommend you try this with users ) .
Also some diseases have been observed affect short - term memory without affecting long - term memory .
Transfer information from short - term to long - term memory and retrieving it again is not very reliable .
It is better to allow the user to select from alternatives rather than force them to commit items to long - term memory and then retrieve them .
At work , the interface of our old accountancy package had many short - comings .
Projects had to be identified as 5 digit numerical codes , even though alphabetic codes would have been easier to remember .
Users also had to enter project numbers from memory , no facility for selecting from available projects was provided .
It would n’t have taken much effort to produce a better interface design , just a little thought .
For example the Microsoft Word print dialog cues the user as to the permitted format for specifying pages to be printed .
A useful aid to memory .
The brain gets its input from the outside world through the senses .
Of the senses vision is the most important , with some 70 % of all sensory receptors in the eyes .
The importance of vision is also reflected in the design of modern computers .
Other than the odd beep the computer communicates with the user almost entirely through the VDU .
Consequently I will confine the scope of the discussion on the senses to vision alone .
The eye is an impressive sensing device by any standards .
Tests show that its is possible for a human eye to detect a candle flame at a range of 30 miles on a dark , still night .
This corresponds to detecting a signal as low as a few photons entering the eye .
Incoming light is focused onto the retina at the back of the eye , which contains the light receptors .
The retina is actually an extension of the brain .
Observation of growing embryos shows that the tissue that forms the retina extends from the brain , it is not formed from the tissue that turns into the rest of the eye .
The retina contains some 5 million ‘ cone ’ receptors and 100 million ‘ rod ’ receptors .
The cones are sensitive to colour , while the rods are sensitive to brightness .
Some cones are sensitive to red , some to green and some to blue , depending on the pigment they contain .
The cones are much more liberally supplied with nerve cells and are able to discern detail , but they do n’t function in low light levels .
The cones are densest in the centre of the retina , and virtually absent at the outer edge .
The fovea centralis , a spot 1 millimetre across at the centre of the retina , contains some 200,000 cones and no rods .
The rods only detect light at the blue end of the spectrum , but they are extremely sensitive and can detect a single photon of light .
The uneven distribution of rods and cones is easy to test .
Look slightly away from this page and try to read it ‘ out of the corner of your eye ’ – its not possible .
Only the fovea has sufficient acuity to discern this level of detail .
You may also notice that it is easiest to see poorly illuminated objects out of the corner of your eye .
A very dim star , visible out of the corner of your eye , disappears when looked straight at .
Because the fovea is so small we are only able to distinguish detail over a range of approximately 2 degrees .
This equates to about 2.5 cm at the normal distance from user to VDU .
To build up a detailed picture of what is on the screen we have to scan it .
It therefore makes sense to have single items on the interface not bigger than 2.5 cm , so they can be recognised without have to scan them .
Games and simulators that perform real - time rendering are wasting a lot of processing power by rendering the whole picture at the same level of detail .
What they should ideally be doing is performing very detailed rendering at the point where the user ’s fovea is pointing and progressively less detailed rendering further away from this .
This would allow a much more efficient use of available processing power .
It is possible to detect where the user is looking by bouncing an infrared beam off their retina .
If this technology becomes widely available it could be used to perform differential rendering , with the result appearing much more detailed without any increase in processing power .
The receptors in the retina , in common with other sense receptors , are only sensitive to change .
Using special optical equipment it is possible to project a ‘ stabilised ’ image onto the retina that does not change , regardless of eye movements .
A stabilised image fades to a formless grey and is no longer discernible after only 2 - 3 seconds .
It turns out that the constant movement of the eye , originally thought to be an imperfection of the optical system , is essential for sensing unchanging images .
Perversely , light has to pass through 9 layers of nerves cells and blood vessels in the retina before it reaches the light receptors ( I guess evolution is n’t perfect ) .
Because the network of nerves and bloods vessels is unchanging , we do n’t normally perceive it [ 2 ] .
The practical consequence is that any form of movement , animation , change in intensity or flashing on a user interface is extremely noticeable .
Flashing should be used sparingly as it can be distracting and fatiguing to users .
Quickly changing text is also difficult to read , this is why , in our digital age , car speedometers remain as analogue dials rather than numerical LEDs .
It may be better to put a flashing symbol next to steady text , this draws attention to the text without reducing its legibility .
Mosier and Smith [ 3 ] recommend a flash rate between 2 - 5 Hz , with a minimum ‘ on ’ time of at least 50 percent .
Large flashing areas of colour are believed to aggravate epilepsy ( particularly at certain frequencies ) and should not be used .
While sensation happens in the eye , perception happens in the brain .
The receptors in the retina convert the light to electrical signals which they pass to the brain through the optic nerve , a bundle of approximately 1,000,000 neurons .
The information is processed in the visual cortex , the surface of the brain at the back of the head .
Our perception is incredibly sophisticated , as artificial intelligence researchers have found to their cost .
Experiments on the cortex shows that it has evolved with built - in ‘ feature detectors ’ .
A feature detector is a neuron that fires for a very particular stimulus .
For example , one neuron in the visual cortex may fire if there is a horizontal line at the top - left of the visual field .
Next to it will be a neuron that fires for a slightly different orientation , length or position .
Additional processing is then carried out to integrate all the information from the different feature detectors .
As you are reading this page your eye is making rapid movements , with your brain recognising the shape of 2 - 3 words at a time before moving on to the next group of words ( the maximum number of words recognised at a time presumably being limited by the size of the fovea ) .
This is apparently being done by information from different feature detectors being integrated very quickly .
For example the word ‘ FIX ’ can be broken down into six straight lines at different positions in the visual field .
We are able to recognise this work in about a third of a second , even though the size and font may vary .
Shape recognition is therefore incredibly efficient and seems to be one of the best developed features of our visual system .
Tests show that objects can be recognised just as well from line drawings as from colour photographs .
A cup is recognisable as a cup because of its shape , not because of its colour , orientation etc .
Textual representations are not always the best way to convey information .
A map , chart , diagram or other form of image will often convey the same information quicker .
The use of icons in Windows Explorer makes it easier to browse document types than would be possible by reading the file extensions .
Tests show that our ability to pick out simple features such as length , orientation , curvature and brightness are carried at a very low level , in parallel .
Consequently we can pick out items based on these features in a constant time , regardless of the number of other items in the image .
Careful use of these abilities allow a great deal of information to be filtered very rapidly by the user .
The anomalous shape is detected as quickly in b ) as in a ) , even though there are three times as many targets .
But the brain is not so good at integrating ( ‘ conjoining ’ ) different types of feature , for example shape and brightness .
It is easy to pick out a black icon or a circular icon , but picking out a black circular icon is more difficult and time consuming .
Time taken to pick out the black circle increases at the number of targets increases .
It follows from this that you should try to distinguish features of the interface by shape or brightness or orientation , but not a combination of these factors .
a ) the horizontal and vertical lines are the same length .
b) the vertical lines are the same length .
The visual cortex carries out a great deal of processing that we are unaware of , not least of which is turning the image of the world the right way up .
Even though we can understand the nature of illusions , our visual system is still fooled .
This is because it is not just sensing the world , but trying to interpret it , making use of all sorts of cues and in - built knowlege , and this is happening at a lower level than we can consciously control .
You may not have even noticed that there was a deliberate spelling mistake in the last sentence because your perceptual system made a sensible guess .
Although the image projected onto our retina is two dimensional we have very well developed depth perception , our ancestors would n’t have been able to swing through the trees without it .
Partly this is because having two eyes allows stereoscopic vision , but also because our brain processes lots of other visual cues that produce a sensation of depth , even where it does n’t exist ( for example in a photograph ) .
The main cues are :
More distant objects are smaller
More distant objects appear closer to the ‘ vanishing point ’ created by converging parallels
More distant objects move across the visual field more slowly
Superposition , if A overlaps B then A must be closer
Shadows and highlights
Chromostereopsis , long wavelength colours ( e.g. red ) appear closer than shorter wavelength colours ( e.g. blue ) because shorter wavelength light is refracted more strongly by the lens of the eye ( but this is rather weak compared to the other effects )
Use of depth cues make the one shape appear closer than the other .
Using these cues can give a very effective illusion of depth , without specialised equipment such as stereoscopic googles .
This built - in depth perception is currently taken advantage of only in a very limited way in most GUI environments , for example the use of highlights and shadows to infer a three dimensional element for controls .
Many applications would benefit from a three dimensional representation .
For example the structure of a complex web site could be better presented in three dimensions than two .
The availability of VRML and other technologies is likely to make three dimensional interfaces increasingly common .
An illusion of depth .
Interestingly it is purely a matter of convention and practise that makes us imagine the light source as at the top - left and see the top button as sticking out and the bottom button as sticking in [ 4 ] .
If you can also see them the other way around if you try .
Layout is an important feature of an interface .
Western users will tend to scan an screen as if they were reading a page , starting from the top - left .
Scanning can be made easier by aligning controls in rows .
Complex displays can be made easier to scan by adding additional cues , for example a timesheet could have a thicker line denoting the end of each week .
Both layout and similarity can be used to group items on an interface .
In a ) the shapes are perceived as 3 rows , while in b ) they are perceived as 3 columns , due to proximity .
In c ) the shapes are perceived as 3 columns , due to similarity .
d) gives a mixed message .
A colour is perceived according to how strongly it activates the red , green and blue cone receptors in our eyes .
From this we perceive its intensity ( how bright it is ) , its hue ( the dominant wavelength ) and saturation ( how wide a range of wavelengths make it up ) .
Within the 400 - 700 nanometer visible range we can distinguish wavelengths 2 nanometers apart .
Combined with differing levels of hue and saturation the estimated numbers of colours we can discriminate is 7,000,000 .
According to the US National Bureau of Standards there are some 7,500 colours with names .
But colour should be used sparingly in interfaces .
I once worked on an application where a very extrovert student with dubious taste ( as evidenced by his choice of ties ) had designed the user interface .
Each major type of window had a different lurid background colour .
This was presumably to make it easy to tell them apart , but the overall effect was highly distracting .
Colour perception , like everything else to do with perception , is complex .
Experiments show that how we perceive a colour depends on the other colours surrounding it .
If you look through a pinhole at a sheet of green or red paper it does n’t appear to have a very strong colour .
But if you put the sheets next to each other and look at them both through the pinhole the colours appear much stronger .
So if you want to make a colour highly visible , put it next to a complementary colour , for example yellow is perceived by red and green cone cells , so to make it more visible put it next to an area of saturated blue .
Colour can be used with text and symbols to add information without making them less legible , as long as a careful choice of colours is used .
Some combinations of colours work better than others .
Saturated blue appears dimmer to the human eye than other saturated colours and is more difficult to focus on .
Blue symbols and text are therefore probably best avoided .
However , for the same reasons , blue can make a background that is easy on the eye .
Saturated yellow appears brighter than all the other colours for the same intensity .
Ill - advised colour combinations .
Better colour combinations .
Designers should remember that a significant proportion of the population has deficient colour vision ( some 6 % of males and 0.4 % of females , the difference being due to the way the defective gene is inherited ) .
This is caused by problems with pigmentation in one or more of the red , green and blue cone cells in the eye .
While there are a range of different types of colour deficiency the most common is the inability to distinguish between red and green .
This raises some questions about the design of traffic lights ( some colour - deficient drivers have to rely on the position , rather than the colour , of the lights ) .
Some individuals may not be able to distinguish one or more primary colours from grey , it is therefore unwise to put a primary colour on a dark background .
Allowing users to customise colours goes some way to alleviating this problem .
Other forms of vision defect are also common , as evidenced by the number of people wearing glasses .
Something that is easily visible on the programmer ’s 17 inch screen may be almost impossible to read on a user ’s LCD laptop screen .
This problem is further compounded by the fact that eyesight deteriorates with age and programmers tend to younger on average than users .
There also seems to be a tendency to use ever smaller fonts even though screen sizes are increasing .
Perhaps this is based on the assumption that large fonts make things look childish and unsophisticated , so small fonts must look professional .
Ideally the user should be able to customise screen resolution and font sizes .
Meaning can sometimes be conveyed with colour , for example a temperature scale may be graded from blue ( cold ) to red ( hot ) as this has obvious physical parallels .
But the meaning of colour can be very culturally dependent .
For example , red is often used to imply danger in the west , but this does not necessarily carry over into other cultures .
The relative commonness of defective colour vision and the limited ability of users to attach meaning to colour means that it should be used as an additional cue , and should not be relied on as the primary means of conveying information .
Furthermore colour wo n’t be visible on a monochrome display ( now relatively rare ) or a monochrome printer ( still very common ) .
Humans are good at recognising patterns , making creative decisions and filtering huge amounts of information .
Humans are not so good at arithmetic , juggling lots of things at once and committing them to long - term memory .
Computers are the opposite .
A good interface design should reflect the respective strengths and weaknesses of human and computer .
Just as a well crafted graphical user interface will minimise the amount of machine resources required to run it , it should also minimise the amount of brain resources required to use it , leaving as much brain capacity as possible for the user to solve their actual problem .

Yalies for the Impeachment of George Bush and Richard Cheney
With great privilege comes great responsibility
If not us , who ?
If not now , when ?
Dear Classmates ,
A call for the impeachment of a president is not one to be taken lightly .
But when the foundations of constitutional government are in mortal danger , it is time to raise our full voices .
Politicians will always be politicians and thus prone to peccadillo , but George Bush and Dick Cheney have so grievously violated their oaths of office to “ preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States ” that the only remedy is impeachment .
With respect to the Fourth Amendment and the Sixth Amendment , the oath has been clearly broken .
The First Amendment is under attack , as peaceful , protected speech is increasingly subject to arrest and harassment .
Yale president Kingman Brewster taught us that from whom much has been given , much is expected .
We knew not what form of courage would be called from us in repayment of our debt , as no generation does .
The courage to risk opprobrium and contempt is sometimes as important as the courage to raise arms in national defense .
Brewster showed moral courage by making
Yale a meritocracy , incurring wrath from many quarters .
By manipulation of fear , faulty but seductive logic , and outright lies , this administration has steered our republic toward unaccountable tyranny , which our nation overthrew at its founding .
No man is above the law .
It falls to those of us who by our education are trained in rational inquiry and critical thinking to strip the mask of patriotism and sole possession of the truth from George Bush , and to foment the debate that so far has been avoided by our nation .
Of course , most important is the participation of those who disagree .
We welcome open debate .
It is the lifeblood of democracy .
If not us , who ?
If not now , when ?
Not only is it possible for impeachment to succeed ; it is vital .
If George Bush and Dick Cheney are simply allowed to leave office , our level of tolerance for lawbreaking among our highest officials will have expanded by breathtaking orders of magnitude , and will become a permanent part of our political culture .
The Law of the Land will be the law of the land no more .
Although other resolutions and articles of impeachment have been put forward by the public , the essential case for the impeachment of first Dick Cheney , then George Bush are :
- Violation of the oath of office to uphold , protect and defend the Constitution , specifically the Sixth Amendment right of American citizens , in criminal matters , to be told of the charges against them , to counsel , and a to speedy and public trial by a jury of their peers .
The rights of foreign nationals may be debated , but the rights of Americans are not open to debate .
They are stated clearly in the Constitution , and “ enemy combatant ” precedents obviously cannot apply to a vaguely defined “ war on terror ” intended to have an infinite horizon .
Jose Padilla was detained and tortured for 4 1 / 2 years in violation of his rights , and the administration to this day claims the authority to do so to any American it accuses of terrorism .
- A corollary charge , seeking to overturn the Bill of Rights of the Constitution by the transparent device of claiming wartime powers which would last forever .
- Violation of the oath of office to uphold , protect and defend the Constitution , specifically the Fourth Amendment right to freedom from search without a warrant , in the NSA warrantless surveillance scandal .
The media assists the administration in twisting the issue to be whether or not the government can spy , when in fact the government has always been authorized to spy on anyone as long as it does so within the law , with a warrant obtained before or even after the fact .
Referring to this , former Nixon White House Counsel John Dean says Bush is the only president in history who has openly admitted an “ impeachable offense . ”
- Lying to Congress and the American people to draw the country into the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
- Giving secrets to the enemy in wartime by ordering the public identification of American intelligence agent Valerie Plame , which constitutes treason , because Plame was engaged in tracing weapons of mass destruction before they reached American shores .
Fox Guest : Assume video taping when invited for sex

Fox News reported Wednesday on a Navy physician charged with secretly videotaping midshipmen having sex while staying at his house .
The doctor 's attorney claimed in a phone interview that his client was set up by a former midshipmen who had been expelled and was trying to extort money .
Greg Gutfeld , a guest on the program and host of Fox 's Red Eye , mockingly opined that " if somebody invites you over to their house to have sex , chances are they are going to film you .
At least , that has been my experience . "
The following video is from Fox 's Live Desk , broadcast on June 6 .
Ineffective or even dangerous fad treatments for autism , always a problem , seem to be growing more pervasive , according to researchers who studied the problem .
“ Developmental disabilities like autism are a magnet for all kinds of unsupported or disproved therapies , and it has gotten worse as more children have been diagnosed with autism , ” said James Mulick , professor of pediatrics and psychology at Ohio State University . ”
“ There 's no cure for autism , and many parents are willing to believe anything if they come to think it could help their child . ”
Mulick chaired a symposium on “ Outrageous Developmental Disabilities Treatments ” Aug. 20 in San Francisco at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association .
The symposium included presentations by several of Mulick 's students at Ohio State who participated in a graduate seminar on fad treatments in autism .
Tracy Kettering , a doctoral student in special education at Ohio State , said a Google search for the phrase “ autism treatment ” yields more than 2.2 million matches .
“ You get hundreds of different types of therapies that come up , and many have quotes from parents that claim a particular therapy ‘ cured ' their child , ” Kettering said .
“ It 's no wonder that parents want to believe .
But very few of these treatments have any evidence to support them . ”

The number and range of fad treatments has seemed to grow in recent years as more children have been diagnosed with autism , said Mulick , who is also editor of a book on fad treatments called Controversial Therapies for Developmental Disabilities : Fad , Fashion , and Science in Professional Practice .
Mulick said when he began treating autism in the 1970s about 3 children in 10,000 were said to have autism .
Now , reports are 1 in 166 children have the condition .
The number of cases has mushroomed because of better diagnoses , and a changing definition of autism that includes a broader range of disorders .
Some of the newer , more popular fad treatments for autism involve special diets or nutritional supplements .
Megadoses of Vitamins C and B6 are popular , as well as supplements with fatty acids like omega - 3s .
A casein and / or gluten - free diet , which involves eliminating dairy and wheat products , has also gained favor with some parents .
While many of these treatments have never been adequately studied , that does n't mean they are n't promoted .
“ One of the characteristics of fad treatments is that they are discussed in the media and on the internet , where many parents can be exposed to them , ” said Anne Snow , an Ohio State psychology graduate student .
advertisement
And while some fads are simply ineffective , others can even be dangerous , Mulick said .
Chelation therapy , which involves taking medicines to remove the heavy metal mercury from the body , has reportedly led to the death of at least one autistic boy receiving that treatment .
Chelation therapy was also touted years ago as a new treatment against some forms of cancer but was eventually shown to have no helpful effect .
Many parents try multiple approaches , hoping at least one will help .
Kettering said one survey she found suggests that the average parent of a child with autism has tried seven different therapies .
“ We 're not saying that all of these treatments do n't work or that they are all dangerous , ” Kettering said .
“ But the research has n't been done to suggest that most of them are effective or even safe . ”
Many of the treatments may have just enough basis in scientific fact to attract attention , even if the treatment itself is unproven .
For instance , most scientists believe that many cases of autism are caused by genetic mutations , and some mutations can be caused by various chemicals that we encounter in our everyday lives , Mulick said .
But still , there is no evidence that any particular chemical causes mutations that lead to autism , as some have claimed .
“ There 's a shred of truth in the rationale presented for some fad treatments , and that is enough for some people to go with , ” he said .
Another reason that fad treatments persist has to do with the natural course of autism , Mulick said .
Autism , like many conditions , has cycles in which symptoms get worse and then get better .
Parents tend to search for treatments when symptoms are getting worse , and when their children get better – as they do in the normal course of disease – parents credit the new therapy .
“ It 's natural to have this bias that the therapy you 're trying has had some positive effect , ” he said .
“ People want to believe . ”
While other treatments are still being investigated , right now the only therapy that has been shown to have a long - term positive affect on autism is called Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention , Mulick said .
EIBI is a highly structured approach to learning , in which children with autism are taught first to imitate their teachers .
But this treatment is very time - consuming and labor intensive .
It involves one - on - one behavioral treatment with the child for up to 40 hours a week for several years .
“ It 's expensive and difficult for many parents to use , ” Mulick said .
“ That 's got to be one reason other treatments look attractive to them . ”
Mulick said other treatments and therapies are being studied .
However , it takes years to test treatments for autism because of the nature of the disease and problems with proving effectiveness .
“ Autism studies are a long , time - consuming , and expensive process , ” Mulick said .
“ And some of the fad treatments being used today would never be approved for testing – they are just too dangerous . ”
In addition to Mulick , Kettering and Snow , other presenters at the symposium included Ohio State graduate students Cristan Farmer , Megan Norris , Andrea Witwer and Jill Hollway .
US Politics The Evils of Lesser Evil Voting Lesser evil voting is phony voting , and it produces a phony political system .
By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published June 07 , 2007
Condemn American progressives for voting enthusiastically for Democrats and the inevitable response is something like , " just imagine how much worse voting for Republicans would be . "
Similarly , many true conservatives and Libertarians see voting for Republicans as a necessary evil .
With many progressives regretting giving Democrats a majority in Congress and many conservatives regretting putting George W. Bush in the White House , it is timely to refute lesser evil logic .
Inevitably , lesser evil voters face personal disappointment and some shame .
Politicians that receive lesser evil votes do not perform according to the values and principles that the lesser evil voter holds dear .
These voters must accept responsibility for putting ineffective , dishonest and corrupt politicians in office .
Though they may be lesser evils , they remain evils .
All too often lesser evil voters avoid shame and regret and prevent painful cognitive dissonance by deluding themselves that the politician they helped put in office is really not so bad after all .
Corrosive lesser evil voting erodes one 's principles as pragmatism replaces idealism .
This makes the next cycle of lesser evil voting easier .
Two - Party Duopoly
Lesser evil voting helps stabilize America 's two - party duopoly that greatly restricts true political competition .
Third party and independent candidates ?
and minor Democratic and Republican candidates in primaries ?
are defeated by massive numbers of lesser evil voters .
Despite authentically having the political goals that mesh with many voters on the left or right , these minor " best " candidates fall victim to lesser evil voting .
Lesser evil voters are addicted to a self - fulfilling prophesy .
They think , " If I vote for a minor candidate they will lose anyway . "
They ensure this outcome though their lesser evil voting .
The truly wasted vote is the unprincipled lesser evil vote .
Effective representative democracy requires politically engaged citizens that vote .
Lesser - evil voters support the current two - party system with its terribly low voter turnout and chronic dishonesty and corruption .
Phony Politics
Lesser evil voters help put into office disappointing politicians , not the best people that would restore American democracy and show more citizens that voting is valuable .
Lesser evil voters demonstrate the validity of turned - off citizens ' view that it really does not matter which major party wins office .
Politicians knowingly market themselves to lesser evil voters by constructing phony sales pitches , especially to certain audiences outside of their more certain base constituents .
Democrats make themselves look more progressive than they really are , and Republicans make themselves look more conservative than they really are .
Lesser evil voters are phony , and they produce a phony political system .
Lesser evil voters contribute mightily to the travesty of our political system that no sane person respects and has confidence in .
Compromise at its Worst
Lesser evil voting demonstrates the worst aspects of political compromise .
This is the common cause of terrible laws .
When citizens surrender so much of what they truly believe in , they enable compromise politicians to create bad public policy that , in the end , satisfies very few people and puts band - aids on severe problems .
Lesser evil voters concede victory to the other side ?
the side they view as the worse alternative because the people they vote for will not stand up for what is right and necessary ( think Iraq war ) .
Even when their lesser evil side wins , they do not have the principled positions that would prevent awful compromises , often in the name of bipartisanship , which is a clever way to justify our corrupt two - party mafia .
Lesser evil voters deride the alternatives of not voting or voting for minor candidates .
The outcome should the " other " side win is deemed unacceptable .
There is worse and there is worst .
Short Term Thinking
The core problem with lesser evil voters is that they are short term thinkers .
They fail to see the repeated long term consequence of their style of voting ?
a system over many election cycles that persists in delivering suboptimal results .
The " good " outcome in the current election ( from their perspective ) is the enemy of the " better " solution in the longer term ( from an objective perspective ) .
The better solution is major reform that will never happen as long as lesser evil voting persists .
Understand this : Lesser evil voting is not courageous .
It is cowardly surrender to the disappointing two - party status quo .
Lesser evil voters should trade regret for pride by voting for candidates they really think are the best .
Voters in this presidential primary season have some remarkable opportunities to transform fine minor candidates into competitive major candidates ?
more honest and trustworthy people like Ron Paul , Mike Gravel and Dennis Kucinich , for example .
Deadly Decline of Democracy
Finally , the deadly decline of American democracy results in large measure from lesser evil voters electing lesser evil politicians .
When virtually no elected public official is there because most voters have embraced his clear principled , trustworthy positions we get a government that is easily corrupted by corporate and other moneyed interests .
We get what we have now .
If you are dissatisfied with that , then reconsider the wisdom of lesser evil voting .
We will only get the best government by voting for the best candidates .
Otherwise , we get what we deserve and what the power elites prefer .

They made war on Midian , as Yahweh had ordered Moses , and put every male to death .
What is more , they killed the kings of Midian , Evi , Rekem , Zur , Hur and Reba , the five Midianite kings ; they also put Balaam son of Beor to the sword .
The Israelites took the Midianite women and their little ones captive and carried off all their cattle , all their flocks and all their goods as booty .
They set fire to the towns where they lived and to all their encampments .
Then , taking all their booty , everything they had captured , man and beast , they brought the captives , spoil and booty to Moses , the priest Eleazar and the whole community of Israelites at the camp on the Plains of Moab , near the Jordan by Jericho .
Moses , the priest Eleazar and all the leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet them .
Moses was enraged with the officers of the army , the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the hundreds , who had come back from this military expedition .
He said , " Why have you spared the life of all the women ?
They were the very ones who , on Balaam 's advice , caused the Israelites to be unfaithful to Yahweh in the affair at Peor : hence the plague which struck Yahweh 's community .
So kill all the male children and kill all the women who have ever slept with a man , and keep them for yourselves .
Moabite
The spoils , the remainder of the booty captured by the soldiers , came to six hundred and seventy - five thousand sheep and goats , seventy - two thousand head of cattle , sixty - one thousand donkeys , and in persons , women who had never slept with a man , thirty - two thousand in all .
Half was assigned to those who had taken part in the war ... sixteen thousand persons , of which Yahweh 's portion was thirty - two .
Moses gave the priest Eleazar the portion set aside for Yahweh , as Yahweh had ordered Moses .
As for the half coming to the Israelites which Moses had separated from that the the combatants ... sixteen thousand persons .
From this half , the Israelites ' share , Moses took one out of every fifty , man and beast , and gave them to the Levites who were responsible for Yahweh 's Dwelling , as Yahweh had ordered Moses .
Rationalization # 1 : Captured women were treated with dignity , and allowed to worship the true god Yahweh .
When you go to war against your enemies and Yahweh your God delivers them into your power and you take prisoners , and among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman , and you fall in love with her , and you take her to be your wife and bring her home ; she must shave her head and cut her nails , and take off her prisoner 's garb ; she must stay inside your house and mourn her father and mother for a full month .
You may then go to her and be a husband to her , and she will be your wife .
Should she cease to please you , you will let her go where she wishes , not selling her for money : you must not make any profit out of her , since you have exploited her .
Rationalization # 2 : The children killed in genocide were spared life in a corrupt and evil pagan society .
Rationalization # 3 : The young children who were killed went to Heaven automatically , and thus received a greater reward than even the Israelites .
Daughter of Babel , doomed to destruction ,
a blessing on anyone
who treats you as you treated us ,
a blessing on anyone who seizes your babies
and shatters them against a rock !
best possible outcome
Conclusions :
thirty - two thousand young girls

For six years , Tania Head symbolised the courage and determination of 9/11 survivors .
She told a dramatic story of how she was set ablaze when a plane smashed into the 78th floor of the World Trade Centre south tower as she waited for a business meeting .
It made her one of the chosen few , the 19 survivors who were at or above the floors where the planes hit .
Another 2,974 people died as the towers collapsed - including her fiance .
Scroll down for more ...
Her account reduced many people to tears and inspired thousands more .
At a memorial service last year she said : " What I witnessed there I will never forget .
It was a lot of death and destruction , but I also saw hope . "
Miss Head , 35 , became president and a leading fundraiser of the World Trade Centre Survivors '
Network , a charity set up to help victims , families and friends traumatised by the attacks .
She gave guided tours of Ground Zero , vividly recounting her experiences .
But yesterday she was exposed as a fake .
The New York Times began to probe her background after she ducked out of three interviews to commemorate the sixth anniversary this month .
Reporters who talked to people she had mentioned found none of them knew much about her .
As officials try to discover if she was actually anywhere near the World Trade Centre , even her name is now in doubt .
Until questions were asked , Miss Head had made a name for herself as a remarkable survivor .
She had emotional meetings with senior politicians such as former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani , current mayor Michael Bloomberg , and former state governor George Pataki .
Tour groups hung on every word of her accounts of the plane 's impact and what followed .
" The first thing you feel is a tremendous increase in pressure , all the air being sucked out of your lungs , " she said recently .
" The next thing you feel is flying through the air . "
As she crawled through the chaos and carnage , she said , she encountered a dying man who handed her his inscribed wedding ring , which she later returned to his widow .
Her life was saved by Welles Crowther , a hero who used his jacket to smother her blazing clothes - and later died rescuing others .
She said she had the strength to make it down the stairs to safety because she kept thinking of the beautiful white dress she was to wear at her wedding to her fiance David .
But as she recovered in hospital she learned that David , a financier , had died in the north tower .
They had just started living together after a Hawaiian holiday , she told people .
For years , no one questioned Miss Head 's story .
Welles Crowther 's mother Alison , who met her several times , said : " I felt it was too private and painful to her to ask questions . "
In fact , as reporters established , David never had a fiancÈe and never went to Hawaii , said his family and his flatmate .
Bankers Merrill Lynch , for whom Miss Head claimed to have worked , say they have never heard of her .
There is no suggestion Miss Head profited financially from her story .
But the Survivors ' Network has voted to remove her as president and she has been sacked as a tour guide .
There was no reply last night at her home in Manhattan , but she has insisted she has done nothing illegal and never claimed government compensation .
WASHINGTON  Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Republican leader , operates with near - robotic efficiency when it comes to negotiating budget figures in public , consistently refusing to answer questions that would ever commit him to a specific number at the bargaining table .
So it was more than a little telling when Mr. McConnell laid down his mark in the current budget fight on Tuesday , informing the Capitol Hill press corps that he was ready to offer Democrats a deal , $ 70 billion in war financing with no strings attached and a total budget identical to President Bush ’s proposal .
In other words , the Republicans should get virtually everything they want .
And he was not kidding .
With the president warning repeatedly that he will veto any budget package he dislikes and the Democrats short of the 60 votes they need in the Senate , the Republican minority is in an unusually strong bargaining position  and not just in the budget negotiations that are the top priority in Congress these days .
Mr. McConnell and his fellow Republicans are playing such tight defense , blocking nearly every bill proposed by the slim Democratic majority that they are increasingly able to dictate what they want , much to the dismay of the majority leader , Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , and frustrated Democrats in the House .

Folks , when it rains it pours … the GOP sexual hypocrite parade continues in all its glory .
I give you …
Glenn Murphy , Jr. , the recently elected chairman of the Young Republican National Federation ( also the RNC Chair for Clark County , Indiana and formerly the YRNF Secretary ) has been accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping man .
Immediately following the accusation , he came up with an unrelated reason to resign , and the YRNF cleansed their website of his name .
Allegedly , Murphy and another YR were drunk and crashing at Murphy ’s sister ’s house .
The other man apparently awoke in the morning to find Murphy giving him a non-consensual blow job .
The Clark County ( Indiana ) Sheriff ’s Department is charging Murphy with “ criminal deviate conduct ” , a Class B felony .
Taking Down Words , an Indiana blog , has been following this guy for some time .
And guess what ?
Apparently this is n’t the first time his mouth has ended up on someone ’s privates while they were asleep .
Glenn Murphy has a prior arrest for sexual battery .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the United States on Thursday of imperialism and starting a new arms race , but Washington said its ex-Cold War foe ’s foreign policy showed it was behind the times .
Speaking a week before he meets leaders of the Group of Eight ( G - 8 ) industrial nations in Germany , Putin said Russia ’s tests on Tuesday of two new missiles were a direct response to U.S. moves to create a missile defense system in Europe .
“ We are not the initiators of this new round of the arms race , ” Putin told a joint Kremlin news conference .
“ There is no need to fear Russia ’s actions : they are not aggressive , ” he said .
“ They are a mere response to harsh and groundless unilateral actions by our partners and are aimed at maintaining the balance of forces in the world . ”
Putin ’s comments , which will be popular among ordinary Russians in a year when there is a parliamentary election , are the latest in a line of harsh outbursts against the West .
On Tuesday , Russia test - fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile with multiple warheads and a new cruise missile , which Russian generals say are sufficient to ensure the country ’s security for the next 40 years .
“ Our partners are stuffing eastern Europe with new weapons , ” Putin said .
“ What are we supposed to do ?
We can not just observe all this . ”
Moscow has been alarmed by U.S. plans to deploy parts of its global missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Washington says it wants to avert attacks from “ rogue states ” such as Iran but Russia sees a threat to its own security .
“ There is a clear desire by some international players to dictate their will to everyone without adhering to international law , ” Putin said .
“ International law has been replaced by political reasons . ”
“ In our opinion it is nothing different from diktat , nothing different from imperialism , ” he added .
RUSSIA FORCED TO DESIGN NEW MISSILES
U.S. President George W. Bush said in an interview with a German newspaper that ties between the two countries were complex but he believed Russia was a friend of the United States .
In the interview conducted in Washington with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and various other European newspapers , Bush was quoted as saying Russia was “ not an enemy regime but a friend ” .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
Relations between Russia and the United States are strained by issues that also include U.S. concerns that human rights and democracy are backsliding in Russia .
Putin and Bush have a chance to discuss their countries ’ differences at talks in the United States on July 1 - 2 .
But on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the difficult relationship as a “ mix of cooperation and competition , friendship and friction ” .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
“ But at times , Russia seems to think and act in the zero - sum terms of another era , ” she said in remarks prepared for a speech .
She said Russia ’s opposition to the missile shield was hard to understand .
But Putin said Russia had to design new missiles after Washington quit the Cold War-era Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) treaty in order to pursue the shield project .
“ We have warned them then that we will come out with a response to maintain the strategic balance in the world , ” he said .
“ We conducted a test of a new strategic ballistic missile with multiple warheads , and of a new cruise missile , and will continue to improve our resources . ”
In another move putting Russia at odds with the West , Putin has frozen Russia ’s commitments under the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe ( CFE ) pact , which limits heavy weapons deployed between the Atlantic and the Urals mountains .
What 's spooked the fat controller ?
In times of relative peace and prosperity , it 's easy for those under our sphere of influence to forget just how unpleasant life could be without our protection .
Sometimes the protected need reminding .
Otherwise , they can become over - confident , too daring , a danger to ourselves or others .
One such reminder which brings my own daughter running for protection , is when papa growls ' Fee fye foe fum ' , the words which signal the arrival of the child - eating ogre of Jack & The Beanstalk .
I find this interesting because , anecdotally , it suggests that mythology or the repetition and embellishment of stories we tell each other - trigger fear just as effectively as a rational assessment of what 's before our eyes .
And so to today and the media descriptions of the recent bomb threats to London nightclubs , Glasgow airport and Tesco supermarkets .
Note the trigger words - ' terror ' , ' extremists ' .
We easily recognise their place in the storybook of 9/11 and 7/7 , the stories of the ogre that crushed skyscrapers , smashed trains and killed without mercy .
Does the diminutive bobby on the beat stand a chance against such a monster ?
Of course not .
No wonder the poor head of the Association of Police Chief Officers has chosen this moment to demand more powers .
But hang on .
Let 's step back and get some perspective .
Do we really want to give our policemen the green light to lock people up indefinitely without charge ?
How much does that raise the probability of innocent people being victimised on the basis of mistaken identity , bad intelligence or simply looking the part ?
That would be terrible too , would n't it ?
In fact , this is not the first time that politicians in Europe have braced themselves for the next deadly bout of violence against civilians .
This is n't even the first time we 've seen massacres at train stations or in supermarkets .
During the Cold War years , numerous acts of violence were perpetrated across Western Europe .
What can we learn from the motivations behind them ?
For one thing , we learn that , in nearly all the worst cases , it was a mistake to assume that the first suspect that sprang to mind was actually responsible .
The blame was successfully pinned on communists - or , more specifically , on the political parties , activists , unions , and governments with communist or left leaning sympathies - but they were not the instigators .
During this period , trained neo-fascists and secret agents infiltrated extreme left groups and egged them on to carry out acts of extreme violence .
Only in 1990 did the wall of silence finally give way to the revelation that these dark actors were members of secret ' stay behind ' armies set up by Nato to resist a Soviet invasion ... an invasion which never came .
We do n't have much hard evidence of CIA and MI6 involvement .
That 's because anybody who does know about their activities is sworn to silence .
What we do now know from declassifed documents , is that the destruction of communism was the secret services ' cause celebre throughout the cold war .
Was this a sensible precaution ?
May be .
But a positive feeling about Soviet socialism was also understandable in post war Europe.
13 million Russian soldiers gave their lives helping save Europe from fascism during WWII .
Given that level of sacrifice , how did Communism wind up being branded ' evil ' ?
Most likely , Western power brokers did n't much like the idea .
Given its promise to distribute wealth more equitably , it was never going to be the rich person 's first choice .
Demands from the fat controller to stop the spread of communism , almost certainly resulted in this marriage of convenience to repress it - the marriage between big money , big business chiefs , judges , secret services , the military officer class , senior policemen ... even the mafia .
Before we think that this is all getting a bit far fetched , the history of Cuba provides ample evidence that these sections of US society have indeed collaborated with the aim of destroying Castro 's Cuba .
They have also protected and provided cover for those that would attack the Cuban system .
But were these Cold War atrocities against civilians solely carried out to turn the public against an ideology ?
Certainly not .
It would be naive to think that the participants acted solely out of patriotism with no hope of extending their own power and influence .
Skip to the USA where the combination of urgency and a feeling of powerlessness in Congress due to 9/11 , provided the climate in which the Patriot Act would be approved without serious debate .
Passed just 45 days after 9/11 , the 1200 page
Act 's full implications are yet to be felt .
But Americans are n't now so sure they like the way the Act sanctioned wiretaps and clandestine house searches and on - demand access to a businesses ' confidential records about customers .
Whatever the cause , the effect , in any case , was an extension of state and executive powers .
Why would the ruling Executive in the US and UK want the power to put civilians behind bars without hard evidence that a crime has been committed ?
What has spooked the fat controller this time ?
Is it really Al Qaeda that has given the world 's greatest superpower a dose of the heebie - jeebies ?
Winding back , we note that the CIA , during the Cold War , offered training to all sorts of combative people who could help them repel Communism .
This included the Mujahedeen , the group of Islamic fundamentalists for whom Bin Laden was a fundraiser .
Equipped by the CIA , they expelled the Soviet army from Afghanistan before regrouping as the Taleban and rebranding as Al Qaeda .
It 's messy , but what these Cold War events seem to tell us is that , when real power feels threatened , no executioners are ruled out for the job of stamping out the threat .
Snap back to today and it seems that the covenant of peaceful co-existence , made when Islamic Fundamentalists were helping us remove the Russians from Afghanistan , is now in tatters and these allies have become the fat controller 's worst 9/11 and 7/7 nightmares .
Or have they ?
Not so , if you believe that the biggest threat facing the USA today , is , in fact , oil depletion combined with the diving dollar .
In this case , having an arch enemy in the Middle East is rather helpful .
It helps justify the continued presence of US troops in the part of the world where the largest remaining reserves of cheap - to - extract oil are waiting to be drilled .
Now peak oil is very definitely a concern to all major oil consumers .
Supplies are already tight .
In fact , 27 of the 51 oil producing nations mentioned in BP ’s Statistical Review of World Energy reported output declines in 2006 .
Tightness of supply has n't been helped by a series of devastating oil industry leaks , fires and explosions which took the UK perilously close to winter gas shortages early in 2006 .
Who exactly was responsible for these has not , to my mind , been adequately explained .
But these shocks were not a bad way to impress on a Parliament the seriousness of the threat ... the real threat of shortages to which Iraq 's ample oil reserves might seem to be the answer .
So , this is my assessment .
It is obvious that , all things being even , when shortages begin , the world 's greediest per capita energy consumer of oil will find it hardest to adjust .
Consider the US army without oil for 24 hours .
The planes , humvees and helicopters would stall .
The generators , refrigerators , air conditioners and rock music would fall silent .
Darkness would descend .
Oil keeps the entire show on the road .
Without oil , America risks the collapse of its power .
Surely that 's what spooked the fat controller .
The thought of the magic beanstalk being cut through at the roots in the not too distant future , bringing the real ogre - the whole debt - laiden edifice - crashing down .

Does orange juice taste sweeter if it's a brighter orange ?
A new study in the March issue of the Journal of Consumer Research finds that the color of a drink can influence how we think it tastes .
In fact , the researchers found that color was more of an influence on how taste was perceived than quality or price information .
" Perceptual discrimination is fundamental to rational choice in many product categories yet rarely examined in consumer research , " write JoAndrea Hoegg ( University of British Columbia ) and Joseph W. Alba ( University of Florida ) .
" The present research investigates discrimination as it pertains to consumers ' ability to identify difference -- or the lack thereof - - among gustatory stimuli . "
Hoegg and Alba are the first to look at how individual attributes -- such as color , price , or brand -- can affect which products we prefer .
The researchers manipulated orange juice by changing color ( with food coloring ) , sweetness ( with sugar ) , or by labeling the cups with brand and quality information .
They found that though brand name influenced people 's preferences for one cup of juice over another , labeling one cup a premium brand and the other an inexpensive store brand had no effect on perceptions of taste .
In contrast , the tint of the orange juice had a huge effect on the taster 's perceptions of taste .
As the authors put it : " Color dominated taste . "
Given two cups of the same Tropicana orange juice , with one cup darkened with food coloring , the members of the researcher 's sample group perceived differences in taste that did not exist .
However , when given two cups of orange juice that were the same color , with one cup sweetened with sugar , the same people failed to perceive taste differences .
" It seems unlikely that our consumers deliberately eschewed taste for color as a basis for discrimination , " write the authors .
" Moreover , our consumers succumbed to the influence of color but were less influenced by the powerful lure of brand and price information . "

Thank you all for writing in !!
We appreciate it , things have been a little crazy around the ISC today , so we have n't been able to throw some stuff up on the diary about the Quicktime bug .
( We 've had to wake everyone up , they all ate turkey ..
tryptophan ... it 's not pretty , anyway ... )
As outlined by Secunia , Apple 's Quicktime 7.2 and 7.3 has a overwrite condition via incorrect rtsp parsing .
Check it out here .
There are several things you can do until this gets patched ( just remember to undo them after you patch ! ) .
1 ) Block the RTSP protocol .
Ports are 554/tcp and 6970 - 6999 / udp .
CORRECTION : The RTSP protocol can go over any port .
( Thank you for correcting me . )
The US - CERT exact verbiage says :
" Blocking the RTSP protocol with proxy or firewall rules may help mitigate this vulnerability .
Note that RTSP ( default 554/tcp and 6970 - 6999 / udp ) may use a variety of port numbers , so blocking the protocol based on a particular port may not be sufficient . "
Excuse my poor paraphrasing .
2 ) Set the Killbit for Quicktime CLSID's :
{02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B}
{ 4063BE15-3B08-470D-A0D5-B37161CFFD69}
There are some other recommendations over at the US - CERT site .
But like I said , remember to undo them after the patch , or you will be wondering why things are n't working with your Quicktime streams .
Please remember that Quicktime is a component of iTunes ...
UPDATE : We have received a report that exploits are now working for Vista , XP , IE6 , IE7 , and Safari 3.0 on Windows .
Keep in mind that other attack vectors may be vulnerable as well .
UPDATE -2 : Firefox has been reported as an exploit vector as well .
UPDATE -3 : Thanks to a friend of mine :
What 's wrong with this picture ?
Boy this vulnerability looks familiar ...
http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2002-0252
UPDATE -4 : We recommend following US - CERT 's guidelines .
I 've been asked alot " what do you know , what can I do " .
Welp , that 's what I recommend .
UPDATE -5 : Looks like the exploit is now affecting OSX .
With this single exploit it affects :
" +leopard_ppc +leopard_x86 +tiger_x86 +tiger_ppc +win_xpsp2 "

Editor 's Note : Harvard Business School professor John Quelch writes a blog on marketing issues , called Marketing Know : How , for Harvard Business Online .
It is reprinted on HBS Working Knowledge .
Last month , Boeing stock went wobbly on news that test flights and initial deliveries of the Dreamliner would be delayed .
Apple 's stock , although it rebounded after a strong earnings report , dropped six percent when the company announced a $ 200 price cut on the iPhone only 8 weeks after the product launched .
CEOs , often dismissive of marketing , are discovering a dangerous reality : aggressive marketing and brand - building can boost stock prices by raising customer and investor expectations .
But the penalties for not delivering on marketing promises are fast becoming as significant as not meeting quarterly earnings targets .
Boeing had banked over 700 orders from 50 - plus airlines when a prototype 787 was showcased to the public from behind the hangar doors on July 8 , 2007 .
Boeing marketers had done a terrific job of positioning the Dreamliner as a step change improvement in air travel , all but blocking out news around the rival Airbus 380 .
The hype had brought forward demand from the Apple afficionistas who love all things Apple .
Slight problem : the 787 was already behind on its production schedule , with multiple parts suppliers falling short of their delivery targets .
Should Boeing have backed off its much - hyped coming out party ?
Perhaps not .
New airliners have typically experienced production delays ( the Airbus 380 is two years behind schedule ) and customers know this when they place their orders .
They will simply operate their existing 747s and 777s a little longer .
In addition , no airline manufacturer ever wants to be seen to be compromising safety by rushing a project .
And the delay to the 787 is not likely to give the equally - hyped ( and delayed ) Airbus 380 any competitive advantage .
The story at Apple is less benign and that explains why the stock was hammered harder .
The iPhone was heavily promoted at the time of its June 29 launch , resulting in long lines and spot shortages at Apple and AT&T retail stores .
Despite a retail price over $ 500 , iPhones were quickly being offered on eBay for $ 100 extra .
Two problems then arose : First , the reviews were mixed .
At that retail price and with that level of hype , the critics were going to be tough but a raft of concerns from delayed activation and sluggish email ( AT&T's responsibility as the exclusive network provider ) to feature shortfalls began to dampen marketplace enthusiasm .
The hype had brought forward demand from the Apple afficionistas who love all things Apple .
But these loyal customers were the very ones caught short when Apple announced a $ 200 iPhone price decrease 8 weeks after launch .
This suggested iPhone sales had slowed considerably below post - launch expectations and might not meet holiday season targets .
The stock price was punished immediately .
More significant perhaps is the possible damage to Apple brand equity among its core customers .
After heavy blogging complaints about Apple exploiting its loyal followers , Steve Jobs had to apologize publicly ( after a curt " That 's technology " response fueled the fire ) and volunteer rebates of half the price difference to those who had already bought the iPhone .
The moral of the story :
Do not risk marketing hype unless you are sure of both your supply curve and your demand curve .
Hype can hurt stock prices and investor confidence when expectations are not met .

Random thoughts about Software and other stuff ...
The intensity of that campaign left a mark on Ms. Pryce , who said she was turned off by the vitriol as well as the more than $ 4.5 million she had to raise and pour into her own attack ads .
“ It was obscene the amount of money I had to spend , ” said Ms. Pryce , a former municipal court judge .
Ms. Pryce said that after adopting her daughter as an infant , she knew she would have to leave Congress at some point and had considered retiring before the 2006 election .
But she hesitated and then felt compelled to stay and defend her seat once she drew a credible challenger .
Yet Ms. Pryce said she continued to be torn between Congress and her family — she was still wincing a few days ago about forgetting pajama day at her daughter ’s kindergarten — and around the Fourth of July decided to step down .
“ Being in the minority makes it easier , ” she said , “ but I was going in that direction anyway . ”
Ms. Pryce , thoroughly familiar with the rough and tumble of modern politics , sees little hope of a shift in tactics unless there is a public backlash , since she said her last campaign convinced her that negative ads work .
“ I do n’t think anything will change until Americans revolt and get it into their heads that they need to be informed voters instead of just listening to the paid political ads , ” she said .
Mr. Hobson , too , had considered leaving in the past and in anticipation sold his condominium in the Washington area a few years ago .
But as chairman of the appropriations panel that distributes money for energy and water projects , he was in a position to benefit his state .
Now , at 71 , he said he wanted to leave office while he was in good health .
The death earlier this year of a friend , Representative Paul E. Gillmor , is not far from his mind , he said .
Unlike the other two Ohio districts , Mr. Hobson ’s district in the Springfield area is probably secure for Republicans .
And he has been grooming a successor .
He also has a reputation for bipartisanship in Congress , traveling on official trips with Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Democrat of California , and cutting spending deals across the aisle .
“ The Democrats and I have gotten along very well , ” Mr. Hobson said .
“ I may have gotten more money with them than I did under our guys . ”
A number of years ago , I started working on a Python library for music theory and composition called Sebastian and one of the first implementation decisions I needed to make was how to represent pitch .
Assuming one allows for double - flats and double - sharps , there are 35 note names .
What I was looking for was a way to represent these 35 note names in a way that was consistent with the relationships between them .
I ended up deciding to use the set of integers with D as 0 and each successor being a 5th higher .
So A would be +1 , E +2 , G - 1 , Eb - 5 , F# +4 and so on .
This turns out to work quite nicely .
Given one note , you can find the tone above / below by adding / subtracting 2 and the semitone ( different letter ) above / below by subtracting / adding 5 .
To augment / diminish ( same letter ) you can add / subtract 7 .
You can determine if two notes are enharmonic by testing
( abs ( val1 - val2 ) % 12 ) == 0
You generate the textual note name from this integer with :
modifiers = ( ( val + 3 ) - ( ( val + 3 ) % 7 ) ) / 7 if modifiers == 0 : m_name = " " elif modifiers == 1 : m_name = " # " elif modifiers > 1 : m_name = " x " * ( modifiers - 1 ) else : # m < 0 m_name = " b " * - modifiers return " DAEBFCG " [ val % 7 ] + m_name
and the reverse with
letter = name [ 0 ] base = " FCGDAEB " . find ( letter ) - 3 if base == - 4 : raise ValueError mod = name [ 1 : ] if mod == " " : m = 0 elif mod == " # " : m = 1 elif mod == " x " * len ( mod ) : m = len ( mod ) + 1 elif mod == " b " * len ( mod ) : m = - len ( mod ) else : raise ValueError return base + m * 7
While it 's true that moving the origin to F would eliminate some of those - 3s and +3s , new ones would need to be introduced , so there 's no really clear winner between an origin at D versus an origin at F .
Scales are easy to generate .
The pattern for a major scale is [ 0 , 2 , 4 , - 1 , 1 , 3 , 5 ] and so you can generate the scale for a particular tonic with something like
[ tonic + i for i in [ 0 , 2 , 4 , - 1 , 1 , 3 , 5 ] ]
Another advantage of the system is it can be extended to 19 - et and other tuning systems .
I have n't given much thought to whether it 's useful for tunings without a constant frequency ratio for the 5th , though .
I also have n't yet investigated how this system is inferior to Hewlett 's base - 40 system .
UPDATE : Okay , I 've finally grokked the functional difference between Hewlett 's system and mine .
Mine can incorporate an infinite number of note names ( triple flats , quadruple sharps , you name it ) but it cannot express intervals of an octave or more .
Hewlett 's base - 40 system can handle intervals of octaves or above but cannot , without change , handle more than the 35 note names of 12 - tone chromatic music .
My system ( and others like it ) require two numbers to handle more than an octave .
Hewlett traded off infinite note - naming capability for the ability to include octave in a single number .

A manhunt is under way Tuesday for two inmates who chipped their way out of a New Jersey jail and left behind a note wishing authorities " Happy Holidays . "
Officials say the two inmates carved an 18 - inch hole in the wall of one of their cells and wiggled through it .
Jose Espinosa , 20 , and Otis Blunt , 32 , who are considered armed and dangerous , were discovered missing from their cells at about 5:15 p.m. Saturday , according to Ted Romankow , Union County , New Jersey 's prosecutor .
Police said Espinosa and Blunt were in adjacent cells in the high - security area of the multilevel Union County Jail .
They used a long metal wire to scrape away mortar around the cinder block between their cells and in the outer wall in Espinosa 's cell , police said .
Once the cement block between the cells was removed , they smashed the block and hid the pieces in a footlocker .
They hung photographs of bikini - clad women to hide the holes in the walls .
According to police , Blunt , who is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds , squeezed into Espinosa 's cell through an approximately 16 - to 18 - inch hole .
The two inmates wiggled through another 18 - inch hole in the outer wall .
From a roof landing , the two men " took a running jump or they were standing and they jumped approximately 15 feet out and about 30 feet down , " Romankow said .
Then they jumped a razor - wire fence onto a New Jersey transit railroad bed to freedom , police said .
Authorities found two sets of footprints in the snow heading in opposite directions .
Watch as authorities downplay comparisons with movie jailbreak »
To delay discovery of the escape , Espinosa and Blunt left dummies made of sheets and pillows in their beds .
At a news conference Monday , Romankow read the note found in Espinosa 's cell , saying it represented the " arrogance of these two men . "
" Thank you officer -------- for the tools needed , you 're a real pal , Happy Holidays , " the note read , with a smiley face drawn next to it .
Espinosa , who recently pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter , was to be sentenced January 25 and faced a minimum of 17 years in prison .
Blunt was being held in lieu of a $ 75,000 bond on weapon and robbery charges .
The way the inmates used pinups to hide their escape route was reminiscent of a scene in the 1994 movie " The Shawshank Redemption . "
Romankow played down the comparison .
" I think this is a very serious situation you saw , " he said .
" I really prefer not to compare with any movie , although I can understand why you might , because it does look certainly very similar to some of them .
Except in ' The Shawshank Redemption , ' they had a better poster on the wall . "
According to police , Blunt tried to escape in September using similar methods .
There is an $ 8,000 reward for the men 's capture .
Romankow said several agencies were involved in the statewide hunt .

Two conservative
Time magazine columnists are on their way out the door : Neither William Kristol nor longtime contributor Charles Krauthammer will be on contract with the magazine starting next month .
Mr. Krauthammer confirmed the news to Off the Record , and a spokeswoman for Time said Mr. Kristol ’s contract would not be renewed .
And according to two sources familiar with the discussions , Time is in negotiations with National Review editor Ramesh Ponnuru to sign him to a contributor contract .
Mr. Ponnuru , who in 2006 published The Party of Death : The Democrats , the Media , the Courts , and the Disregard for Human Life , has written twice for the magazine over the past month .
The exact reasons for the departures of Mr. Krauthammer and Mr. Kristol , both high - profile backers of the Iraq war , are not entirely clear .
“ I was very happy to work with them , ” said Mr. Krauthammer on the phone from his Washington office .
“ And I have a lot of things that occupy me . ”
Asked if he would have preferred to stay with the magazine , Mr. Krauthammer , a Pulitzer Prize winner who writes a regular column for The Washington Post , suggested there was n’t much of a choice .
“ It ’s a hypothetical that did n’t arise , ” he said .
The Time spokeswoman would not detail the reasons for ending the contract of Mr. Kristol , the editor of The Weekly Standard , but said that the decision was mutual .
Mr. Kristol did not return a call for comment .
Back in March , Time managing editor Richard Stengel , who took over in May 2006 , redesigned the magazine , putting columnists front - and - center .
The top - heavy banner with the name “ Krauthammer ” was a visual signature in the new look ; Mr. Kristol was hired last December , along with the liberal columnist Michael Kinsley , as part of an effort by Mr. Kristol to hire what he described as “ star writers . ”
“ They ’ve been looking for columnists basically since Rick came here , ” said one Time staffer .
“ He ’s in love with columnists — the idea of columnists . ”
Mr. Stengel , though , has rejected at least one high - profile potential columnist hire .
Radar reported last month that he declined to sign Karl Rove , when approached about the idea by Mr. Rove ’s agent , Robert Barnett .
Mr. Rove is now a columnist for Newsweek .
As for the two recent departures , Mr. Krauthammer has had a diminished presence in Time lately .
He ’s written for the magazine only once since March , compared to the eight times he wrote last year and the nine times he wrote in 2005 .
Mr. Kristol , for his part , had been on the job only 11 months , during which time he penned fewer than 20 columns , including only four since July ( one recent piece outlined why the Republicans can win the White House ; another , about the nature of patriotism , was titled “ Learning from Lincoln ’s Wisdom ” ) .
The Time spokewoman said that Mr. Stengel was not available for comment , because the magazine is closing its annual “ Person of the Year ” issue .
She added , of the two departing columnists : “ We hope and expect each of them will continue to contribute to Time frequently . ”
No matter where you call home , there 's a good chance that one of your neighbors is busy making some kind of booze .
Brewing , distilling , and winemaking are nearly universal activities , and folks will ferment just about anything .
1 . If you want to try traditional chicha , go to Peru or Bolivia , where women chew corn flour and then spit it into bowls .
Enzymes in their saliva help break down the sugars in the corn .
Chicha tastes tart and can be white , yellow , red , purple , or even black depending on the corn used .
Today you can buy a liter of this favorite drink of the Incas for about 10 cents in bars called chicherias .
2. Kumiss is a Mongolian specialty made from horse 's milk .
It 's not very alcoholic , though — only about 2 % — so you 're going to have to drink a lot of kumiss to get a buzz .
But that 's exactly what nomadic Mongolians do , downing gallons of the stuff during high kumiss season .
We may be hearing more about kumiss in the future : Japanese scientists have discovered that it can dramatically lower your cholesterol .
3. Sahti is an ancient Finnish beer still being made in the traditional way on farms .
It is filtered and spiced with juniper branches , and every August there 's a brewing competition that helps keep this national homebrew alive .
The winner is called the " Holder of the Haarikka , "  with the haarikka in question being ceremonial wooden bucket used — you guessed it !— for drinking sahti .
Commercial breweries have also gotten in on the action :
In Finland you can also go out and buy a three - liter box of sahti .
Read on for eleven more indigenous alcoholic beverages from around the world ...
4. Manioc , also known as cassava and yucca , is a worldwide staple , especially in South America , where many cultures have developed beers from this tuber .
You'd think it would be dangerous , because manioc contains cyanide , but local women know how to remove the poison through careful preparation .
In Peru , manioc beer is called masato .
In Guyana , it 's parakari .
In Suriname , it 's cassiri and is said to be warm , sour , and dense .
In Ecuador , it 's nihamanchi .
The locals drink it like water , up to four gallons a day for men .
They also make a high - alcohol version for ceremonies .
5. Shakparo is a sorghum beer from Benin , West Africa , where every kitchen contains a brewery .
Producing this sour , fruity brown - pink beer is an essential skill that every mother teaches to her daughter as a rite of passage .
Though it 's men who drink most of the shakparo , a woman was assured a certain level of status if she knows how to make it .
Like many of the other beers mentioned here , shakparo is now produced commercially and has been celebrated by folks with gluten allergies because it contains no wheat .
And here are nine other beverages for your next booze fest ( including root beer for the kids and teetotalers ) ...
" ¢ Europeans settling on the American frontier were used to drinking beer every day , but they did n't have key Old World ingredients like barley or malt .
So instead they used roots to make root beer , from which our familiar soft drink has descended .
" ¢ Hard apple cider was a staple drink on the American frontier , consumed by adults and children alike .
Johnny " Appleseed " Chapman was planting apple trees for cider , not for eating .
We know this because apple trees grown from seed produce funky and often inedible apples , and the best way to salvage them is to make cider .
If you want to grow edible apples , you do so by grafting from existing trees .
" ¢ Perry is a hard cider made from pears .
" ¢ Ginger beer was originally alcoholic .
It was quite popular in the U.S. until Prohibition stamped it out .
" ¢ Arrack is a Sri Lankan liquor made by fermenting and blending the nectar of coconut palms .
A " toddy tapper "  climbs from tree to tree on ropes harvesting the nectar .
" ¢ Brem is a rice wine native to Bali .
" ¢ Wine made from the fruit of the saguaro cactus of the Sonoran Desert plays an important role in Native American rituals .
" ¢ Banana beer is popular throughout Africa .
" ¢ Tesquino , the yellow , harsh corn beer of the Tarahumara people of Mexico , is considered a highly spiritual drink .
It 's supposed to scare out the " large souls "  out of the body , leaving the " little souls , "  which , they says , explains why drunk people act childish .

The Federal Bureau of Investigation today revealed the second phase of its Operation ‘ Bot Roast ’ netted eight individuals that have been indicted , pled guilty , or been sentenced for crimes related to botnet activity .
Additionally , 13 search warrants were served in the U.S. and by overseas law enforcement partners in connection with the operation , the FBI said .
This ongoing effort has thus far uncovered more than $ 20 million in economic loss and more than one million victim computers .
The botherders identified by the FBI as part of Bot Roast II are as follows :
· Ryan Brett Goldstein , 21 , of Ambler , Pennsylvania , was indicted on 11/01/07 by a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for botnet related activity which caused a distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) attack at the University of Pennsylvania .
In the midst of this investigation the FBI was able to neutralize a vast portion of the criminal botnet by disrupting the botnet ’s ability to communicate with other botnets .
In doing so , it reduced the risk for infected computers to facilitate further criminal activity .
This investigation continues as more individuals are being sought .
· Adam Sweaney , 27 , of Tacoma , Washington , pled guilty on September 24 , 2007 in U.S. District Court , District of Columbia , to a one count felony violation for conspiracy fraud and related activity in connection with computers .
He conspired with others to send tens of thousands of email messages during a one - year period .
In addition , Sweaney surreptitiously gained control of hundreds of thousands of bot controlled computers .
Sweaney would then lease the capabilities of the compromised computers to others who launched spam and DDoS attacks .
· Robert Matthew Bentley of Panama City , Florida , was indicted on 11/27/07 by a federal grand jury in the Northern District of Florida for his involvement in botnet related activity involving coding and adware schemes .
This investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Secret Service .
· Alexander Dmitriyevich Paskalov , 38 , multiple U.S. addresses , was sentenced on 10/12/2007 in U.S. District Court , Northern District of Florida , and received 42 months in prison for his participation in a significant and complex phishing scheme that targeted a major financial institution in the Midwest and resulted in multi-million dollar losses .
· Azizbek Takhirovich Mamadjanov , 21 , residing in Florida , was sentenced in June 2007 in U.S. District Court , Northern District of Florida , to 24 months in prison for his part in the same Midwest bank phishing scheme as Paskalov .
Paskalov established a bogus company and then opened accounts in the names of the bogus company .
The phishing scheme in which Paskolov and Mamadjanov participated targeted other businesses and electronically transferred substantial sums of money into their bogus business accounts .
Immigrations Customs Enforcement , Florida Department of Law Enforcement , and the Panama City Beach Police Department were active partners in this investigation .
· John Schiefer , 26 , of Los Angeles , California , agreed to plead guilty on 11/8/2007 in U.S. District Court in the Central District of California , to a four felony count criminal information .
A well - known member of the botnet underground , Schiefer used malicious software to intercept Internet communications , steal usernames and passwords , and defraud legitimate businesses .
Schiefer transferred compromised communications and usernames and passwords and also used them to fraudulently purchase goods for himself .
This case was the first time in the U.S. that someone has been charged under the federal wiretap statute for conduct related to botnets .
· Gregory King , 21 , of Fairfield , California , was indicted on 9/27/2007 by a federal grand jury in the Central District of California on four counts of transmission of code to cause damage to a protected computer .
King allegedly conducted DDoS attacks against various companies including a web based company designed to combat phishing and malware .
· Jason Michael Downey , 24 , of Dry Ridge , Kentucky , was sentenced on 10/23/2007 in U.S. District Court , Eastern District of Michigan , to 12 months in prison followed by probation , restitution , and community service for operating a large botnet that conducted numerous DDoS attacks that resulted in substantial damages .
Downey operated Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) network Rizon .
Downey stated that most of the attacks he committed were on other IRC networks or on the people that operated them .
Downey ’s targets of DDoS often resided on shared servers which contained other customer ’s data .
As a result of DDoS to his target , innocent customers residing on the same physical server also fell victim to his attacks .
One victim confirmed financial damages of $ 19,500 as a result of the DDoS attacks .
“ Today , botnets are the weapon of choice of cyber criminals .
They seek to conceal their criminal activities by using third party computers as vehicles for their crimes .
In Bot Roast II , we see the diverse and complex nature of crimes that are being committed through the use of botnets , ” said FBI Director Robert S. Mueller .
“ Despite this enormous challenge , we will continue to be aggressive in finding those responsible for attempting to exploit unknowing Internet users . ”
A botherder can gain control of computers by unleashing malicious software such as viruses , worms , or trojan horses .
By executing a simple task such as opening an attachment , clicking on an advertisement , or providing personal information to a phishing site ( a fraudulent site that mimics a legitimate site ) , an individual computer user has unintentionally allowed unauthorized access .
Bot operators will then typically use these compromised computers as vehicles to facilitate other actions such as commit identity theft , launch denial of service attacks , and install keystroke loggers .
In June the Department of Justice and FBI announced Operation Bot Roast and at that time said ongoing investigations have identified over 1 million botnet crime victims .
The FBI is working with industry partners , including the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University , to notify the victim owners of the computers .
Microsoft and the Botnet Task Force have also helped out the FBI .
Through this process the FBI may uncover additional incidents in which botnets have been used to facilitate other criminal activity , the FBI said in a statement .
" The little water - saving gestures , like putting a bucket in the shower or turning the tap off while you brush your teeth — while they are good measures , and I do them myself — are exactly that , gestures .
" They are going to contribute almost nothing to solving Australia 's water crisis and we are deluding ourselves if we think it 's going to be enough , " Dr Byron said .
He said two or three large irrigators , such as dairy or cotton farms , would use " in a couple of days " the water the entire city of Melbourne could save in a year .
Earlier this month , Victorian Water Minister John Thwaites praised Melburnians for their water - saving efforts over summer .
The city of Melbourne had saved , on average , 209 megalitres ( million litres ) of water every day .
" This is a great savings effort equivalent to a saving of around 19 billion litres of water over summer , " Mr Thwaites said .
But by comparison Australia 's largest irrigator , Queensland cotton farm Cubbie Station , has a water allocation in excess of 400,000 megalitres a year .
It has on - farm water storages bigger than Sydney Harbour .
When water is available , it uses an average of 1095 megalitres every day , more than five times the amount saved by the 3.7 million people of Melbourne .
The 19,000 megalitres of water saved by Melburnians over the three months of summer would be used by Cubbie Station alone in about 2½ weeks .
Australia uses about 24 million megalitres of water a year .
About 75 per cent is used in irrigation , 20 per cent goes to urban and industrial uses and 5 per cent to other rural uses including for stock and domestic needs .
Dr Byron said household water - saving gestures should still be encouraged .
" One of the good things about these small gestures is they indicate public interest and buy - in , that is the public care about this issue , they 're concerned about it , and they want to help .
" That 's terrific for when it gets to the really serious stage , and we really need to do something that involves a little bit of pain , the public is already onside , " he said .
" But these little gestures will not even get us close to where we want go .
If every man , woman and child in Australia was to do it , the difference in water use would be negligible .
" The problem is the big actions carry with them a pretty big tag , but rather than bite the bullet and adopt some of the big changes needed , we 're told to be satisfied with making these symbolic gestures . "
Unless large - scale water - saving methods were adopted by governments , state and federal , Australia 's water crisis would only worsen , Dr Byron said .
“ From our perspective , this does bring to light a public health concern , but for a different reason , ” said Kimberly Martinez , the executive director of the Abstinence Clearinghouse , which advocates abstinence from sex until marriage .
“ These young women are relying on this contraception to protect them .
But contraception is n’t 100 percent — for pregnancy or for disease . ”
The price change came as part of the tangled method by which drug manufacturers pay rebates to states for prescription drugs covered by Medicaid , the federal drug program for low - income people .
Those rebates are set by calculations that take into account the lowest prices paid for certain drugs .
Since 1990 , the steeply discounted contraception given to university health centers and low - income clinics was considered exempt from those calculations .
The arrangement helped those who could least afford the contraceptives to receive them , but was also seen as potentially beneficial to drug companies , which might not make money on the college clinic sales but were able to market their products to young women who might grow accustomed to one brand over another .
More recently though , legislators , worried about abuse in the rebate calculations , set strict limits about which facilities would be exempt .
Student health centers , among others , were left out — an unintended oversight , some lawmakers now say .

The new rules , part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 , came into effect at the start of this year , prompting pharmaceutical manufacturers to tell college clinics that they could no longer afford the huge discounts .
Knowing that the change was coming , many health clinics stocked up on the discounted prescriptions and were able to offer cheaper contraception for months , into the summer and even the fall .
Then prices began skyrocketing .
“ What happened here is what happened everywhere :
The price went up , ” said Jeanne Galatzer - Levy of the University of Illinois at Chicago .
“ We are a state institution , so we ’re not in a position to do something different . ”
Hi all ,
Since functional reactive programming has come up here a few times in the past , I figured my posting of this would n't be too out - of - place ...
I 've been working for the past few months on a functional reactive GUI system for O'Caml called " O'Caml Reactive Toolkit " .
The core FR logic is based heavily on Haskell 's Yampa , while the FR API is modelled after PLT Scheme 's FrTime ( users of FrTime should feel at home with the API ) , so there is not much new there .
The novelty is in the GUI API , which constructs a GUI via functions , in contrast to systems such as Fudgets ( which uses arrows ) , or SuperGlue ( which uses objects with explicit signal connections ) .
The goal in API design is simplicity and clarity .
As an example , here is a toy temperature conversion program :
open
Fr open FrGui let _ = let temp_box , temp = float_entry 20 .
in let fahrenheit = lift ( ( @temp -. 32 . ) *. 1.8 ) and celsuis = lift ( @temp /. 1.8 +. 32 . ) in let main_window = window ~title : " Temperature converter " ( hbox [ hbox [ label " Convert " ; temp_box ; label " to : " ] ; vbox [ hbox [ label " degrees Fahrenheit : " ; float_view fahrenheit ] ; hbox [ label " degrees Celsius : " ; float_view celsius ] ] ] ) in run_dialog ( main_window , main_window #close )
The temperature entered by the user is instantly converted to both degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius .
( Note the definitions of " float_entry " and " float_view " , although trivial , have been left out to save space . )
Though O'Caml RT is far from complete I made a prerelease because I want to solicit feedback from others who are interested in functional reactive programming .
I made a web page providing links to the source code , documentation , and ( coming soon ) examples .
It 's known to compile on Mac OS X and Linux , and it should be possible already to write many simple GUI applications using it .
My questions to you are :
Am I duplicating work ?
I know of systems such as Fudgets ( arrow - based ) and SuperGlue ( object - based ) ; would I be better off to use one of those as a model than to create my own ?
What would you want to see in a functional - reactive GUI toolkit ?
i.e. what things which are often awkward to express in procedural langauges do you think should be made easy in O'Caml RT ?
What are some examples of things which are easy in procedural languages but you think would be awkward in a functional - reactive setting ?
Is the API clear and understandable ?
e.g. does the above example make sense ( even to those who do n't know O'Caml ) ?
Thanks in advance for your feedback !
( P.S. I do n't want this to come off as a plug for O'Caml RT ... if any of the admins feel this is too specific a topic for LtU I 'll try to find a more appropriate forum to discuss it in . )

The Nuvuk site is a snowmobile ride away from modern - day Barrow
There are bodies , the voice on the end of the line told Anne Jensen ; we do n't know who they were , or why they are here .
" People started noticing stuff eroding out of the bluff , " she recalls , " and I got called out , along with the police , the real estate people and so on .
" It was very clearly an archaeological burial .
And the bluff was collapsing quickly , so we just got the contents out . "
The bluff lies virtually at the end of the Americas , on a narrow , hooked spit projecting northwards from Barrow .
It marks the join of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas , and is prey to the temperamental vagaries of both .
I used to think that my ancestors were really smart , but I never knew they achieved so much
Ben Frantz II
These bodies , these bones , clearly came from no crime scene .
The police could leave , and Dr Jensen 's team could get to work on a find more closely related to its own interests .
It has been working every summer since .
Disappearing land
When I visit in late May , the spit itself is virtually invisible beneath the blanket of ice which carpets land and sea alike .
Led by Laura Thomas , we speed out on to the ice on snowmobiles , bodies swathed in heavy - duty parkas and feet wrapped in " bunny boots " which include a layer of air to insulate the delicate extremities .
After perhaps 20 minutes we disembark at the point , the site of ancient Nuvuk .
The higher level of ice is a clue that we are on land , and grey - brown late Spring melt mush materialises beneath our feet as we walk , to prove the case .
Here , at the edge , is Anne Jensen 's bluff , where bodies began appearing a decade ago .
Or at least , here is where it is now ; then it was 100 metres or so further out to sea .
" We 've had a lot of changing in currents over the past decade or so , " explains Dr Thomas , " and with the changing currents and increased storm activity in the fall especially , it 's undercutting the gravels and the point is literally washing out into the ocean . "
And as the point washes out , so do the bodies .
What used to be an accreting spit - one building up - has become an eroding spit as the coastal ebbs and flows have changed their seasonal patterns , perhaps at the behest of global climate change .
" It 's eroding at about 20 m per year ; we only have an eight - week field season , and we need to cover at least 300 m of shore , " she says .
" So it 's salvage archaeology - we have to beat the erosion . "
Tunnels into history
The team uncovers about 20 complete burials each year .
The methodology now involves digging exploration holes every few metres in a lattice pattern - " Swiss - cheesing " , as Laura Thomas calls it - and excavating the newly identified burial sites .
Most of the bodies were interred in a rough framework made of wood or whale bones , with a piece of driftwood on top ; some were also wrapped in animal skin or fur .
Whalebone tools for making nets have been found in Nuvuk burials
There is armour made from whale baleen .
Many of the graves also contain flat stones , which presumably have some kind of ceremonial purpose .
Researchers can also call on human memory and lore , because Nuvuk retained human inhabitants until about 60 years ago .
And although the houses have gone , Ukpeagvik , in the middle of what is now Barrow , has been an important site for studying remains of dwellings from the same period and culture ; dwellings of impressive complexity built with subterranean cold - traps , entrance tunnels supported by whale mandibles , and insulation by sod .
Arctic origins
But what period and culture does Nuvuk represent ?
Clearly it was complex enough 1,000 years ago to support whaling , an activity which needs great co-ordination within the community .
Crews must organise hunting , villagers must turn out for a swift butchering , meat must be stored , seals caught to make umiaq , and trading enacted to bring in caribou meat and driftwood .
" I think these are very early Thule people , " opines Anne Jensen .
" One of the big questions is where did the Thule come from ?
The culture was first described in the eastern Arctic , and it's clearly the ancestor of the modern Inupiat and Inuit cultures ; but where did it develop ? "
Whaling is the keystone ; it's what everything in the culture is organised around
Laura Thomas
" My idea is it started somewhere in northern Alaska , perhaps in a major whaling area ; and it does n't seem to stop , moving from place to place looking for whales . "
A community organised for whaling , she believes , would have had an edge over competing cultures .
The social hierarchy and regular experiences of mass mobilisation would have made for organised defence and perhaps attack too , while a diet rich in whalemeat meant better nutrition .
Laura Thomas believes you can draw a direct line between the Thule culture and the modern Inupiat , the traditional residents of Barrow and many settlements around .
And the line , she says , is drawn in whalemeat .
" Whaling is the keystone ; it 's what everything in the culture is organised around , " she says .
" It is the defining element of what makes ' Thule ' , Thule ; and in modern times , what makes ' Inupiat ' , Inupiat . "
Cool runners
When the first bodies washed out of the sea - battered bluff a decade ago , interest was high , but funding to excavate and examine stubbornly low .
That has changed ; and since 2005 , the researchers have received grants from Echo , a US federal programme aiming to give high school students a regular taste of real science .
The students spend several weeks digging alongside researchers , which given the shortness of the digging season and the necessity of getting the bodies out fast would be described as a dawn - to - dusk job , if the north Alaskan summer had dawns or dusks rather than 24 - hour sunlight .
Flags are used to mark locations meriting a closer look
" I thought it would be pretty cool to see how my ancestors lived , " the fresh - faced 19 - year - old Inupiat tells me .
" Originally it was just a job ; but as it turned out we started working on weekends and it was kind of fun , so I decided to stay for a while . "
Now employed as a research assistant , his main task is to catalogue artefacts - arrowheads , harpoon shafts , scrapers , tools , and sled runners .
So much has been recovered that he is still working on artefacts unearthed in 2005 .
But , he says , it has been a worthwhile experience .
" It 's changed my view of my own culture .
I used to think that my ancestors were really smart , but I never knew they achieved so much . "
As the Point Barrow bluff erodes , the rescue mission will presumably continue .
Bodies will be snatched from the ocean 's grasp each short summer , examined and catalogued before a new internment in the safer soils of modern Barrow .
Each body is a fragment of the town 's past , a reminder of the long history of whale - centred culture which binds the threads of a millennium .
They are treasures which neither the Barrow community nor its modern scientific boarders are minded to let wash away .

Jay Leno's Green Garage Makeover Cost Almost $ 500K
Like us on Facebook :
The current article you are reading does not reflect the views of the current editors and contributors of the new Ecorazzi
For a guy pulling in $ 25 million a year , $ 500 K for a sweet , green setup certainly is n’t going to hurt .
But damn !
Comedian Jay Leno certainly has been throwing some green at making his personal garage as eco-friendly as possible .
$ 450 K alone went for the 54 - kilowatt solar - power system he installed atop his garage last month .
Just to diversify ( Because Jay says two - thirds of the day , there ’s not enough sunlight to generate electricity ) , he also spent $ 19,000 on a 10 KW vertical - axis turbine from PacWind .
What ’s next on his list ?
His home .
From the article ,
“ I guess I ’m a rich guy , ” said Leno , who makes an estimated $ 25 million annually as host of “ The Tonight Show . ”
“ I can afford to do it , so why do n’t I be the one that experiments with it and tries it out ?
And if it works , if enough people like me try it , then it passes down and becomes more affordable . ”
So far , Leno has installed solar panels and a wind turbine only at his garage because he uses a lot more electricity there than at his house .
But his Beverly Hills home is the “ next step , ” said the comedian , who ’s been frustrated by frequent power outages .
“ Our power was out for 18 hours about a month ago , for no reason , ” he said .
“ It was a beautiful day .
Bink .
What happened ?
It ’s like you ’re in a Third World country now in California . ”
That ’s part of why Leno believes “ if you want to keep living the way you ’re living , then , hey , you better make your own electricity . ”
Good advice .
Let ’s hope such purchases like this one enable us “ regular ” folk to afford such an option in the future .
Jay ’s 14,000 square foot facility has also received some updates to its flooring in the way of something similar to these rubber garage floor mats to protect the flooring from the sheer volume of vehicles that drive over it on a regular basis .
This durable flooring solution is also very easy to clean and drain and is an affordable way to give any garage a professional finish .

There is nothing I like more then to find or hear about hidden easter eggs in software , games , products , etc .
I just love it !
You probably heard of the famous Google moon easter egg that when you zoom in really close , the moon surface starts to slowly turn into yellow swiss cheese .
I recently saw that even Spybot Search & Destroy , a free anti spyware software , has developed their own easter egg .
Believe it or not , but when you click on the small binoculars image on the top left of the screen while scanning , a little game pops out .
The goal of the game is to uncover all the numbers in order to reveal the hidden picture underneath .
It is n’t difficult to recognize the image , but it is n’t as easy to finish the game .
So next time you are bored and are scanning for spyware on your laptop or desktop , remember the little hidden game that is available for all .
Enjoy !
Hillary Clinton : A Win-Win For Corporate America
By John F. Miglio
It ’s a done deal .
The corporate power brokers who hold the politicians in their pockets like so many nickels and dimes have already hedged their bets and decided that -- barring any unforeseen circumstances -- Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee for president .
It ’s the smart choice for them , a win - win situation .
Naturally , they would rather see a Republican become the next president , someone just as corrupt and heartless and dimwitted as George W. Bush , their ultimate wet dream .
However , this is a tall order .
It will be difficult to find another human being -- even a Republican -- so thoroughly bought and paid for with corporate dollars and so unbelievably devoid of compassion for average Americans .
Nevertheless , the corporate power brokers have plenty of Republican candidates to choose from , and any of them would be suitable replacements -- except for Ron Paul , of course , who actually has some degree of integrity and independence , which immediately rules him out .
But if polls are any indication of future success , and if the Republican candidate is destined to lose the next presidential election , who better than Hillary to win ?
Of all the Democrats running for president , which one is the most mainstream and accommodating to corporate America ?
Which one has already sucked up to John McCain , Newt Gingrich , and Rupert Murdoch ?
Which one has a husband who makes the scene with George H.W.
Bush every time there ’s a natural disaster ?
Which one has no compunction about shifting her political philosophy to suit her ambitions , beginning as a conservative “ Goldwater girl ” in high school , to a liberal supporter of George McGovern in college , to a centrist Senator in the current Congress ?
And which one knows how to play the Machiavellian game of hardball politics in Washington better than anyone ?
In other words , Hillary is the safe choice .
The corporate elite have dealt with her and her husband for years , and they know they can count on the king and queen of compromise not to push the envelope nor do anything radical to shift the balance of power in the United States to a more populist agenda .
Ironically , many Democrats ( especially women ) are under the delusion that Hillary is liberal , even progressive , and they think she will right all the wrongs of the Bush regime .
But what many of these individuals fail to realize is that on the three most important issues of our time -- health care , the U.S. occupation of Iraq , and renewable energy -- she ’s almost as conservative as her Republican presidential opponents .
And Obama and Edwards are n’t much better .
In fact , the only real Democrats in the race who are n’t bought and paid for by corporate America are Dennis Kucinich and Mike Gravel , but like Ron Paul , they have no chance of winning .
This political reality is very depressing to liberals and progressives since once again their choice for president in the next election will be between two corporate - backed candidates who will do the bidding of their financial malefactors and leave most Americans out in the cold .
As a result , Democratic power brokers like Rahm Emanuel will once again use the same old saw to get liberals and progressives to vote for the lesser of two evils :
“ All right , maybe Hillary is n’t as liberal as you would like , but she is certainly better than her Republican counterpart . ”
In other words , forget about voting for a candidate that would actually promote single payer universal health care , withdraw from Iraq within six months , and create a national renewable energy program that would undercut the power of the fossil fuels industry and ameliorate global warming .
The best you ’re going to get in our corrupt , corporate fascist system is Hillary .
So be thankful for her , boys and girls .
And remember , a half a loaf of bread is better than no loaf at all .
This was the same argument that Bill and Hillary used in the oval office when they negotiated with a Republican - controlled Congress .
But what did liberals or progressives ever get out of their half - baked , “ half - loaf ” strategy ?
Name one major piece of liberal legislation that Bill and Hillary proposed during their two terms in office that was signed into law ?
NAFTA ?
Welfare reform ?
A balanced budget ?
Oh , wait !
They were part of the conservative Republican agenda !
Ca n’t think of any ?
Neither can I . They got killed on health care , they did almost nothing on renewable energy ( just ask Al Gore ) , and they stood idly by as wages stagnated and the disparity between the rich and poor continued onward and upward .
So when Democrats wax nostalgic for the 1990s and tell you how great the Clinton era was for average Americans , do n’t believe it -- it ’s pure propaganda .
It ’s no different than when Republicans tell you what a great president Ronald Reagan was .
The truth is , both “ Slick Willie ” and the “ Amiable Dunce ” were consummate salesmen , ambitious alpha males with smiley faces who were more concerned with their own careers than the welfare of most Americans .
And neither of them was averse to dropping their drawers from time to time and bending over for their corporate masters .
The only difference was that Reagan did it gladly , whereas Clinton did it reluctantly ( and felt a little pain in the process ) .
But this time things will be different , say rank - and - file Democrats .
If Hillary gets elected president and has a Democratic majority in Congress , she ’ll do the right thing .
She ’s more liberal than her husband was when he was president , more independent too , more willing to fight for the underdog .
In fact , she ’ll cross her corporate backers as soon as she gets in office and start a new era of populism in America , just like FDR did .
Yes , kids , would n’t it be pretty to think so !
But if Nancy “ Impeachment Is off the Table ” Pelosi is any indicator of how a tough liberal woman is supposed to act when she assumes the reigns of power in the Democratic Party , we ’re in for a big disappointment , because Hillary is less liberal than Nancy .
Hell , she ’s even less liberal than Joe Biden or Chris Dodd -- they did n’t vote for the Bush resolution that labels the Iranian Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization and sets the stage for an upcoming invasion of Iran .
This painting could be fairly important not only because the artist is nationally recognized but because of the ancestry of the sitter .
According to Paul Heinegg , author of " Free People of Color in North Carolina , " this Thomas Johnson , a wealthy Maryland planter , was none other than the great grandson of Anthony Johnson , one of the earliest African Americans to settle Virginia .
And it is this very Anthony Johnson who is a pivotal figure in the debate over the origins of slavery .
Anthony Johnson had acquired close to a thousand acres of land by the middle of the 17th century and was among the first generation of free blacks whose relative affluence have forced scholars of the Colonial south to revise their original views on the origins of American slavery and the fine line between this " peculiar " institution and indentured servitude .
What makes Anthony Johnson a central figure in the debate is an utterly bizarre and " politically incorrect " twist of fate .
From evidence found in the earliest legal documents extant , it is Anthony Johnson who we now must recognize as the nation 's first slaveholder .
After all , the court battle he eventually won in 1655 to keep John Casor ( Ceasar ? ) as his servant for life , identifies this unfortunate soul as the first slave in the recorded history of our country .
Claiming that he had been imported as an indentured servant , Casor attempted to transfer what he argued was his remaining time of service to Robert Parker , a white , but Johnson insisted that " hee had ye Negro for his life " .
The court ruled that " seriously consideringe and maturely weighing the premisses , doe fynde that the saide Mr. Robert Parker most unjustly keepeth the said Negro from Anthony Johnson his master ....
It is therefore the Judgement of the Court and ordered That the said John Casor Negro forthwith returne unto the service of the said master Anthony Johnson , And that mr .
Robert Parker make payment of all charges in the suit . "
Even though it is quite possible for a bi-racial person to favor only one of the parents , the reason for the totally European features of the portrait is obviously the proportion of his white to black ancestry .
According to some historians , since both Anthony Johnson and his wife were possibly Hispanic , there might have already been some Caucasian admixture in either one or both of their genetic makeups .
Indeed a son was officially described as " Richard Johnson Mollatto . "
Although Susanna , the wife of John , another son of theirs , is noted as black , it has also been documented that this John had also produced offspring with Hannah Leach , a white .
Heinegg suggests that the father of the sitter in the above Peale portrait , is John 's son , Anthony , obviously named for his grandfather .
However , because of how old he would have been at the time of his marriage , ( between 45 and 50 in 1699 ) , my personal suspicion is that he was , instead , John 's grandson .
Whatever the case , this particular Anthony 's wife was white and if Heinegg has indeed skipped a generation , then his mother was also white since we do know that Elizabeth the wife of John 's son , John Jr. , was also white .
Besides the recurrence of the name Anthony , it should be pointed out here , as well , that this was the branch of the family that had migrated to Maryland by the end of 1665 .
Because there are no other Anthony Johnsons in the state records that would make sense , the following is my own take on the genealogical tree of the subject in the above portrait .
Anthony Johnson m. Mary ( hispanic blacks )
John Johnson m. Susan ( black )
Hannah Leach ( white )
John Johnson Jr. m. Elizabeth ( white )
Anthony m. 1699 Catherine Smith ( white )
Thomas Johnson Needless to say , since Thomas Johnson wife was also white , his sons and daughters married into the local planter class of which they had already become important members .

Official reveals Justice Dept. stalled probe into NH phone - jamming Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday December 19 , 2007

The prosecution of a Republican official for phone - jamming in New Hampshire was slowed by the Justice Department until after the 2004 election , an unnamed official alleges .
Senior Justice officials delayed the probe " until after the 2004 election , protecting top GOP officials from the scandal until the voting was over , " writes Greg Gordon for McClatchy Newspapers .
" An official with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the 2002 Election - Day scheme said the inquiry sputtered for months , " Gordon continues , " after a prosecutor sought approval to indict James Tobin , the northeast regional coordinator for the Republican National Committee . "
The phone - jamming was apparently " aimed at preventing New Hampshire Democrats from rounding up voters " to participate in the Senate race between GOP Rep.
John Sununu and Gov. Jeanne Shaheen ( D ) . Sununu won , helping Republicans regain Senate control at the time .
Excerpts from the McClatchy article , available in full here , follow ... # A Manchester , N.H. , policeman quickly traced the jamming to Republican political operatives in 2003 and forwarded the evidence to the Justice Department for what ordinarily would be a straightforward case .
However , the official , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter , told McClatchy that senior Justice Department officials slowed the inquiry .
The official did n't know whether top department officials ordered the delays or what motivated those decisions .
The official said that Terry O'Donnell , a former Pentagon general counsel who was representing Tobin , was in contact with senior department officials before Tobin was indicted .
...
Paul Twomey , a lawyer for the state Democratic Party , said the delay spared Republicans embarrassment at the peak of the campaign because a pending deposition would have revealed that several state GOP officials knew about the scheme , which was hatched by their executive director , Charles McGee .
The delay also stalled the case beyond its statute of limitations , depriving Democrats of full discovery , he said . #
At the End of Time ...
Two will go back to save the World .

An estimated 1,100 prison inmates across the Gulf Coast collected in excess of $ 10 million in rental assistance and disaster - relief money .
Crime pays !
FEMA , in addition , distributed millions of tax dollars to people who used names and Social Security numbers belonging to state and federal prisoners .
A hotel owner in Sugar Land , Texas , has been charged with submitting $ 232,000 in invoices for evacuees who allegedly never stayed at his hotel , billing FEMA for purportedly empty rooms or rooms occupied by paying guests or hotel employees .
An Illinois woman who was living in Illinois at the time of the storm sought relief benefits by claiming she had watched her two daughters drown in the flood waters of New Orleans .
The children never existed .
A Department of Labor employee in Louisiana , appropriately named Wayne Lawless , has been charged with handing out nearly 100 falsified disaster unemployment benefit cards in exchange for kickbacks of up to $ 300 per card .
In New Orleans , two FEMA officials have pleaded guilty to pocketing $ 20,000 in bribes in exchange for inflating the count on the number of meals a contractor was serving to relief workers .
With the $ 2,000 debit cards distributed by FEMA for disaster relief , an estimated 5,000 people have double dipped , receiving both the $ 2,000 plastic card and a second $ 2,000 by check or electronically .
Two men , one a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers , have pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks in exchange for approving payments for removal of nonexistent loads of hurricane debris .
In contrast , with loads of debris that were not nonexistent , a councilman in St. Tammany Parish , Louisiana , has been charged with attempting to extort $ 100,000 from a debris - removal contractor .
One creative scam artist is charged with collecting 26 federal disaster relief checks totaling $ 139,000 by using 13 Social Security numbers and fake claims of damage at bogus addresses .
Others collected and pocketed hurricane relief donations by posing as Red Cross workers .
All told , what the above represents is " one of the most extraordinary displays of scams , schemes and stupefying bureaucratic bungles in modern history , " reports the Times , " costing taxpayers up to $ 2 billion . "
Greed for political power can be more harmful to a population 's overall well - being than the capitalist " greed " an entrepreneur might have for a larger market share or the " greed " a worker might have within capitalism for a larger income .
As a case in point , recent disclosures about the level of corruption and fraud related to the relief efforts involving Hurricane Katrina show a pattern of dishonesty and " greed " among all sectors , among businesses , government and the general population .
Some examples cited by The New York Times illustrate the wide - ranging nature of the corruption :
The $ 2 billion guesstimate might well prove to be just the proverbial tip of the iceberg .
Commenting on the extent of fraud and waste in FEMA 's response to Katrina , Gregory D. Kutz , a director of audits at the General Accounting Office , stated , " I still do n't think they fully understand the depth of the problem . "
By the time the Katrina accounting is over , it wo n't be surprising if the fraud and boondoggles hit $ 5 billion .
The question :
How high does the price of ineptitude and corruption have to go before we all begin to understand the depth of the problem ?
A kite the size of a football field will provide most of the power for a German heavy freight ship set to launch in December .
The Beluga shipping company that owns the 460 - foot Beluga said it expects the kites to decrease fuel consumption by up to 50 % in optimal cases as well as a cutback of the emission of greenhouse gases on sea by 10 to 20 % .
Interestingly , the ship will be hauling windmills from Esbjerg , Denmark to Houston , Texas .
The company that makes the kite for the German transport , SkySails , has made kites for large yachts but is targeting commercial ships with new , larger kites .
And it has the ambitious goal of equipping 1,500 ships with kites by 2015 .
The SkySails system consists of a towing kite with rope , a launch and recovery system and a control system for the whole operation .
The control system acts like the autopitot systems on an aircraft , the company says .
Autopilot software sends and receives data about the sail etc to make sure the sail is set at its optimal position .
The company also says it provides an optional weather routing system so that ships can sail into optimal wind conditions .
The kites typically fly at about 1,000 feet above sea level , thereby tapping winds that can be almost 50 % stronger than at the surface .
Skysail is n't the only company pioneering kite technology .
A US company , KiteShip , in Martinez , Calif. , has been building ultra- large kites mostly for the private yachting sector , with plans to expand into cargo and cruise vessels .
Not everyone is sold on the kites however .
In an article in the Atlanta Journal Constitution today , John Barnes , editor of Marine Engineers Review , a marine engineering magazine in London , said the jury 's still out on kite propulsion systems .
" This could work , but there is an extra cost entailed , and it wo n't make much sense if the price of fuel falls back , " he said .
" It seems to be a practical approach , but we still need to see what the benefits and penalties will be .
" One hurdle is the costs associated with the hiring of crews to actually tend the kites .
Another : drawback :
The system obviously wo n't work in a head wind , the article stated .

NORAD - Keeping an eye towards the sky to protect the United States .
In the early dawn hours of November 9th , 1979 , just a month and a half after the inexplicable Vela Incident , crews manning the underground missile silos along the American Great Plains received an urgent alert .
Early warning satellites had detected that Soviet nuclear missiles were in flight , soon to rain apocalyptic fire and death upon the United States .
This was not a drill ( repeat , this was not a drill ! ) .
The soldiers manned their stations , and braced themselves for the unthinkable : the possibility of launching their ballistic nuclear missiles in retaliation .
There was little time for considering options , as there were apparently hundreds of megatons worth of atomic weapons en route at high speeds .
It seemed the world was about to end , courtesy of the world ’s superpowers .
This alert was not limited to the US intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) force .
The entire U.S. air defense interceptor force was put on alert , and at least 10 fighters took off .
The National Emergency Airborne Command Post⁠ — the “ doomsday plane ” ⁠— also took to the sky , although the president was not on board .
The United States was falling into its doomsday contingency plan , preparing for the worst .
Fortunately , this nuclear nightmare was only an error in the United States ’ detection system , not an actual attack .
A training tape that simulated the signals of a massive Soviet nuclear first - strike had been mistakenly loaded into a computer the U.S. Strategic Air Command ’s Cheyenne Mountain control center , nestled deep in the Colorado mountains .
This mistake was discovered when U.S. leaders viewed the raw - data from the Defense Support Program ’s ( DSP ) early warning satellites .
This was part of standard threat assessment protocol used before deciding to launch a massive counter - strike .
The DSP satellites were capable of detecting the launches of Soviet missiles almost anywhere on the Earth ’s surface .
None of these satellites reported any launches … and an accidental global nuclear war was narrowly avoided .
Although this was the first reported incident to bring the world to the brink of a nuclear World War , it was certainly not the last .
Since the inception of the nuclear missile and early - warning systems , the US and Russia have each had at least two instances of faulty information leading to a near - launch of a nuclear volley .
A Minuteman missile launch .
Less than a year after the training tape incident , U.S. commanders received another warning that the Soviet Union had launched a nuclear strike .
On June 3 , 1980 , launch crews for Minuteman missiles were given preliminary launch warnings , and bomber crews went airborne .
This time , however , the displays did not present a recognizable attack pattern or even a consistent number of incoming missiles as they had during the training tape episode .
Instead , the displays showed a random number of attacking missiles , changing frequently .
The displays would show that 200 had been launched , then zero missiles , and then 2 missiles .
Also , the number of attacking missiles displayed at different command posts were not the same .
This random display of missiles firing left the crews manning early - warning radars scrambling to find an answer .
Again , data from the DSP satellites and other early - warning systems were reviewed , and it was found that no missiles had been launched .
Later investigations revealed that a single computer chip failure had caused random numbers of attacking missiles to be displayed .
Not to be outdone by the capitalist pigs , the Soviet Union established their own error - prone early - warning satellite system .
However , the Soviets had chosen a different method to spot these launches .
The Soviets chose not to look down on the entire Earth ’s surface the way the U.S. DSP satellites do .
Instead , the Soviet satellites look at the edge of the Earth , reducing the chance that a naturally occurring phenomenon would look like a missile launch .
When a missile rises 5 to 10 miles , it appears silhouetted against the black background of space .
Also , when the edge of the earth is viewed , light reflected off the top of clouds and snow banks has to travel through much more of the atmosphere , which reduces the chance that this light would set off a false alarm .
To view a recently launched missile against the black background of space , a unique type of orbit is needed for the satellite .
To achieve this , the Soviet Union placed their early - warning satellites in a Molnyia orbit .
A Molnyia orbit comes very close to the earth as it passes the southern hemisphere , but as it approaches the northern hemisphere and its apogee , it extends to nearly 1/10 the distance to the moon .
From this position high above northern Europe , the Soviet Union ’s Oko ( “ Eye ” ) early - warning satellites spend much of their time observing the missile fields of the United States .
This practice nearly led to nuclear disaster .
A hypothesized Oko Satellite view of the U.S. missile fields at the time of the " Autumn Equinox " incident .
Shortly after midnight in Moscow on September 26th 1983 , the satellite ’s field of view lined up perfectly with the sun and US missile bases .
They were arranged in such a way that the maximum amount of sunlight was reflected off high - altitude clouds towards the early - warning satellite .
Lt. Colonel Stanislav Petrov was the officer in charge of “ Serpukhov - 15 ” , the secret bunker from which the Soviet Union monitored the satellites ’ signals .
In subsequent interviews he described the dilemma he faced when the system suddenly indicated the launch of several missiles from the U.S. continental missile fields .
Disobeying his standing orders , Lt. Col Petrov decided not to sound the alert .
Petrov later spoke on the incident , explaining why he did not pass the information on to his superiors : “ When people start a war , they do n’t start it with only five missiles .
You can do little damage with just five missiles . ”
The last such near - disaster that the superpowers are willing to acknowledge occurred on January 25th , 1995 .
Shortly before sunrise , the Soviet early - warning systems sang out a warning that an American missile was incoming .
The missile originated near Norway , suggesting that the Americans were executing the classic Cold War first - strike scenario : surfacing a sub off the coast and lobbing a nuclear missile to be detonated high over the Soviet Union , thereby blinding Russian radar stations .
In theory , this action would be shortly followed by an all - out attack .
Unlike the previous alerts , this event was n’t an error in the early - detection system , this missile was confirmed as real .
Fearing the worst , the Russian military prepared to launch a full - scale counterattack against the United States .
Planes were readied , and missiles sat waiting to launch a nuclear volley on selected targets in the United States at a moment ’s notice .
Tensions were running so high within the Russian leadership that Russian President Boris Yeltsin activated his nuclear briefcase , enabling him to communicate with his top military advisers and review the situation online .
This was the first time he had ever done so .
Amidst this uncertainty , as many fingers nervously hovered over death - bringing buttons , word was received from Soviet military observers : the missile , while real , was not en route to Russia .
It was a harmless research rocket headed for space .
NASA had launched the four - stage rocket in partnership with Norwegian scientists for the purpose of studying the northern lights , and somehow the men at the Soviet radar stations had not received the memo .
The rocket was not the first to be launched from the island off the coast of Norway , nevertheless it was indistinguishable from a Trident missile to Russia ’s low - resolution early - warning radars .
An early warning radar , ready to detect a nuclear nightmare .
Nuclear inter-continental ballistic missiles are almost quaint by today ’s risk - assessment standards ; the nuke of the future is more likely to originate in an atomic attaché than a missile silo .
But as long as the number of nations with nuclear weapons steadily increases , early - warning systems are an unpleasant necessity .
Considering the purpose of these detection systems⁠— to defend nations from the unthinkable⁠ — it is ironic that they are responsible for bringing the world to the brink of an inappropriate apocalypse on at least a few occasions .
Sometimes , it seems , an ounce of prevention is worth a megaton of cure .
If you ’re looking for a quick memory fix , move your eyes from side - to - side for 30 seconds , researchers say .
Horizontal eye movements are thought to cause the two hemispheres of the brain to interact more with one another , and communication between brain hemispheres is important for retrieving certain types of memories .
Previous studies have suggested that horizontal eye movements improve how well people recall specific words they have just seen .
But Andrew Parker and his colleagues at Manchester Metropolitan University in England wanted to know whether such eye movements might also help people recognize words they have just seen .
Recognition memory differs from recall memory in that people trying to recognize words tend to make false memory errors called source monitoring errors .
This occurs when they recognize words but attribute their familiarity to the wrong source — they might think they just read the words , when they had actually heard them in a conversation earlier that day , for example .
Lure test
To test whether horizontal eye movements reduce source monitoring errors in addition to improving how many items people can remember , Parker and his colleagues presented 102 college students with recordings of a male voice reading aloud 20 lists of 15 words .
Some of the lists converged around a “ lure ” word that was n’t presented .
For example , subjects might have heard words that included “ thread , ” “ eye , ” “ sewing ” and “ sharp ” — all of which converge around the word “ needle , ” even though “ needle ” was never said .
After the subjects heard all of the lists , a third of them followed a computer prompt that initiated side - to - side eye movements for 30 seconds .
Another third did the same with up - to - down eye movements , and the final third did nothing .
Then the subjects were handed a list of words and asked to pick out the ones they had just heard .
Those who chose the unspoken “ lure ” words were making source monitoring errors because they could n’t distinguish having heard the words from having thought the words themselves .
The researchers found that the people who performed the horizontal eye movements correctly remembered , on average , more than 10 percent more words , and falsely recognized about 15 percent fewer “ lure ” words than the people who performed vertical eye movements or no movements at all .
“ The movements could be helping people identify the true source of their memories , ” said Stephen Christman , a psychologist at the University of Toledo , who was not involved in the study , published in the April issue of the journal Brain and Cognition .
Eye movements and recall
Christman ’s research has independently shown that such eye movements improve recall memory .
Christman said that he first came up with the idea to look at the effects of eye movements on memory after learning that leftward eye movements activate the right brain hemisphere and that rightward movements activate the left hemisphere .
He thought that horizontal eye movements might , therefore , improve memory by helping the hemispheres interact .
But Parker notes that the proposed mechanism linking eye movement to memory is still somewhat speculative and that more research will be needed to understand how and why eye movements affect memory .
Christman said he has received many letters from people wondering whether horizontal eye movements could help them in their everyday lives .
“ Let ’s say you ’re leaving a mall after a long day shopping and you realize , ‘ Oh God , I ca n’t remember where I parked my car , ’ ” he said .
“ Would it help you if you stood there in the parking lot and just wiggled your eyes back and forth for 30 seconds ? ”
He ’s not sure , he said — but it might be worth a shot .
The title of the agreement , signed by President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Maliki in a “ video conference ” last week , and carefully labeled as a “ non- binding ” set of principles for further negotiations , was a mouthful : a “ Declaration of Principles for a Long - Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America . ”
Whew !
Words matter , of course .
They seldom turn up by accident in official documents or statements .
Last week , in the first reports on this “ declaration , ” one of those words that matter caught my attention .
Actually , it was n’t in the declaration itself , where the key phrase was “ long - term relationship ” ( something in the lives of private individuals that falls just short of a marriage ) , but in a “ fact - sheet ” issued by the White House .
Here ’s the relevant line : “ Iraq ’s leaders have asked for an enduring relationship with America , and we seek an enduring relationship with a democratic Iraq . ”
Of course , “ enduring ” there bears the same relationship to permanency as “ long - term relationship ” does to marriage .
In a number of the early news reports , that word “ enduring , ” part of the “ enduring relationship ” that the Iraqi leadership supposedly “ asked for , ” was put into ( or near ) the mouths of “ Iraqi leaders ” or of the Iraqi prime minister himself .
It also achieved a certain prominence in the post - declaration “ press gaggle ” conducted by the man coordinating this process out of the Oval Office , the president ’s so - called War Czar , Gen. Douglas Lute .
He said of the document : “ It signals a commitment of both their government and the United States to an enduring relationship based on mutual interests . ”
In trying to imagine any Iraqi leader actually requesting that “ enduring ” relationship , something kept nagging at me .
After all , those mutual vows of longevity were to be taken in a well publicized civil ceremony in a world in which , when it comes to the American presidential embrace , do n’t - ask / do n ’t - tell is usually the preferred course of action for foreign leaders .
Finally , I remembered where I had seen that word “ enduring ” before in a situation that also involved a “ long - term relationship . ”
It had been four - and - a - half years earlier and not coming out of the mouths of Iraqi officials either .
Back in April 2003 , just after Baghdad fell to American troops , Thom Shanker and Eric Schmitt reported on the front page of the New York Times that the Pentagon had launched its invasion the previous month with plans for four “ permanent bases ” in out of the way parts of Iraq already on the drawing board .
Since then , the Pentagon has indeed sunk billions of dollars into building those mega - bases ( with a couple of extra ones thrown in ) at or near the places mentioned by Shanker and Schmitt .
When questioned by reporters at the time about whether such “ permanent bases ” were in the works , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld insisted that the U.S. was “ unlikely to seek any permanent or ‘ long - term ’ bases in Iraq ”  and that was that .
The Times ’ piece essentially went down the mainstream - media memory hole .
On this subject , the official position of the Bush administration has never changed .
Just last week , for instance , Gen .
Lute slipped up , in response to a question at his press gaggle .
The exchange went like this :
“ Q : And permanent bases ?
“ GENERAL LUTE : Likewise .
That ’s another dimension of continuing U.S. support to the government of Iraq , and will certainly be a key item for negotiation next year . ”
White House spokesperson Dana Perino quickly issued a denial , saying : “ We do not seek permanent bases in Iraq . ”
Back in 2003 , Pentagon officials , already seeking to avoid that potentially explosive “ permanent ” tag , plucked “ enduring ” out of the military lexicon and began referring to such bases , charmingly enough , as “ enduring camps . ”
And the word remains with us  connected to bases and occupations anywhere .
For instance , of a planned expansion of Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan , a Col. Jonathan Ives told an AP reporter recently , “ We ’ve grown in our commitment to Afghanistan by putting another brigade [ of troops ] here , and with that we know that we ’re going to have an enduring presence .
So this is going to become a long - term base for us , whether that means five years , 10 years  we do n’t know . ”
Still , whatever they were called , the bases went up on an impressive scale , massively fortified , sometimes 15 - 20 square miles in area , housing up to tens of thousands of troops and private contractors , with multiple bus routes , traffic lights , fast - food restaurants , PXs , and other amenities of home , and reeking of the kind of investment that practically shouts out for , minimally , a relationship of a distinctly “ enduring ” nature .
The Facts on Land  and Sea
These were part of what should be considered the facts on the ground in Iraq , though , between April 2003 and the present , they were rarely reported on or debated in the mainstream in the U.S.
But if you place those mega - bases ( not to speak of the more than 100 smaller ones built at one point or another ) in the context of early Bush administration plans for the Iraqi military , things quickly begin to make more sense .
Remember , Iraq is essentially the hot seat at the center of the Middle East .
It had , in the previous two - plus decades fought an eight - year war with neighboring Iran , invaded neighboring Kuwait , and been invaded itself .
And yet , the new Coalition Provisional Authority , run by the president ’s personal envoy , L. Paul Bremer III , promptly disbanded the Iraqi military .
This is now accepted as a goof of the first order when it came to sparking an insurgency .
But , in terms of Bush administration planning , it was no mistake at all .
At the time , the Pentagon made it quite clear that its plan for a future Iraqi military was for a force of 40,000 lightly armed troops  meant to do little more than patrol the country ’s borders .
( Saddam Hussein ’s army had been something like a 600,000 - man force . )
It was , in other words , to be a Military Lite  and there was essentially to be no Iraqi air force .
In other words , in one of the more heavily armed and tension - ridden regions of the planet , Iraq was to become a Middle Eastern Costa Rica  if , that is , you did n’t assume that the U.S. armed forces , from those four “ enduring camps ” somewhere outside Iraq ’s major cities , including a giant air base at Balad , north of Baghdad , and with the back - up help of U.S. Navy forces in the Persian Gulf , were to serve as the real Iraqi military for the foreseeable future .
Again , it ’s necessary to put these facts on the ground in a larger  in this case , pre-invasion  geopolitical context .
From the first Gulf War on , Saudi Arabia , the largest producer of energy on the planet , was being groomed as the American military bastion in the heart of the Middle East .
But the Saudis grew uncomfortable  think here , the claims of Osama bin Laden and Co. that U.S. troops were defiling the Kingdom and its holy places  with the Pentagon ’s elaborate enduring camps on its territory .
Something had to give  and it was n’t going to be the American military presence in the Middle East .
The answer undoubtedly seemed clear enough to top Bush administration officials .
As an anonymous American diplomat told the Sunday Herald of Scotland back in October 2002 , “ A rehabilitated Iraq is the only sound long - term strategic alternative to Saudi Arabia .
It ’s not just a case of swopping horses in midstream , the impending U.S. regime change in Baghdad is a strategic necessity . ”
As those officials imagined it  and as Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz predicted  by the fall of 2003 , major American military operations in the region would have been reorganized around Iraq , even as American forces there would be drawn down to perhaps 30,000 - 40,000 troops stationed eternally at those “ enduring camps . ”
In addition , a group of Iraqi secular exiles , friendly to the United States , would be in power in Baghdad , backed by the occupation and ready to open up the Iraqi economy , especially its oil industry to Western ( particularly American ) multinationals .
Americans and their allies and private contractors would , quite literally , have free run of the country , the equivalent of 19th - century colonial extraterritoriality ( something “ legally ” institutionalized in June 2004 , thanks to Order 17 , issued by the Coalition Provisional Authority , just before it officially turned over “ sovereignty ” to the Iraqis ) ; and , sooner or later , a status of forces agreement or SOFA would be “ negotiated ” that would define the rights of American troops garrisoned in that country .
At that point , the U.S. would have successfully repositioned itself militarily in relation to the oil heartlands of the planet .
It would also have essentially encircled a second member of the “ axis of evil , ” Iran ( once you included the numerous new U.S. bases that had been built and were being expanded in occupied Afghanistan as part of the ongoing war against the Taliban ) .
It would be triumphant and dominant and , with its Israeli ally , militarily beyond challenge in the region .
The cowing of , collapse of , or destruction of the Syrian and Iranian regimes would surely follow in short order .
Of course , much of this never came about as planned .
It turned out that , once the Sunni insurgency gained traction , the Bush administration had little choice but to reconstitute a sizable , if still relatively lightly armed , Iraqi military ( as a largely Shi’ite force ) and then , more recently , arm Sunni militias as well , possibly opening the way for future clashes of a major nature .
It had to accept a Shi’ite regime locked inside the highly fortified Green Zone of the Iraqi capital that was religious , sectarian , largely powerless , and allied to some degree with Iran .
It had to accept chaos , significant and unexpected casualties , continual urban warfare , and an enormous strain and drain on its armed forces ( as well as a black hole of distraction from other global issues ) .
None of this had been predicted , or imagined , by Bush ’s top officials .
On the other hand , the Bush administration has demonstrated significant “ endurance ” of its own , especially when it came to the linked issues of oil and bases .
In a recent report for Harper ’s Magazine , “ The Black Box , Inside Iraq ’s Oil Machine , ” Luke Mitchell describes traveling the southern Iraqi oil field of Rumaila with a petroleum engineer working for Foster Wheeler , a Houston engineering firm hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers “ to oversee much of the oilfield reconstruction , ” and protected by private guards employed by the British security company Erinys .
He describes what ’s left of the Iraqi oil industry after decades of war , sanctions , civil war , sabotage , and black - market theft  a run- down industrial plant with a rusting delivery system that , at a technical level , is now largely in the hands of the Army Corps of Engineers , the Department of Energy , the State Department , and private contractors like KBR , the former division of Halliburton .
At the most basic level , he reports that many of “ Iraq ’s native oil professionals , ” who heroically patched up and held together a broken system in the years after the first Gulf War , have ( along with so many other Iraqi professionals ) fled the country .
He writes :
“ The Wall Street Journal in 2006 called this flight a ‘ petroleum exodus ’ and reported that about a hundred oil workers had been murdered since the war began and that ‘ of the top hundred of so managers running the Iraqi oil ministry and its branches in 2003 , about two - thirds are no longer at their jobs . ’
Now most of the [ oil ] engineers in Iraq are from Texas and Oklahoma . ”
Similarly , in Baghdad , the government of Prime Minister Maliki is not expected to handle the crucial energy problems of its country alone .
Here ’s a relevant ( if well - buried ) passage from a recent New York Times piece on the subject : “ Earlier this month , the White House dispatched several senior aides to Baghdad to work with the Iraqis on specific legislative areas .
They include the under secretary of state for economic , energy , and agricultural affairs , Reuben Jeffery III , who is working on the budget and oil law ” This is what passes for “ sovereignty ” in present - day Iraq .
In this context , the following line of text about agreed - upon subjects for negotiation in last week ’s Bush / Maliki “ declaration ” caused eyebrows to be raised ( at least abroad ) : “ Facilitating and encouraging the flow of foreign investments to Iraq , especially American investments , to contribute to the reconstruction and rebuilding of Iraq . ”
As the British Guardian put the matter : “ The promise was immediately seen as a potential bonanza for American oil companies . ” A BBC report commented , “ Correspondents say US investors benefiting from preferential treatment could earn huge profits from Iraq ’s vast oil reserves , causing widespread resentment among Iraqis . ”
( American coverage regularly ignores or plays down the oil aspect of the Bush administration ’s Iraq policies , even though that country has the third largest reserves on the planet . )
Bases , Bases Everywhere
Among the most tenacious and enduring Bush administration facts on the ground are those giant bases , still largely ignored  with honorable exceptions  by the mainstream media .
Thom Shanker and Cara Buckley of the New York Times , to give but one example , managed to write that paper ’s major piece about the joint “ declaration ” without mentioning the word “ base , ” much less “ permanent , ” and only Gen .
Lute ’s slip made the permanence of bases a minor note in other mainstream reports .
And yet it ’s not just that the building of bases did go on  and on a remarkable scale  but that it continues today .
Whatever the descriptive labels , the Pentagon , throughout this whole period , has continued to create , base by base , the sort of “ facts ” that any negotiations , no matter who engages in them , will need to take into account .
And the ramping up of the already gigantic “ mega - bases ” in Iraq proceeds apace .
Recent reports indicate that the Pentagon will call on Congress to pony up another billion dollars soon enough for further upgrades and " improvements . "
We also know that frantic construction has been under way on three new bases of varying sizes .
The most obvious of these  though it ’s seldom thought of this way  is the gigantic new U.S. embassy , possibly the largest in the world , being built on an almost Vatican - sized plot of land inside Baghdad ’s Green Zone .
It is meant to be a citadel , a hardened universe of its own , in , but not of , the Iraqi capital .
In recent months , it has also turned into a construction nightmare , soaking up another $ 144 million in American taxpayer monies , bringing its price tag to three - quarters of a billion dollars and still climbing .
It is to house 1,000 or so “ diplomats , ” with perhaps a few thousand extra security guards and hired hands of every sort .
When , in the future , you read in the papers about administration plans to withdraw American forces to bases “ outside of Iraqi urban areas , ” note that there will continue to be a major base in the heart of the Iraqi capital for who knows how long to come .
As the Washington Post ‘s Glenn Kessler put it , the 21 - building compound “ is viewed by some officials as a key element of building a sustainable , long - term diplomatic presence in Baghdad . ”
Presence , yes , but diplomatic ?
In the meantime , a relatively small base , “ Combat Outpost Shocker , ” provocatively placed within a few kilometers of the Iranian border , has been rushed to completion this fall on a mere $ 5 million construction contract .
And only in the last weeks , reports have emerged on the latest U.S. base under construction , uniquely being built on a key oil - exporting platform in the waters off the southern Iraqi port of Basra and meant for the U.S. Navy and allies .
Such a base gives meaning to this passage in the Bush / Maliki declaration : “ Providing security assurances and commitments to the Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression against Iraq that violates its sovereignty and integrity of its territories , waters , or airspace . ”
As the British Telegraph described this multi-million dollar project : “ The U.S. - led coalition is building a permanent security base on Iraq ’s oil pumping platforms in the Gulf to act as the ‘ nerve center ’ of efforts to protect the country ’s most vital strategic asset . ”
Chip Cummins of the Wall Street Journal summed up the project this way in a piece headlined , “ U.S. Digs In to Guard Iraq Oil Exports  Long - Term Presence Planned at Persian Gulf Terminals Viewed as Vulnerable ” : “ [ T ] he new construction suggests that one footprint of U.S. military power in Iraq is n’t shrinking anytime soon : American officials are girding for an open - ended commitment to protect the country ’s oil industry . ”
Though you ’d never know it from mainstream reporting , the single enduring fact of the Iraq War may be this constant building and upgrading of U.S. bases .
Since the Times revealed those base - building plans back in the spring of 2003 , Iraq has essentially been a vast construction site for the Pentagon .
The American media did , in the end , come to focus on the civilian “ reconstruction ” of Iraq which , from the rebuilding of electricity - production facilities to the construction of a new police academy has proved a catastrophic mixture of crony capitalism , graft , corruption , theft , inefficiency , and sabotage .
But there has been next to no focus on the construction success story of the Iraq War and occupation : those bases .
In this way , whatever the disasters of its misbegotten war , the Bush administration has , in a sense , itself “ endured ” in Iraq .
Now , with only a year left , its officials clearly hope to write that endurance and those “ enduring camps ” into the genetic code of both countries  an “ enduring relationship ” meant to outlast January 2009 and to outflank any future administration .
In fact , by some official projections , the bases are meant to be occupied for up to 50 to 60 years without ever becoming “ permanent . ”
You can , of course , claim that the Iraqis “ asked for ” this new , “ enduring relationship , ” as the declaration so politely suggests .
It is certainly true that , as part of the bargain , the Bush administration is offering to defend its “ boys ” to the hilt against almost any conceivable eventuality , including the sort of internal coup that it has , these last years , been rumored to have considered launching itself .
In an attempt to make an end - run around Congress , administration officials continue to present what is to be negotiated as merely a typical SOFA - style agreement .
“ There are about a hundred countries around the world with which we have [ such ] bilateral defense or security cooperation agreements , ” Gen .
Lute said reassuringly , indicating that this matter would be handled by the executive branch without significant input from Congress .
The guarantees the Bush administration seems ready to offer the Maliki government , however , clearly rise to treaty level and , if we had even a faintly assertive Congress , would surely require the advice and consent of the Senate .
Iraqi officials have already made clear that such an agreement will have to pass through their parliament in a country where the idea of “ enduring ” U.S. bases in an “ enduring ” relationship is bound to be exceedingly unpopular .
Still , a formula for the future is obviously being put in place and , after more than four years of frenzied construction , the housing for it , so to speak , is more than ready .
As the Washington Post described the plan , “ Iraqi officials said that under the proposed formula , Iraq would get full responsibility for internal security and U.S. troops would relocate to bases outside the cities .
Iraqi officials foresee a long - term presence of about 50,000 U.S. troops . ”
No matter what comes out of the mouths of Iraqi officials , though , what ’s “ enduring ” in all this is deeply Pentagonish and has emerged from the Bush administration ’s earliest dreams about reshaping the Middle East and achieving global domination of an unprecedented sort .
It ’s a case , as the old Joni Mitchell song put it , of going “ round and round and round in the circle game . ”
[ Note : Spencer Ackerman has been offering especially good coverage of developments surrounding the recent Bush / Maliki declaration at TPM Muckraker .
I ’d also like to offer one of my periodic statements of thanks to Iraq - oriented sites that give me daily aid and succor in gathering crucial material and analysis , especially Juan Cole ’s invaluable Informed Comment , Antiwar.com , and Paul Woodward ’s The War in Context . ]

「数万円 のCPUを販売しても1000円以下の利益にしかならない」とは、昔からPCパーツショップの店員さんが口にする恒例の台詞だ。Windows 95と98の登場で大ブレイクした自作PC市場は、一方で当事者から“儲からない”という愚痴がついて回る不思議な業界でもある。これが単なる悲観主義でないことを、小林氏は力説する。
― ―PCパーツの安売り競争が続いている感がありますが、自作PCブームが去った現在、いつかは流れが変わるのでしょうか？
小林 この業界がなくなるまで終わらないでしょう。問題はこの業界がブローカー（※1）とバッタ屋（※2）で成立していること。そもそもこの業界は一種のファイナンス商売。PC業界と思ってはいけない。金儲けしか興味のない連中が、たまたま利益率の高いPC関連商品を扱っているに過ぎません。そして何の規制もないから、飲食店やほかの品物をあつかう業界よりも好き放題できる。つまり、自分さえ儲かれば何やってもいいという風潮になっている。
※ 1 ここでは、メーカーと小売店を取り次ぐ卸業者を指している。
※ 2 ここでは、まがい物や不正な品物を正規品のように販売する一部の小売店を、多少の罵倒を含めて指している。
注記を一部訂正いたしました。
――普通に営業しては、小売店が利益を得る状態ではないということでしょうか？
小林 そうです。小売店の中にはバッタ屋がいる。あるショップは定格140ワットの電源に250ワットのラベルを貼って売っていた。こちらも忙しいからいちいち突っ込まないけど、普通の業界じゃ考えられない行為じゃないですか。そこまでひどいのはめずらしいですが、現在ならVista Premiumマシンなのにメモリ512Mバイトのラインアップを用意して“激安Vistaマシン” を標榜するショップはザラ。PCをあつかうことに誇りがあれば、そんな売り方できないでしょ。卸業者にしろ、小売店にしろ、コンピューターのことをよく知っている経営者が少なすぎるのが問題だと思っています。
――そのような状況になってしまった原因は？
小林 Windows 95が登場した前後、 「自作は安い」と知られ最初の自作PCブームが起こった頃、あるPCパーツショップがアキバに進出して、安売り攻勢を仕掛けたのがきっかけでしょうか。当時は不合理にPCパーツが高かったので、業界に価格破壊を起こしたそのショップの意義は確かにありました。
ただ、成功のあまり一線を越えてしまったんです。まともな利益を確保できるラインを越えて安売りを続けてしまった。こうなると、周囲のショップも限度を超えた価格に合わせていくしかなくなります。すると、どこのショップも、卸価格に上乗せする利益がどんどん薄くなっていく。それでも安売りは止まりませんから、現在に至るまで業界全体で苦しみ続けることになったんです。
これは一般論だけど、 “ 価格を破壊するとその産業自体が壊れ” ます。自作PC市場はその典型になってしまいましたね。また、“ディスカウンター（安売り業者）が生き残った歴史はない”という定理も、ぴったり当てはまります。
――PC-Successが閉店したのも、自然の流れということですか？
小林 PC - Successは安売りの典型例だったからね。2年前から倒産の噂が立っていましたが、一度は盛り返したようです。業界全体の不況もあって、結局駄目になりましたが。正直、安売りに注力しているショップは他人事ではないでしょうね。
――ちなみに自 作PC市場が「 儲からない 」 「危機的状況にある」のは、世界的な情勢なのでしょうか？
小林 自作PC市場は世界的にも縮小傾向にありますが、急激に低下しているのは日本だけです。先に述べた過度の安売りが蔓延したことが大きい。さらに、日本は家電やケータイが飛び抜けて優秀です。ネットブラウジングやTV視聴／録画程度なら、PCよりも家電やケータイを使ったほうが便利で分かりやすい。つまり、日本のPC業界は、世界的に見ても一般層を取り込みにくい環境にあるわけです。わざわざ自分でパーツを組み立ててまでPCを使う人はさらに限られる。それこそ趣味の世界です。PCパーツショップに引っ張られるように完成品のPCも安くなり、「自作PCは安い」の前提が崩れたいま、ニーズが減るのは自然でしょう。

A former model turned the tables on a mugger , beating him senseless on a Manhattan street until cops finally pried her off , authorities said yesterday .
Silva Natividad , 54 , yesterday credited the TV show “ COPS ” for spurring her to tackle Jonathan Burkes on First Avenue near 38th Street at noon Monday .
“ He grabbed my money and pushed me , ” she said .
“ But I did n’t fall .
I got a grip on myself . ”
Natividad said Burkes tried to take off with the cash , but “ you know how in ‘ COPS , ’ when they jump on the person before they run away ?
That ’s what I did . ”
“ I just wanted my money .
I was p- – – ed .
Angry does n’t begin to describe how I felt . ”
Cops said the arrest of Burkes , 42 , “ saved ” him from his victim ’s blows .
He was charged with robbery and criminal possession of stolen property
“ He was trying to punch me to get away and I was punching him , ” Natividad said .
“ He must have lost his footing because he fell and I jumped right on top of him .
“ My money was . . . in his hand .
I started banging his fist against the concrete until he let it go . ”
Natividad said she put the money in her purse , then “ kept hitting him and hitting him .
I must have lost my mind . ”
Burkes finally broke free and ran across the street , but his incensed victim was hot on his tail , and she caught and tackled him again .
She called 911 and told the dispatcher , “ If you do n’t come and get this guy I ’m going to kill him . ”
Matthew Duss notes that Giuliani foreign policy advisor Daniel Pipes is on the " presidium " of an outfit called the Jerusalem Summit that opposes the creation of a Palestinian state under any circumstances and instead proposes the transfer of Palestinians to elsewhere in the Arab world .
It seems to me that just as Giuliani ought to be asked whether or not he endorses Norman Podhoretz 's view that we need to bomb Iran ASAP he also ought to be asked whether he joins Daniel Pipes in endorsing this view .
And if he does n't , then why does he have so many advisors he disagrees with on key issues ?

OTTAWA / TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Two Americans who deserted the U.S. Army to protest against the war in Iraq lost their bid for refugee status in Canada on Thursday , and the Canadian government made it clear they were no longer welcome .
U.S. Army private Jeremy Hinzman , who deserted because he opposed the war in Iraq , speaks at a rally after Canada 's Immigration and Refugee Board ruled he did not qualify as a refugee in Toronto , March 24 , 2005 .

The Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear appeals from the two men , Jeremy Hinzman and Brandon Hughey , over decisions by immigration authorities -- backed in two subsequent court rulings -- that they were not refugees in need of protection .
Opposing the war on the belief that it was illegal and immoral , the two deserted when they learned their units would be deployed to Iraq , and came to Canada .
If deported to the United States , they say they face a court martial and up to five years in prison .
During the Vietnam War , Canada was a haven for tens of thousands of draft dodgers and deserters .
But Hinzman and Hughey were volunteers rather than conscripts .
Their backers urged the government to let them stay in Canada anyhow , but this met with little sympathy from Ottawa .
“ Canadians want a refugee system that helps true refugees , ” said Mike Fraser , spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Minister Diane Finley .
“ All refugee claimants in Canada have the right to due process and when they have exhausted those legal avenues we expect them to respect our laws and leave the country . ”
He declined to comment on whether active steps would be taken to deport the two men to the United States .
In any case , it could still take months before they can be sent away , said Lee Zaslofsky of the War Resisters Support Campaign .
“ They wo n’t be deported tomorrow ; there is a process , ” said Zaslofsky , himself a Vietnam War deserter .
He said the immigration department would ask if the two men want to do a “ pre-removal risk assessment , ” which can take months .
An immigration spokeswoman , Karen Chadd - Evelyn , said such an assessment would judge whether in the United States they would be at risk of torture , death or cruel and unusual punishment or treatment .
They can also apply for permanent residence in Canada on humanitarian or compassionate grounds .
The War Resisters Support Campaign , aware of some 55 deserters who have come to Canada since 2004 , said they would press for a political way to let the deserters stay .
“ It ’s up to ( politicians ) if they want to give resisters access to Canada , as they did during the Vietnam War , ” Michelle Robidoux said in the group ’s small Toronto office .
The small opposition New Democratic Party said it would introduce a motion calling on the House of Commons immigrations committee to hold immediate hearings on the issue .
Meanwhile , one stratagem appeared to be for resisters to use the legal system to enable them to stay longer in Canada .
One deserter who still hopes to stay is Kimberly Rivera , from Mesquite , Texas .
She came to Canada in February with her husband and two small children while on a two - week army leave , after spending three months on security duty in Iraq .
Despite the Supreme Court ’s refusal to hear the Hinzman and Hughey appeals , Rivera said she plans to continue filing court appeals in her own case .
“ I ’m sure it ’s going to be denied but at least it gives us more time here , ” she said .
A few weeks ago I was in New York staying at the Surrey Hotel on 76th Street between 5th Avenue and Madison right near Central Park .
Before heading down to the meatpacking district for dinner and some fun with a business associate we stopped into CafÃ© Boulud next to the hotel for a drink .
The restaurant is owned by famous French chef Daniel Boulud .
As we were sitting at a 4 top table in the bar area looking out over the simple and elegant dining room , we had a decision to make on this very hot August early evening in the cityâ€¦ . what to drink ?… a special cocktail ? â€ ¦a glass of white wine ?
Neither seemed appropriateâ€ ¦. it must be a glass of Champagne .
The Maitre D’ , John Winterman , suggested a glass of Pierre Peters Blanc de Blanc NV Champagne .
Honestly , I had never heard of the producer , however , I certainly was comfortable accepting the recommendation .
Boy , it did not disappoint .
Actually , it was fabulousâ€ ¦the setting did not hurt either .
Blanc de Blanc is made from 100 % Chardonnay grapes .
The bubbles in the glass were incredibleâ€ ¦ . 1000 ’s and 1000 ’s that never stopped .
This was perfection in a glassâ€ ¦smooth , flavorful , clean , refreshing , with just a hint of that wonderful yeastiness that is so unique to Champagneâ€ ¦so very balanced .
It was not cheap at $ 25 a glass ; however , it was worth every penny .
You will probably pay around $ 45 a bottle at retail .
Special time , special moment , special wineâ€ ¦this is what life is aboutâ€ ¦creating special memories .
Go out there and try new thingsâ€ ¦many times you will be very pleasantly surprised .
By the way , the meatpacking district was a blast .
A story about that laterâ€ ¦
Tags : New York
The parents of 15 - year - old Rachel M. say that “ being married is the only career ” their daughter is interested in .
They are seeking a man willing to pay $ 19,995 for her hand in marriage .
Kristin J. , 16 , has a wild streak but recently decided “ it was time she settled down with a man who could meet her needs and help her fulfill her dreams of being an actor or singer . ”
Her parents are trying to sell their “ fiery ” daughter into matrimony for $ 49,995 .
Or so go the personal ad listings on MarryOurDaughter.com , an outrageous Web site that purports to blithely sell underage girls to older husbands for large dowries .
The site is a prank .
Thank goodness .
But not everyone is in on the joke .
The site has gotten 20 million page views in the last two weeks and now elicits around a thousand , mostly angry , emails a day .
In the last few days , the site ’s “ publicity director ” has also appeared on at least half a dozen talk radio shows around the country , including on Las Vegas ( MIX - FM ) , Houston ( KRBE - FM ) and Philadelphia ( WYSP - FM ) and mixed it up with belligerent on - air - personalities and hostile listeners , whom he neglected to let in on the ruse .
“ People get angry so fast they do n’t stop to question whether its real , ” says the creator of MarryOurDaughter.com , John Ordover , who masqueraded as the site ’s fictional publicity director , the unlikely surnamed Roger Mandervan .
Mr. Ordover is a science - fiction editor with a prankish history and an interest in urban nudism .
Contacted through MarryOurDaughter this morning , Mr. Ordover quickly conceded the page was a parody aimed at drawing attention to inconsistencies in state marriage laws .
States consider it a crime for adults to have sex with minors , but they allow kids as young as 12 to get married with parental and sometime judicial permission .
“ As far as I can tell , in every state but Oregon , parents can marry off their children , ” Mr. Ordover said , pointing to this Cornell University Web site which tracks the various state marriage laws .
Texas has a particularly ridiculous legal discrepancy , he says .
Kids as young as 14 need parental permission to get married – unless , the law says , they have already been married before .
Mr. Ordover is no stranger to controversy , or to media attention .
Mr. Ordover runs events for nudists and recently organized a Sheepshead Bay nude cruise , covered by the Times in July .
In 2000 , he was also the co-creator of the now defunct humor site Technicalvirgin.com , in which a young actress described the creative ways in which she maintained her honor .
Last year , when those videos enjoyed a resurgence on YouTube the actress who appeared in them , Melanie Martinez , was fired from a job hosting “ The Good Night Show ” on the PBS KIDS Sprout network – another Mr. Ordover - inspired saga covered by the paper .
Mr. Ordover was planning on coming clean next week as the creator of the site and has a full slate of radio interviews scheduled this week .
He said he avoided spinning his fiction to print journalists who might get fired for falling for the scheme , but reasoned that radio shock jocks had looser leashes .
“ We were trying to get people a little stirred up about this , ” Mr. Ordover said .
The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Thursday February 14 2008
In the article below we gave the impression that an IAEA report - which said that Iran is producing fuel - grade uranium - reported that Iran has enough centrifuges to build a warhead within a year .
That inference was not contained in the report .
US and British officials , as well as some independent experts , say Iran now has enough centrifuges to make a warhead in a year , but in a briefing to accompany the report , a senior IAEA official said that it would take 18 months and would be possible only if the centrifuges were configured in a different way .
Iran has installed 3,000 centrifuges for enriching uranium - enough to begin industrial - scale production of nuclear fuel and build a warhead within a year , the UN 's nuclear watchdog reported last night .
The report by Mohamed ElBaradei , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , will intensify US and European pressure for tighter sanctions and increase speculation of a potential military conflict .
The installation of 3,000 fully - functioning centrifuges at Iran 's enrichment plant at Natanz is a " red line " drawn by the US across which Washington had said it would not let Iran pass .
When spinning at full speed they are capable of producing sufficient weapons - grade uranium ( enriched to over 90 % purity ) for a nuclear weapon within a year .
The IAEA says the uranium being produced is only fuel grade ( enriched to 4 % ) but the confirmation that Iran has reached the 3,000 centrifuge benchmark brings closer a moment of truth for the Bush administration , when it will have to choose between taking military action or abandoning its red line , and accepting Iran 's technical mastery of uranium enrichment .
US generals are reported to have warned the White House that military action would trigger a devastating Iranian backlash in the Middle East and beyond .
Russian officials yesterday called for patience , insisting Iran could still clinch a deal with the international community in the next few weeks .
They pointed to other parts of the IAEA report showing Tehran had been cooperating with the agency 's inspectors on other nuclear issues .
" We are most concerned to prevent Iran being cornered so that they walk out of the Non Proliferation Treaty , and break relations with the IAEA , " one Russian source said .
He said Chinese officials were stepping up diplomatic pressure on Iran , with Moscow , to avert a collision .
" They are on high alert that something has to be done quickly , " the source said .
The Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , also seized on positive parts of the IAEA report , noting increased Iranian cooperation with inspectors , as vindication for Tehran .
He said : " The world will see that the Iranian nation has been right and the resistance of our nation has been correct . "
Last night , a Foreign Office spokesman said : " If Iran wants to restore trust in its programme it must come clean on all outstanding issues without delay . "
Gordon Brown has called for increased pressure on Tehran , including an international ban on investment in the Iranian oil and gas industry .
But UK officials are nervous about pressure from the US vice president Dick Cheney and other hawks for military action against Iran before a new administration takes office in January 2009 .
They emphasise that Iranian scientists could be months if not years away from getting the 3,000 centrifuges to function properly , at top speed , for a sustained period , and insist there is no imminent pressure for military intervention .
However , they also point out that Israel 's red lines for military action are unclear .
Against the fraught backdrop , a meeting of senior officials from the UN security council 's five permanent members and Germany to decide on sanctions , planned for Monday , was put off after the Chinese delegation said it could not attend .
The critical meeting has been pushed back to later this month , giving time for the six - nation group 's negotiator , Javier Solana , the EU foreign policy chief , to hold last - ditch talks with Iranian officials .
The ElBaradei report gave a mixed account of Iran 's cooperation with inspectors looking into Tehran 's nuclear activity in the two decades before it declared its enrichment programme .
" Iran has provided sufficient access to individuals and has responded in a timely manner to questions , " it said , but added that " cooperation has been reactive rather than proactive " .
David Albright , a former UN inspector and now an independent nuclear expert in Washington , said ElBaradei appeared to be trying to put " a happy face " on a worsening situation .
" The main issue is that Iran now has 3,000 centrifuges , " he said .
" The report does n't even judge the quality of the information being offered , but it 's clear it is giving minimal answers . "
The organizers say their movement is driven by a belief among some Democratic activists that the presidency rightfully belongs to Mr. Gore after a disputed 2000 election outcome many never accepted , and that it is time for him to stand up and claim it .
But it is also fueled by dissatisfaction within the party over the crop of Democratic candidates .

Though the Democratic field is widely considered attractive , some Democrats worry that even Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is doing well in the polls , could be beaten in the general election .
Some also say they are dissatisfied with the extent of the candidates ’ commitment to ending the war in Iraq .
Draft movements are often suspected of being nothing more than stealth organizations set up on behalf of would - be candidates .
But organizers in this case say they have had no contact with Mr. Gore .
“ We ’ve never gotten any encouragement , or discouragement , ” said Monica Friedlander , a public relations manager who started Draft Gore from her kitchen in Berkeley , Calif. , before the 2004 election .
“ He has the combination of vision , experience , leadership , standing in the world and , I think very importantly , ability to win that none of the other candidates have , ” Ms. Friedlander said .
Michael Feldman , a former White House aide whose firm , the Glover Park Group , has worked with Mr. Gore to promote “ An Inconvenient Truth ” — the book and the Oscar - winning film that sprang from it — said , “ There is n’t some secret campaign being put together here . ”
Still , Mr. Feldman and others said Mr. Gore had been flattered and delighted by the attention .
The former vice president has undergone an extraordinary metamorphosis , after all , publicly evolving from likely president - elect to stunning loser to lost soul to national and even international hero .
Committed to bringing attention to global warming and other environmental issues , he has a new sense of purpose in that effort , which has earned him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize .
( The winner will be announced Friday . )

According to their web site and TV Guide , last night ’s episode of Mythbusters was supposed to address the airplane on a treadmill question .
They did n’t and nerds everywhere are upset .
According to an email from the executive producer of the show , the segment got rescheduled :
First up , for those concerned that this story has been cancelled , do n’t worry , planes on a conveyer belt has been filmed , is spectacular , and will be part of what us Mythbusters refer to as ‘ episode 97 ’ .
Currently that is due to air on January 30th .
Secondly , for those very aggrieved fans feeling “ duped ” into watching tonight ’s show , I can only apologise .
I ’m not sure why the listings / internet advertised that tonight ’s show contained POCB .
I will endeavour to find out an answer but for those conspiracy theorists amongst you , I can assure you that it will have just been an honest mistake .
SOMETIMES , the simplest ideas are the best .
To absorb heat from the sun efficiently — to use it , for example , to heat water — you need large , flat , black surfaces .
One way to do that is to construct those surfaces specially , on the roofs of buildings .
But why go to all that trouble when cities are full of black surfaces already , in the form of asphalted roads ?
This was the thought that occurred ten years ago to Arian de Bondt , an engineer who works for a Dutch building company called Ooms .
Eventually , Dr de Bondt persuaded his employers to follow it up .
The result is that their headquarters in Scharwoude is now heated in winter — and also cooled in summer — by a system that relies on the surface of the road outside .
The heat - collector itself is a circuit of connected water pipes .
Most of them run from one side of the street to the other , just under the asphalt layer .
Some , however , dive deep into the ground .
In summer , when the surface of the street gets hot , water pumped through the pipes picks up this heat and takes it underground through one of the diving pipes .
At a depth of about 100 metres lies a natural aquifer into which a series of heat exchangers have been built .
The hot water from the street runs through these exchangers , warming the groundwater , before returning to the surface via another pipe .
The aquifer is thus used as a heat store .
In winter , the circuit is changed slightly .
Water is pumped through the heat exchangers to pick up the heat that was stored during summer .
This water goes into the Ooms building and is used to warm the place up .
After performing that task , it is pumped under the asphalt and the residual heat it carries helps to keep the road free of snow and ice .
That is not the end of the story .
By now the water has been cooled to near freezing point , and it is once again sent underground — this time through a different pipe to a second aquifer .
Here , another set of heat exchangers is used to cool the groundwater .
This store of cold water is then used in summer to keep the Ooms building cool in exactly the same way that the store of heat is used in winter to keep it warm .
The result is cheap heating in winter and cheap cooling in summer .
And there is a bonus .
Summer heating softens asphalt .
That makes it easier for heavy traffic to damage the road surface .
Dr de Bondt 's system not only saves on electricity , but also saves the road .
Expect to see more examples of it , in other countries , soon .
Today 's game will be about seeing how long the " respectable " news outlets can pretend Rudy Giuliani did n't make the taxpayers pick up the expense of his Hamptons hook - ups .
For the Giuliani campaign , the game will be about denying there were any improprieties ( If true , that 's a lot of gas money and a long drive for nothing . ) , or insisting that charging the expense of " guarding " the mayor during his " constituent service " to agencies serving the city 's disabled and indigent was somehow good for America .
I do n't think there 's any denying what Rudy was up to .
The question -- if " Family Values " RepublicansTM can successfully slide past the adultery -- will be , why the shenanigans with the accounting ?
Rudy will no doubt deny any knowledge of , oh , you know , how the city 's finances are run ( even as he takes credit for " fixing " them ) , and then maybe even fall back on the , " Hey , it 's a fact of life and everyone has a private life " explanation .
But while it 's true that everyone has a private life , it 's also true that public leaders know its price .
If you want to claim it 's no big deal that Giuliani was having an adulterous affair , that 's one thing .
But why not just be an adult and have it , already ?
Why the long drives out of the city , when you know full well it 's going to cost $ 3,000 a pop ( no pun intended -- and we hope he got a better rate than that by buying in bulk ) ?
What was the taxpayer cost of having his gal pal come by the mansion ?
But he did n't want to do that , because that would be unseemly .
Family ValuesTM and all , you know .
So he snuck out to the Hamptons instead ( where everyone America 's just gotta " have a beer with " summers , dontcha know ) and passed the costs on to the city .
Because he could n't be a man and be honest about what he was doing , and never gave a moment 's thought to whether or not it was fair to make you and me pay for his cowardly selfishness .
And why would he ?
He 's a Republican .
Their entire philosophy of government is to privatize the benefits of public expenditures .
So here we are in round one of the spin game .
If there could have been no worse timing for breaking the story than the night of a debate , then there 's perhaps no better timing for the spin cycle than during a television writer 's strike , when Giuliani will be spared the acid test of political scandal : late night comedy monologues .
Daily Kos , you 're going to have to pick up the slack .
America needs jokes .
And we 'll need to work together to make it happen .
Can you out - Onion the Giuliani campaign with yet more excuses ?
Can you capture it all in a one - liner , like ellefarr did ?
Rudy got laid , New York paid .
Or can you help me write the set - up to the most immediately obvious punchline for a Rudy Giuliani sex scandal : " Sixty - nine eleven ? "

It was in Chicago , that city made notorious by gangster Al Capone , where President Bush at an impromptu news conference in 2004 said if somebody in his crime family broke the law , “ that person will be taken care of . ”
( Ha ha .
Actually , Bush said “ Administration , ” not “ crime family . ” )
Even so , truer words were never spoken .
Bush “ took care ” of White House consigliere I. Lewis ( “ Scooter ” ) Libby by commuting his sentence after Libby ’s conviction for lying to a grand jury , did n’t he ?
And if former White House press secretary Scott McClellan is right that Bush was behind Libby ’s bid to discredit former Ambassador Joseph Wilson , we ’ve got a criminal don- in - chief that can keep his accomplices out of the slammer .
When Capone ran Chicago , owners of 20,000 speakeasies poured his beer , and thousands of cops got paid to help him roll out the barrels .
Chicago was so lawless New York Mafioso Lucky Luciano called it “ a real goddamn crazy place !
Nobody ’s safe in the streets ! ”
What might Luciano have said upon visiting don Bush ’s Baghdad ?
Bush ’s power far exceeds anything Al Capone wielded .
Bush reached half way around the world to execute enemy Saddam Hussein for his alleged role in 9/11 .
At least , when mobster Joe ( “ Joe Cargo ” ) Valachi made a mistake he confessed , “ You can imagine my embarrassment when I killed the wrong guy . ”
Bush thinks no apology is due for invading Iraq and lynching a fellow wiseguy .
Despite his crimes , Bush may never make the deserved journey from the White House to the Big House .
The cowardly Congress allows him and his consiglieres to remain at large .
They live well and dine well .
When goodfellow Senator John McCain , an ardent Iraq war backer , spotted the dubious fare spread out for him at one campaign stop , he said , “ I ’d love some spaghetti . ”
McCain can eat for the many that are going hungry in Iraq tonight , thanks to his votes .
Apparently , spaghetti sauce does n’t remind McCain of you - know - what .
Unlike Capone , don Bush does not break laws to defy the government .
He is the government .
Bush has even more right than Capone to declare , “ My rackets are run along strictly American lines . ”
He ’s Capone gone global .
Like Capone , Bush solemnly observes the Fourth of July and , also like Capone , he has earned the right to celebrate St. Valentine ’s Day .
Capone wiped out seven associates of “ Bugs ” Moran in that infamous 1929 Chicago massacre .
As of this November 23 , according to Information Clearing House , Bush has eliminated 1,118,625 residents of Iraq .
Capone would have been awed .
The thorn in Bush ’s set - up is that , unlike traditional Mafia “ made ” men , his soldiers can quit .
They ’re jumping ship as his ratings plunge faster than a corpse chained to a block of cement tossed into the Chicago River .
So he hires new loyalists .
There ’s Michael Mukasey , the nation ’s second Jewish Attorney General , who will be a regular menace if he’s as ignorant of the commandment God gave Moses not to kill as he is of how the White House mob justifies torture .
As Joey ( “ Crazy Joey ” ) Gallo of New York ’s Profaci Crime Family once said , “ You like Federal judges ?
I ” ll buy you one for Christmas . ”
This holiday season , Mukasey may be the consigliere that helps eXterminator Bush put the X back in X -mas .
Those who regard don Bush as a failure just do n’t get it .
He ’s pulled off the most sensational heist in the history of crime : his Iraq war has pushed global oil prices sky high .
This just happened to improve the value of ExxonMobil and Chevron ’s oil reserves by $ 666 billion and $ 250 billion , respectively , Greg Palast wrote in “ Armed Madhouse ” ( Plume Books ) .
The other oilglopolies are also bathing in boodle .
Every motorist in America today is paying twice as much for gas ( $ 3.09 ) as when don Bush took office ( $ 1.52 ) .
As Jay Leno cracked on the “ The Tonight Show : ” “ The Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to three people --- the CEOs of Exxon , Texaco , and Shell for figuring out how to quadruple the price of oil over a seven - year period without an actual shortage . ”
And to think “ Godfather ’s ” fictional don Vito Corleone dabbled in olive oil .
If don Bush seeks a new career , he could give Hollywood a spaghetti western hero in the remake of “ For a Few Dollars More . ”
It ’s what wiseguy government is all about . #

I have used this software just like others available in the market .
But I did n't found it much of use as it does not provide any special features it just provides pause , resume buttons and nothing else .
I did n't saw any improvements in the transfer speed .
I would not recommend this to anyone , Sorry !
After searching a lot for the alternatives I found GS Richcopy 360 which works best among all .
Some of my favorite features include long path name support which is really important when copying large files , 100 % multi threaded file transfer ( as the company claims , you can witness the boost in transfer speed yourself ) , pre scheduled file transfer , email notification when the transfer is done , NTFS support , and many more exciting features .
I am currently using the enterprise version of it .
Try it its the best !
At some point on December 4 , 2006 , the number of reviews of Gary Weiss ‘s book Wall Street Versus America dropped from 17 to 10 , as all of the following reviewers ’ contributions were deleted :
Burton ( Baltimore , MD )
Dave Watson ( Banning , CA )
Luminiere ( Miami )
George ( Needham , MA )
Marty Ross ( Houston , Texas )
Rich Golden ( New York , NY USA )
Ted Dichtler ( Monroe , NY )
Jim O’Reilly ( New York , NY USA ) , who did not review Weiss ’s book , also saw his 16 reviews deleted .
You ’ll note that five of the above eight names ( in bold ) are the same five we concluded were being deceptively used by Gary Weiss to artificially boost his book ’s sales while artificially depressing others .
Of course the reviews in situ are gone and the links to them broken , but we will soon post the full text , which we saved pre-delete , here .
We had concluded that the additional three users were also Gary Weiss , but limited our initial report to five , given the need to conserve space and the ease of proving as much .
Our complete list , for those of you playing at home , also includes the following :
Chuck T. ( Chicago , IL )
Elliot Baker ( Red Bank , NJ )
Johannsen ( Atlanta )
Raymond Stella ( New York , NY )
At this point , it ’s unclear who deleted these reviews , whether it was Amazon administrators or Gary Weiss himself ( as users may delete or edit their own reviews ) but the following incident suggests it was Gary .
Soon after the reviews were discovered to be missing , a poster on an investorvillage.com message board noted that the user page of Jim O’Reilly , while devoid of reviews , retained a link to Jim O’Reilly ’s “ Wish List . ”
Upon clicking the link , he found “ Gary Weiss ’s Wish List . ”
A cut and paste version of it can be seen here .
Within minutes of posting this odd Weiss / O’Reilly connection , the wish list was also deleted .
We hypothesize that the account was originally called Gary Weiss and the name was changed to Jim O’Reilly at some point , though the name on the wish list was not .
We applaud Gary Weiss for deleting eight of his deceptive reviewer accounts and call on him to now remove the additional four noted above .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration ’s new Iraq report paints a picture of Iraqi security forces still plagued by sectarianism and heavily dependent on U.S. troops to conduct operations .

The portrayal , in the report measuring Iraqi authorities against benchmarks laid down by the U.S. Congress , is bound to raise fresh questions about the sustainability of any gains made by the current U.S. troop increase in Iraq .
“ Left on their own , many ISF ( Iraqi Security Force ) units still tend to gravitate to old habits of sectarianism when applying the law , ” said the report , issued by the White House on Thursday .
The report graded Iraq “ not satisfactory ” in terms of increasing units that could operate without U.S. help , allowing Iraqi forces to work without political interference and enforcing the law even - handedly .
It said progress in stopping false , politically motivated accusations against members of the Iraqi security forces was also “ not satisfactory . ”
A key element of U.S. strategy is building up Iraqi security forces so they can take over more responsibility and allow U.S. troops to go home .
The U.S. military says it has trained and equipped more than 353,000 members of Iraq ’s security forces .
But the report said there had actually been a “ slight reduction ” since January in the number of Iraqi units judged capable of operating independently of U.S. forces .
It did not provide figures .
A U.S. senior defense official said the report was only a snapshot of capabilities .
He said more and more Iraqi units were joining the fight against insurgents , and were suffering casualty rates three times higher than U.S. forces .
“ We remain confident that they are on program for taking over more and more responsibility , ” said the official , briefing journalists on the report on condition of anonymity .
SECTARIAN BIAS
Aside from the technical capabilities of Iraqi units , the report also highlighted the problem of sectarianism inside the security forces as the United States seeks to curb violence between Iraq ’s Shi’ite Muslim majority and Sunni minority .
Sunnis accuse Iraq ’s Shi’ite - led government of using security forces and militias to persecute them .
“ There continues to be evidence of sectarian bias in the appointment of senior military and police commanders , which in turn gives rise to suspicions that political considerations may be behind Iraqi commanders ’ decisions on which operations to undertake or support , ” the report said .
It said senior Iraqi officials responsible for human rights abuses continued to hold important positions .
The report documented concerns about the work of Iraq ’s Office of the Commander in Chief , which reports to Shi’ite Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
“ There is evidence of target lists emanating from the Office of the Commander in Chief that bypassed operational commanders and directed lower - level intelligence officers and commanders to make arrests , primarily of Sunnis , ” it said .
The senior defense official said the office had been “ an unhelpful organization ” in the past and measures had been taken to reform the way it operated .
“ We would expect that that still could use additional progress , ” he said .
Congressman Ron Paul : " It just looks like we may well come to a ' 79 , ' 80 .
Do you anticipate that there 's a possibility that we 'll face a crisis of the dollar such as we had in ' 79 and 1980 ? "
Chairman Bernanke : " The Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining low and stable inflation , and I 'm very confident we 'll be able to do that . "
Mr. Paul : " You 're not answering whether or not you anticipate a problem . "
Mr. Bernanke : " I 'm not anticipating a problem like ' 79 , ' 80 . No . "
* * *
That exchange , between Congressman Ron Paul and the chairman of the Federal Reserve board , Ben Bernanke , took place on July 18 in a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee .
It can be viewed on YouTube.com  and has been by tens of thousands .
The London fix on gold that day put the value of a dollar a bit less than a 666th of an ounce of gold , according to the Kitco charts .
Four months after Mr. Bernanke said he was not anticipating a crisis like that of 1980 , when the dollar collapsed to 1/850th of an ounce of gold , the dollar has reached just such a crisis , with the greenback trading Friday at less than 1/837th of an ounce .
So much for Mr. Bernanke 's anticipatory powers .
Now it will be said that the crises of 1980 and 2007 are not the same .
In 1980 , the inflation rate calculated from the Consumer Price Index averaged more than 13 % , according to a chart at inflationdata.com ; the average this year has been but 3.23 % .
But the dollar crisis comes at a most inconvenient time for the Fed because it comes amid a credit crisis as well .
So far , Mr. Paul is looking a lot more prescient in respect of monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke .
The Wall Street Journal , in an editorial last week , reached back 30 years to one of its famous editorials from 1978 to warn of a crisis over the dollar .
It reckoned another such crisis was n't inevitable , but that at least we 're getting " a reminder of what such a thing looks like , and it is n't pretty . "
Our own view is that Mr. Paul 's prescience on the dollar is one of the reasons he 's showing what the pundits are calling surprising strength on the hustings .
The New York Times attributes it to the way the Internet is impacting the campaign .
But we 're of the view that it relates to the substance .
We have a lot of differences with Mr. Paul , but on monetary matters , we 've been covering him since his days , in the early 1980s , as a member of the United States Gold Commission , when he coauthored , with New York 's own Lewis Lehrman , a minority report favoring a return to a version of the gold standard .
What can be said about Mr. Paul is that he 's not only ahead of Mr. Bernanke but also of his fellow Republicans , and he will eat into their standing until they address the question of the soundness of our currency .

ALTHOUGH it symbolises a bright idea , the traditional incandescent light bulb is a dud .
It wastes huge amounts of electricity , radiating 95 % of the energy it consumes as heat rather than light .
Its life is also relatively short , culminating in a dull pop as its filament fractures .
Now a team of researchers has devised a light bulb that is not only much more energy - efficient — it is also expected to last longer than the devices into which it is inserted .
Moreover , the lamp could be used for rear - projection televisions as well as general illumination .
The trick to a longer life , for light bulbs at least , is to ensure that the lamp has no electrodes .
Although electrodes are undeniably convenient for plugging bulbs directly into the lighting system , they are also the main reason why lamps fail .
The electrodes wear out .
They can react chemically with the gas inside the light bulb , making it grow dimmer .
They are also difficult to seal into the structure of the bulb , making the rupture of these seals another potential source of failure .
Scientists working for Ceravision , a company based in Milton Keynes , in Britain , have designed a new form of lamp that eliminates the need for electrodes .
Their device uses microwaves to transform electricity into light .
It consists of a relatively small lump of aluminium oxide into which a hole has been bored .
When the aluminium oxide is bombarded with microwaves generated from the same sort of device that powers a microwave oven , a concentrated electric field is created inside the void .
If a cylindrical capsule containing a suitable gas is inserted into the hole , the atoms of the gas become ionised .
As electrons accelerate in the electric field , they gain energy that they pass on to the atoms and molecules of the gas as they collide with them , creating a glowing plasma .
The resulting light is bright , and the process is energy - efficient .
Indeed , whereas traditional light bulbs emit just 5 % of their energy as light , and fluorescent tubes about 15 % , the Ceravision lamp has an efficiency greater than 50 % .
Because the lamp has no filament , the scientists who developed it think it will last for thousands of hours of use — in other words , for decades .
Moreover , the light it generates comes from what is almost a single point , which means that the bulbs can be used in projectors and televisions .
Because of this , the light is much more directional and the lamp could thus prove more efficient than bulbs that scatter light in all directions .
Its long life would make the new light ideal for buildings in which the architecture makes changing light bulbs complicated and expensive .
The lamps ' small size makes them comparable to light - emitting diodes but the new lamp generates much brighter light than those semiconductor devices do .
A single microwave generator can be used to power several lamps .
Another environmental advantage of the new design is that it does not need mercury , a highly toxic metal found in most of the bulbs used today , including energy - saving fluorescent bulbs , fluorescent tubes and the high - pressure bulbs used in projectors .
And Ceravision also reckons it should be cheap to make .
With lighting accounting for some 20 % of electricity use worldwide , switching to a more efficient system could both save energy and reduce emissions of climate - changing greenhouse gases .
By Professor Richard Wiseman
University of Hertfordshire
Why do some people get all the luck while others never get the breaks they deserve ?
A psychologist says he has discovered the answer .
Ten years ago , I set out to examine luck .
I wanted to know why some people are always in the right place at the right time , while others consistently experience ill fortune .
I placed advertisements in national newspapers asking for people who felt consistently lucky or unlucky to contact me .
Hundreds of extraordinary men and women volunteered for my research and , over the years , I have interviewed them , monitored their lives and had them take part in experiments .
Professor Wiseman 's top tips
The results reveal that although these people have almost no insight into the causes of their luck , their thoughts and behaviour are responsible for much of their good and bad fortune .
Those who have succeeded at anything and do n't mention luck are kidding themselves
Larry King
Take the case of seemingly chance opportunities .
Lucky people consistently encounter such opportunities , whereas unlucky people do not .
I carried out a simple experiment to discover whether this was due to differences in their ability to spot such opportunities .
I gave both lucky and unlucky people a newspaper , and asked them to look through it and tell me how many photographs were inside .
Professor Wiseman 's formula came too late for some ...
I had secretly placed a large message halfway through the newspaper saying : " Tell the experimenter you have seen this and win £ 250 . "
This message took up half of the page and was written in type that was more than two inches high .
Anxiety
It was staring everyone straight in the face , but the unlucky people tended to miss it and the lucky people tended to spot it .
Everything in life is luck
Donald Trump
Unlucky people are generally more tense than lucky people , and this anxiety disrupts their ability to notice the unexpected .
As a result , they miss opportunities because they are too focused on looking for something else .
They go to parties intent on finding their perfect partner and so miss opportunities to make good friends .
They look through newspapers determined to find certain types of job advertisements and miss other types of jobs .
Self - fulfilling prophecies
Lucky people are more relaxed and open , and therefore see what is there rather than just what they are looking for .
Luck is believing you 're lucky
Tennessee Williams
My research eventually revealed that lucky people generate good fortune via four principles .
They are skilled at creating and noticing chance opportunities , make lucky decisions by listening to their intuition , create self - fulfilling prophesies via positive expectations , and adopt a resilient attitude that transforms bad luck into good .
Towards the end of the work , I wondered whether these principles could be used to create good luck .
I asked a group of volunteers to spend a month carrying out exercises designed to help them think and behave like a lucky person .
Dramatic results
These exercises helped them spot chance opportunities , listen to their intuition , expect to be lucky , and be more resilient to bad luck .
I am a great believer in luck , and I find the harder I work , the more I have of it
Thomas Jefferson
One month later , the volunteers returned and described what had happened .
The results were dramatic : 80 % of people were now happier , more satisfied with their lives and , perhaps most important of all , luckier .
The lucky people had become even luckier and the unlucky had become lucky .
Finally , I had found the elusive " luck factor " .
Here are Professor Wiseman 's four top tips for becoming lucky : Listen to your gut instincts - they are normally right
Be open to new experiences and breaking your normal routine
Spend a few moments each day remembering things that went well
Visualise yourself being lucky before an important meeting or telephone call .
Luck is very often a self - fulfilling prophecy Return to story I Should Be So Lucky is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday mornings , at 0930 GMT .
Some of your comments : I think the Professor is right in terms of having a " positive " attitude and generally being prepared to accept that things can and do go wrong .
However , my experience is when they do and although it may be not what you wished , very often , something new and better happens that would n't have arisen without the " knockback " .
For many years , I said that my life seemed often like a complete accident .
Not for me the steady job and climb up the career ladder but , I 've had more fun and different experiences as a result .
A friend of mine told me a couple of years ago that I was wrong to say my life was accidental , what they said was that the difference was that I was open minded , saw opportunities others missed but , most of all , was prepared to do something about them .
Do I consider myself lucky ?
Well maybe I will never win the National Lottery but I enjoy life , after all , it 's a journey not a destination so , enjoy the journey !
John , London , UK
The best definition of luck I 've heard is that " luck occurs when preparedness meets opportunity " .
Tim Field , UK I have always thought of myself as a lucky person , although when I look back I have had road accidents , relationship break - ups , and bad jobs like anyone else ; its whether you dwell on these , and define yourself permanently by them , or seek out the positive instead .
Nicky , Bristol , UK Prof Wiseman seems to have confused " luck " with superstition .
Perhaps he should try carrying a rabbit 's foot as well .
My gut instinct is that following gut instinct is bad .
Seriously , though , everyone has good and bad luck in equal measure - what 's different is that some people dwell on the good and others on the bad , just as some see a glass half full and others as half empty .
Brian , UK Prof Wiseman seems to be confusing luck and success .
There are dozens of self - help pop psychology books out there saying exactly the same thing as him , but none of them are about luck .
If something causes " good luck " then , by definition , it is not luck .
Luck is a chance happening , where the outcome is governed purely by outside , uncontrollable factors .
So rolling a double six is lucky , paying attention whilst reading a newspaper is not .
Phil , UK Brian and Phil from Uk seem to be missing the point of Prof Wiseman 's research .
There is no such thing as ' luck ' .
There is only chance .
It is the outcome of chance occurances that people will then attribute the judgements ' lucky or unlucky ' - and this is very much reflected by their personality or state of mind .
' Luck ' is not a universal law or property .
I have always felt instinctively what the Professor has shown - that people who regard themselves as ' lucky ' reflect more their attitude to life than any inherent ' luck ' .

With the release of the TI - 99/ 4 in 1979 , integrated - circuit pioneer TI took its first shaky steps into the home computer market with a $ 1150 package that included a special monitor and a calculator - like Chiclet keyboard .
Like the original Apple II , the 99/4 did not support lowercase letters .
Because of this limitation , the Shift key served as a function modifier , with the functions typically marked on a plastic overlay .
The most frustrating of these key combinations was Shift - Q , which would quit a program or reset the computer , much to the chagrin of users who lost a day 's work while erroneously trying to capitalize the letter Q. The 99/4's layout problems extended beyond the Q conundrum :
The Enter key sat where a Right Shift key would normally reside on a standard layout .
Also , the keyboard had a space key instead of a spacebar , and it was located in an odd position .
The design had no dedicated Backspace key , either .
At least TI learned from its mistakes and released the TI - 99 / 4a , which came with a full - stroke keyboard .
DARPA , the Pentagon 's way - out science arm , wants to make soldiers stronger , faster , and generally " kill proof . "
The key , the agency believes : Getting humans to act more like animals .
For years , DARPA has been pushing to boost soldier performance .
Today , at the opening of DARPATech , the agency 's bi-annual conference , program manager Michael Callahan just announced a new effort to take that research even further .
He calls it " Inner Armor . "
The project has two main thrusts .
The first is to enable soldiers to work better in extremes – high altitudes , brutal heat , and undersea depths .
In each of these conditions , Callahan notes , there are animals that handle these environments well .
The bar - headed goose , for instance , can fly for days at Himalayan heights without taking a break .
Certain microorganisms thrive in steam vents , despite the Venutian conditions .
Then there 's the sea lion , which redirects blood flow and slows its heart rate , to stay underwater for hours .
Callahan wants soldiers to pull off some of the same tricks .
He 'd like to increase oxygen flow to Navy divers by 30 to 40 percent .
But instead of just giving 'em more O2 , Callahan would like to " do what a sea lion does - redirect oxygen demand . "
Similarly , sea lions have a particularly strong " dive reflex " – an ability to slow their heart rates and steer blood flow towards their cores .
Callahan would like to see a " push - button dive reflex , " so military divers can do the same , automatically .
Callahan 's second make thrust is to make soldiers , in his words , " kill proof . "
Chemical and radiological dumps sites , he notes , are actually " teeming with life " – filled with organisms that resist what 's toxic to most .
Callahan wants to " mimic " that , by creating a set of " synthetic vitamins " that " forestal the onset of chemical and radiation " poisoning .
But that 's the easy part .
The military today only protects against " 7 of 44 highly dangerous pathogens . "
Callahan wants to be better that ratio , through " pre-position [ed ] universal immune cells " that protect against all kinds of diseases , not just one .
He also wants his researchers to figure out " predic[t ] pathogen evolution " to " preempt pathogens ' emergence with preventive vaccine . "
If they can pull that off , Callahan figures he can develop " 3 million doses of any vaccine or therapeutic in 12 weeks , at just pennies a dose . "
And he thinks he can do it , with no animal testing .
We do have so much to learn from the critters , after all .
" A curious aspect of the theory of evolution , " said Jacques Monod , " is that everybody thinks he understands it . "
A human being , looking at the natural world , sees a thousand times purpose .
A rabbit 's legs , built and articulated for running ; a fox 's jaws , built and articulated for tearing .
But what you see is not exactly what is there ...
In the days before Darwin , the cause of all this apparent purposefulness was a very great puzzle unto science .
The Goddists said " God did it " , because you get 50 bonus points each time you use the word " God " in a sentence .
Yet perhaps I 'm being unfair .
In the days before Darwin , it seemed like a much more reasonable hypothesis .
Find a watch in the desert , said William Paley , and you can infer the existence of a watchmaker .
But when you look at all the apparent purposefulness in Nature , rather than picking and choosing your examples , you start to notice things that do n't fit the Judeo - Christian concept of one benevolent God .
Foxes seem well - designed to catch rabbits .
Rabbits seem well - designed to evade foxes .
Was the Creator having trouble making up Its mind ?
When I design a toaster oven , I do n't design one part that tries to get electricity to the coils and a second part that tries to prevent electricity from getting to the coils .
It would be a waste of effort .
Who designed the ecosystem , with its predators and prey , viruses and bacteria ?
Even the cactus plant , which you might think well - designed to provide water fruit to desert animals , is covered with inconvenient spines .
The ecosystem would make much more sense if it was n't designed by a unitary Who , but , rather , created by a horde of deities — say from the Hindu or Shinto religions .
This handily explains both the ubiquitous purposefulnesses , and the ubiquitous conflicts :
More than one deity acted , often at cross-purposes .
The fox and rabbit were both designed , but by distinct competing deities .
I wonder if anyone ever remarked on the seemingly excellent evidence thus provided for Hinduism over Christianity .
Probably not .
Similarly , the Judeo - Christian God is alleged to be benevolent — well , sort of .
And yet much of nature 's purposefulness seems downright cruel .
Darwin suspected a non-standard Creator for studying Ichneumon wasps , whose paralyzing stings preserve its prey to be eaten alive by its larvae : " I cannot persuade myself , " wrote Darwin , " that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars , or that a cat should play with mice . "
I wonder if any earlier thinker remarked on the excellent evidence thus provided for Manichaen religions over monotheistic ones .
By now we all know the punchline :
You just say " evolution " .
I worry that 's how some people are absorbing the " scientific " explanation , as a magical purposefulness factory in Nature .
I 've previously discussed the case of Storm from the movie X - Men , who in one mutation gets the ability to throw lightning bolts .
Why ?
Well , there 's this thing called " evolution " that somehow pumps a lot of purposefulness into Nature , and the changes happen through " mutations " .
So if Storm gets a really large mutation , she can be redesigned to throw lightning bolts .
Radioactivity is a popular super origin : radiation causes mutations , so more powerful radiation causes more powerful mutations .
That 's logic .
But evolution does n't allow just any kind of purposefulness to leak into Nature .
That 's what makes evolution a success as an empirical hypothesis .
If evolutionary biology could explain a toaster oven , not just a tree , it would be worthless .
There 's a lot more to evolutionary theory than pointing at Nature and saying , " Now purpose is allowed , " or " Evolution did it ! "
The strength of a theory is not what it allows , but what it prohibits ; if you can invent an equally persuasive explanation for any outcome , you have zero knowledge .
" Many non-biologists , " observed George Williams , " think that it is for their benefit that rattles grow on rattlesnake tails . "
Bzzzt !
This kind of purposefulness is not allowed .
Evolution does n't work by letting flashes of purposefulness creep in at random — reshaping one species for the benefit of a random recipient .
Evolution is powered by a systematic correlation between the different ways that different genes construct organisms , and how many copies of those genes make it into the next generation .
For rattles to grow on rattlesnake tails , rattle - growing genes must become more and more frequent in each successive generation .
( Actually genes for incrementally more complex rattles , but if I start describing all the fillips and caveats to evolutionary biology , we really will be here all day . )
There is n't an Evolution Fairy that looks over the current state of Nature , decides what would be a " good idea " , and chooses to increase the frequency of rattle - constructing genes .
I suspect this is where a lot of people get stuck , in evolutionary biology .
They understand that " helpful " genes become more common , but " helpful " lets any sort of purpose leak in .
They do n't think there 's an Evolution Fairy , yet they ask which genes will be " helpful " as if a rattlesnake gene could " help " non-rattlesnakes .
The key realization is that there is no Evolution Fairy .
There 's no outside force deciding which genes ought to be promoted .
Whatever happens , happens because of the genes themselves .
Genes for constructing ( incrementally better ) rattles , must have somehow ended up more frequent in the rattlesnake gene pool , because of the rattle .
In this case it 's probably because rattlesnakes with better rattles survive more often — rather than mating more successfully , or having brothers that reproduce more successfully , etc .
Maybe predators are wary of rattles and do n't step on the snake .
Or maybe the rattle diverts attention from the snake 's head .
( As George Williams suggests , " The outcome of a fight between a dog and a viper would depend very much on whether the dog initially seized the reptile by the head or by the tail . " )
But that 's just a snake 's rattle .
There are much more complicated ways that a gene can cause copies of itself to become more frequent in the next generation .
Your brother or sister shares half your genes .
A gene that sacrifices one unit of resources to bestow three units of resource on a brother , may promote some copies of itself by sacrificing one of its constructed organisms .
( If you really want to know all the details and caveats , buy a book on evolutionary biology ; there is no royal road . )
The main point is that the gene 's effect must cause copies of that gene to become more frequent in the next generation .
There 's no Evolution Fairy that reaches in from outside .
There 's nothing which decides that some genes are " helpful " and should , therefore , increase in frequency .
It 's just cause and effect , starting from the genes themselves .
This explains the strange conflicting purposefulness of Nature , and its frequent cruelty .
It explains even better than a horde of Shinto deities .
Why is so much of Nature at war with other parts of Nature ?
Because there is n't one Evolution directing the whole process .
There 's as many different " evolutions " as reproducing populations .
Rabbit genes are becoming more or less frequent in rabbit populations .
Fox genes are becoming more or less frequent in fox populations .
Fox genes which construct foxes that catch rabbits , insert more copies of themselves in the next generation .
Rabbit genes which construct rabbits that evade foxes are naturally more common in the next generation of rabbits .
Hence the phrase " natural selection " .
Why is Nature cruel ?
You , a human , can look at an Ichneumon wasp , and decide that it 's cruel to eat your prey alive .
You can decide that if you 're going to eat your prey alive , you can at least have the decency to stop it from hurting .
It would scarcely cost the wasp anything to anesthetize its prey as well as paralyze it .
Or what about old elephants , who die of starvation when their last set of teeth fall out ?
These elephants are n't going to reproduce anyway .
What would it cost evolution — the evolution of elephants , rather — to ensure that the elephant dies right away , instead of slowly and in agony ?
What would it cost evolution to anesthetize the elephant , or give it pleasant dreams before it dies ?
Nothing ; that elephant wo n't reproduce more or less either way .
If you were talking to a fellow human , trying to resolve a conflict of interest , you would be in a good negotiating position — would have an easy job of persuasion .
It would cost so little to anesthetize the prey , to let the elephant die without agony !
Oh please , wo n't you do it , kindly ... um ...
There 's no one to argue with .
Human beings fake their justifications , figure out what they want using one method , and then justify it using another method .
There 's no Evolution of Elephants Fairy that 's trying to ( a ) figure out what 's best for elephants , and then ( b ) figure out how to justify it to the Evolutionary Overseer , who ( c ) does n't want to see reproductive fitness decreased , but is ( d ) willing to go along with the painless - death idea , so long as it does n't actually harm any genes .
There 's no advocate for the elephants anywhere in the system .
Humans , who are often deeply concerned for the well - being of animals , can be very persuasive in arguing how various kindnesses would n't harm reproductive fitness at all .
Sadly , the evolution of elephants does n't use a similar algorithm ; it does n't select nice genes that can plausibly be argued to help reproductive fitness .
Simply : genes that replicate more often become more frequent in the next generation .
Like water flowing downhill , and equally benevolent .
A human , looking over Nature , starts thinking of all the ways we would design organisms .
And then we tend to start rationalizing reasons why our design improvements would increase reproductive fitness — a political instinct , trying to sell your own preferred option as matching the boss 's favored justification .
And so , amateur evolutionary biologists end up making all sorts of wonderful and completely mistaken predictions .
Because the amateur biologists are drawing their bottom line — and more importantly , locating their prediction in hypothesis - space — using a different algorithm than evolutions use to draw their bottom lines .
A human engineer would have designed human taste buds to measure how much of each nutrient we had , and how much we needed .
When fat was scarce , almonds or cheeseburgers would taste delicious .
But if you started to become obese , or if vitamins were lacking , lettuce would taste delicious .
But there is no Evolution of Humans Fairy , which intelligently planned ahead and designed a general system for every contingency .
It was a reliable invariant of humans ' ancestral environment that calories were scarce .
So genes whose organisms loved calories , became more frequent .
Like water flowing downhill .
We are simply the embodied history of which organisms did in fact survive and reproduce , not which organisms ought prudentially to have survived and reproduced .
The human retina is constructed backward :
The light - sensitive cells are at the back , and the nerves emerge from the front and go back through the retina into the brain .
Hence the blind spot .
To a human engineer , this looks simply stupid — and other organisms have independently evolved retinas the right way around .
Why not redesign the retina ?
The problem is that no single mutation will reroute the whole retina simultaneously .
A human engineer can redesign multiple parts simultaneously , or plan ahead for future changes .
But if a single mutation breaks some vital part of the organism , it does n't matter what wonderful things a Fairy could build on top of it — the organism dies and the genes decreases in frequency .
If you turn around the retina 's cells without also reprogramming the nerves and optic cable , the system as a whole wo n't work .
It does n't matter that , to a Fairy or a human engineer , this is one step forward in redesigning the retina .
The organism is blind .
Evolution has no foresight , it is simply the frozen history of which organisms did in fact reproduce .
Evolution is as blind as a halfway - redesigned retina .
Find a watch in a desert , said William Paley , and you can infer the watchmaker .
There were once those who denied this , who thought that life " just happened " without need of an optimization process , mice being spontaneously generated from straw and dirty shirts .
If we ask who was more correct — the theologians who argued for a Creator - God , or the intellectually unfulfilled atheists who argued that mice spontaneously generated — then the theologians must be declared the victors : evolution is not God , but it is closer to God than it is to pure random entropy .
Mutation is random , but selection is non-random .
This does n't mean an intelligent Fairy is reaching in and selecting .
It means there 's a non-zero statistical correlation between the gene and how often the organism reproduces .
Over a few million years , that non-zero statistical correlation adds up to something very powerful .
It 's not a god , but it 's more closely akin to a god than it is to snow on a television screen .
In a lot of ways , evolution is like unto theology .
" Gods are ontologically distinct from creatures , " said Damien Broderick , " or they 're not worth the paper they 're written on . "
And indeed , the Shaper of Life is not itself a creature .
Evolution is bodiless , like the Judeo - Christian deity .
Omnipresent in Nature , immanent in the fall of every leaf .
Vast as a planet 's surface .
Billions of years old .
Itself unmade , arising naturally from the structure of physics .
Does n't that all sound like something that might have been said about God ?
And yet the Maker has no mind , as well as no body .
In some ways , its handiwork is incredibly poor design by human standards .
It is internally divided .
Most of all , it is n't nice .
In a way , Darwin discovered God —a
God that failed to match the preconceptions of theology , and so passed unheralded .
If Darwin had discovered that life was created by an intelligent agent — a bodiless mind that loves us , and will smite us with lightning if we dare say otherwise — people would have said " My gosh !
That 's God ! "
But instead Darwin discovered a strange alien God — not comfortably " ineffable " , but really genuinely different from us .
Evolution is not a God , but if it were , it would n't be Jehovah .
It would be H. P. Lovecraft 's Azathoth , the blind idiot God burbling chaotically at the center of everything , surrounded by the thin monotonous piping of flutes .
Which you might have predicted , if you had really looked at Nature .
So much for the claim some religionists make , that they believe in a vague deity with a correspondingly high probability .
Anyone who really believed in a vague deity , would have recognized their strange inhuman creator when Darwin said " Aha ! "
So much for the claim some religionists make , that they are waiting innocently curious for Science to discover God .
Science has already discovered the sort - of - godlike maker of humans — but it was n't what the religionists wanted to hear .
They were waiting for the discovery of their God , the highly specific God they want to be there .
They shall wait forever , for the great discovery has already taken place , and the winner is Azathoth .
Well , more power to us humans .
I like having a Creator I can outwit .
Beats being a pet .
I 'm glad it was Azathoth and not Odin .
In a recent blog posting , a German operator of a Tor anonymous proxy server revealed that he was arrested by German police officers at the end of July .
Although he was released shortly afterwards , information about the arrest had been kept quiet until his lawyers were able to get the charges dropped .
Tor Project
Tor is a privacy tool designed to allow users to communicate and browse anonymously on the Internet .
It 's endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties groups as a method for whistle blowers and human rights workers to communicate with journalists .
Tor provides anonymous Web - browsing software to hundreds of thousands of users around the world , according to its developers .
The largest numbers of users are in the United States , the European Union and China .
The police were investigating a bomb threat posted to an online forum for German police officers .
The police traced one of the objectionable posts on the forum to the IP address for Janssen 's server .
Up until his arrest , Alex Janssen 's Tor server carried more than 40 GB of random strangers '
Internet traffic each day .
Showing up at his house at midnight on a Sunday night , police cuffed and arrested him in front of his wife and seized his equipment .
In a display of both bitter irony and incompetence , the police did not take or shutdown the Tor server responsible for the traffic they were interested in , which was located in a different city , more than 500 km away .
Janssen 's attempts to explain what Tor is to the police officers initially fell on deaf ears .
After being interrogated for hours , someone from the city of Düsseldorf 's equivalent of the Department of Homeland Security showed up and admitted to Janssen that they 'd made a mistake .
He was released shortly after .
Germany is clearly not going out of its way to make computer security researchers and activists feel too welcome .
Germany recently passed a law that " renders the creation and distribution of software illegal that could be used by someone to break into a computer system or could be used to prepare a break in .
This includes port scanners like nmap , security scanners like nessus [ as well as ] proof of concept exploits . "
Back in summer 2006 , German authorities conducted a simultaneous raid of seven different data centers , seizing 10 Tor servers in the process .
Agents took the servers believing them to be related to a child porn investigation .
Furthermore , in 2003 a German court ordered the developers of the Jap anonymity system , a completely different project than Tor , to create a back - door in their system to be used in national security investigations .
This event does raise some interesting legal questions .
If 40 GB of other people 's Internet traffic flows through your own home network , can authorities , be they the RIAA or FBI , reasonably link anything that has been tracked to your computer 's IP address to you ?
Does setting up a Tor server give you the ultimate plausible deniability card ?
" No officer , that BitTorrent downloadwas n't mine .
It was from one of the thousands of people who route their Internet traffic through the anonymizing sever on my home network . "
The ability to have a believable claim to plausible deniability is something that some of us have been attempting to get for a while by having an open wireless access point at home .
And 40 GB of Internet traffic from perfect strangers may be more significant in the eyes of a court than the possibility of one or two of your neighbors connecting to your wireless network .
All of this , for now , remains theoretical .
No Tor -related case has made it to the courts .. but it 's just a matter of time until one does .

Ahmadinejad : Iran , US not headed for war ; Lawmaker wants New Yorkers to ' make his life miserable ' Mike Aivaz and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday September 24 , 2007
Print This Email This Update at bottom : Ahmadinejad says Iran does not resort to terrorism , calls for referendum among all inhabitants to determine future of Palestine , insists Iran could be a good friend to the United States .
The arrival in New York City of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been met with frenzy by opponents such as New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind , who called on New Yorkers to " make his life miserable . "
Columbia University has come under particular fire for its invitation to Ahmadinejad to speak there , with the Bush administration appearing fearful of providing him any sort of public forum in this country .
According to CNN , " Ahmadinejad 's public - relations push appears aimed at presenting his views directly to a U.S. audience amid rising strains and talk of war between the two nations . "
Admadinejad stated in an appearance on 60 Minutes this past weekend , " It 's wrong to think that Iran and the U.S. are walking toward war .
Who says so ?
Why should we go to war ?
There is no war in the offing . "
John Coatsworth , dean of Columbia 's School of International and Public Affairs , told CNN that it is necessary to deal with Ahmadinejad because " Iran is going to hold the key to peace in the Middle East . "
" We have to be able to deal with and negotiate with leaders like this , however much we may disagree with their views , " Coatsworth stated , downplaying suggestions that it was " foolish " to allow American's to hear Admadinejad 's views .
" We 're going to ask him tough questions .
If he gives terrible answers , that will be known ... by everyone in the world . "
Coatsworth explained further that the issue is not one of offering Ahmadinejad a platform , because he " has a platform whenever he wishes to have one . "
Rather , Columbia is offering him " an opportunity not only to present his views but to defend them in the face of challenges and tough questions .
...
We 're going to challenge this guy as he has not been challenged in other places . "
ABC News interviewed Columbia University President Lee Bollinger on the same subject , asking him , " Why court controversy ? "
" The reasons for doing this really go to freedom of speech and academic freedom , " explained Bollinger .
" What 's at stake here is really the opportunity to be able to learn about the world .
...
It 's extremely important to know who the leaders are of countries that are your adversaries , to watch them to see how they think , to see how they reason or do not reason . "
" I think we have to recognize that free speech does not endorse someone , does not honor the dishonarable , " Bollinger added .
" Our principals include listening to those whom we may despise . "
Ahmadinejad 's speech at Columbia
As described by Newsday , " In remarks that veered between sermon and speech , Ahmadinejad quoted frequently from the Quran , warning of the corrupting influence of the material world and extolling the importance of spiritual guidance .
He inveighed against governments that ' tap telephones ' and decried ' their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations . ' "
Ahmadinejad stated repeatedly that the Palestinians were being made to pay for the Holocaust , an event which they had nothing to do with , and insisted there was nothing wrong with calling for further study of the facts .
When he was asked during a question - and - answer session following his speech whether he or his government seek the destruction of the State of Israel , he responded that he would like to see a referendum among all those residing in Palestine -- Jewish , Muslim , and Christian -- to determine the future of the region .
When asked whether Iran supports terrorists in Iraq , Ahmadinejad referred to American support for MEK , a terrorist group which has killed many Iranians , and added , " We are a cultured nation .
We do n't need to resort to terrorism . "
" We do n't have homosexuals like in your country , " Ahmadinejad said in response to another question , an answer which was met by a chorus of boos .
He insisted that Iran 's nuclear program is entirely peaceful but has been turned into " a political issue . "
He also stated that Iran would be glad to have far - reaching talks with the United States on a basis of " mutual respect " and that if the United States dropped its hostility towards Iran , it would find that Iran could be a good friend .

We can't stress our " do n't try this at home " attitude strongly enough towards readers over this piece of robot hackery from the 5 Voltcore collective , called the knife.hand.chop.bot .
The basic premise is this : the robot plays a game of " Mumblety - Peg , " a test of courage wherein a blade is brought down between your fingers at an ever increasing pace .
Of course , we 've all played a round or two of this game with friends , but it 's unlikely that many of us have allowed a bot to play , much less do all the shot - calling .
The system manages to avoid slicing fingers due to signals it receives from an onboard sensor which guides the knife , however , it also utilizes contact sensors underneath the user 's hand , which can detect moisture ( aka " nervous sweat " ) .
The sweat triggers " stressful " sounds via closure of the contacts , and can have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the aiming mechanism , thus increasing your stress , thus causing you to sweat , thus throwing off the aim , thus ... well , we 're just going to keep our mitts off of the thing .
Check the video after the break to see what all the sweating is about .

A study on how to relieve jetlag in hamsters won one of the prizes
Other winners included work on treating hamster jetlag with impotency drugs , extracting vanilla from cow dung , and the side - effects of sword swallowing .
The awards , founded in 1991 , mark achievements that " first make people laugh , and then make them think " .
The prize ceremony took place at Harvard University , US .
Genuine Nobel Laureates handed out the much - coveted awards to the winners , who took away no cash , but instead received a hand - made prize , a certificate , and , of course , the glory of such an illustrious win .
Sword effects
Dan Meyer , executive director of Sword Swallowing Association International and an author of the British Medical Journal paper Sword Swallowing and its Side - Effects , said : " I was surprised and extremely honoured when I found out I was not only nominated for an Ig Nobel prize but that I had won it .
I could n't believe it . "
He told the BBC News website that the study revealed that when professional sword swallowers ingested a single sword very carefully , it did not do much harm , but swallowing many swords , strangely shaped blades , or being distracted when swallowing , could cause injury .
The findings also suggested that sword swallowers should not swallow swords if they already had a sore throat , he said .
Unfortunately , said the organisers , nobody from the US military who carried out the research on chemicals that could prompt homosexual dalliances amongst rival troops ( a research project called Harassing , Annoying and " Bad Guy " Identifying Chemicals ) attended the ceremony because the study 's authors could not be tracked down .
Real research
The Ig Nobel Prizes were created by the Annals of Improbable Research ( AIR ) , a science magazine .
The Ig Nobels celebrate the unusual side of research
The awards , now in their 17th year , are intended to " celebrate the unusual , honour the imaginative - and spur people 's interest in science , medicine and technology " .
Marc Abrahams , the editor of AIR , told the BBC News website : " When I became the editor of a science magazine , suddenly I was meeting all kinds of people who had done things that were hard to describe , and for the most part , nobody had ever heard of .
" For some of them , it seemed a great shame that nobody would give them any kind of recognition , and that was what really led to the birth of the Ig Nobels . "
Like their more sober counterpart , the Nobel Prizes , the Ig Nobels are split into several categories and all research is real and published .
2007 Ig Nobel Winners
Medicine - Brian Witcombe , of Gloucestershire Royal NHS Foundation Trust , UK , and Dan Meyer for their probing work on the health consequences of swallowing a sword .
Physics - A US - Chile team who ironed out the problem of how sheets become wrinkled .
Biology - Dr Johanna van Bronswijk of the Netherlands for carrying out a creepy crawly census of all of the mites , insects , spiders , ferns and fungi that share our beds .
Chemistry - Mayu Yamamoto , from Japan , for developing a method to extract vanilla fragrance and flavouring from cow dung .
Linguistics - A University of Barcelona team for showing that rats are unable to tell the difference between a person speaking Japanese backwards and somebody speaking Dutch backwards .
Literature - Glenda Browne of Blue Mountains , Australia , for her study of the word " the " , and how it can flummox those trying to put things into alphabetical order .
Peace -
The US Air Force Wright Laboratory for instigating research and development on a chemical weapon that would provoke widespread homosexual behaviour among enemy troops .
Nutrition - Brian Wansink of Cornell University for investigating the limits of human appetite by feeding volunteers a self - refilling , " bottomless " bowl of soup .
Economics - Kuo Cheng Hsieh of Taiwan for patenting a device that can catch bank robbers by dropping a net over them .
Aviation - A National University of Quilmes , Argentina , team for discovering that impotency drugs can help hamsters to recover from jet lag .
Visitors to the IndiaTimes website are being bombarded by malware , some of which appear to target previously unknown vulnerabilities in Windows , a security researcher warns .
In all , the English - language Indian news site is directly or indirectly serving up at least 434 malicious files , many of which are not detected by antivirus software , according to Mary Landesman , a senior security researcher at ScanSafe .
She said at least 18 different IP addresses are involved in the attack .
" The end result of the compromise is that the user , going through their normal course of activities , is subject to a really massive installation of malicious files , " she told us .
" Coupled with the low detection by antivirus vendors , it does put the end user in a very vulnerable position . "
Visitors can be infected even if they have up - to - date systems and they do n't fall victim to tricks to install software or browser add - ons , she said .
She urged people to avoid the site until it 's been cleaned up .
Diwali , the Hindu festival of lights , is in full swing in India and Landesman is concerned webmasters for the site may be hard to reach over this holiday weekend .
" Our hope is they 'll cut their holiday short and take care of this before Monday , " she said .
She said most pages on the IndiaTimes site are clean .
Those that are infected , however , contain a potent cocktail of downloader and dropper Trojans and other binaries .
They contain a script that points to remote sites , some of which link to still other sites .
The malicious files exploit multiple vulnerabilities , and some appear to be previously unknown flaws in Windows , according to Landesman , who used to be a security researcher for Microsoft .
A Microsoft spokesman said he was looking in to the report .
ScanSafe first detected and began blocking the malware on the IndiaTimes on October 25 .
The site was continuing to serve malware at time of writing .
ScanSafe 's advisory is here . ®
Fox News asks Ron Paul why he gets most military support while calling for Iraq withdrawal David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 17 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This When GOP presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) appeared on Fox News this week , he was introduced as a master of the art of the Internet who has raised millions in online donations .
" We have a lot of viewers who are psyched that we finally have you live on the show , " the Fox & Friends host told Paul .
Paul modestly replied that his growing support is not so much a matter of campaign wizardly on his part as that " we offered a program and a political position , and the young people especially , and the Internet , has found us , and we 're very delighted because our numbers are growing . "
He said that even though his standing in the polls remains low , he believe that " we 're in a pretty good position " for the early primaries , with " the third amount of cash available . "
Paul told
Fox he was n't bothered by the governor of his own state of Texas endorsing Rudy Giuliani because " the party is a broad - based party . "
He emphasized , however , that " we do n't want to be exclusive .
I mean , I 'd like to build the party , which I believe I am , from the young people .
And the college kids are flocking to our campaign .
... I think our wing of the party is alive and well , and I think I can show that the number of people joining us are probably greater than those who are joining the big spenders . "
Fox asked Paul about a study showing he is the candidate with the most support from members of the US military , even though he is calling for immediate withdrawal from Iraq .
" We take the traditional position that you should only go to war under a declaration and win and get out , " Paul explained .
" It 's protecting the troops ... and the fact that we get the money from the military more than all the other Republicans put together is a pretty darn good endorsement . "
Paul finished by noting that his positions are based on Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution , which he regularly cites as the basis for his view of limited government .
That section enumerates a limited list of Congressional functions -- including punishing piracy on the high seas , granting letters of marque and reprisal , and regulating commerce with the Indian tribes -- but does not cover many of the functions routinely assumed by government today .
The following video is from Fox 's Fox & Friends , broadcast on October 17 , 2007 .

UPDATE : The entire nearly - 3 - minute interview with the woman is here .
This is a video from an Obama rally in LA yesterday .
The second person interviewed is a woman claiming to be an American vet who served in Iraq .
She says she was sitting by a tent , a tank hit the back of the tent and the falling tent cut her legs off .
She 's now missing one leg ( possibly two , it 's hard to tell in the video ) .
She says the military is n't " paying her " because they 're calling her loss of a leg " an accident . "
Judging by the other horror stories we 've now heard , this one sounds exactly the same - no disability payment if your horrible injury was n't caused by some guy with a funny name .
Hopefully some intrepid journalist , or Hill staffer , or Illinois Senator perhaps ... can look this woman up and see if her story is for real , and if it is , get it fixed .
That natural bath sponge you use to scrub - a - dub - dub your body might not have a nervous system , but its cells possess many of the genes needed to make one .
The surprising discovery , detailed in June 6 issue of the open- access journal PLoS ONE , suggests the evolutionary origins of the nervous system are much older than scientists previously thought .
The study found that sponges contain about 25 genes that are very similar to human genes found in the “ synapses ” of nerve cells , called neurons .
Synapses are bulb - like connections neurons use to communicate ; in humans and many other animals , they play a crucial role in learning and memory .
Genes are specific DNA sequences that carry instructions for when , where and how much a certain protein a cell should make .
Synapse - like interactions “ Sponges are the first animals to branch off compared to the rest of animals .
They do n’t have nervous systems , yet we found they have many of the genes that are used in the synapse of modern humans , ” said Todd Oakley , an evolutionary biologist at the University of California , Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) , who was involved in the study .
Even more surprising , the proteins made by the sponge genes were found to interact with one another in ways similar to proteins in human synapses .
“ Not only do they have [ human synapse genes ] , they also have this signature that they may be functioning in a similar way in the absence of a nervous system , as they do in the presence of one , ” Oakley told LiveScience .
The function of the sponge genes are not clear , but their human counterparts combine to form complex protein “ machines ” important for synaptic communication , Oakley said .
The team ’s research was made possible by the recent sequencing of the sponge genome , the result of which have yet to be published but is available online .
In addition to lacking nervous systems , sponges also do n’t have internal organs or muscles .
Sponges are filter - feeders :
They spend most of their lives anchored to sediment or rock .
Feeding and the excreting wastes are done with the aid of flowing water .
May I borrow that gene ?
Scientists think the first neurons and synapses first appeared on Earth more than 600 million years ago in organisms called “ cnidarians , ” which include the hydra , sea anemone and jellyfish .
“ While sponges do show evidence that their cells can communicate with each other , the nervous system is much more efficient , ” Oakley said .
The researchers speculate that the sponge genes were recycled over evolutionary time , with small modifications , to create the nervous systems of later animals .
“ Evolution can take these ‘ off - the - shelf ’ components and put them together in new and interesting ways , ” said study leader Kenneth Kosik , a UCSB neuroscientist .
Other genes would also have had to evolve or to have been co-opted to create complex nervous systems , such as our own .
Scientists think an estimated 77 to 1,000 genes are important for human synaptic communication , Oakley said .
Did you ever have a learning experience after a major change in your life that made you realize you could have learned that same lesson without having gone through the major change ?
Obviously the change was a necessary catalyst for the lesson , but it still gives you the opportunity to slap yourself in the forehead and say , “ I could have learned this years ago ! ” .
After moving to Port Orange , FL this past weekend , I ’ve had several of those moments .
In an effort to keep you from needing to bop yourself in the head over similar lessons , I ’ll share what I have learned over the past few days .
1 ) You do n’t realize how much your surroundings are a part of your state of mind until you experience the contrast of going through your daily routine in a strange environment .
There were a lot of things about my previous daily routine that were not “ ideal , ” and as I got ready to move , I certainly looked forward to making some positive changes in that regard .
However , when it came down to unloading the last box and saying a final goodbye to my previous lifestyle , I was suddenly very aware of the fact that I was all alone in a brand - new world .
Logistically I was prepared for that , but this was the first time in many years that I was going to be geographically cut off from the environment and the people that I had grown so accustomed to having as part of my life .
It was a bit scary , to be honest , and more than just a little sad .
The Lesson : Do n’t take your surroundings and your circle of influence for granted .
If you do n’t enjoy certain aspects of your life , then get out of your comfort zone for awhile so you can experience the contrast of what your life looks like from a different point of view .
Make a list of everything and everyone that is part of your daily routine , and then take 2 or 3 days and remove it all .
Leave town if you have to .
While trying not to have any ties to your “ previous life , ” you might be surprised how much your normal surroundings and the people around you were part of your security and comfort level .
2 ) Try being healthy in a way that you normally would n’t – you might like it !
I used to be a personal trainer , so I am certainly familiar with the ins and outs of proper diet and exercise habits .
Whenever I am doing something healthy or unhealthy , I am always acutely aware of it .
Nonetheless , like anyone else , I have certain routines that I tend to stick to , even if they are n’t the most healthy habits in the world .
Two of my vices are coffee and diet soda .
I do n’t take the sugared version of either one , but instead opt for using flavored creamer and Splenda for my coffee , and whatever chemically - stuffed ingredients are in the diet soda that I buy .
I know those habits are n’t good for me , but I do them anyway .
Well , grocery shopping still has n’t happened since the move , so although I have coffee and coffee creamer , I do not have any Splenda or any diet soda yet .
Imagine my surprise when I realized that my coffee was just as good with only the creamer in it , and in less than 3 days of drinking water , I have almost completely curbed my desire to drink soda of any kind .
The Lesson : Healthy habits do n’t just look good on paper !
Even if you may have resistance to healthy habits as part of your normal routine , just give yourself a few days of doing things in a manner different than what you are used to .
Who knows ?
You might even end up with radically fewer chemicals in your system every day like I did !
3 ) If you push yourself to the limit , no matter how much it hurts , you ’ll be glad you did it .
One of the reasons why I moved to Port Orange is because of its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean .
I love the beach and the energy that is always available at the water ’s edge , so getting over to the coast was one of the first things that I did once the boxes were all unloaded .
There is a causeway that separates the “ mainland ” from the peninsula where the actual coastline is , and that causeway is about a mile and a half from my house .
It was a beautiful , sunny day , so I hopped on my bike and away I went .
Well , in addition to being beautiful and sunny , it was also very windy , and the causeway itself is a fairly steep incline – probably at least 30 - degrees up or more , and about a quarter of a mile from the bottom to the top .
Now , between the recent launching of PDP , and the administrative issues of finding and securing the house that I moved into , it has been about 3 weeks since I have gotten any consistent cardiovascular exercise .
Let me tell you that getting up that causeway was literally the hardest physical thing that I can remember doing in years !
I was n’t wearing my heart rate monitor , so I do n’t know what my beats per minute were , but I can tell you that I was well outside of the safety zone !
However , in addition to the incredible view of the ocean and the beach that I had as soon as I got to the top of the causeway , the sense of accomplishment that I felt was unbelievable .
I felt like I was on top of the world , and that it was all downhill from there !
The Lesson : Do n’t wait until you find yourself in an unexpectedly difficult situation to push yourself to the limits .
Find ways to take it to the max – every day if you can .
Not only will you feel wonderful for having made the effort , but your confidence in what you are capable of will grow by leaps and bounds !
4 ) You really do n’t need all of that junk
This move for me was to a location that was only about 90 minutes south of where I was before , so the physical part of the move was actually done in chunks .
In fact , some of my stuff is still back where I used to live because it just was n’t a priority to get it moved right away .
During the process of moving everything that I own over the course of several different trips , I had to make some hard decisions about what needed to stay or go on any given trip , and what could be left behind for the final low priority trip later on .
Imagine my surprise when I realized that almost 90 % of the things that I owned were really not that important to me !
With the exception of my computer , my clothes , the minimum necessary furnishings , and a few other necessary or high priority items , almost everything I own is not used on a daily basis .
Sure , I like having a TV , I would cry if something happened to my iPod , and there are many things that have sentimental value for me .
However , most of my belongings are just things that I use because they are there .
I have very little attachment to them , nor a strong desire to keep them close to me .
Even as I type this , there are things in the garage that I could bring into the house , but I ’m simply not in a very big hurry to do so !
The Lesson : Do n’t be too attached to the material possessions in your life .
Ask yourself how many of the things that you own are actually important to you .
If they are n’t , then why not clear out the physical and the mental clutter by getting rid of them ?
5 ) True friendship will show itself when needed .
I saved this one for last because I felt it was the most important thought for you to be left with .
As I went through the process of planning for and preparing for this move , to say that my life was chaotic would not even begin to cover it .
Between the work that I do o
nline , and the logistics that went into this entire process , I have been running crazy for months .
Through it all , there was one person who bent over backwards for me on every occasion , although at the same time she maintained her own integrity by not bending so far that she did n’t tend to her own needs in the process .
I am an active social person , and I have a lot of friends from all over the U.S. , most of whom I see at least semi- frequently during annual get - togethers that we have planned .
However , I could count the people who would do for me what this person did on less than one hand .
The person in question knows who she is , so I wo n’t call her out by name , except of course to say Thank You for all that you did !
I ’m quite sure I have n’t expressed that sentiment as much as I should have .
The Lesson :
You may have an address book full of names , a contact list a mile long , or even a database of the hundreds of people that you know all over the world , and that is a wonderful thing .
However , how many fingers and toes would it take for you to count the number of people who would truly jump through fire for you ?
Once you have that figure , pick up the phone and call them right now just to say “ Thanks for being my friend ” .
As I indicated at the beginning of this post , each of these lessons can be learned without having to actually go through major changes in your life .

Every Christmas
Eve he whizzes around the world at top speed , without incident .
But Santa 's unblemished driving record is not enough to satisfy the health and safety brigade .
They have ordered him to wear a seatbelt - at least when he visits Halesowen , West Midlands .
The local rotary club has been forced to fit a belt to the sleigh he uses there - or face a £ 200 increase in its insurance premiums .

President of the Halesowen and Rowley Regis Rotary Club Barry Wheeler said they were shocked at the news from their insurers .
Santa reaches a cruising speed of only 5 mph while in town , as a Land Rover pulls the sleigh to give the reindeer a rest .
Mr Wheeler said : " He would be more likely to injure himself getting in and out of the sleigh than actually falling out of it . "
He added : " We have done the sleigh round the towns for something like 20 years .
Every year we have made sure Santa gets to go through town and wave to the children .

" But this year we found out we actually needed a much more wideranging insurance policy for Santa riding on the sleigh because of health and safety rules .
It would have run into a four - figure sum . "
He said that the group paid for Santa 's visits out of club funds , and could not afford the higher premium .
Luckily , one of the Rotary Club members owned a garage and took the sleigh in to be refurbished , with a big harness to reach around St Nick 's belly .
" At least this will make sure Santa never falls out , " said Mr Wheeler .
" It seems so silly , but it 's just what we have had to do to make sure the event stays running .
It was so worrying to think we would n't be able to hold the event just because of something like insurance .
" It somewhat takes the magic out of it .
But at least we get to carry on and Santa can carry on spreading his Christmas cheer . "
Kelly Ostler , from the Association of British Insurers , said : " Premiums are set according to both the risk and the amount that the courts award for personal injury claims .
" Awards are rising by 10 per cent every year and this , coupled with the growing compensation culture , means that insurers are paying out more and more .
" We want people to be able to enjoy themselves while being protected against other people 's possible negligence .
" This is as much about protecting Santa from other drivers as protecting him from the speed of his sleigh . "
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
To listen to Big Oil executives , there 's no reason why a barrel of crude costs $ 80 .
But others say strong demand and limited supply justifies at least that much , and that the industry is clearly looking out for itself by saying oil is overvalued .
" No one has to wait at the gas pumps of the world .
There is no physical problem , " Jeroen van der Veer , head of Royal Dutch Shell , recently told reporters in Calgary .
" [ There 's ] a lot of psychology in the price . "
Van der Veer 's comments echoed those of Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson , who said earlier this month that he " cannot explain why we have $ 70 oil today .
We are not having trouble finding oil .
There is something else going on that I do n't get . "
Exxon declined to elaborate on Tillerson 's remarks , and a spokesperson for Shell was unavailable for comment .
But for some , the motivations behind the executives claims are clear .
" They have political motivations for trying to talk down the price of oil , " said Ken Carol , an oil company analyst at Johnson Rice & Co , a research and investment banking firm .
" If you were the favorite whipping boy of policy - makers , would n't you say the same thing , " said Mike Fitzpatrick , an analyst and trader on the energy desk at Man Financial in New York .
Previous spells of record - setting prices have prompted calls for a special tax on oil company profits , closing some tax loopholes , and even breaking up the big oil firms , such as Exxon Mobil ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , ConocoPhillips ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Chevron ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
This time around , politicians have been relatively quiet .
Oil passed the $ 80 a barrel mark last week as debate concluded on broad - ranging energy bills that include eliminating some oil industry tax breaks .
House and Senate negotiators are currently trying to reconcile the two bills .
In addition to hoping to duck further government action , the industry may also be trying to deflect criticism for what some say is a lack in investment in oil production and refining capabilities .
While oil companies do n't control the price of oil directly , they , along with OPEC , are largely responsible for the supply .
They are also responsible for building refineries that turn crude oil into usable products , such as gasoline and heating oil .
One analyst , who declined to be named , said the industry may be trying to shift attention away from the fact that no new refineries have been built in this country since 1976 .
The analyst said the oil companies would rather invest in drilling and production efforts rather than refining , where up until recently profit margins had been much lower .
A spokesman at the American Petroleum Council notes that capacity at existing refineries has expanded substantially , and says community opposition and environmental laws make building a new refinery difficult .
Timing has not helped the supply situation either .
Throughout most of the 1990s crude traded between $ 10 and $ 20 a barrel .
That left little money for new exploration and production projects .
Then the worldwide economy boomed in the early 2000s - and continues growing today .
" The economy is not giving the oil companies the time they need to bring new resources to market , " said Peter Beutel , an oil analyst at the consultancy Cameron Hanover .
Even with today 's high prices , many oil companies return more cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends than they invest in exploration and production projects .
Although top oil executives feel $ 80 is too high , there 's an ongoing debate among experts as to whether that price is justified .
Since early 2000 the strong and growing oil demand in the U.S. and abroad with fairly static supplies is the main reason behind oil 's surge , according to most analysts .
Oil has gone from $ 20 in 2002 to over $ 80 today .
That price jump has also attracted lots of investors , which could be the " something else going on " that Tillerson believes is driving up prices .
" There 's clearly some financial players pushing up the price of crude , " said Carol of Johnson Rice & Co . " Given the current supply - demand scenario , $ 80 is not justified . "
But opinions are split as to just how much speculative investors are driving crude prices .
Beutel notes that only 18 percent of the " long " contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange - meaning bets where the investor thinks the price of oil is going to go up - are held by investment funds .
Seventy five percent are held by people who actually use the oil .
Moreover , he said only 9 percent of the total contracts on Nymex are held by investment funds .
" I just do n't buy the ' speculators are doing it ' argument , " said Beutel .
Fitzpatrick , a speculator himself , said the investment premium on each barrel of oil is only about $ 4 or $ 5 .
The rest he said can be attributed to the fundamentals : " China is not going away , India is not going away , " he said .
" They are going to drink up this oil . "
So is there really a supply crunch or is it simply a case that speculators are driving up prices ?
While supply appears to be growing , much of it comes from OPEC .
That fact builds a risk premium into the price of crude .
Whether it should add up to $ 80 a barrel is clearly an ongoing debate .
The Energy Information Administration makes projections about how much extra oil the world has .
Known as spare production capacity , it 's the difference between what the world currently consumes and what it could produce .
That number has been quite small over the last couple of years , which only exaggerates the effects of geopolitical events - as there 's less extra oil to cover demand if supplies get disrupted .
The world currently consumes about 86 million barrels of oil per day , and EIA estimates current spare production capacity is about 2.17 million barrels a day .
Yet that 's projected to grow to 2.25 by the end of the year , and average 2.70 million barrels a day in 2008 - still tight , but not exactly supportive of the ' rising demand static supply ' scenario .
But maybe it is .
EIA economist Tancred Lidderdale said that all of that spare production capacity lies in OPEC countries , which could turn off the tap at anytime .
" Worldwide demand for petroleum is still growing faster than non -OPEC production " and that 's what caused the price run-up over the last four years , said Lidderdale .

Senate Bill 1959 to Criminalize Thoughts , Blogs , Books and Free Speech Across America
Mike Adams
Mike Adams at Newstarget.com says , “ The end of Free Speech in America has arrived at our doorstep .
It 's a new law called the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act , and it is worded in a clever way that could allow the U.S. government to arrest and incarcerate any individual who speaks out against the Bush Administration , the war on Iraq , the Department of Homeland Security or any government agency ( including the FDA ) .
The law has already passed the House on a traitorous vote of 405 to 6 , and it is now being considered in the Senate where a vote is imminent .
All over the internet , intelligent people who care about freedom are speaking out against this extremely dangerous law : Philip Giraldi at the Huffington Post , Declan McCullagh at CNET's News.com , Kathryn Smith at OpEdNews.com , and of course Alex Jones at PrisonPlanet.com . ”
Here is the Senate Bill 1959 link .
And here are some of the probable candidates for a long visit to Concentration Camps : Dennis Kucinich , Ron Paul , Al Gore , Senator Hillary Clinton , Senator Barack Obama , Senator Ted Kennedy and all the rest of those who protest Evil in its rankest form , the Satanic Bushites , and here are some of the minor offenses which are now not even misdemeanors which could land you forever ina prison cell or worse .
Good - Bye America , Hello Thomas Jefferson .
As I stated weeks ago I will lift no finger to help one single office - seeking politician .
That is correct , I will help politicans , no more forever , no donations , no letters , no phone calls , no errands , no cheer leading .
The vote in the Democratic controlled House to pass the bill was 405 to 6 .
To say we have been betrayed is an understatement .
If you give any money , time or help to anyone running for office you are a fool and an enemy of Freedom .
Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country , by neither supporting OT giving money or aid and comfort to the men and women who have betrayed us all .
Read the article , it describes what I wrote about and spoke about since 1974 , which is a bill that makes anyone who raises a voice in protest a criminal .
See what I wrote 6 years ago and republished several times since which is my custom even here on OpEdNews.com .

LETTERS TO & FROM TOM ENGELHARDT
What is more , Blackwater is seeking Land in Northeastern Illinois and several other places in the USA , which fulfills my prophecy of Blackwater coming here to do to use what they did to the innocent 1.5 million dead and the 4.5 million wounded , Iraqi ’s citizens .
THE shallow hole widens and a man comes together like a puzzle : hips , fingers , ribs , vertebrae , teeth and crushed skull .
A boot surfaces along with a rusted bullet clip .
But no dog tags , no wedding ring , nothing to give him a name , so the bones go into a box where they are marked with a number written in white chalk : 1,968 .
The one who filled the box is sweaty ; his after - shave fades amid the dirt and the dust .
His name is Erwin Kowalke .
The villagers know him by his determined face and trim graying beard and the way he moves from shovel , spade to hoe .
He collects the bones of the fallen from a world war that ended six decades ago , but one that , if you listen , still moans through the forests and across the marshes .
“ I once dug a whole plane out of a swamp .
The pilot was sitting in the cockpit .
His leather jacket was pretty well preserved even after all those years , but he was burned , ” said Kowalke , a volunteer who has excavated the remains of 20,000 people , most of them German and Russian soldiers killed in fighting as Berlin collapsed toward defeat in the final days of April 1945 .
The dead are hidden in this loamy earth , but they are his , and with quiet obsession he aims to find them , even if there are 20,000 more scattered beyond the windshield of his white station wagon , which bounces and swerves down forgotten country roads .

“ People tell me to just let the bones sleep in the woods , ” said Kowalke , a member of the German War Graves Assn . who has been searching for skeletons for 43 years .
“ But I say to them that no matter what this generation did , without them you would n’t be here .
“ In these bones you see what war is like .
I know war now .
I ’ll tell you what it is .
War is young men killing other young men they do not know on the orders of old men who know one another too well . ”
And so he digs , this compact 65 - year - old man with a briefcase holding ledgers of the dead and an amber - tinted photograph of his father , a German soldier killed somewhere in France .
What a boy did n’t have he invents ; the bones Kowalke collects honor his father and those days in 1944 when the man returned briefly from the front to visit his 3 - year - old son .
It was the last time they saw each other .
“ He was tall , ” said Kowalke , “ I still remember my small arms around his black boots .
He arrived home on June 3 and three days later it was D - day in Normandy and they called him back . ”

KOWALKE grew into a fidgety man with two daughters and five grandsons ; his wife , Gisela , calls him a “ restless pensioner . ”
His coveralls are neat and pressed and his boots , like those he recalls on his father , are shiny , as if each new day , despite the grime to come , must be faced with a meticulous spirit .
When he brushes the dirt from a bone , he speaks of where joints and cartilage connect , and then his eyes , pale blue and flecked with brown , scan the parts of a man he never knew for clues to who he was .
He conjures old battles as if they ’ve happened just last week , of how the Germans moved and how the Russians countered ; for him history lies about 36 inches beneath the ground , the depth where he finds most of his bones .
The land he scours these days rolls out from the soldiers ’ cemetery in the town of Halbe toward the Polish border , about 30 miles south of Berlin .
In this terrain thick with pine and broken by lakes and creeks , two Russian divisions closed in like pincers on the trapped 9th German Army .
Tens of thousands died and the bodies of infantrymen were stacked along roadsides shadowed by starving dogs and storms of swirling flies .
Many were burned .
Some were pushed into bomb craters , others were flung into rough graves dug by men in a hurry .
The dead were lost , except their bones .
Kowalke gathers them in black cardboard boxes the size and shape of an infant ’s coffin that he delivers to the cemetery .
The earth claims much after 60 years , and if there are no identifying signs tangled amid the ribs , the bones are reburied , sometimes in a small ceremony , and given a marble marker that says : Unknown .

That mystery bothers Kowalke .
Unknown .
He hates the sound .
But names often do survive , on zinc and aluminum dog tags , strangely preserved papers , trinkets zipped into shaving kits and in letters scratched on helmets .
“ We identified one soldier awhile back .
His 92 - year - old widow from Berlin came to the cemetery in Halbe , ” Kowalke said .
“ When I saw that old woman in a wheelchair holding the box of bones that were her husband and saying , ‘ Oh , Werner , I know where you are .
Now , I can have peace , ’ I knew that what I do matters . ”
He seems to understand that a man often finds his calling by chance .
After the war ended , his mother married a farmer ; Kowalke grew up in the fields , apprenticed as a carpenter and later worked as a machinist for irrigation equipment .
He knew the land , from the winter fields to the river grass .
He unearthed his first German soldier in 1963 , when his wife ’s father , who had asthma , asked him to help with some digging .

Until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , the work went on quietly ; the Soviet - backed leaders of East Germany did n’t much care whether Hitler ’s army received a proper resting place .
German fascist aggression killed millions of Russians and instigated the Holocaust -- why , the thinking went , should the German army be granted even a semblance of respect ?
“ I excavate Russian soldiers too , ” Kowalke said .
“ Some Germans get mad at me for that .
They say , ‘ How can you do it ?
Look what the Russians did to us . ’
But I tell them , ‘ Do n’t forget history .
It was the Germans who marched into Poland and started all this . ’
“ It does n’t matter whether they ’re Russian or German to me .
The dead deserve a bit of honor .
They were mostly all young , you know .
I can tell how old they were when I hold their bones .
Bones have a different feel at different ages . ”
Kowalke is , perhaps , the most frequent visitor to the cemetery .
He knows it well , remembers how it flowed from a church graveyard and spread through the forest , taking shape the way a knitted shawl grows from a bag of yarn .
He looked toward the tree line ; beyond , cars raced north and south on the autobahn , their sounds a soft , distant thrum in a cemetery where rows read like this : Gottfried Puchinger , 5/7/1920 to April 1945 .
Unknown .

“ I do n’t judge the dead , ” Kowalke said , “ but God knows them all . ”
HE has delved all over the east German map , but he has also turned soil from Romania to the Balkans , and is mystified by the breadth of a war that scattered German bones , and those of millions of others , across countries and continents .
Collecting them all may never happen .
Kowalke works with 20 or so other volunteer diggers , but the war veterans are dying out and the desire to remember , long a sensitive topic in Germany , has faded with younger generations .
On a clear morning not long ago , Kowalke left the cemetery to dig a shallow hole in a stand of pine at the rim of a farm field .
He had gotten a call from the guys with metal detectors who hunt for munitions and bombs .
The woods are full of unexploded things -- bullets , grenades and tank shells .
But there was something else out there , a faint ping as if from a belt buckle or a button .
Kowalke arrived in his car and the guys nodded ; he is like them , a scavenger of sorts .
They pointed .
Kowalke worked his spade , slicing it easily into soil marbled with sand and clayish dirt .
He broke shallow roots , breathing through his nose , finding a rhythm , muscles hardening beneath his zip - up fading green coveralls .
Scrape , scrape , plunk .

“ A bone , ” he said .
He pulled up a dark clump , a boot , German by make he could tell because of the nail studs in the heel .
He lifted more , a shin bone .
He brushed the dirt from it , put it into the box .
He took his shovel , but went slower ; the strange , dark harvest came .
“ I ’d say he was between 30 to 35 years old .
No doubt he was a German , ” said Kowalke , holding the jawbone and examining the teeth .
“ Russians did n’t have these kinds of fillings .
Given his age , you have to assume he was married and probably had children .
They probably never knew where he ended up . ”
More digging .
An ammunition clip , then another .
And then a crushed skull , breaking apart in Kowalke ’s hands .
He took a hoe , raked the dirt for small bits .
Advertisement
“ I ca n’t think about who he was or might have been , ” he said .
“ It ’s better not to speculate , but concentrate on details . ”
His hands work the soil , his fingers like rippling sieves .
But nothing , nothing he had hoped for ; no dog tags , no ring , no rifle , no wisp of identity .
Kowalke piled the bones into the box and carried it to his car .
He measured arm and leg bones and determined that “ this man was 1 meter 68 centimeters tall .
All of him fits in a small box . ”
He opened his briefcase , pushed aside the picture of his father and filled out the death ledger .
By the space for a name he wrote 1,968 .
He stapled the lid on and slid the box into his car .
He rubbed the dirt from his hands and drove toward the cemetery , and another marble marker chiseled with the word : Unknown .

Prince Harry 's hopes of seeing active service as an Army officer in Afghanistan are in doubt amid mounting concern over casualty levels among British troops .
In addition to two deaths in the last week , Army sources have revealed that a single infantry battalion recently saw around a dozen of its soldiers airlifted back to Britain suffering critical injuries within a three - week period .
In addition , other soldiers suffered less serious battlefield wounds treated at field hospitals .
Insiders say the intensity of fighting against the Taliban has risen markedly in recent weeks , as Nato forces try to drive the insurgents out of key areas across Helmand Province where most UK forces are located .
The head of the Army General Sir Richard Dannatt announced last month that he was cancelling Prince Harry 's planned deployment to southern Iraq at the last minute , due to fears that his presence would attract more attacks from insurgents and put his fellow - soldiers in greater danger .
The Mail revealed alternative plans for the 22 - year - old prince to be sent on a low - profile trip to Afghanistan later in the summer , to carry out relatively safe tasks such as training the Afghan security forces .
But the level of violence in Helmand Province raises questions over whether the Prince would be any safer in Afghanistan than he would be in Iraq .
According to insiders around a dozen soldiers from the 1st Battalion the Royal Anglian Regiment had to be evacuated to Britain by air in the first three weeks of May after suffering severe injuries .
Several had lost limbs , while others were critically injured by shrapnel from roadside bombs or rocket - propelled grenades .
The gruelling casualty rate comes amid intensive fighting in several areas , including the southern frontier town of Garmsir which controls a key Taliban supply route from neighbouring Pakistan , and the area around the strategically vital Kajaki hydroelectric dam in the north of the province where Nato forces launched a fresh offensive last week .
Five Britons have been killed in the last month and a total of 31 casualties were flown home to Britain in the first two weeks of May - matching the figure for the whole of April .
The most recent British fatalities were Corporal Darren Bonner , aged , 31 , of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment who was killed by a roadside bomb last Monday , and Corporal Mike Gilyeat , 28 , of the Royal Military Police who was among seven men who died when a U.S. Chinook helicopter crashed near Kajaki on Wednesday .
Ominously , officials have admitted the Chinook may have been shot down by Taliban fighters - the first such loss in Helmand .
Chinooks are in constant use to shuttle British troops and supplies around the sprawling province and a successful attack from the enemy on the ground would be a disturbing development .
Last month British officers serving in Afghanistan admitted they were fighting an " undeclared war " against Iranian - backed militias , equipped with increasingly sophisticated and effective weaponry and tactical skills .
Although UK forces have defeated the Taliban in every battle and skirmish to date , at times they have come perilously close to disaster , commanders admit .
British and Nato forces have the huge advantage of air power but they lack the manpower needed to hold wide areas of territory for long periods , meaning that the Taliban often return to areas when UK troops withdraw , and often the same ground has been fought over many times .
Prince Harry , a cornet or 2nd Lieutenant in the Blues and Royals Regiment , had originally hoped to spend six months leading a 12 - strong armoured reconnaissance patrol in the deserts of Iraq .
But intelligence reports of planned attempts to assassinate or kidnap him forced senior defence chiefs to cancel his deployment at the last minute , and his men are now being led by a stand - in officer .
A final decision over whether he can serve in Afghanistan will not be taken for some weeks , according to insiders .
Despite the fierce fighting in Helmand a range of options remain open , including sending Harry to work at the Nato headquarters in the capital Kabul , which remains relatively safe .
He could also be given a role at the Camp Bastion , the main British base in Helmand which is located in remote desert , and has so far not come under direct attack .
The Pirate Bay is without a doubt the most popular BitTorrent tracker .
Unfortunately their current tracker system is not performing as it used to and has reached its effective limit .
The TPB team is currently working on a more efficient Open Source tracker system that , among other things , will guarantee better protection against anti-piracy outfits .
Some of you might have noticed that the Pirate Bay trackers were down for a couple of hours today .
The reason for the downtime is not related to an anti-piracy organization this time , on the contrary .
TPB has moved its servers to a new datacenter and added some extra servers to their already pretty impressive server lineup .
The tracker currently runs on 12 servers , and 4 brand new ones will be added later today .
Adding new servers is not the only reason for the move of course .
The new datacenter has better routers which handle their requirements better .
It allows TPB to install better protection against DDoS attacks and nullrouting the spam-nets from anti-piracy organizations .
However , a complete overhaul of the current tracker system is needed to ensure the future effectiveness of the tracker and to ensure protection against spammers and fake torrents .
According to the tracker design page , this new tracker will be capable of blocking and / or logging known p2p vandals such as MediaDefender , BayTSP , MediaSentry and EZ2net .
The new tracker will ensure the privacy of its users and is designed to be as efficient as possible , meaning more peers with less bandwidth .
TiAMO , one of the developers of the new tracker system told TorrentFreak that they are still looking for skilled coders who want to join the Open Source project and help the BitTorrent community .

" He that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . "
( Luke 22:36 KJV )
Most of us are aware that the heroic actions of a brave woman at the New Life Church in Colorado Springs , Colorado a few days ago saved the lives of perhaps scores , or even hundreds , of people .
However , her bravery would not have counted for much had she not been armed .
On that fateful December Sunday , a man by the name of Matthew Murray entered the church armed to the teeth .
According to press reports , he was armed with a semi-automatic rifle , two handguns , some smoke grenades , and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition .
By the time Murray arrived in the Colorado Springs church , he had already killed four people : two at a missionary training center miles away , and two in the church parking lot .
He had wounded several others .
No one realized it at the time , but the man was a serial killer in the midst of a rampage .
He doubtless planned to kill as many people as he could , as there were thousands of people inside the church .
Had there not been an armed citizen in the church house , the death toll would have been massive .
According to church spokesmen , the congregation has over a dozen members who volunteered to serve as security personnel for the church .
Jeanne Assam was one of those volunteers .
A former police officer , Assam said , " I saw him [ Murray ] coming through the doors , and I took cover , and I waited for him to get closer .
I came out of cover , I identified myself and engaged him and took him down . "
Murray died in the exchange .
Although Assam shot him several times with her 9 mm pistol , the coroner 's office said that Murray actually succumbed to a self - inflicted gunshot wound .
After being incapacitated by Assam 's gunfire , Murray apparently turned one of his weapons on himself .
Chalk one up for the good guys , or in this case , good gals .
Have you noticed how the media dropped the Colorado story as soon as it was discovered that a lawfully armed citizen ended the potential massacre by using her own handgun ?
Had the killer been successful in murdering scores of people , however , it would have been at the top of the news for weeks .
As it is , the story is already buried in the dungeon section of the news , if it is in the news at all .
One thing the national news media will always ignore is the practice of lawful self - defense .
For example , most people are probably not aware of the fact that American citizens use a firearm to defend themselves more than 2.4 million times EVERY YEAR .
That is more than 6,500 times EVERY DAY .
This means that , each year , firearms are used 60 times more often to protect the lives of honest citizens than to take lives .
Furthermore , of the 2.4 million self - defense cases , more than 192,000 are by women defending themselves against sexual assault .
And in less than eight percent of those occasions is a shot actually fired .
The vast majority of the time ( 92 % ) , the mere presence of a firearm helps to avert a major crime from occurring .
That is what Congressman Roscoe Bartlett ( R - MD ) concluded after extensive research .
According to Rep. Bartlett , the number of defensive uses is four times the number of crimes reported committed with guns .
John Lott , senior research scientist at the University of Maryland , agrees with Bartlett .
His book " More Guns , Less Crime " documents the fact that -- instead of being a cause of crime -- firearms in the hands of private citizens are actually a major deterrent to crime .
Another fact conveniently ignored by the major media is the connection between wanton killings and so - called " gun-free " zones .
For an example of this , look no further than the Virginia Tech massacre .
In spite of Virginia state laws that allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for self - defense , Virginia Tech forbade its students and faculty from carrying weapons for self - defense on campus .
Had a student or faculty member been armed -- as was Ms. Assam in the Colorado Springs attack -- no doubt many , if not most , of the Virginia Tech victims would not have died .
Obviously , bad guys do not pay any attention to " gun-free " zones , except to note that such zones create a free - killing environment .
Is it any wonder that those states and cities with the most restrictive gun control laws tend to also be home to the highest crime rates ?
The old saying is still true .
" When guns are outlawed , only outlaws will have guns . "
There is another saying I like even better .
" When guns are outlawed , I will be an outlaw . "
Even our Lord understood and validated the right of every person to arm themselves for personal self - defense .
He said , " He that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one . "
( Luke 22:36 KJV ) The old Roman sword was the First Century equivalent of a modern handgun .
It was the most practical and convenient form of self - defense available at that time .
Also , please note that at least two of Jesus ' disciples ( one of whom was Simon Peter ) were in the habit of carrying their own personal swords , and Jesus never rebuked them .
( See Luke 22:38 . )
Jesus also acknowledged , " When a strong man ARMED [ emphasis added ] keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace . "
( Luke 11:21 ) Furthermore , the Apostle Paul said , emphatically , " But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel . "
( I Tim .
5:8 ) Does " not providing for his own " include not providing protection ?
Of course it does .
The right and , yes , obligation of personal self - defense is entrenched in both Christian and American tradition .
People who would deny citizens the right to arm themselves are either naïvely ignorant or deliberately duplicitous .
As Robert Heinlein said , " An armed society is a polite society . "
America 's Founding Fathers agreed with Heinlein .
Thomas Jefferson said , " No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . "
He also said , " Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . .
Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants ; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides , for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man . "
Samuel Adams said , " [ T ] he said Constitution [ shall ] be never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press , or the rights of conscience ; or to prevent the people of the United States , who are peaceable citizens , from keeping their own arms . "
James Madison said , " To preserve liberty , it is essential that the whole body of people always possess arms . "
Thomas Paine said , " [ A ]rms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe , and preserve order in the world as well as property . . .
Horrid mischief would ensue were the law - abiding deprived of the use of them . "
George Washington called the private collections of arms " the people 's liberty 's teeth . "
America must always preserve the right to keep and bear arms .
To do any less is to invite oppression and tyranny , not to mention acts of violence .
Some years back , Alan Rice of the Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership ( JPFO ) wrote , " Since 1900 at least seven major genocides have occurred resulting in the murder of 50 - 60 million people : * Ottoman Turkey , 1915 - 17 ; 1 - 1.5 million Armenians murdered ;
* Soviet Union , 1929 - 53 ; 20 million anti-Communists and anti-Stalinists murdered ;
* Nazi Germany & Occupied Europe , 1933 - 45 ; 13 million Jews , Gypsies , and Anti-Nazi murdered ;
* China , 1949 - 52 , 1957-60 & 1966-1976 ; 20 million anti-Communists murdered ;
* Guatemala , 1960 - 1981 ; 100,000 Mayan Indians murdered ;
* Uganda , 1971 - 1979 ; 300,000 Christians and Political Rivals of Idi Amin murdered ;
* Cambodia , 1975 - 1979 ; 1 million murdered . "
Rice continued to say , " In all seven of the genocides summarized above , gun control laws were in force before the genocide occurred , in some cases decades before .
In five of the seven genocides , the lethal law , the gun control law was in force before the genocide regime took power . "
Rice also said , " Gun control laws are usually enacted during a crisis or a perceived crisis . "
He then said , " Government officials , not hate groups or common criminals , were responsible for these seven genocides .
In most of these cases the murder victims outnumbered their murderers ; yet they were powerless to defend themselves because they were disarmed . "
Do the math yourself .
Absent an armed citizen , 32 innocent people lost their lives at Virginia Tech , while the presence of 1 armed citizen resulted in 2 innocent deaths in Colorado Springs .
Furthermore , the presence of over 200 million firearms in the possession of the American people has done more to keep America free than any other human element - - bar none !
Therefore , to help keep your family safe and your country free , go buy a gun .

I do not believe it to be true , but as a very general , very broad statement , it does seem that intelligent people tend to be more depressed than ' other ' people .
Is it a case of " Ignorance is bliss " ?
I am ( despite popular belief ) quite intelligent but I am not depressed , but I do lack some social skills depending upon my company .
----------------------------------------------
smart people over think life and it causes them stress and other complications , this happens to me sometimes , and my mates who lack a higher level of thinking cruise through their lives just rolling with the punches and smiling .
----------------------------------------------
Yes - because intelligent people can see past the sugar coated world and into the corrupt truth , when you see how ugly things in the world really are , you tend to be a bit dissillusioned and depressed .
----------------------------------------------
not so much intelligence , but over thinking .
----------------------------------------------
I imagine it 's not so much being intelligent , as thinking too much about things you cannot change .
----------------------------------------------
Now , whilst I think it is true , that intelligent people do seek out " the truth " and that seeing it can sometimes lend itself towards disillusionment , I think that to use this as a reason ( I prefer the word excuse ) for depression is wrong .
If you are intelligent enough to see the truth about things , then you should be intelligent enough to do something about it , to make your world ( note , I said " your " world , I 'm not talking greenpeace here ) better .
---------------------------------------------
I have a fair degree of intelligence ( apparently my IQ indicates I am a genius , but I 'd take that with a pinch of salt ) , I am hardly ever depressed .
However , a few years ago I was often depressed / angry with almost every facet of life .
Then one day I decided to stop watching the news , within a few weeks of not knowing what was going on I was a lot happier .
I have since taken this one step further and actively avoid any news of any kind ( when I refer to news , I mean mass media style news ) .
So in my case ignorance is bliss .
----------------------------------------------
In terms of the more intelligent people searching for the real meaning into things ( ie not taking them at face value ) , this combined with empathy is a killer .
Nothing like knowing the world is a terrible place but then caring too much about the things in it .
----------------------------------------------
yeah , it can be depressing to know how people work , what motivates them to be utterly dumb , and what motivates people to strive , and it can be depressing to not have any power to change it .
----------------------------------------------
I do n't know about depression specifically , but it is well documented throughout history that the geniuses of this world - Da Vinci , Einstein , etc suffered from psychological illnesses , including depression .
It 's also been documented that people of higher IQ are more prone / susceptible to these illnesses as well .
----------------------------------------------
The more you know .. the more you realise how *$ %ed up everything is .
And how little you can do to fix it .
----------------------------------------------
I really do n’t feel as though it 's the intelligence of the person that defines whether they are more prone to depression or not .
I feel it ’s more about that individual ’s strength of mind .
----------------------------------------------
The strength of an individual ’s mind has an impact on how easily they can become depressed , but does not cause the depression itself .
What we are saying is that because the intellect 's mind is so open to worldly things , and because they understand / interpret so much more , this makes them more susceptible to depression .
----------------------------------------------
I have way too much empathy and can feel other people 's pain more than is healthy .
I really do wish I could be just a little bit more cold and uncaring , as I am way too empathetic at the moment .
I get angry and upset sometimes that I can't make things better for people - I gotta learn that 's the way it is .
----------------------------------------------
Possibly intelligence does equal depression .
However it appears that it is actually other things , such as a disappointment in others .
Dissatisfaction with the world around them .
And a sense of frustration at their inability to do anything about either .
Not intelligence .
----------------------------------------------
I guess when you spend more time with your intelligence , you tend not to socialise and share your thoughts and feelings .. so they are kept bottled up , causing ' over - thinking ' , loneliness and loss of hope ... which can be a cause of depression .
----------------------------------------------
sometimes I wish I was stupid and did n't know ****.
Perhaps I would be happier that way .
But then , I can see plenty of examples from dumb people who are depressed by all sorts of dilemmas ...
Hard to say who 's happier / more depressed than who .
Intelligent people can't try to be dumb and see if they are happier and vice versa .

Where was your absolutely favorite place to play as a kid ?
Chances are , it was a pillow fort , a tree house or anywhere but a traditional playground .
Moreover , studies have now shown that when children ’s play has an element of danger it is strangely more healthy than safe play .
What Are Adventure Playgrounds ?
In short , adventure play areas are places where children can create and modify their own environments , rather than relying on rigid equipment that only serves a limit set of programmed purposes :
“ In a sense , you and I have always played in ‘ adventure playgrounds . ’
We created a fort in the kitchen cabinets , jumped from couch to couch across oceans ; we snuck out through a hole in the fence to a new world .
We climbed trees and hid in bushes .
We played in the mud and the rain .
We chased each other , made secret worlds … ”
So How Did Adventure Playgrounds Get Started ?
Believe it or not , modern adventure playgrounds began with wastelands of World War II .
Designers then had the idea to institutionalize these spontaneous and accidental junk playgrounds .
Initially the principle point was to encourage a more natural form of play , but increasingly the emphasis has been on sustainability and hands - on building , allowing children to create and ‘ own ’ their playgrounds .
What Are the Benefits of Adventure Playgrounds ?
Reasonable risk can be healthy , according to those who support the adventure playground movement :
“ The opportunity to be able to access a rich play environment , and assess and take risks , is paramount for the healthy development of all children , physically , mentally , emotionally , socially and creatively . ”
We created spaces with whatever we could find around us .
Some of us played in abandoned buildings , or barns , or vacant lots between buildings , used what we found and made up stories of our lives to be .
Here you go , hammers , saws , nails , wood , tires , rope , cloth , whatever you can find .
Make it your own .
QUEENSFERRY ( Reuters ) -
The world ’s richest corporations and finest minds spend billions trying to solve the problem of carbon emissions , but three fishing buddies in North Wales believe they have cracked it .
They have developed a box which they say can be fixed underneath a car in place of the exhaust to trap the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming -- including carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide -- and emit mostly water vapor .
The captured gases can be processed to create a biofuel using genetically modified algae .
Dubbed “ Greenbox ” , the technology developed by organic chemist Derek Palmer and engineers Ian Houston and John Jones could , they say , be used for cars , buses , lorries and eventually buildings and heavy industry , including power plants .
“ We ’ve managed to develop a way to successfully capture a majority of the emissions from the dirtiest motor we could find , ” Palmer , who has consulted for organizations including the World Health Organisation and GlaxoSmithKline , told Reuters .
The three , who stumbled across the idea while experimenting with carbon dioxide to help boost algae growth for fish farming , have set up a company called Maes Anturio Limited , which translates from Welsh as Field Adventure .
With the backing of their local member of parliament they are now seeking extra risk capital either from government or industry : the only emissions they are not sure their box can handle are those from aviation .
CAPTURE RATE
Although the box the men currently use for demonstration is about the size of a bar stool , they say they can build one small enough to replace a car exhaust that will last for a full tank of petrol .
The world 's richest corporations and finest minds spend billions trying to solve the problem of carbon emissions , but three fishing buddies in North Wales believe they have cracked it .

The crucial aspect of the technology is that the carbon dioxide is captured and held in a secure state , said Houston .
Other carbon capture technologies are much more cumbersome or energy - intensive , for example using miles of pipeline to transport the gas .
“ The carbon dioxide , held in its safe , inert state , can be handled , transported and released into a controlled environment with ease and a minimal amount of energy required , ” Houston said at a demonstration using a diesel - powered generator at a certified UK Ministry of Transportation emissions test centre .
More than 130 tests carried out over two years at several testing centers have , the three say , yielded a capture rate between 85 and 95 percent .
They showed the box to David Hansen , a Labour MP for Delyn , North Wales , who is now helping them .
“ Based on the information , there is a clear reduction in emissions , ” Hansen told Reuters .
“ As a result , I ’m facilitating meetings with the appropriate UK government agencies , as we want to ensure that British ownership and manufacturing is maintained . ”
The men are also in contact with car - makers Toyota Motor Corp of Japan and General Motors Corp. of the United States .
Houston said they have also received substantial offers from two unnamed Asian companies .
Both Toyota and General Motors declined to comment .
SECRETS
If the system takes off , drivers with a Greenbox would replace it when they fill up their cars and it would go to a bioreactor to be emptied .
Through a chemical reaction , the captured gases from the box would be fed to algae , which would then be crushed to produce a bio-oil .
This extract can be converted to produce a biodiesel almost identical to normal diesel .
This biodiesel can be fed back into a diesel engine , the emptied Greenbox can be affixed to the car and the cycle can begin again .
The process also yields methane gas and fertilizer , both of which can be captured separately .
The algae required to capture all of Britain ’s auto emissions would take up around 1,000 acres
.
The three estimate that 10 facilities could be built across the UK to handle the carbon dioxide from the nearly 30 million cars on British roads .
The inventors say they have spent nearly 170,000 pounds ( $ 348,500 ) over two years developing the “ three distinct technologies ” involved and are hoping to secure more funding for health and safety testing .
Not surprisingly , the trio wo n’t show anyone -- not even their wives -- what ’s inside the box .
After every demonstration they hide its individual components in various locations across North Wales and the technology is divided into three parts , with each inventor being custodian of one section .
“ Our three minds hold the three keys and we can only unlock it together , ” said Houston .
The Rule of 72 is an Easy Way to Calculate How Long it Takes for Your Money to Double
If you want to quickly determine how long it will take for your money to double , the rule of 72 is all you need .
Most people generally understand the concept of compound interest , knowing that over time , interest earned will begin to snowball and accumulate more rapidly .
Even though it is a relatively simple concept , visualizing how it works can be more difficult .
I think Albert Einstein said it best :
Compound interest is the greatest mathematical discovery of all time .
So , what is the Rule of 72 and what does it have to do with compound interest ?
The rule simply states that if you divide 72 by the interest rate , it will tell you how long it takes for your money to double .
For example , assume you earn a 6 % rate of return on your money .
To find out how long it takes for your initial amount of money to double , just do the simple calculation : 72 / 6 percent = 12 years .
It does n’t matter if you have a starting balance of $ 500 or $ 50,000 , if you earned a real rate of return of 6 % each year , you will double your money after 12 years .
Table of Returns
This table should highlight the importance of squeezing the most out of your money .
If you notice , your checking or savings account at the bank earning 1 % , by keeping your money there and you ’ll need 72 years to double it .
But , if you can manage to even get 3 % on that money , you can shave 48 years from that goal .
Even a modest 7 % return will allow you to double your money in just over 10 years .
Even more impressive is when you consider the higher rates of return .
For instance , if your investments are in the market during 5 good years and you can realize around a 14 % return , you will double your money in that same period .
The Big Picture
For most people , the number of years to double your money seems like a long time .
Even at a modest 7 % return , that ’s just over 10 years .
Well , it may seem like a long time , but this is where you have to really take into account the power of compounding over the long term .
Let ’s use an example of a 25 year old who has $ 10,000 saved up in a retirement account .
For simplicity , let ’s say that the account is earning 7.2 % per year , so according to the Rule of 72 , the money will double every 10 years .
As you can see , it starts out kind of slow .
By age 35 , it might not feel like much to have $ 20,000 saved up .
But as the decades pass , the numbers accelerate in value as they double , to a point where by retirement , a measly $ 10,000 has turned into over $ 150,000 .
Money begets more money over time .
Also keep in mind , this is simply using a single lump - sum with no additional money being saved .
When you consider that most people would be continuously adding money to this investment , the rate of compounding goes up significantly .
Some Caveats
Keep in mind that the Rule of 72 is just a guideline .
Clearly , in the real world you ’ll almost never have a constant interest rate unless your investment is in a long - term fixed income vehicle .
In addition , you will want to consider the impact of taxes and inflation on your results .
This rule is simply a tool to help illustrate the impact that time and rate of return has on your money .
Remember , time can be either your greatest asset , or your worst enemy .
The sooner you start , even if by just a small amount , it will provide more time for your money to compound .
On the other hand , every passing week , month , or year is time that you can never get back .
It is up to you to decide if you want time to be on your side or working against you .

Decking & Deck Building
Decking an outside area of your home can have several benefits .
Decking is often much easier to install than patio flags and can enable most people to enjoy outdoor living , such as dining outside or sunbathing .
Building a deck is relatively easy and can easily be accomplished by those with a little DIY experience .
Here in the decking section you will find the information you need that will show you step by step how to complete your own deck building project .
Before planning your deck it is advisable to check with your local building control to see if any permission is required for building the deck .
Building regulations change regularly and decking has been included in some of the building regulations , so it is advisable to check before starting to build the deck .
Stevie Wonder Mounts Rare Concert Tour ( Photos and Video )
, has mounted his first extended tour in 12 years .
After nearly 4 decades of providing his fans with soul , funk , reggae and more , he is back on center stage with his daughter , who is providing backup singing for her father .
The singer 's 2 - 1/ 2 hour show features an 11 piece band and a mix of Wonder 's hit songs .
The singer performed in Charlotte earlier this week to an appreciative audience .
A concert reviewer indicated that his voice is still in incredible shape .
Wonder , blind at infancy , signed on with Motown Records at age 12 .
He has recorded more than 30 top hits , has won 25 Grammy 's , won an Academy Award for Best Song and also won a Lifetime Achievement award and has been indicted into the Rock and Roll and Songwriters halls of fame .
He has sold over 100 million albums .
Quite an impressive history .
So why does he want to mount another tour ?
His mother passed away last year and the singer says that it is her spirit that has lead him back to the stage .
We included a music video of Steve Wonder performing Superstition with Prince on November 17 , 2007 at Madison Square Garden in NYC .

DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Doug Warner seems like a stereotypical Republican : Southern , white , male , he served in the military , drives an SUV and likes hunting and fishing .
Doug Warner ( L ) and his partner Truman Smith , who works as a private consultant and is the president of Log Cabin 's South Carolina chapter , pose in this undated handout photo in Charleston , South Carolina .

He is also openly gay .
Warner ’s sexual orientation makes for an awkward fit in a party with a powerful evangelical Christian wing that regards homosexuality as a sin and same - sex marriage as a threat to the traditional family .
“ I believe that the approach of the social extremists eliminates our party ’s ability to grow in the future , ” he told Reuters by phone from his home in Charleston , South Carolina .
For years , bashing the “ homosexual agenda ” worked well for Republicans .
In 2004 , the party placed anti-gay marriage referendums on 11 state ballots .
All passed by large majorities and the tactic boosted turnout among religious conservatives , helping President George W. Bush win re-election .
But times may be changing .
The leading Republican candidate for 2008 is former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani who supports gay rights , including “ domestic partnerships ” and equal rights under the law .
Republicans were embarrassed this summer when one of their most outspoken anti-gay spokesmen , Idaho Sen .
Larry Craig , pleaded guilty to lewd behavior in an airport bathroom , having apparently made a homosexual advance to an undercover agent .
Craig has since tried and failed to rescind his guilty plea , saying he was panicked into a confession .
All the major Democrats in the race believe workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation should be outlawed and back full equality in civil unions .
Much of the organized gay community has long been an integral part of the Democratic base .
Meanwhile conservative gays have felt they had no place to go .
Warner ’s concern about his party ’s direction has led him to become an active member in a growing movement of conservative gays called the Log Cabin Republicans .
It claims to have 20,000 members nationwide with over 40 official chapters .
Interviews with several Log Cabin Republicans revealed a familiar refrain : disappointment with a party seen betraying its commitment to fiscal prudence and limited government .
“ Somewhere along the way our party was hijacked by the social extremists who say that government needs to regulate things that were once considered private , ” said Warner ’s partner Truman Smith , who works as a private consultant and is the president of Log Cabin ’s South Carolina chapter .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
“ If we believe in lower taxes and less government , what are we going to do ?
Become Democrats ? , ” he asked .
While the organization is not endorsing a presidential candidate for 2008 , Giuliani is clearly their favorite .
GIULIANI ALONE
This is hardly surprising as he is pointedly alone in the Republican field in his support for gay rights .
And it suggests the party may be more diverse than its image suggests .
“ I think it is refreshing to see a prominent Republican who is supportive of our issues doing so well , ” said Noel Freeman , who is head of Log Cabin ’s Houston chapter .
Gay Republican activists say the party needs to expand its base if it wants to remain relevant by shedding its anti-abortion and anti-gay rights platforms and aiming for the political center on social issues .
“ I ’m afraid that the Republican Party is going to make itself so pure that it will be able to meet in a phone booth , ” said Freeman .
Some say the party ’s loss of both houses of Congress in the mid-term elections last year shows it needs to change course .
“ When we make social issues our priority then the Republican party loses independents and swing voters and loses elections , ” said Jimmy LaSalvia , Log Cabin ’s grassroots outreach director .
Under Bush , the party took a different tack .
His top political strategist Karl Rove , who resigned earlier this year , maintained that the way to win elections was to mobilize the country ’s 60 million evangelicals and get them to the polls .
There has long been tension between the party ’s religious wing and those who favor low taxes , free markets , fiscal responsibility and a government that stays out of their personal lives .
The Log Cabin Republicans , formed in 1977 , are just one vocal strand of the party ’s more moderate side .
It takes its name from Abraham Lincoln ’s humble origins and says it aims to bring the party back to its inclusive roots .
Its influence is obviously limited by its small though growing numbers .
The South Carolina chapter for example was formed just three years ago but now numbers in the hundreds .
The Justice Department did another document dump yesterday on the US Attorneys scandal .
I bet all those Nixonian cronies in the Bush Administration long for the " good ole days " of the pre-Internets 70s .
Within minutes of their release , bloggers were poring over them , fact - checking them against public statements and filling in the tentacles of influence .
TPMmuckraker :
The Justice Department turned over yet more documents to Congress today -- documents which seem to show that Alberto Gonzales ' chief of staff Kyle Sampson was responsible for misleading Congress about Karl Rove 's role in replacing a U.S. attorney .
On February 23 , acting Assistant Attorney General wrote Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and other senators in response to questions about the appointment of Timothy Griffin , a former aide to Rove .
In the letter , Hertling stated " The Department is not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the decision to appoint Mr. Griffin . "
But emails subsequently released by the Justice Department showed that was n't the case .
Last December , for example , Sampson wrote in an email that Griffin 's appointment was " important to Harriet , Karl , etc . "
Other emails showed that Rove 's deputy had been intimately involved in the effort to get Griffin installed as the U.S. Attorney in Eastern Arkansas .
In a letter accompanying documents sent to Congress today , Hertling admits that the assertion in his letter is n't true , adding , " We sincerely regret any inaccuracy . "
And to answer questions about who was responsible for that inaccuracy , he accompanied his letter with 202 pages documents " reflecting the preparation and transmittal of the February 23 letter . "
Among the documents is a February 8th email from Kyle Sampson providing what ultimately , with a few small revisions , comprised Hertling 's letter .
And in that email Sampson wrote that Hertling should say , " I am not aware of Karl Rove playing any role in the Attorney General 's decision to appoint Griffin . "
Update : Read the exclusive interview we conducted with the sign
As you drive down Sunset Blvd.eastbound toward Vermont you might see a yellow sandwich board sign at the corner of Edgemont advertising what seems to be a dozen roses for $ 4 .
Since the area has several hospitals ( Kaiser , Children's , Hollywood Pres ) , such a deal would seem like the sort of hidden gem that you 'd expect LAist to share with you .
But the sign is hiding a dark secret .
In fact it hopes that you see it in the dark .
It relies on the fact that you will see it obscured in traffic .
This is not a scientific comparison , but when i saw one scene I remembered another .
This is the recent scene : yesterday afternoon , Naha airport , Okinawa , Japan .
Line crew gassing up a Cirrus SR22 :
Details to notice below : crew identically dressed in company uniform ; complete safety gear -- hardhats , reflective chest straps with procedural checklist clipped on , puffy protective cuff to shield the plane 's wing from damage .
It 's hard to see in the picture , but even the boots are part of the uniform : black , with red laces , and company logos on the back .
Impossible to see in the picture : the coordinated shout and semi-bow toward the plane when the fueling was done .
Now , the scene I remembered and mentioned last year : Refueling the same kind of plane in Changsha , capital of Hunan Province , China .
With usual caveats against sweeping generalization , what this made me think was : Japan is all about the way of doing things .
Practice , ritual , perfectionism , as much fanatical attention to the process as to the result .
China is all about finding a way to do things .
Improvisation , little interest in rules , putting up with whatever is necessary to attain the result .
( Yeah yeah yeah , there are exceptions : perfectionist operations in China , loosey - goosey ones in Japan .
Still . )
At the moment , I am feeling positive toward both approaches .
The emphasis on the right way of doing things is re-surprising on each encounter with Japan .
And the determination to do things in China , no matter what , commands respect , despite the obvious complications and problems it creates .
But when it comes to refueling the plane ....

It ’s the relationship you spend more time on than any other .
It has deepened even during the past few years .
When things go wrong , you become enraged and tearful and attack inanimate objects — but you ’re willing to spend hours making things right .
Obviously , we ’re talking about your relationship with your personal computer .
Consider this :
In a survey earlier this year , 64 percent of Americans say they spend more time with their computer than with their significant other .
Meanwhile , 84 percent said they were more dependent on their computer than they were three years ago .
Probing emotions
Those were just a couple of the recently released findings from a consumer survey conducted in January for SupportSoft Inc. , a firm in Redwood City , Calif. , that makes software for computer help desks .
Anthony Rodio , the firm ’s chief marketing officer , said SupportSoft commissioned the survey to test the waters before getting into the consumer market .
They were surprised , Rodio said , to find that computer problems could unleash such powerful emotions .
When confronted with a dead computer , 19 percent admitted to wanting to hurl it out the nearest window , 9 percent felt stranded and alone , 11 percent used language normally reserved for special occasions , 7 percent did so loudly , 3 percent did so tearfully and 3 percent additionally vented their wrath on inanimate objects .
( They were not asked about animate targets — it was a survey , not a police blotter . )
On the other hand , a healthy 32 percent said that they basically shrugged .
The respondents ( who were all over 18 , owned a PC and enjoyed broadband Internet access ) estimated they spent an average of 12 hours a month wrestling with computer problems .
Unsurprisingly , 48 percent said they would rather help a friend move than deal with a computer problem .
Thirty percent said they currently felt more frustration with their computer than they felt three years ago .
Results
Rodio said that , after digesting the results , his firm decided that people were looking for support and empathy during their times of computer troubles .
So SupportSoft made the decision not to follow the example of the service firms that use “ geek ” and “ nerd ” in their business names , and instead touted their staff as supportive and caring “ computer therapists . ”
They simply named their consumer service “ support.com . ”
“ At this point we can barely hire enough people to keep up with the business , ” Rodio told LiveScience .
As for those people spending more time with their computers than with their animate partners , “ The computer is a nice tool , but using one is not the same as face - time , ” he said .
“ Closing the laptop would be a good thing now and then . ”

( Fortune ) --
With the S&P down over 10 % from its October record high , TV pundits and Wall Street strategists are blaming the most obvious culprits for the sudden reversal of fortune , chiefly the subprime crisis and the looming threat of a recession .
But it 's neither the credit crunch , nor a slowing economy -- nor a third hobgoblin , the weak dollar -- that pushed the markets into correction territory Monday .
The real reason is so basic , and so antithetical to Wall Street 's habitual happy talk about stocks , that it barely rates a mention in the market chatter .
Put simply , stocks are extremely expensive relative to the daunting risk in owning them .
At current prices , earnings can't possibly grow fast enough to give investors the fat returns they covet .
There 's just one way for equities to get their lustre back -- their prices have to fall substantially so that investors can harvest attractive returns from the modest profit growth that 's in the cards .
Like the biblical sheik who hastens to Samarra to escape death , only to find death waiting for him there , stocks have an inescapable appointment with a withering fate .
Naturally , stocks could bubble back to their old heights in the next few weeks or months .
If the recent past proves anything , it 's that the course of equity prices is totally unpredictable from day to day or quarter to quarter .
As the economist Milton Friedman once told me , after returning my call collect , " Stock prices are rational in the long - term , but in the short - term , they 're far from rational .
They 're full of noise . "
But do n't let the Wall Street crowd fool you into thinking that the current decline is mostly noise , an irrational blip in a bull market caused by a spate of bad news .
What we 're probably witnessing is a massive , irreversible revaluation of stocks based on fundamentals .
The repricing machine is now in motion .
The smart money says it wo n't stop , despite feints and lurches , until stocks are a bargain again , a prospect investors have n't seen in years .
Why are stocks at a probable turning point ?
The reason is that investors ' perception of the potential perils of holding equities has changed substantially in the last few months .
In any major shift , it 's impossible to predict what the catalyst will be .
In this case , it was the subprime mess .
Again , subprime was the catalyst , not the cause .
It was n't just a crisis that would pass , as the pundits argued , but a flashing red warning that triggered a durable shift in investor psychology .
Before the credit crisis , investors took an incredibly blas� attitude toward risk .
Yields on junk bonds , corporate debt , and office buildings were at all - time lows .
Then subprime struck .
Suddenly , investors recognized that the rates on high - risk mortgages did n't come close to reflecting the high probability that homeowners would default on their mortgages .
So the prices of subprime paper plummeted .
The downward pull on prices spread to all types of fixed income securities , from all types of junk bonds to LBO loans .
Now , the fear of risk is spreading to equities with a vengeance .
The problem with equities is that the repricing following the bubble of the late 1990s never fully played out .
Stocks roared back from their 2001 lows , reaching record levels this fall .
The rub is that they were , and still are , extremely expensive .
The best way to measure whether stocks are giving you enough juice for the risk you 're taking is examining the equity risk premium .
This is the ultimate number in corporate finance , what Dartmouth economist Kenneth French calls " the holy grail " of stock investing .
Let 's run through some simple math .
The best measure for the future return on stocks is the earnings yield , the inverse of the price - to - earnings ( PE ) ratio .
Today , the PE , based on trailing 12 month earnings , is around 16 .
That 's not too far above the historic average of 14 .
Even by that measure , stocks are far from cheap .
But the 16 PE is n't the whole story .
Earnings are now near a cyclical peak , having jumped more than 60 % since 2001 .
They 're now more than 12 % of GDP versus an historic average of around 9 % .
Over long cycles , earnings grow in tandem with GDP .
It 's likely that they will grow more slowly than national income over the next few years to restore the normal ratio .
That prediction makes sense :
Many of the factors that led to the earnings explosion are now shifting .
Rates for corporate borrowing have increased substantially , companies are being forced to invest far more capital equipment to remain competitive , and labor is demanding a bigger share of the pie .
To get a more accurate read on the PE , it 's critical to smooth earnings to take out the spikes in the cycle .
Yale economist Robert Shiller has developed a profits - smoothing formula that does just .
The Shiller model now puts the PE at around 22 or 23 , reflecting today 's sumptuous earnings .
So where does that put the equity risk premium ?
With a PE of 22 , the earnings yield is just 4.5 % .
So the return investors can expect from equities is 4.5 % plus expected inflation of 2.5 % , or around 7 % .
To get the equity risk premium , subtract that expected return from the 10 - year treasury rate of 4 % .
That 's the extra lift investors get for choosing the perils of holding stocks over the comfort of owning government bonds .
At 3 % , the equity risk premium is low by historical standards .
The recent decline has helped make it more attractive .
But the drop has n't gone far enough .
Over the past 50 years , the risk premium has averaged around 5 % .
Maybe investors do n't need that big a spread today , given the ease of diversifying portfolios and the Fed 's ability to smooth economic cycles .
So let 's say the number is now 4 % .
To get there , stocks still need to drop an additional 18 % .
The most dangerous sector is technology .
Just look at the lofty PE's .
The big names like Microsoft ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Intel ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) boast multiples of between 20 and 25 , yet they 're now giant , mature enterprises that , because of their sheer size , can't grow profits nearly fast enough to justify their high prices .
For the Googles and Yahoos , the outlook is far scarier .
Google 's PE now stands at 52 .
Say you 're expecting a 10 % a year return from Google ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) .
Its market cap would have to double to more than $ 400 billion by 2014 .
Even if Google kept a stellar PE of 30 , it would need to earn $ 13 billion by then .
Today , it earns about $ 4 billion .
So its profits would need to more than quadruple in seven years .
It wo n't happen .
For the bulls , the coup de grace is the math -- earnings growth cannot bail out the market .
The reason is that what really counts , earnings per share , do n't even grow as fast as GDP .
That 's because companies regularly issue more shares and dilute their current shareholders -- the explosion in stock options is only the most obvious example .
Because of the big dilution , earnings per share grow far more slowly than GDP ; the best estimate is around 2 % , adjusted for inflation .
Investors can't get fat returns from profit growth .
But they can get good returns from a combination of far higher dividend yields plus modest profit growth .
And for dividend yields to rise , prices have to drop .
That 's the inexorable math we now see playing out .
Forget the chatter , ignore the headlines , and follow the math .
Prices will get a lot more attractive .
The process is underway .
All investors have to do is wait .
PS : Yes , I know the Dow was up 331 points on Wednesday .
But that just gives the market even more room to fall .

When you say , “ Support the troops , ” what you really mean is “ Do n’t criticize this war . ”
When you say , “ Do n’t criticize this war , ” what you ’re really saying is , “ Fuck the troops . ”
I ’m an American .
I love my country and want the best for its future because it ’s my future , my family ’s .
There is no other country quite the same nor as free though I do n’t think it ’s nearly free enough but that ’s a cat for another skinning .
The troops are not protecting me , my family , or my country .
Iraq was no threat to the US .
The President , his puppeteers , and a chorus of sycophants filtered , distorted , and manipulated the information at hand to suggest otherwise .
It was lies .
You heard half of them yourself .
The whole incident , the whole cabal , will be remembered as a horrifying joke .
Historians will run races against James Buchanan , Andrew Johnson , Franklin Pierce , and George W Bush to select the worst US President in history .
The troops are not eliminating terrorism .
They are spawning it .
Massive amounts of it .
There were no terrorists to speak of in Iraq before the war .
It ’s now a breeding ground for it .
Just like Afghanistan was when Russia invaded there in 1979 and the CIA propped up freedom fighters .
One you know by name : Osama bin Laden.1
The troops are hurting me .
They ’re taking my tax dollars to live 6,000 miles away and expend expensive ordnance .
They ’re making it unsafe for me to lay my American passport down when I travel in places like Indonesia or Africa .
They ’re teaching the world that American soldiers can shoot an unarmed , wounded man to death on camera and it ’s not a crime .
They ’re implying to the world that I somehow support that instead of lynching the morons who get away with it .
The troops are hurting Iraq .
Hussein was a beast but he was , of late , a stable and relatively innocuous one .
The Baghdad morgue is taking in more than 1,000 murder victims a month and the number has been steadily rising since the war started .
It ’s also a minimum because many murders go unreported and unrecognized .
This is a single city in Iraq where 20,000 civilians will be murdered this year .
It will be called civil unrest but 20,000 dead in one city is a combination of anarchy and civil war .
In New York City , 1.6 times more populous than Baghdad , there will be around 600 murders this year .
The troops are decent men killing innocent people because the situation backs them into corners they can shoot through but ca n’t see around .
They ’re getting hammered with things that cause post traumatic stress in strong men .
As the news from Abu Ghraib , Ishaqi , Haditha , and even the American soil of Guantanamo Bay suggests , they ’re being turned into monsters by these forced situations .
Far above reasonable averages , they ’re coming home to divorces .
They ’re coming home unemployable , unable to function in normal society ; damaged goods , psychological splatter damage .
They ’re coming home to kill their wives .
They ’re coming home to kill themselves .
They ’re even coming home with the potential to be the exact thing they ’re supposedly stopping , the worst single terrorist we ’ve had .
The price you think the war is exacting on them is n’t just a couple of body bags stuffed in flag - wrapped oak boxes a day .
The price of this is a book of blank checks without so much as an expiration date .
Stop signing them .
Support the troops ?
Bring them the fuck home and give everyone who wants it an honorable discharge so they can get back to taking care of America in person .
Then everyone here could support them in ways that are n’t a twisted piece of jingoism tied to bumpers with yellow ribbons .
For the augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life .
It should be easier than ever to find great new books to read , but I find that finding great new books is almost hit or miss .
I ’ve stumbled upon too many good books on the recommendation of someone I ’ve sat next to on an airplane , or because I read a comment on a website somewhere .
I ’ve found as many good books from Amazon.com ‘s recommendation engines and related lists as I have anywhere else .
I ’m lukewarm on computer generated recommendations , though .
They always seem to point me to books I already know about and for good reason have chosen not to read , not to books that I do n’t know about and should .
Amazon does keep lists of bestsellers , award winners , and editor ’s picks , and these are always great things to mine for the next good thing .
The lists that the readers make are also quite good , and have often been a good way to explore a new author or topic .
LibraryThing is clearly trying to fill this space , but seems like a waste of time to me : like Amazon ’s automatic recommendations , but more difficult , since I have to enter in all of my books by hand .
I subscribe to the Sunday New York Times , and the book review section is always the first thing I read .
I never really find any books I ’m dying to read from its pages , though .
There are a few exceptions : I heard of The Road months before Oprah did .
But most of the time it just focuses on Important Books , like some new biography of Truman , and not books that anyone ever reads .
Ditto and more so for the New York Review of Books .
I have as many intellectual pretensions as the next man , but , really , snore .
As I ’ve mentioned before , I ’m a huge fan of my local library .
Through their web site I subscribe to several booklists that are managed by DearReader .
New Fiction , New SciFi , Hot Picks , etc .
Two of the magazines I make time for are Paste and The Week .
Both have very good book review sections , and editors who do n’t try to be too clever .
I found Raw Shark Texts through Paste , and a number of others , including The Ruins and The Keep , through The Week .
But it seems to me that a real opportunity is being lost .
I ’m a web2.0 kind of guy , but the way I find books are very 1980 - ish .
Why is n’t there a reddit type web2.0 site for books , where people can vote up books they like ?
Or something .
There has to be some way to connect people with the books they want to read , does n’t there ?

There ’s been quite a lot of Google talk of late , both out on the wild and wooly interweb and right here on this humble little blog .
It ’ll take a back seat , no doubt , to tomorrow ’s news , which will see Europa , the GPLv3 and the iPhone unleashed upon the waiting masses , but it ’ll pick back up .
Particularly if we do switch to Apps , because the testing experience thus far has been an interesting one .
Mostly positive , particularly on the migration front , but with the requisite ups and downs .
Most of that news is , of course , well documented .
Whether it ’s the release of Desktop on Linux ( CNET ’s got that ) , the introduction of IMAP migration ( I caught that one via Matt ) , or the rumors of a Grand Central acquisition ( saw it first on Google Operating System ) , someone ’s talking about it .
Even something you ’d think would be of interest only to a technical audience – Steve Yegge ’s port of Rails to Javascript – got a lot airtime .
What ’s gone under the radar , in my opinion , are Google ’s Linux repositories .
For once , it ’s not really Google that ’s the story here : it ’s the mainstreaming of the repository overlay approach .
This , as mundane and esoteric as it sounds , could be a significant development for commercial ISVs .
Confused ?
Let me explain .
For those of you unfortunate enough to never have had the benefit of using package management systems , my condolences .
From a users perspective , package management systems are revelatory the first time you use them .
“ You mean I do n’t have to go to a website , download some random file , and double click to install it ?
Or worry about keeping that application updated over time ?
It ’s like magic ! ”
Like any other sufficiently advanced technology , yes , yes it is .
Just like magic .
Or , in the words of Tim Bray , “ unreasonably f*** ing great . ”
These magical package management systems leverage , typically , community based repositories of , well , packages .
Each package tells the operating system important things like what it is , where it needs to be installed , and most critically – what else needs to be installed for it to run .
Lamentably , at least in Linux land , the packages themselves vary from distribution to distribution , in such a fashion that Debian , Fedora and Gentoo each need to have an Apache package maintainer , a MySQL package maintainer and so on .
In spite of this regrettably redundant effort , the repositories are broad and far more complete than any commercial equivalent , with even the smallest repositories typically containing packages numbering in the thousands .
As diligent and responsive as the package maintainers from the respective distributions and operating systems are , however , there are always applications that someone would like to see included in a repository that are not present .
Maybe they can’t find a maintainer , maybe they do n’t comply with the licensing terms required for inclusion , or maybe they ’re just not that popular – who knows .
The important thing , from a user ’s perspective anyway , is that they ’re not there .
Java , not an unpopular technology despite its flaws , only got into repositories this past year , after significant changes to its licensing .
Presented with the lack of the application they ’re looking for , the user has a choice to make : do I install this application separately and maintain it myself , or do I wait for it the package ?
Ok , yes , there ’s a third : install an alternative application that is in the system , but forget that for now .
Seen from this angle , it ’s apparent that the operating system / distribution and its maintainers are a control point .
Not in a malicious sense , mind you , as the maintainers are in large part volunteers performing a public service ; a public service that permits lazy users like me to install entire stacks from the command line .
But a control point nonetheless .
If you want access to their users , you ’re obligated to submit to their process .
Although those on the wrong side of a tangle with Debian would probably take exception to this assertion , I think it ’s to the distros credit , in fact , that they decline to throw their weight around as heedlessly as does , say , Wal - Mart when it arbitrarily decides not to carry books or music that does n’t meet its “ moral ” standards .
They have strict rules , yes , but you know that going in and you know they play by those same rules .
Given the fact that the distro folks I know are all excellent people , I wo n’t push the Sprawl - Mart analogy further .
But while the distributions may only be part time moral arbiters , they are – like it or not – full time gatekeepers to sizable communities , not to mention potential markets .
For this reason , we ’ve strongly encouraged our ISV customers with credible and viable open source projects to pursue relationships with the various distributions ; have facilitated some of those very conversations on their behalf , in fact .
But what if that control point became less important over time ?
This is , I believe ( and he can correct me if I ’m wrong ) , the future that Jeff Waugh , formerly of Ubuntu , was discussing in this post .
Anthony summarizes Jeff ’s views with the following :
I think it ’s fair to sum Jeff ’s main point about the future of distros as one of “ disintermediation ” – that is removing , or at least minimising , the barriers between the authors and users of a piece of software , and in general getting closer and quicker collaboration between everyone involved and interested in developing and maintaining that software …
Jeff had a bunch more ideas in that vein – like not bothering with a central archive , but having users collect the packages they ’re interested in from upstream sites all over the place , standardising , reducing or removing the “ control ” information for packages so that creating the correct packages for 80 % of free software ( that uses ./ configure in the usual way , eg ) was a complete no -brainer , and perhaps viewing distributions not so much as the gatekeepers and central players of the open source world , but perhaps more as systems of providing resources , assistance and opportunities to software authors who deal with their users directly – and in so doing have more of an opportunity for their users to actively participate in the project ’s development , and have more feedback ( and control ) of how their project is perceived by its users .
Technically , there ’s nothing preventing this disintermediation now .
Donnie and the Gentoo crowd know this approach well as “ overlays ” .
My initial implementation of Beryl ( a Linux UI enhancement ) , as an example , was via a repository outside of the Ubuntu mainstream ( Quinn ’s , as I recall ) .
Further proving the point , to finally get back round to the topic at hand , are Google ’s Linux repositories .
Rather than fight half a dozen pitched battles to persuade distributions to include its software – battles it was likely to lose , in many cases – Google chose the MacArthur route .
It bypassed the control points entirely , offering its software directly to end users , neatly packaged in the format of your choice ( except for the poor Gentoo users ) .
I ’m sure they ’re not the first commercial firm to take this approach , but I ’d bet they ’re the biggest ( happy to be corrected on that score , trust me ) .
The implications of this are profound , I think – for users , maintainers , and ISVs alike .
For the users , it ’s certainly a short term win , in that they get access to applications more quickly via the standard installation mechanism .
Longer term , this has the potential to be a Categorical Imperative type problem , but personally I ’ll cross the bridge of too many repositories to manage when I get to it .
The maintainers likewise may see a short term win – less packages to be maintained , but more software available – partially offset by longer term concerns : what does this mean to the importance of the distro ?
For ISVs , it ’s an approach I expect to see increasingly adopted , if only as an interim step towards full product adoption .
In fact , I ’d recommend it .
In any event , this is a trend to watch – and one that other , smarter folks have already predicted .
I do n’t know that anyone yet has the answers here , but that it will impact the future of the distributions – as Jeff contends – seems to me inarguable .
Money spent on energy research vs. the Iraq war .
( Via Matthew Yglesias . )
Amusingly illustrative graph below the fold .
I 'm not usually impressed by these kinds of comparisons ; if the Iraq war really had inspired populaces throughout the entire Middle East to spontaneously overthrow their despotic governments and inaugurate a new era of democracy , tolerance , and prosperity , it would have been a good idea .
The war is expensive , but that 's not the best argument against it .
Still , the occasional pictorial representation of our spending priorities does help to bring home how messed up they are .
Via Ezra Klein , here 's the famous food pyramid , along with a corresponding pyramid showing how we subsidize different types of production .
Sometimes this democracy stuff is just depressing .
The Pentagon has been concealing the true number of American casualties in the Iraq War .
The real number exceeds 15,000 and CBS News can prove it .
CBS 's Investigative Unit wanted to do a report on the number of suicides in the military and " submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department of Defense " .
After 4 months they received a document which showed -- that between 1995 and 2007 -- there were 2,200 suicides among " active duty " soldiers .
Baloney .
The Pentagon was covering up the real magnitude of the " suicide epidemic " .
Following an exhaustive investigation of veterans ' suicide data collected from 45 states ; CBS discovered that in 2005 alone " there were at least 6,256 among those who served in the armed forces .
That 's 120 each and every week in just one year . "
That is not a typo .
Active and retired military personnel , mostly young veterans between the ages of 20 to 24 , are returning from combat and killing themselves in record numbers .
We can assume that " multiple - tours of duty " in a war - zone have precipitated a mental health crisis of which the public is entirely unaware and which the Pentagon is in total denial .
If we add the 6,256 suicide victims from 2005 to the " official " 3,865 reported combat casualties ; we get a sum of 10,121 .
Even a low - ball estimate of similar 2004 and 2006 suicide figures , would mean that the total number of US casualties from the Iraq war now exceed 15,000 .
That 's right ; 15,000 dead US servicemen and women in a war that -- as yet -- has no legal or moral justification .
CBS interviewed Dr. Ira Katz , the head of mental health at the Department of Veteran Affairs .
Katz attempted to minimize the surge in veteran suicides saying , " There is no epidemic of suicide in the VA , but suicide is a major problem . "
Maybe Katz is right .
Maybe there is no epidemic .
Maybe it 's perfectly normal for young men and women to return from combat , sink into inconsolable depression , and kill themselves at greater rates than they were dying on the battlefield .
Maybe it 's normal for the Pentagon to abandon them as soon as soon they return from their mission so they can blow their brains out or hang themselves with a garden hose in their basement .
Maybe it 's normal for politicians to keep funding wholesale slaughter while they brush aside the casualties they have produced by their callousness and lack of courage .
Maybe it is normal for the president to persist with the same , bland lies that perpetuate the occupation and continue to kill scores of young soldiers who put themselves in harm 's - way for their country .
It 's not normal ; it 's is a pandemic --- an outbreak of despair which is the natural corollary of living in constant fear ; of seeing one 's friends being dismembered by roadside bombs or children being blasted to bits at military checkpoints or finding battered bodies dumped on the side of a riverbed like a bag of garbage .
The rash of suicides is the logical upshot of the U.S. war on Iraq .
Returning soldiers are traumatized by their experience and now they are killing themselves in droves .
Maybe we should have thought about that before we invaded .

Programmable neural silicon
Neuromorphic chips were pioneered by Carver Mead in the late eighties , when he developed the first silicon retina at Caltech .
Extrapolating the doubling in computer performance that was occurring every eighteen months ( Moore ’s Law ) , Mead predicted correctly in 1990 that present - day computers would use ten million times more energy ( per instruction ) than the brain uses ( per synaptic activation ) .
He sought to close this efficiency - gap by building microelectronic circuits based on the brain .
Mead succeeded in mimicking ion-flow across a neuron 's membrane with electron - flow through a transistor 's channel — this should not have come as a surprise — the same physical forces are at work in both cases !
We made these chips programmable by coming up with a versatile ion-channel analog and reconfigurable synaptic connections .
A computer that executes one instruction every time the brain activates a synapse would consume a hundred megawatts !
Whereas simulation refers to software , emulation refers to hardware — a physical realization of a neural model that operates in real - time .
Instead of designing different electronic circuits to emulate each of a wide variety of ion-selective protein pores that stud neurons ' membranes , as Mead did in his silicon retina , we came up with a versatile analog thatthe range of behavior they display .
Some open when the voltage across the membrane is high , others open when the voltage is low , and everything in between .
Nevertheless , the fraction that opens always follows a sigmoid - curve , and the time it takes always follows a bell - curve .
As few as eight transistors sufficed to replicate this behavior — thanks to the common physical forces — allowing millions of distinct ion-channel populations to be modeled with a single chip .
After it is fabricated , its sigmoid - and bell - curves are tailored to fit any desired ion-channel type by computer - controlled bias voltages .
Instead of hardwiring the silicon neurons together , as Mead did in his silicon retina , we softwired them by assigning unique addresses .
Every time a spike occurs , the chip outputs that neuron ’s address .
This address points to a memory location ( RAM ) that holds the synaptic target ’s address , or to multiple memory locations if the neuron has multiple synaptic targets .
When this address is fed back into the chip , a post - synaptic potential is triggered at the target .
An extremely efficient technique , as the same post - synaptic circuit serves all the synapses that neuron receives — virtual synapses !
Encoding , translating , and decoding an address happens fast enough to route several million spikes per second , allowing a million connections to be made among a thousand silicon neurons .
These softwires may be rerouted simply by overwriting the RAM ’s look - up table , making it possible to specify any desired synaptic connectivity .
With no new evidence , Fox continues to ask : Did al Qaeda burn California ?

For the second straight day , Fox News stood virtually alone in advancing thinly supported speculation to raise fears that the wildfires ravaging California are not the result of a confluence of arid heat and high winds but were set deliberately by al Qaeda terrorists bent on destroying America .
Fox & Friends , the conservative cable channel , was panned Wednesday for breathlessly reporting a sketchy , four - year - old FBI memo as if it offered new information linking America 's enemies in the " Global War on Terror " with a plot to burn down southern California .
The morning team was back at it Thursday , as anchor Alisyn Camerota introduced a segment on the fires that again mischaracterized and over - inflated warnings from a 2003 interview with an al Qaeda detainee .
Camerota said Fox 's fear - mongering was " based on some information the FBI sent to local law enforcement in California and other Western states ... that there was a plot afoot to set three or four different " fires .
Left unsaid by the Fox news - reader was that the FBI warning was sent more than four years ago , described a potential plot that made no mention of California , could not be proven accurate and did not raise alarms from forrest - fire officials at the time .
( Such caveats all were included in an Associated Press report on the warning at the time . )
" How do they determine what 's arson and what 's terrorism ? " she asked , noting accurately that authorities believe arsonists were responsible for at least " some of these fires . "
( Authorities say arson has been shown to have caused only two of more than a dozen fires so far . )
Terror analyst Erick Stakelbeck served as Camerota 's foil in boosting the terror fears .
Although he did clarify that the FBI memo was from 2003 , the vintage of the intelligence did n't squelch his terror speculation ; Stakelbeck warned that the fires appeared to be the result of a " coordinated effort ... over a large area . "
" In a post - 9/11 world , we have to consider all possibilities , " Stakelbeck intoned .
Even if al Qaeda is n't involved -- and no one but Fox seems to be seriously suggesting they were -- the fires are still an example of " domestic terrorism , " Stakelbeck said , although he was sure to note that law enforcement would be checking to see if arson suspects in custody fit the " terrorist profile . "
Whoever is responsible for the fires , Stakelbeck could n't help but note the ease with which such devastation can be wreaked with just some matches , kerosene and dry brush : " What a cost - effective means of terrorism , " he marveled .

For 50 years Linda Sue Brown ’s nine siblings fiercely protected her , facing down anyone who would taunt her or seek to exploit the disability that left her with the mental capacity of a 12 - year - old .
That sense of responsibility only grew after their 81 - year - old mother , Brown ’s lifelong caretaker , was stricken with Alzheimer ’s disease , leaving her unable to tend to her daughter .
So when Brown ’s lower legs swelled last summer and she grew short of breath , her eldest sister rushed her to a place the family knew and trusted : Brotman Medical Center in Culver City .
One of Brown ’s sisters , Thelma Allen , worked there as a nurse ; another , Rosslyn Diamond , had previously been a nurse there .
And Brown had been treated there , successfully , for years .
At the 420 - bed hospital , tests revealed that Brown had an enlarged heart , fluid in her lungs and severe anemia , medical records show .
She received blood transfusions and , two days later , an emergency hysterectomy .
Afterward , Allen was given an unorthodox , but welcome , assignment :
She was to be one of Brown ’s nurses .

On July 4 , after her shift ended , Allen watched TV with Brown , then kissed her good night .
By the time she returned the next morning , her sister was dead .
The death was probably caused by a pulmonary embolism , a clot of blood blocking an artery to the lungs , Diamond recalled the surgeon saying .
If so , nothing could have saved her .
For most grief - stricken relatives , the questions would have ended here .
Patients die unexpectedly in hospitals every day .
If families have vague doubts about why and how , they typically lack the knowledge and access to get answers .
Advertisement
But Diamond , 60 , and Allen , 59 , vowed to find out what happened to their sister .
Along the way , they discovered that their decades of experience afforded them little advantage over any other bereaved family .
Instead , almost everything they believed about the medical profession was turned on end .
And ultimately , the answers they battled to get have provided little comfort .
After months of investigation , state health inspectors determined that Brown ’s death was nothing so random as an embolism .
Brotman staffers , the inspectors found , had failed Brown in virtually every way :
Her nurses -- Allen ’s colleagues -- appear to have forged consent forms and had Brown sign agreements that she could n’t understand .
One failed to call for help as Brown ’s vital signs plummeted .
Advertisement
Her doctors did n’t investigate signs of heart failure , performed a risky emergency surgery with no clear justification and then did n’t intervene as her condition deteriorated .
And hospital officials did n’t even look into what went wrong until inspectors inquired .
“ That is just a pretty phenomenal failure , ” said Dr. Eric J. Thomas , an associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas , Houston , and a patient safety expert who reviewed Brown ’s medical records and the state report for the Los Angeles Times .
“ Certainly anyone would classify it as a preventable death , ” he said .
Brotman leaders said that Brown was in precarious health , with ailments that included an enlarged heart , and that nothing staffers did could have changed the outcome .
Health inspectors also judged Brotman staffers too harshly , they said , failing to consider some mitigating information .

If mistakes were made , said Brotman ’s chief executive , Howard H. Levine , “ you have to realize that in a hospital , any time you have the human element involved in care , there ’s going to be an error or two , unfortunately . ”
According to the 72 - page report by the state Department of Health Services , three of Brotman ’s physician leaders separately told state inspectors that they had a “ concern for the quality of care ” provided to Brown throughout her stay .
In the months after Brown ’s death , her sisters heard nothing about such problems .
They knew only that she died somewhere they thought she would be safe , a place that had begun treating them as outsiders .
At the beginning , Diamond said , “ our goal was just to find out what happened to my sister . ”

Now , “ I want to see someone in handcuffs .
Someone should be in handcuffs . ”
5 - foot powerhouse
Brown , the seventh of 10 children , was the family ’s heart .
Hooked up to her headphones , the 5 - foot , 150 - pound powerhouse would bellow along to the tunes of Elvis , the Beatles and the Ikettes -- oblivious to her surroundings and her less - than - harmonious voice .
“ She could n’t sing a lick , ” Diamond said .
Every year , she lighted candles to mourn the anniversaries of the deaths of Elvis and John Lennon .

Brown knew she was different , her sisters said .
A medication side effect caused her to lose her hair as a teen , so she wore wigs .
She had a seizure disorder and , as she got older , hypertension and diabetes .
She once told Diamond that after she died , she ’d like to come back as “ normal . ”
Perhaps to compensate , she ’d sassily assert “ I know that ” to whatever anyone told her .
Brown was fortunate , her family believed , to have doctors at Brotman who knew of her limitations .
Some had treated her for years .
Thelma
Allen visited her sister July 1 , the day after her admission .
She said Brown ’s longtime primary - care doctor , Daryl Houston , told her that Brown had a little fluid overload in her lungs from the blood transfusions she had received to combat her anemia .
“ I did n’t think anything of it , because I felt comfortable with Dr. Houston , ” Allen said .
Advertisement
What she was n’t told , Allen said , was that doctors had intended to perform an emergency hysterectomy that day , certain the anemia was caused by abnormal vaginal bleeding , which Brown had previously complained about .
But an anesthesiologist canceled the surgery , saying Brown ’s fluid - filled lungs made it too risky .
Brown had the hysterectomy the next day .
Diamond and Allen said they assumed that their elder sister , Alice Brown , had approved the procedure .
She had n’t , they said .
They later discovered that Linda Brown had signed the consent herself , even though her mental limitations required an authorized surrogate to sign on her behalf , according to health inspectors .
On other hospital consent forms , her signature appeared falsified , the inspectors found .
The morning after the surgery , Allen was assigned to care for Brown and five other post - surgical patients .
Both she and Diamond noticed that Brown was n’t her usual chatty self .
“ I said to her , ‘ You ’re going to have to perk up .
You got to get out of the bed and move , ’ ” Diamond said .

Despite all the intravenous fluids going in , there was scant urine coming out , a sign that her bladder and kidneys were not functioning properly , said Diamond , a post - delivery nurse at Harbor - UCLA Medical Center .
Both sisters said Brown ’s doctors did not seem overly concerned .
Brown ’s condition deteriorated .
She died the morning of July 5 , while Allen was on her way to the hospital .
When Diamond arrived , she demanded that Dr. Norma Salceda , the gynecologist who performed Brown ’s surgery , tell the family what went wrong .
“ These things happen , ” Diamond recalled Salceda saying , suggesting the probability of the embolism .
Advertisement
Diamond , whose pretty features turn fierce in the face of perceived wrongs , said her reply was loud and furious .
“ I said , ‘ No , that is not what happened .
You are going to tell me what happened . ’ ”
No consolation
As the family waited in the hallway , no one offered explanations or even consolation .
“ No supervisor approached us .
No social worker .
No charge nurse .
No one .
Ever , ” Diamond said .
Advertisement
Allen felt she was no better off for being a hospital staffer , despite having been recognized in the past as a “ Shining Star ” who had made an “ outstanding contribution to Brotman , ” according to an internal newsletter .
A hospital official told the sisters that federal patient privacy laws prohibited the sisters from looking at Brown ’s final medical charts , even though Allen had previously had access as one of Brown ’s nurses .
Because no family member was Brown ’s legal guardian , Diamond said , she was forced to hire a lawyer to subpoena the records .
“ They were already circling the wagons , ” she said .
Advertisement
But unlike the families of most patients , Diamond said , she knew how hospitals worked .
When Brotman called to ask permission to do an autopsy , Diamond said , she called the Los Angeles County coroner to request an independent autopsy .
She filed a complaint with the California health department , which oversees care in the state ’s hospitals , and she called back again and again until an inspector was assigned and a probe completed .
Six months after Brown ’s death , Diamond and Allen had their answers .
Advertisement
The health department report faulted nearly all of Brown ’s caregivers , beginning soon after Brown arrived in the emergency room .
The report said doctors failed to investigate Brown ’s enlarged heart and the fluid in her lungs as signs of congestive heart failure .
Transfusions ordered by Houston , who was not in the ER and was in contact by telephone , forced even more fluid into her lungs , the report said .
The coroner later found that an enlarged heart muscle , unable to pump effectively and stressed by an abnormal heart rhythm , led to Brown ’s death .
Advertisement
Inspectors found that Houston , who did not examine Brown until 11 1 / 2 hours after her arrival in the ER , had “ no current core privileges to practice in the facility , ” the report said .
Later , gynecologist Salceda performed an emergency hysterectomy with no evidence that Brown was “ suffering from acute , life - threatening vaginal bleeding at any time ” before her surgery , inspectors said .
The only reports of bleeding , inspectors said , came from Brown , who was described in medical records as a “ poor historian [ with ] poor cognition . ”
Dr. Luis Torres - Garcia , the anesthesiologist who raised concerns , was “ unable to explain ” to inspectors why he ultimately agreed to go ahead with the surgery .
Advertisement
Houston and Torres - Garcia declined to comment .
Salceda did not return calls for comment .
Finally , the inspectors said , as Brown ’s condition worsened on the night of July 4 , no doctors examined her .
Even as her vital signs plummeted in her final three hours , there was no evidence that her nurse alerted her superior or any physician , according to the report .
The nursing staff was cited for its repeated failure “ to act as the patient ’s advocate . ”

A sense of betrayal
After they learned what happened , the sisters -- driven by anger and a sense of betrayal -- sought to hold the hospital and its caregivers accountable .
They sent portions of the inspection report in January to the Medical Board of California , which oversees the conduct of physicians , and to the state Board of Registered Nursing .
Then they waited .
As the months passed , Diamond and Allen grew bitter .
Advertisement
Diamond angrily called the medical board , accusing officials of dragging their feet .
Allen sent pleading letters to everyone she could think of : local , state and federal lawmakers , the mayor , reporters .
“ It ’s like bumping your head up against a brick wall , ” Allen said .
In April , Brown ’s family sued the hospital , the doctors and other hospital staff for more than $ 30 million , alleging battery and abuse of a dependent adult .
The suit is pending .
Salceda denied the allegations .
Houston , Torres - Garcia and Brotman filed motions to dismiss the suit , contesting the legal basis for the complaint .
Advertisement
As time passed , Allen kept replaying Brown ’s final days in her head , searching for a moment she could have done something different .
Should she have pressed harder ?
Knee surgery kept her out of work after Brown ’s death , but later , after all that had happened , she could n’t go back .
She quit .
Most days she visits the vault where her sister ’s ashes lie to play the oldies she loved .
“ She can hear it , ” Allen said .
“ I know she can . ”

Review promised
In June , more than 11 months after Brown ’s death , Brotman promised the state that it would review or revamp almost every process and procedure identified by inspectors in the case , including such basics as when nurses should alert their bosses or doctors to a patient ’s deteriorating condition .
After refusing for weeks to answer a Times reporter ’s questions about the case , Brotman officials said in a long interview that the failures in Brown ’s case were not as clear - cut as the state report portrayed .
Inspectors did n’t review outpatient records that might have provided justification for Brown ’s emergency hysterectomy , including a prior history of vaginal bleeding and fibroids , the officials said .
Nor did they consider nursing notes and other evidence suggesting that Brown ’s final nurse did much more to aid her than was documented in the medical record .
Advertisement
As for the sisters ’ complaints that the hospital shut them out , Brotman leaders said it was Brown ’s primary doctor ’s responsibility -- not theirs -- to explain what happened .
“ The hospital , ” Levine said , “ does not have a lead person who is supposed to take care of this unfortunate job . ”
In July , the sisters got a final shock : A three - page letter from the state medical board arrived , explaining that its investigation of Brotman physicians was closed .
Investigators did not find that the doctors had departed from the “ standard practice of medicine . ”
Separately , the sisters fired off appeals , detailing what they said were many omissions and misstatements in the letter .
Advertisement
The findings are “ an insult to my family ’s intelligence and the public that depends on your agency to protect the public from substandard care , ” Allen wrote .
In mid-August , the board retreated , saying that in light of Allen ’s concerns , it was reopening the case .
Today , more than a year after Brown ’s death , the two feel they have been robbed of more than a sister .
Diamond has lost trust that the medical system -- and her fellow nurses -- put patients first .
Advertisement
Her anger flares when she sees a colleague ignore a patient ’s call light .
“ When the light goes on , ” she says , “ you go see what the patient wants . ”
Allen has lost her passion for medicine altogether .
“ I loved being a nurse , ” she said .
“ I just do n’t want to be a nurse anymore . ”

Emergency services took nearly three hours to find a bed
A ninth hospital refused to admit her even after she miscarried in an ambulance and her baby died .
The woman , who was in the sixth month of her pregnancy , lived just three minutes away from a hospital .
But she was forced to travel 70 km ( 45 miles ) by ambulance looking for a facility that would admit her .
The woman , who lives in the countryside , called an ambulance in the middle of the night because she was suffering from stomach pains and bleeding .
For more than an hour the ambulance crew tried to find a hospital to accept her .
Eight refused .
Then on the way to a ninth hospital the ambulance crashed and the woman miscarried .
The hospital then changed its mind and refused to admit her .
An official told ambulance staff that treatment would be difficult and they were already busy with an emergency operation .
Eventually , almost three hours after they first arrived to pick her up , the ambulance crew found a hospital that would take her .
Long hours
Last year a pregnant woman who lived in the same area died after she was refused admission by about 20 hospitals which said their beds were full .
The problem is there are neither enough doctors in Japan , nor emergency facilities .
It is especially bad in rural areas .
The number of obstetricians has declined - medical students are said to be put off by the long hours of training needed to qualify and a rise in the number of malpractice suits .
The health minister has promised to try to improve the situation .
But measures already in place - like scholarships for doctors willing to work in rural areas - have not made much of a difference .
I ’ve been working on arithmetic in Mathematica for more than 12 years .
You might think that ’s silly ; after all , how hard can arithmetic be ?
Today we were reminded again about how hard it can be .
A nasty little bug in Excel 2007 came to light , whereby the result of computing , for example , 850 * 77.1 is displayed as 100000 :
Of course , this works just fine in Mathematica :
But why is arithmetic so difficult to get right ?
The standard “ schoolbook ” algorithms are pretty easy .
But they ’re inefficient and often unnecessarily inaccurate .
So people like me have done a huge amount of work to find algorithms that are more efficient and accurate .
And the problem is that these algorithms are inevitably more complicated , and one has to be very careful to avoid insidious bugs .
Take multiplying integers , for example .
The standard “ schoolbook ” long - multiplication algorithm uses n^2 multiplications to multiply two n - digit numbers .
But many of these multiplications are actually redundant , and we now know clever algorithms that take n^1.58 , n log n or even fewer multiplications for large n .
So this means that if one wants to do a million - digit multiplication , Mathematica can do it in a fraction of a second using these algorithms — while it would take at least a few minutes using standard long multiplication .
The black squares below show the multiplications required for the schoolbook and Karatsuba algorithms respectively .
Today ’s Excel bug is actually not about underlying multiplication , but instead about displaying numbers in base 10 .
Current computers essentially all represent numbers in binary .
But when one outputs them , one has to convert to base 10 .
Doing this conversion might seem to be the “ easy part . ”
But actually , it ’s really subtle .
The main issue is being able to round the underlying binary form to the “ nearest representation ” in decimal .
If one gets it wrong , very bizarre things can happen .
For example , one can enter a number in decimal , have it converted to binary to be stored and then have it end up being a different number when one prints it out .
And in fact , this happens in Excel , not only in the 2007 version but also in previous versions .
Here one enters 40000.223 and it shows up as 40000.2229999999 :
Converting from binary to decimal is based on multiplication ; converting from decimal to binary is based on division .
The tricky part is that for some numbers , the multiplication or division needs to be done to a higher precision than the numbers themselves in order to get the correct answers .
Most computer systems just work with numbers at a fixed precision that ’s immediately available from the underlying hardware .
And if one ca n’t do anything to increase the precision , it ’s simply not possible to always get the right answers for binary - to - decimal and decimal - to - binary conversions .
Mathematica takes a much more sophisticated view of numbers .
Ever since the beginning , it ’s allowed numbers to have arbitrary numbers of digits , and arbitrary precision — and it can track precision through a computation .
One might have thought that arbitrary precision would only be important for something esoteric like computational number theory .
But in fact , what we ’ve seen in recent years is that it ’s increasingly crucial in ensuring reliability in everyday computations .
So it ’s really nice that it ’s built in throughout the Mathematica system .
One of the strange things about arithmetic and arithmetic algorithms is that it can be fairly easy to get them almost right — but there can be weird bugs that crop up only in rare cases .
This has happened many times .
The Pentium FDIV bug in 1994 occurred only for particular numbers that happened to sample an incorrect entry in a lookup table .
The Ariane 5 rocket explosion in 1996 occurred because a conversion between number types failed for particular numbers .
And so on .
Carries are a particularly common cause of rare bugs .
What can happen is that there may be only some rare class of numbers for which a carry propagates in a particular way that causes trouble .
Problems like this have a long history ; Charles Babbage ’s original mechanical computers in the 1820s would get stuck if they had to carry too far .
And most likely the problem in Excel today is associated with carries .
One problem with rare bugs that afflict only numbers with particular patterns of bits is that they can be very hard to catch in testing .
One can run an algorithm on billions of numbers , and never see a problem .
But if one is working on some particular computation that happens to generate numbers with a particular structure , one can fall right into the bug .
When we test Mathematica , we put a lot of effort into systematically testing all of the “ fringe ” cases where unusual things might happen .
And doing this correctly requires quite sophisticated knowledge not only of testing but also of the underlying algorithms that are used .
These days reliability is an increasingly important component of numerical computation .
Machines have become so fast that people are doing huge numbers of numerical computations all the time .
And now what ’s critical is to get them right all the time — because if there ’s a fringe case that ’s wrong , it ’s now going to be noticed .
It ’s not easy to get reliable numerical computation , and it ’s not something one can “ bolt on ” after the fact .
It ’s something one has to build in from the beginning , as we ’ve done in Mathematica for nearly 20 years .

Washington , DC - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded the failure of an amendment offered to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill that would have authorized $ 300 million of federal funding for states to implement the Real ID driver 's license program , which has been estimated by DHS to cost $ 23.1 billion .
The ACLU deemed the proposal " sucker money " because it aimed to entice states to accept a paltry amount of funding for a flawed program that would ultimately cost millions more in state taxes and licensing fees .
The amendment was killed when a motion to table it passed 49 to 45 , after both the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee , Senators Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) and Thad Cochran ( R - MS ) , respectively , spoke passionately against the funding proposal .
The death of this amendment means the states will receive no additional federal funding to implement Real ID , dealing a crushing blow to the viability of the unworkable program .
" Real ID is dead in the water , and it is clear that no amount of money can save it , " said ACLU Legislative Counsel Tim Sparapani .
" The only solution to Real ID is to scrap and replace it , and Congress has caught on .
With seventeen states opposed to this program and the U.S. Senate standing behind them , this is the beginning of the end of Real ID .
$ 300 million does not even come close to covering the costs of the program , and it is not enough to lure Americans to give up their privacy . "
Real ID poses serious privacy threats .
The federally mandated IDs would hold machine - readable data of every American .
That information would be stored in a national database available to government employees at all levels , putting every American at risk of identity theft and security breaches .
Ultimately , Real ID could pave the way for a society that tracks Americans ' movements and warehouses personal information in centralized databases that are rife with errors and highly enticing to identity thieves .
Because Real ID promises to be such an integral part of our lives , from boarding a plane to opening a bank account to verifying your eligibility to work , a small glitch could have disastrous consequences .
Seventeen state legislatures have passed laws rejecting the program , with seven of those states passing binding legislation refusing to implement it .
Never before in modern history has a federal mandate been so vehemently rejected by the states .
" The American people are not suckers and they wo n't be duped by attempts to dress up a bad proposal with a little federal funding , " said Director of the ACLU Technology and Liberty Program Barry Steinhardt .
" Throwing money at Real ID will not fix anything because the program is fundamentally flawed and fundamentally unworkable .
There are only two options : Scrap Real ID altogether , or replace it with something that works .
Americans do n't want a national ID , and they should n't be forced to pay for one . "

By By Michael Billy Oct 15 , 2007 in Crime Law enforcement officers are allowed to kill the family pet without consequence , but do so much as threaten a police dog and you could be looking at jail time with a $ 100,000 bond .
On September 27 , 2007 police officers approached the house of Jennifer Stiernagel .
The car parked in her driveway resembled the car that was used in a bank robbery sometime earlier .
Jennifer was alone with her two - year old son , Derek .
As she talked to an investigator in the front yard , she noticed a deputy nearby approaching her two dogs .
She said Duke , the Basset Hound , was barking , Eddie , the Terrier Lab , was lying in the grass growling .
" The dog was down , he did n't try jumping at him , " said Stiernagel , " he did n't do anything , as soon as I turned around , he shot him right in the head . "
Derek watched from the front deck 20 feet away .
I ran into the house and grabbed him , " said Derek 's mother .
" I put him in the house and he would n't leave me and he was holding onto me and he was crying . "
The officer in this case could -- and should -- have acted more responsibly in the situation .
Why not ask the mother to take the dogs inside instead of shooting one of them in the head in front of a two - year - old ?
The officer received no punishment .
Glen Harris , the dogs owner said , " They did n't knock .
They ignored the sign , the dog sees or hears ( and ) protects my daughter , so he ran toward him -- not growling , not foaming at the mouth , not anything . "
O'Hare has also gone unpunished .

On the other side of the law , Pittsburgh native Kenneth King has been placed in county jail for allegedly yelling at a police dog .
Kenneth King , 23 , walked by a K - 9 police cruiser at a Sunoco station on the North Side shortly after midnight on Saturday and was startled by the dog , which was barking .
Police say King yelled at the dog , “ Shut the [ expletive ] up , and charged with taunting a police animal .
King is being held on a $ 100,000 straight bond and will be in jail until he has his preliminary hearings in a few days .

No charges have been filed against Officer Deeter for failing to confine the dog .
Vanderhoff faces up to five years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine if convicted of the assault charge .
Cruelty to animals , a second - degree misdemeanor , carries a maximum sentence of 90 days in jail .
When a police dog is killed officers are quick to say that the dog is a fellow officer and should be treated as such .
I do n't know about you , but my my dog is a member of my family and should therefore be treated like one .
If an officer wrongly killed a member of my family I would hope that proper actions were taken against them .
So here are the rules :
Do not kill or threaten a police dog no matter what , unless you want to be put in jail .
However , if you are an officer , you can recklessly kill the pets of average citizens if they so much as bark at you .
The hypocrisy that the law takes when it come to police dogs is fairly astounding .
Is the life of a police dog more valuable than that of a citizens dog ?
It depends on the perspective you take .
As for me , I would never give up the life of my dog for that of a police dog , as his life is more important to me .
The laws should not discriminate .
If you happen to kill a police dog that has wandered onto your property then you could be facing a third degree felony .

We all know that some airlines nickel - and - dime you with fees -- fees for baggage , fees for food , fees for blankets and pillows .
But fees for death ?
Monrovia resident Jane Wilkens , 48 , was looking forward to a getaway to Hawaii ’s Big Island this coming April with her 77 - year - old mom and one of her mom ’s friends .
In August , she booked three first - class tickets to Kona on Hawaiian Airlines for $ 4,287 .
But in September , Wilkens ’ mom underwent surgery for a back problem .
Three days later , she unexpectedly died from a blood clot .
“ It was horrible , ” Wilkens recalled .
“ She was my best friend .
We were very close , and this was devastating to me . ”
Advertisement
After dealing with all the things that arise under such circumstances , Wilkens finally got around to canceling various travel arrangements .
She contacted the Hilton Waikoloa Village resort , where she ’d booked a suite for about $ 600 per night , and explained what had happened .
“ Just like that , they canceled the reservation , ” Wilkens said .
She contacted Delta Air Lines , on which she ’d booked a separate first - class trip for a “ girls ’ weekend ” in Maine after she and her mom returned from Hawaii .
“ They fully refunded the tickets , no questions asked , ” Wilkens said .
She contacted Hawaiian Airlines , which , like Delta , requested a copy of her mom ’s death certificate .
About a month later , Wilkens received a letter from Paul Whitaker , Hawaiian Air ’s “ resolution coordinator . ”
Advertisement
He said the airline would refund each of the three first - class tickets but would deduct a $ 75 “ service fee ” per ticket , or $ 225 .
Whitaker wrote that Hawaiian Air understood that the death of Wilkens ’ mom was “ an uncontrollable event , ” but nevertheless believed its fees were “ fair and reasonable . ”
He said the carrier now considered the case closed .
“ I thought that was ridiculous , ” Wilkens told me .
“ I bought those tickets nine months in advance and canceled seven months in advance .
It ’s not like they would n’t have time to resell them .
“ It was n’t the money , ” she added .
“ It was the principle . ”

As it happens , Hawaiian Air prides itself on its customer service .
The carrier ’s website includes a “ customer service commitment ” that says the airline “ is committed to delivering superior service by making air travel an easy and positive experience for every customer . ”
“ Our passengers ’ comfort is of utmost importance to us , second only to our concern for their safety , ” it says .
“ Since 1929 , our company has built an unmatched reputation for safety and hospitality . ”
Hawaiian Air is Hawaii ’s largest airline , serving 20 domestic and international destinations .
The airline says it carries an average of 6 million passengers a year .
In October , Hawaiian Air ’s parent company , Hawaiian Holdings Inc. , said its quarterly profit more than doubled to $ 19.6 million .
Advertisement
Keoni Wagner , a Hawaiian Airlines spokesman , said the charge to Wilkens was “ a refund fee for processing the refund . ”
“ There ’s administration involved -- paperwork , computer entries , ” he said .
“ The processing of the refund takes staff time that costs the company money . ”
I do n’t know about paperwork , but I ’d be very surprised if the computer entries in such cases involved more than a few minutes of work .
Let ’s say it took 10 minutes per ticket to process .
That means the $ 75 fee equates to an hourly charge of $ 450 , or $ 3,600 for an eight - hour shift .
Hawaiian
Air must pay its staff pretty well .
Advertisement
Not all carriers take such a heartless view of things .
Susan Elliott , a Delta spokeswoman , confirmed that her airline does what it can to accommodate bereaved passengers -- and does n’t ding them with processing fees if a trip has to be canceled .
“ In the case of a nonrefundable ticket , we make an exception if there ’s a death of the passenger or an immediate relative , ” she said .
Elizabeth Merida , a spokeswoman for the Air Transport Assn. , an industry group , said there are no regulations governing how an airline must treat passengers with a death in the family .
“ There are variations , ” she said .
“ Those kinds of decisions are up to individual carriers . ”
Advertisement
Wilkens , an insurance broker , said she wo n’t lose any sleep about Hawaiian Air withholding $ 225 in dead - mom fees .
But she does n’t think people in her position should be taken advantage of .
“ It ’s morally wrong , ” Wilkens said .
Her credit card company , American Express , apparently agreed .
Wilkens said she contacted AmEx after Hawaiian Air dug in its heels .
She ’d used her plastic to purchase the tickets .
Last week , a response finally arrived .
AmEx said it would cover Wilkens ’ fees and refund the $ 225 to her account .
She assumes the card company will use its considerable muscle to be compensated by Hawaiian Air .
Advertisement
“ We look at everything on a case - by - case basis , ” said Desiree Fish , an AmEx spokeswoman .
“ It comes down to customer service .
Sometimes we do things as a goodwill gesture . ”
One alternative in such cases is to take out a travel insurance policy that would guarantee a refund in the event of a death in the family .
Such policies can run about $ 80 for every $ 1,000 in travel costs , which is kind of pricey but could provide a little peace of mind .
But should that really be necessary ?
If your mom has just died , you ’d think any company would step up and do the right thing , especially if they want to keep you as a loyal customer .
Reaching into your pocket and plucking out $ 75 -- that ’s just cold .
Especially for an otherwise warm place like Hawaii .

Nov. 20 , 2007  -- CNN anchor Lou Dobbs , a self - described " advocacy journalist " and " independent populist , " has a new book out called " Independents Day : Awakening the American Spirit . "
In the book , Dobbs , who has become known for his anti-immigration stance , talks about the failure of America 's political system and how the arrogance of " the elites " threatens the future of the nation .
One solution to the problem , he says , is a viable third party candidate .
You can read an excerpt from " Independents Day : Awakening the American Spirit " below .
Excerpt : ' Independents Day '
The 2008 presidential campaign is upon us , and there should be no doubt that we are at a critical historic juncture , and the very survival of our nation may well depend on the electoral choices we make .
When one scans the number of candidates seeking their party 's nomination for the highest office in the U.S. government , what has seemed an interminably long campaign seems too brief and inadequate a period in which to choose a leader of great quality and character to successfully lead us in the twenty - first century .
America is a great nation whose leaders have become intoxicated with the idea that the accomplishments and achievements of preceding generations assure them not only of success , but of only limited consequences for their failures of judgment and infidelity to traditional American values .
Nearly all of our political leaders seem to believe that America 's wealth is so great that it cannot be exhausted ; the elites of politics and business seem to believe that their power flows from a superior DNA structure that confers upon them an omniscience in economic and geopolitical affairs that three hundred million citizens cannot hope to comprehend .
Their arrogance now threatens the future of our nation , and their elitist sense of entitlement has reached such heights that our leaders are now openly dismissive of the will of the people .
They no longer honor our fundamental national values but instead attach themselves to the interests of multinational corporations and politi cal parties , and recognize no duty to the nation in which they prosper .
Many of our political leaders rationalize their careless exercise of power and their disregard for the consequences of their decisions with their religiosity ; that is , God 's providence has guided and favored America throughout its history and therefore favors the faithful , if incompetent , leaders in all walks of American life .
Let us pray .
Many of our corporate leaders are even more disdainful of our national values and interests than our politicians .
Business leaders , if anything , seem more committed to their personal belief systems , which have been elevated to religiosity , the foundation of which is a blind faith in what they perceive to be the higher perfect power of economics and markets .
" Mr. Market " knows all and knows best for these corporate masters of the universe .
These lofty elites wield their awesome social , economic , and political powers without apparent regard for the common good , the national interest , or the traditional values that have historically informed and guided America 's leaders .
These elitists have abandoned American ideals for self - interest , and are ignoring ordinary citizens as unworthy of their concern , obligation , and duty .
For too long the American people have deluded themselves that failures of leadership will in the fullness of time resolve themselves in our great republic , because our history has given us the assurance that partisanship is an acceptable substitute for citizenship .
We 've accepted our own apathy and tolerated what has become a frontal assault by the establishment elites on our national sovereignty , the welfare of our people , and our future as a nation .
But there are now promising signs that the American people will soon be ready to reclaim this nation .
As I write these words , the U.S. Senate has just rejected a cloture vote on so- called comprehensive immigration reform legislation by a vote of 53 to 46 .
The defeat of President Bush and the Demo cratic Senate leadership all but ends the eff orts in this session of Congress to grant amnesty to twelve million to twenty million illegal aliens and to keep our borders wide open .
For four years I have fought almost daily the advocates of open borders and amnesty , and despite this Senate victory , I know that the fight will go on .
That fight will likely intensify , because the political , social , and economic interests driving open borders and amnesty are powerful , the stakes could hardly be larger , and American citizens are only slowly awakening to the threat to our nation that emanates from both the left and the right , the establishment and the radical .
But the American spirit is no longer slumbering .
On my broadcast we have reported the facts that should form the parameters and foundation of what has at long last become a national dialogue , even if now only incipient , on our illegal immigration and border - security crisis .
I have put representatives of all sides of the debate and discussion on the broadcast in an effort to examine the facts , to put the facts as we know them in perspective from the points of view of the advocates , to debate the merits and failings of those views , and to expose the varied agendas and interests of the elites who have tried to ram their positions through Congress and down the throats of American citizens who were just a few years ago unaware of the nature and extent of the threat to the American way of life .
The political contest that has resulted from our immigration and border crisis produces great passions and every bit as much heat as light .
Unfortunately , the facts and the independent , nonpartisan reality that my colleagues and I try to report to our audience each night are inconvenient obstacles for the ideological orthodoxies and conflicting partisan , establishment , ethnocentric , and even radical agendas that motivate most of our national dialogue and debate on so many critical issues , and nowhere more powerfully than on the illegal immigration and border - security crisis .
Too much of our national mainstream media is content to devote more airtime , ink , and kilobytes to Paris Hilton and Anna Nicole Smith than to the events , ideas , and issues that will determine our quality of life and our future as a nation .
Ours is a national entertainment media that is incentivized to appeal to the lowest common denominator in our society , a national news media that reports the ideological postures and rhetoric of both Republicans and Democrats and regards such journalistic efforts as fair and balanced .
As I 've said frequently , the truth is seldom fair or balanced , and it is certainly seldom represented by the partisanship and ideology of our two principal political parties .
Even before the final Senate vote on " comprehensive immigration reform legislation " was tallied , e-mails and telephone calls of congratulations started pouring into my office .
But I was surprised by my reaction to that vote and to all the congratulatory messages .
I felt great satisfaction , to be sure , that many of our elected officials had actually listened to their constituents , but I felt more a sense of relief at the prospect of a pause , for a while at least , in the political and media battles that might well give us all the opportunity to reflect and consider carefully our future course .
And I was grateful that for the first time in a long time that senators , both Democrats and Republicans , stood up and acted like they really cared about our nation and found the courage and good judgment to demand better of themselves and the leadership of the upper house of our Congress .
Senators Jeff Sessions , John Cornyn , Jim DeMint , Claire McCaskill , Jim Webb , Bernie Sanders , and and Byron Dorgan stood out in the fray on the Senate floor as people of character , quality , and commitment to our fundamental national values , the common good , and our national interest .
Fifteen Democratic senators and thirty - seven Republican senators voted to kill the legislation , and each of them played an important part in asserting the public good against what has become the almost always overwhelming political influence and power of corporate America and special interests , particularly the business associations and ethnocentric activist organizations that have played a disproportionately dominant role both in the national media and on Capitol Hill .
As Senator Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina , said to his colleagues before the vote , " Remember this day if you vote no . "
Senator Graham was issuing a warning to his colleagues , seeking their support in favor of amnesty in the upcoming vote .
But not only our senators but all of us should remember that day because it may well and truly have been the dawning of reasonable hope that we the people can still influence and shape our future as a nation ; it was the beginning of a reason to believe , with some confidence , that we can still save the once great democratic republic inherited .
We have much to overcome in the months and years ahead , but it 's been a long time since I felt as confident as I do now that we can succeed in restoring a broad commitment to our great national values : equal rights of individual liberty and opportunity , both economic and educational .
I can actually imagine the American people demanding that excellence be restored to our public education system , that a better quality of life for our working men and women and their families be the goal of domestic public policy , and that the restoration of our national sovereignty and security can become an attainable governmental goal .
My growing confidence is predicated on the belief that most of us are learning that America can no longer tolerate inadequate and incompetent leadership in either the White House or the Congress .
Nor can we any longer tolerate our own indifference , apathy , and cynicism , which have given rise to a succession of weak and short - sighted leaders who have spoken and have acted as if our citizens were strangers to them in what they now regard as their land , not ours .
I actually believe that populism is gaining the power to defeat elitism and that our government can one day soon again legitimately claim to be " of the people , by the people , and for the people . "
We Americans are surely strangers to any person who could say , " America must not fear diversity .
We ought to welcome diversity . "
Who would utter such condescending words about our land and our people , the most diverse nation on earth ?
None other than President George W. Bush .
Can we be such strangers to this president that he does not comprehend that this great nation 's citizens are from every country , practice every religion , and are of every race and ethnicity on the planet , and that Americans will never submit to any fear of any kind ?
We as a people welcome millions of legal immigrants to our country each and every year , more than all other countries combined .
Americans speak over 120 different languages in the New York City public school system alone .
Afraid of diversity , Mr. President ?
What in the world are you thinking ?
Let me acquaint you with the America I know .
We are a nation of immigrants .
But foremost we are a nation of laws .
We are a nation of unprecedented diversity , and we are a people of laws .
Even foreigners who visit and who are guests of this nation enjoy the same legal protection guaranteed our citizens under the Constitution .
That Constitution begins with the words " we the people , " and so far we have persevered , in good times and bad , in war and peace , in poverty and prosperity , because we honor our Constitution and the laws that flow from it .
To paraphrase our president , our leaders must not fear the people , and our leaders must welcome democracy .
America is first a nation and Americans are first citizens , despite those corporate and special interests and political partisans who insist that America is only an economy and a market and Americans are just consumers and laborers .
America is a great nation , Americans are a great people , and we are desperate for great leaders who know us , understand us , and respect us .
We will no longer tolerate elitists who would have Americans be strangers in our own land .
The ever - enlarging size , scope , and scale of government , business , and media are often celebrated by establishment elites who are indifferent to the rights and lives of ordinary citizens whose interests are poorly served by many of the powerful institutions that once stood for all that is best of what has been America and American .
While our elites have perverted our great national purpose of providing for the life , liberty , and pursuit of happiness of all our citizens , they exalt ideology , partisanship , greed , and privilege .
Our elites no longer talk straightforwardly and plainly .
They speak instead in the jargon of Wall Street and the lexicon of globalization .
Elites in business and government promote efficiency , productivity , and competitiveness rather than their responsibilities to our citizens , to the quality of life of our working men and women and their families , to the education of our young , and to our American way of life .
Straightforwardly , we have allowed our elites to mortgage our future , literally and figuratively , and to constrain our individual liberty and freedom , and it is time that we examine with clear eyes who we 've become , who we are as a nation , and how American citizens will shape our own future .
Both Republicans and Democrats , the president , and the congressional leadership would have us focus on fears and limitations rather than on our aspirations and hopes , and accept elitist direction toward the fate they favor .
The elite establishment fears nothing more than the awakening of the American spirit and the empowerment of American citizens to determine our national destiny .
Until now , the elites have had their way .
It 's time for the American way .
Irrespective of your politics or partisanship , your ideology or socio- economic status , our elites would much prefer we avoid important questions .
Questions such as :
Why , if we are the world 's only superpower , why are we also the world 's leading debtor nation ?
Why , if we have the world 's most advanced military , can we not defeat an insurgency and sectarian conflict in a third - world nation of only twenty - five million people ?
Why , engaged in a global fight to the death with radical Islamist terrorists , does our government refuse to secure our borders and ports ?
Why , six years after September 11 , do we have fewer allies and not more in that global battle against radical Islamist terror ?
And why , if ours is the world 's strongest economy , have we run thirty - one consecutive years of trade deficits , lost the ability to clothe and feed ourselves , and now find ourselves dangerously dependent on other nations for our oil , computers , consumer electronics , and , increasingly , even our basic daily sustenance in almost every respect ?
Those are a few of the questions we must answer , honestly and directly , if we are to shape our future and assure security and prosperity for generations of Americans to come .
And we can no longer rely upon our elites to ask the right questions , and we certainly can no longer trust them to provide truthful , relevant answers .
The issues and forces , global and domestic , that challenge us and our future are all the more daunting if we lose sight of our history as a people and nation , if we forget who we are as individuals , as citizens , and if we permit ourselves to be defined by those whose ideologies and interests compel them to deny our uniqueness as a people and a nation .
Should we really subordinate the interests of our fellow Americans and our nation to those of the United Nations , NAFTA , and the World Trade Organization , to multinational corporations and even the governments of other nations ?
I do n't think so .
But the orthodoxy that has built up among most of our elites in politics , business , academia , and media certainly does .
Many of those elites have declared me a " nationalist " because I care about our country and our fellow citizens , and on every single issue , whether domestic or international , strongly believe that our government should put the common good and the national interest of America ahead of all else .
The " internationalists " seek the demise of national sovereignty around the world , the end of borders , and an integration of commerce and economies that observes no distinction among people in France , Indonesia , Venezuela , and America , and they cheer the " flat earth " corporatist society that recognizes people only as consumers or producers .
Our elites increasingly look upon themselves as the owners and managers of this land we call America , our government as something simply to be bought and brokered , our borders as outdated obstacles to international commerce , and American citizenship as an annoying conceptual relic of the eighteenth , nineteenth , and twentieth centuries that interferes with efficient production and distribution and heretofore predictable consumer patterns .
So who and what are we if we cannot declare America as our land and ourselves to be Americans ?
Our elites do n't want you to even consider that question , and they sure as hell do n't want any of us to make a declaration .
So , I will .
First , I 'm an American , and damned proud of it .
I 'm also deeply grateful to this nation because I was born poor and this country gave me and millions upon millions of others the chance to live the American Dream .
I'm also a devout believer in our fundamental national values of equality of liberty and opportunity and in the irrepressible American spirit .
And I believe that each of us must be as vigilant and protective of the rights of equality and opportunity of our fellow Americans as we are of our own , and honor our obligations to our nation and future generations of Americans .
Nearly all of us have an ideal of what America ought to be .
My ideal was shaped by elementary school teachers who taught us that George Washington did n't lie and took responsibility for his actions .
An ideal framed in the classroom by portraits of presidents on the wall , looking down on us from their lofty perches in history .
Biographies of Jefferson , Lincoln , and Teddy Roosevelt .
And Benjamin Franklin .
Stories about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn .
Frank and Joe Hardy .
An ideal shaped by Fourth of July parades in my small hometown of Rupert , Idaho .
An ideal passed on by a high school teacher , Elizabeth Toolson , who made me believe , as did she , that a poor boy born in Texas and raised in Idaho could go to Harvard .
At Harvard , Professors Oscar Handlin and Frank Freidel taught me how powerful ideas and working people built the country , and saved it more than a few times .
My ideal of America was also shaped by the Vietnam War , and by the protests against it .
The struggle for civil rights and the death of Martin Luther King , Jr. The Apollo project and Neil Armstrong 's first steps on the moon .
The OPEC oil crises and the Persian Gulf War .
The stock market crash of 1987 and the greatest bull market in Wall Street history .
Presidential impeachment and the collapse of the Soviet Union .
More than thirty years in journalism have revealed the best and the worst of us , the base and the uplifting , the ordinary and the spectacular , the cruel and the truly good , including all that this country can accomplish and all that it is capable of becoming .
After the tragedy of September 11 , the corporate corruption scandals , and now the war in Iraq , I cannot imagine most Americans are content to allow our elites to continue to further debase the ideals of our nation and determine our course into the future .
Both of our major political parties have become little more than well - funded marketing organizations , advertising brands that the corporate and special - interest elites manage for their own benefits , with almost no regard for the common good and the national interest .
We have much to overcome , and much to do .
That 's why I 'm an in de pen dent and a populist .
I no longer believe the Republican and Democratic parties are capable of serving the people :
Their priorities and focus are the special interests and corporatists who fund them , and now direct them and the rest of us .
The consent of the governed is the foundation of our government and its endurance over the past two hundred years .
If the American people are to prevail against the challenges of the next two hundred years , we must end our apathetic and uninformed acquiescence to elitist unrepresentative governance and demand that our political leaders respectfully seek our consent rather than take for granted our submission .
I believe that only the energized , active engagement and participation of our citizens at every level of politics and government will change our national direction .
We will succeed if the vast majority of us can reject partisanship and end what are nothing more than brand loyalties to the Democratic and Republican parties , and replace those partisan brands with a passionate commitment to our ideals of in dependence and equality , to the common good and the national interest .
Populism requires no political apparatus , no party machine .
Populism as a philosophy and movement requires only that we put our people and our national interest first , that we honor our Constitution and nation , and that we respect one another 's rights of individual liberty and equality of opportunity .
Populism requires that we Americans be neither timid nor retiring in asserting our rights and the equal rights of our fellow Americans , and that we prize our American heritage of self - reliance and compassion and our independence as a people and a nation .
I truly believe all of us should live every day as Independence Day .
We must make this our day , the day of the independent American .

WASHINGTON , Nov. 3 — The World Bank , newly caught up in the Bush administration ’s campaign against Iran , has had to suspend payments for earthquake relief , sanitation and other projects there in response to new American sanctions on leading Iranian banks , World Bank officials say .
Only $ 5.4 million in payments has been suspended for four projects , involving earthquake relief , water and sanitation , environment management and urban housing , the officials said , and they do not expect the suspensions to be permanent .
But the bank has no plan to resume payments because it is having trouble finding banks in Iran to handle them now that the United States has barred dealing with four of Iran ’s largest banks , accusing them of involvement in terrorism , or nuclear or missile programs .
“ At this point , the World Bank is looking for alternate ways to support these projects , ” said a bank official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
“ It is unknown how difficult that might be .
It is not that easy to find alternatives .
We have no answer on how or when at this point . ”
ONDON -- " This is n't about Islam . "
The world 's leaders have been repeating this mantra for weeks , partly in the virtuous hope of deterring reprisal attacks on innocent Muslims living in the West , partly because if the United States is to maintain its coalition against terror it can't afford to suggest that Islam and terrorism are in any way related .
The trouble with this necessary disclaimer is that it is n't true .
If this is n't about Islam , why the worldwide Muslim demonstrations in support of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda ?
Why did those 10,000 men armed with swords and axes mass on the Pakistan - Afghanistan frontier , answering some mullah 's call to jihad ?
Why are the war 's first British casualties three Muslim men who died fighting on the Taliban side ?
Why the routine anti-Semitism of the much - repeated Islamic slander that " the Jews " arranged the hits on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , with the oddly self - deprecating explanation offered by the Taliban leadership , among others , that Muslims could not have the technological know - how or organizational sophistication to pull off such a feat ?
Why does Imran Khan , the Pakistani ex-sports star turned politician , demand to be shown the evidence of Al Qaeda 's guilt while apparently turning a deaf ear to the self - incriminating statements of Al Qaeda 's own spokesmen ( there will be a rain of aircraft from the skies , Muslims in the West are warned not to live or work in tall buildings ) ?
Why all the talk about American military infidels desecrating the sacred soil of Saudi Arabia if some sort of definition of what is sacred is not at the heart of the present discontents ?
Of course this is " about Islam . "
The question is , what exactly does that mean ?
After all , most religious belief is n't very theological .
Most Muslims are not profound Koranic analysts .
For a vast number of " believing " Muslim men , " Islam " stands , in a jumbled , half - examined way , not only for the fear of God — the fear more than the love , one suspects — but also for a cluster of customs , opinions and prejudices that include their dietary practices ; the sequestration or near - sequestration of " their " women ; the sermons delivered by their mullahs of choice ; a loathing of modern society in general , riddled as it is with music , godlessness and sex ; and a more particularized loathing ( and fear ) of the prospect that their own immediate surroundings could be taken over — " Westoxicated " — by the liberal Western - style way of life .
Highly motivated organizations of Muslim men ( oh , for the voices of Muslim women to be heard ! ) have been engaged over the last 30 years or so in growing radical political movements out of this mulch of " belief . "
These Islamists — we must get used to this word , " Islamists , " meaning those who are engaged upon such political projects , and learn to distinguish it from the more general and politically neutral " Muslim " — include the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , the blood - soaked combatants of the Islamic Salvation Front and Armed Islamic Group in Algeria , the Shiite revolutionaries of Iran , and the Taliban .
Poverty is their great helper , and the fruit of their efforts is paranoia .
This paranoid Islam , which blames outsiders , " infidels , " for all the ills of Muslim societies , and whose proposed remedy is the closing of those societies to the rival project of modernity , is presently the fastest growing version of Islam in the world .
This is not wholly to go along with Samuel Huntington 's thesis about the clash of civilizations , for the simple reason that the Islamists ' project is turned not only against the West and " the Jews , " but also against their fellow Islamists .
Whatever the public rhetoric , there 's little love lost between the Taliban and Iranian regimes .
Dissensions between Muslim nations run at least as deep , if not deeper , than those nations ' resentment of the West .
Nevertheless , it would be absurd to deny that this self - exculpatory , paranoiac Islam is an ideology with widespread appeal .
Twenty years ago , when I was writing a novel about power struggles in a fictionalized Pakistan , it was already de rigueur in the Muslim world to blame all its troubles on the West and , in particular , the United States .
Then as now , some of these criticisms were well - founded ; no room here to rehearse the geopolitics of the cold war and America 's frequently damaging foreign policy " tilts , " to use the Kissinger term , toward ( or away from ) this or that temporarily useful ( or disapproved - of ) nation - state , or America 's role in the installation and deposition of sundry unsavory leaders and regimes .
But I wanted then to ask a question that is no less important now : Suppose we say that the ills of our societies are not primarily America 's fault , that we are to blame for our own failings ?
How would we understand them then ?
Might we not , by accepting our own responsibility for our problems , begin to learn to solve them for ourselves ?
Many Muslims , as well as secularist analysts with roots in the Muslim world , are beginning to ask such questions now .
In recent weeks Muslim voices have everywhere been raised against the obscurantist hijacking of their religion .
Yesterday 's hotheads ( among them Yusuf Islam , a k a Cat Stevens ) are improbably repackaging themselves as today 's pussycats .
An Iraqi writer quotes an earlier Iraqi satirist : " The disease that is in us , is from us . "
A British Muslim writes , " Islam has become its own enemy . "
A Lebanese friend , returning from Beirut , tells me that in the aftermath of the attacks on Sept. 11 , public criticism of Islamism has become much more outspoken .
Many commentators have spoken of the need for a Reformation in the Muslim world .
I 'm reminded of the way noncommunist socialists used to distance themselves from the tyrannical socialism of the Soviets ; nevertheless , the first stirrings of this counterproject are of great significance .
If Islam is to be reconciled with modernity , these voices must be encouraged until they swell into a roar .
Many of them speak of another Islam , their personal , private faith .
The restoration of religion to the sphere of the personal , its depoliticization , is the nettle that all Muslim societies must grasp in order to become modern .
The only aspect of modernity interesting to the terrorists is technology , which they see as a weapon that can be turned on its makers .
If terrorism is to be defeated , the world of Islam must take on board the secularist - humanist principles on which the modern is based , and without which Muslim countries ' freedom will remain a distant dream .
Salman Rushdie is the author , most recently , of " Fury : A Novel . "
A good observation from Henry Farrell :
As an aside – one of the most aggravating things about Saletan , Sullivan , Douthat etc ’s embrace of the scientiness of race and IQ is that they seem to have convinced themselves that they are bold truthsayers fearlessly committed to challenging commonly accepted falsehoods etc etc etc .
Quite so .
In particular , Saletan and my bloggy colleagues seem to have convinced themselves that there 's overwhelming opposition in public opinion to the view that whites are intrinsically smarter than blacks and also that there 's strong scientific consensus in favor of that hypothesis .
As best I can tell , however , neither is true .
The " black genes make you dumb " crowd is siding with widely - held popular prejudice against what most researchers believe .
Now , of course , that does n't mean the racialists are wrong .
It 's entirely possible that the sort of views about black inferiority that were sufficiently widely and strongly held as to provide key ideological support for centuries of enslavement , imperial conquest , Jim Crow , etc. and had public support for desegregation in the low thirties and trending down as recently as 1978 are correct .
Maybe the slave - owners , white supremacists , imperialists , etc. were right all along about the facts of the matter but simply drew the wrong normative conclusions .
Maybe the scientific consensus over the past handful of decades is a mistake -- an ideology - driven overreaction to an ethical backlash against white supremacists .
But if that 's your hypothesis , it should be seen as what it is , the hypothesis that a long - established widely - held popular prejudice is correct and the more recent expert consensus is mistaken .
And of course one wonders why it is that Saletan is saying things like " I 've been soaking my head in each side 's computations and arguments .
They 're incredibly technical . "
Is Saletan a technical expert in the relevant fields and therefore felt a need to adjudicate ?
No .
So what 's the prurient interest in race science ?
And I say it 's a prurient interest precisely because Saletan does n't go on to draw any sweeping white supremacist conclusions .
Indeed , he concedes that there 's evidence of a trend toward a narrowing of the black - white IQ gap that may in the future close the gap to zero , he just offers the opinion -- speaking as a non-technician whose decided to enter a debate he regards as highly technical -- that it probably wo n't .
So he 's not entirely sure he 's right that blacks are genetically inferior , and he does n't think this fact has any clear implications for public policy or how we should interact with individuals we encounter in our daily lives , but he just thinks it 's really important to go on record with the view that blacks are inferior .
Why ?
Given the source , the diagnosis of knee - jerk contrarianism run amok seems most appropriate but it 's pretty odd .

Shumail Raj ( left ) and Shahzina Tariq are the focus of attention
Last week the court ruled that the husband was , in fact , a woman , despite sex - change surgery and that the couple had lied about his sexual status .
It also said their marriage was un -Islamic because it was same - sex .
The case is believed the first of its kind in Pakistan .
The couple said they would appeal against the sentence and have asked President Musharraf to help .
Shumail Raj , 31 , had sex - change surgery to become a man and then married his cousin - who was aware of the condition but says she needed his help to avoid being forced into wedlock with someone else .
' Lenient '
He is reported to have undergone surgery twice in Pakistan over the past 16 years to become a man .
But tests carried out by doctors on behalf of the court ruled that Raj , who has a beard an moustache , was still a woman .
He himself says that he needs to go abroad for more treatment even though his breasts and uterus have been removed .
Shumail Raj has appealed to President Musharraf for help
The judge , Khawaja Mohammad Sharif , said he was issuing a " lenient " sentence , below the maximum punishment , because the couple had apologised , the Associated Press news agency reports .
He also asked them to pay a fine of 10,000 Pakistani rupees ( $ 165 ) .
Reports said Mr Raj and his 24 - year - old wife Shahzina Tariq appeared shocked by the verdict .
" We appeal to President Musharraf to intervene .
Mr Musharraf is talking about moderation and enlightenment .
We hope he will do something for us , " Mr Raj said .
' Against Islam '
Earlier , the couple told the court that they had got married so that the wife could avoid an arranged marriage .
The bride 's father wants to annul the wedding on the grounds that it is against Islam for two women to marry .
But the couple argue that they married to protect the bride from being sold into marriage to pay off her uncle 's gambling debts .
Shahzina
Tariq says they are not homosexuals and they married because they are in love .
The two were arrested a fortnight ago after the bride 's family complained about the gender of her husband .
Demolition of public housing in N.O. draws protest
NEW ORLEANS  Federal officials began demolishing a local housing project Thursday despite protesters who angrily decried the destruction , saying the hurricane - ravaged city needs to preserve its affordable housing .
About 30 protesters had stood Wednesday in the path of a two - story excavator , temporarily blocking the demolition crew 's path into the B.W. Cooper housing development in central New Orleans .
Thursday 's gathering was less confrontational and crews began demolishing one section of the development .
Another part of the complex will remain open .
About 50 protesters marched from the housing project to City Hall and the New Orleans office of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) .
" There is a terrible housing crisis in our city and the country needs to know about it , " said Elizabeth Cook , a member of the Coalition to Stop Demolition , which organized the protests .
Just behind her , the large excavator chewed into one of the four - story buildings .
HUD officials sealed most of the city 's public housing projects following Hurricane Katrina and revived plans to demolish and replace them with mixed - income housing .
Demolition was approved for four of the city 's largest developments — B.W. Cooper , St. Bernard , Lafitte and C.J. Peete — which account for about 4,500 public housing units .
Some of the properties , in decay already , were further battered by Katrina 's floods .
B.W. Cooper was the first of the projects to be demolished .
Protesters and civil rights groups said some of the buildings are still habitable and new plans will lead to increased homelessness if more government - subsidized units are not included .
About 5,100 families were living in public housing pre-Katrina , according to HUD .
Knocking down dilapidated projects for mixed - income housing is a national trend that often leaves the poorest families homeless , said Sheila Crowley , president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition , a Washington - based housing advocacy and research group .
Debate over how much public housing to replace in post - Katrina New Orleans has even entangled two Louisiana senators .
Legislation proposed by Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu calls for " one - for - one " replacement of the government - subsidized apartments .
Republican Sen. David Vitter leads opposition to the bill , saying that with only two - thirds of New Orleans ' population back since Katrina , the need for public housing has diminished .
Che Guevara , who did so much ( or was it so little ? ) to destroy capitalism , is now a quintessential capitalist brand .
His likeness adorns mugs , hoodies , lighters , key chains , wallets , baseball caps , toques , bandannas , tank tops , club shirts , couture bags , denim jeans , herbal tea , and of course those omnipresent T - shirts with the photograph , taken by Alberto Korda , of the socialist heartthrob in his beret during the early years of the revolution , as Che happened to walk into the photographers viewfinder and into the image that , thirty - eight years after his death , is still the logo of revolutionary ( or is it capitalist ? ) chic .
Sean OHagan claimed in The Observer that there is even a soap powder with the slogan  Che washes whiter . 
Che products are marketed by big corporations and small businesses , such as the Burlington Coat Factory , which put out a television commercial depicting a youth in fatigue pants wearing a Che T - shirt , or Flamingos Boutique in Union City , New Jersey , whose owner responded to the fury of local Cuban exiles with this devastating argument :  I sell whatever people want to buy . 
Revolutionaries join the merchandising frenzy , too from  The Che Store ,  catering to all your revolutionary needs on the Internet , to the Italian writer Gianni Minà , who sold Robert Redford the movie rights to Ches diary of his juvenile trip around South America in 1952 in exchange for access to the shooting of the film The Motorcycle Diaries so that Minà could produce his own documentary .
Not to mention Alberto Granado , who accompanied Che on his youthful trip and advises documentarists , and now complains in Madrid , according to El País , over Rioja wine and duck magret , that the American embargo against Cuba makes it hard for him to collect royalties .
To take the irony further : the building where Guevara was born in Rosario , Argentina , a splendid early twentieth - century edifice at the corner of Urquiza and Entre Ríos Streets , was until recently occupied by the private pension fund AFJP Máxima , a child of Argentinas privatization of social security in the 1990s .
The metamorphosis of Che Guevara into a capitalist brand is not new , but the brand has been enjoying a revival of latean especially remarkable revival , since it comes years after the political and ideological collapse of all that Guevara represented .
This windfall is owed substantially to The Motorcycle Diaries , the film produced by Robert Redford and directed by Walter Salles .
( It is one of three major motion pictures on Che either made or in the process of being made in the last two years ; the other two have been directed by Josh Evans and Steven Soderbergh . )
Beautifully shot against landscapes that have clearly eluded the eroding effects of polluting capitalism , the film shows the young man on a voyage of self - discovery as his budding social conscience encounters social and economic exploitation laying the ground for a New Wave re-invention of the man whom Sartre once called the most complete human being of our era .
But to be more precise , the current Che revival started in 1997 , on the thirtieth anniversary of his death , when five biographies hit the bookstores , and his remains were discovered near an airstrip at Bolivias Vallegrande airport , after a retired Bolivian general , in a spectacularly timed revelation , disclosed the exact location .
The anniversary refocused attention on Freddy Albortas famous photograph of Ches corpse laid out on a table , foreshortened and dead and romantic , looking like Christ in a Mantegna painting .
It is customary for followers of a cult not to know the real life story of their hero , the historical truth .
( Many Rastafarians would renounce Haile Selassie if they had any notion of who he really was . )
It is not surprising that Guevaras contemporary followers , his new post - communist admirers , also delude themselves by clinging to a myth except the young Argentines who have come up with an expression that rhymes perfectly in Spanish :  Tengo una remera del Che y no sé por qué ,  or  I have a Che T - shirt and I dont know why . 
Consider some of the people who have recently brandished or invoked Guevaras likeness as a beacon of justice and rebellion against the abuse of power .
In Lebanon , demonstrators protesting against Syria at the grave of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri carried Ches image .
Thierry Henry , a French soccer player who plays for Arsenal , in England , showed up at a major gala organized by FIFA , the worlds soccer body , wearing a red and black Che T - shirt .
In a recent review in The New York Times of George A. Romeros Land of the Dead , Manohla Dargis noted that  the greatest shock here may be the transformation of a black zombie into a righteous revolutionary leader ,  and added ,  I guess Che really does live , after all . 
The soccer hero Maradona showed off the emblematic
Che tattoo on his right arm during a trip where he met Hugo Chávez in Venezuela .
In Stavropol , in southern Russia , protesters denouncing cash payments of welfare concessions took to the central square with Che flags .
In San Francisco , City Lights Books , the legendary home of beat literature , treats visitors to a section devoted to Latin America in which half the shelves are taken up by Che books .
José Luis Montoya , a Mexican police officer who battles drug crime in Mexicali , wears a Che sweatband because it makes him feel stronger .
At the Dheisheh refugee camp on the West Bank , Che posters adorn a wall that pays tribute to the Intifada .
A Sunday magazine devoted to social life in Sydney , Australia , lists the three dream guests at a dinner party : Alvar Aalto , Richard Branson , and Che Guevara .
Leung Kwok - hung , the rebel elected to Hong Kongs Legislative Council , defies Beijing by wearing a Che T - shirt .
In Brazil , Frei Betto , President Lula da Silvas adviser in charge of the high - profile  Zero Hunger program , says that we should have paid less attention to Trotsky and much more to Che Guevara . 
And most famously , at this years Academy Awards ceremony Carlos Santana and Antonio Banderas performed the theme song from The Motorcycle Diaries , and Santana showed up wearing a Che T - shirt and a crucifix .
The manifestations of the new cult of Che are everywhere .
Once again the myth is firing up people whose causes for the most part represent the exact opposite of what Guevara was .
No man is without some redeeming qualities .
In the case of Che Guevara , those qualities may help us to measure the gulf that separates reality from myth .
His honesty ( well , partial honesty ) meant that he left written testimony of his cruelties , including the really ugly , though not the ugliest , stuff .
His courage what Castro described as his way , in every difficult and dangerous moment , of doing the most difficult and dangerous thing meant that he did not live to take full responsibility for Cubas hell .
Myth can tell you as much about an era as truth .
And so it is that thanks to Ches own testimonials to his thoughts and his deeds , and thanks also to his premature departure , we may know exactly how deluded so many of our contemporaries are about so much .
Guevara might have been enamored of his own death , but he was much more enamored of other peoples deaths .
In April 1967 , speaking from experience , he summed up his homicidal idea of justice in his  Message to the Tricontinental : hatred as an element of struggle ; unbending hatred for the enemy , which pushes a human being beyond his natural limitations , making him into an effective , violent , selective , and cold - blooded killing machine .
His earlier writings are also peppered with this rhetorical and ideological violence .
Although his former girlfriend Chichina Ferreyra doubts that the original version of the diaries of his motorcycle trip contains the observation that  I feel my nostrils dilate savoring the acrid smell of gunpowder and blood of the enemy ,  Guevara did share with Granado at that very young age this exclamation :  Revolution without firing a shot ?
You re crazy .
At other times the young bohemian seemed unable to distinguish between the levity of death as a spectacle and the tragedy of a revolutions victims .
In a letter to his mother in 1954 , written in Guatemala , where he witnessed the overthrow of the revolutionary government of Jacobo Arbenz , he wrote :  It was all a lot of fun , what with the bombs , speeches , and other distractions to break the monotony I was living in . 
Guevaras disposition when he traveled with Castro from Mexico to Cuba aboard the Granma is captured in a phrase in a letter to his wife that he penned on January 28 , 1957 , not long after disembarking , which was published in her book Ernesto : A Memoir of Che Guevara in Sierra Maestra :  Here in the Cuban jungle , alive and bloodthirsty . 
This mentality had been reinforced by his conviction that Arbenz had lost power because he had failed to execute his potential enemies .
An earlier letter to his former girlfriend Tita Infante had observed that if there had been some executions , the government would have maintained the capacity to return the blows . 
It is hardly a surprise that during the armed struggle against Batista , and then after the triumphant entry into Havana , Guevara murdered or oversaw the executions in summary trials of scores of people proven enemies , suspected enemies , and those who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time .
In January 1957 , as his diary from the Sierra Maestra indicates , Guevara shot Eutimio Guerra because he suspected him of passing on information :  I ended the problem with a .32 caliber pistol , in the right side of his brain ....
His belongings were now mine .
Later he shot Aristidio , a peasant who expressed the desire to leave whenever the rebels moved on .
While he wondered whether this particular victim was really guilty enough to deserve death ,  he had no qualms about ordering the death of Echevarría , a brother of one of his comrades , because of unspecified crimes :  He had to pay the price . 
At other times he would simulate executions without carrying them out , as a method of psychological torture .
Luis Guardia and Pedro Corzo , two researchers in Florida who are working on a documentary about Guevara , have obtained the testimony of Jaime Costa Vázquez , a former commander in the revolutionary army known as El Catalán ,  who maintains that many of the executions attributed to Ramiro Valdés , a future interior minister of Cuba , were Guevaras direct responsibility , because Valdés was under his orders in the mountains .
 If in doubt , kill him were Ches instructions .
On the eve of victory , according to Costa , Che ordered the execution of a couple dozen people in Santa Clara , in central Cuba , where his column had gone as part of a final assault on the island .
Some of them were shot in a hotel , as Marcelo Fernándes - Zayas , another former revolutionary who later became a journalist , has written adding that among those executed , known as casquitos , were peasants who had joined the army simply to escape unemployment .
But the cold - blooded killing machine  did not show the full extent of his rigor until , immediately after the collapse of the Batista regime , Castro put him in charge of La Cabaña prison .
( Castro had a clinically good eye for picking the right person to guard the revolution against infection . )
San Carlos de La Cabaña was a stone fortress used to defend Havana against English pirates in the eighteenth century ; later it became a military barracks .
In a manner chillingly reminiscent of Lavrenti Beria , Guevara presided during the first half of 1959 over one of the darkest periods of the revolution .
José Vilasuso , a lawyer and a professor at Universidad Interamericana de Bayamón in Puerto Rico , who belonged to the body in charge of the summary judicial process at La Cabaña , told me recently that
Che was in charge of the Comisión Depuradora .
The process followed the law of the Sierra : there was a military court and Ches guidelines to us were that we should act with conviction , meaning that they were all murderers and the revolutionary way to proceed was to be implacable .
My direct superior was Miguel Duque Estrada .
My duty was to legalize the files before they were sent on to the Ministry .
Executions took place from Monday to Friday , in the middle of the night , just after the sentence was given and automatically confirmed by the appellate body .
On the most gruesome night I remember , seven men were executed .
Javier Arzuaga , the Basque chaplain who gave comfort to those sentenced to die and personally witnessed dozens of executions , spoke to me recently from his home in Puerto Rico .
A former Catholic priest , now seventy - five , who describes himself as closer to Leonardo Boff and Liberation Theology than to the former Cardinal Ratzinger ,  he recalls that
there were about eight hundred prisoners in a space fit for no more than three hundred : former Batista military and police personnel , some journalists , a few businessmen and merchants .
The revolutionary tribunal was made of militiamen .
Che Guevara presided over the appellate court .
He never overturned a sentence .
I would visit those on death row at the galera de la muerte .
A rumor went around that I hypnotized prisoners because many remained calm , so Che ordered that I be present at the executions .
After I left in May , they executed many more , but I personally witnessed fifty - five executions .
There was an American , Herman Marks , apparently a former convict .
We called him  the butcher because he enjoyed giving the order to shoot .
I pleaded many times with Che on behalf of prisoners .
I remember especially the case of Ariel Lima , a young boy .
Che did not budge .
Nor did Fidel , whom I visited .
I became so traumatized that at the end of May 1959 I was ordered to leave the parish of Casa Blanca , where La Cabaña was located and where I had held Mass for three years .
I went to Mexico for treatment .
The day I left ,
Che told me we had both tried to bring one another to each others side and had failed .
His last words were :  When we take our masks off , we will be enemies . 
How many people were killed at La Cabaña ?
Pedro Corzo offers a figure of some two hundred , similar to that given by Armando Lago , a retired economics professor who has compiled a list of 179 names as part of an eight - year study on executions in Cuba .
Vilasuso told me that four hundred people were executed between January and the end of June in 1959 ( at which point Che ceased to be in charge of La Cabaña ) .
Secret cables sent by the American Embassy in Havana to the State Department in Washington spoke of over 500 . 
According to Jorge Castañeda , one of Guevaras biographers , a Basque Catholic sympathetic to the revolution , the late Father Iñaki de Aspiazú , spoke of seven hundred victims .
Félix Rodríguez , a CIA agent who was part of the team in charge of the hunt for Guevara in Bolivia , told me that he confronted Che after his capture about  the two thousand or so executions for which he was responsible during his lifetime .
 He said they were all CIA agents and did not address the figure ,  Rodríguez recalls .
The higher figures may include executions that took place in the months after Che ceased to be in charge of the prison .
Which brings us back to Carlos Santana and his chic
Che gear .
In an open letter published in El Nuevo Herald on March 31 of this year , the great jazz musician Paquito DRivera castigated Santana for his costume at the Oscars , and added :  One of those Cubans [ at La Cabaña ] was my cousin Bebo , who was imprisoned there precisely for being a Christian .
He recounts to me with infinite bitterness how he could hear from his cell in the early hours of dawn the executions , without trial or process of law , of the many who died shouting ,  Long live Christ the King !  
Ches lust for power had other ways of expressing itself besides murder .
The contradiction between his passion for travel a protest of sorts against the constraints of the nation - State and his impulse to become himself an enslaving state over others is poignant .
In writing about Pedro Valdivia , the conquistador of Chile , Guevara reflected :  He belonged to that special class of men the species produces every so often , in whom a craving for limitless power is so extreme that any suffering to achieve it seems natural .
He might have been describing himself .
At every stage of his adult life , his megalomania manifested itself in the predatory urge to take over other peoples lives and property , and to abolish their free will .
In 1958 , after taking the city of Sancti Spiritus , Guevara unsuccessfully tried to impose a kind of sharia , regulating relations between men and women , the use of alcohol , and informal gambling a puritanism that did not exactly characterize his own way of life .
He also ordered his men to rob banks , a decision that he justified in a letter to Enrique Oltuski , a subordinate , in November of that year :  The struggling masses agree to robbing banks because none of them has a penny in them . 
This idea of revolution as a license to re-allocate property as he saw fit led the Marxist Puritan to take over the mansion of an emigrant after the triumph of the revolution .
The urge to dispossess others of their property and to claim ownership of others  territory was central to Guevaras politics of raw power .
In his memoirs , the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser records that Guevara asked him how many people had left his country because of land reform .
When Nasser replied that no one had left , Che countered in anger that the way to measure the depth of change is by the number of people who feel there is no place for them in the new society . 
This predatory instinct reached a pinnacle in 1965 , when he started talking , God-like , about the  New Man that he and his revolution would create .
Ches obsession with collectivist control led him to collaborate on the formation of the security apparatus that was set up to subjugate six and a half million Cubans .
In early 1959 , a series of secret meetings took place in Tarará , near Havana , at the mansion to which Che temporarily withdrew to recover from an illness .
That is where the top leaders , including Castro , designed the Cuban police state .
Ramiro Valdés ,
Ches subordinate during the guerrilla war , was put in charge of G - 2 , a body modeled on the Cheka .
Angel Ciutah , a veteran of the Spanish Civil War sent by the Soviets who had been very close to Ramón Mercader , Trotskys assassin , and later befriended Che , played a key role in organizing the system , together with Luis Alberto Lavandeira , who had served the boss at La Cabaña .
Guevara himself took charge of G - 6 , the body tasked with the ideological indoctrination of the armed forces .
The U.S. - backed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 became the perfect occasion to consolidate the new police state , with the rounding up of tens of thousands of Cubans and a new series of executions .
As Guevara himself told the Soviet ambassador Sergei Kudriavtsev , counterrevolutionaries were never  to raise their head again . 
 Counterrevolutionary  is the term that was applied to anyone who departed from dogma .
It was the communist synonym for heretic .
Concentration camps were one form in which dogmatic power was employed to suppress dissent .
History attributes to the Spanish general Valeriano Weyler , the captain - general of Cuba at the end of the nineteenth century , the first use of the word concentration to describe the policy of surrounding masses of potential opponents in his case , supporters of the Cuban independence movement with barbed wire and fences .
How fitting that Cubas revolutionaries more than half a century later were to take up this indigenous tradition .
In the beginning , the revolution mobilized volunteers to build schools and to work in ports , plantations , and factories all exquisite photo - ops for Che the stevedore , Che the cane - cutter , Che the clothmaker .
It was not long before volunteer work became a little less voluntary : the first forced labor camp , Guanahacabibes , was set up in western Cuba at the end of 1960 .
This is how Che explained the function performed by this method of confinement :  [ We ] only send to Guanahacabibes those doubtful cases where we are not sure people should go to jail ... people who have committed crimes against revolutionary morals , to a lesser or greater degree ....
It is hard labor , not brute labor , rather the working conditions there are hard . 
This camp was the precursor to the eventual systematic confinement , starting in 1965 in the province of Camaguey , of dissidents , homosexuals , AIDS victims , Catholics , Jehovahs Witnesses , Afro-Cuban priests , and other such scum , under the banner of Unidades Militares de Ayuda a la Producción , or Military Units to Help Production .
Herded into buses and trucks , the unfit would be transported at gunpoint into concentration camps organized on the Guanahacabibes mold .
Some would never return ; others would be raped , beaten , or mutilated ; and most would be traumatized for life , as Néstor Almendross wrenching documentary Improper Conduct showed the world a couple of decades ago .
So Time magazine may have been less than accurate in August 1960 when it described the revolutions division of labor with a cover story featuring Che Guevara as the brain and Fidel Castro as the heart and Raúl Castro as the fist .
But the perception reflected Guevaras crucial role in turning Cuba into a bastion of totalitarianism .
Che was a somewhat unlikely candidate for ideological purity , given his bohemian spirit , but during the years of training in Mexico and in the ensuing period of armed struggle in Cuba he emerged as the communist ideologue infatuated with the Soviet Union , much to the discomfort of Castro and others who were essentially opportunists using whatever means were necessary to gain power .
When the would - be revolutionaries were arrested in Mexico in 1956 , Guevara was the only one who admitted that he was a communist and was studying Russian .
( He spoke openly about his relationship with Nikolai Leonov from the Soviet Embassy . )
During the armed struggle in Cuba , he forged a strong alliance with the Popular Socialist Party ( the islands Communist Party ) and with Carlos Rafael Rodríguez , a key player in the conversion of Castros regime to communism .
This fanatical disposition made
Che into a linchpin of the  Sovietization of the revolution that had repeatedly boasted about its independent character .
Very soon after the barbudos came to power , Guevara took part in negotiations with Anastas Mikoyan , the Soviet deputy prime minister , who visited Cuba .
He was entrusted with the mission of furthering Soviet - Cuban negotiations during a visit to Moscow in late 1960 .
( It was part of a long trip in which Kim Il Sungs North Korea was the country that impressed him  the most . )
Guevaras second trip to Russia , in August 1962 , was even more significant , because it sealed the deal to turn Cuba into a Soviet nuclear beachhead .
He met Khrushchev in Yalta to finalize details on an operation that had already begun and involved the introduction of forty - two Soviet missiles , half of which were armed with nuclear warheads , as well as launchers and some forty - two thousand soldiers .
After pressing his Soviet allies on the danger that the United States might find out what was happening , Guevara obtained assurances that the Soviet navy would intervene in other words , that Moscow was ready to go to war .
According to Philippe Gavis biography of Guevara , the revolutionary had bragged that this country is willing to risk everything in an atomic war of unimaginable destructiveness to defend a principle .
Just after the Cuban missile crisis ended with Khrushchev reneging on the promise made in Yalta and negotiating a deal with the United States behind Castros back that included the removal of American missiles from Turkey Guevara told a British communist daily :  If the rockets had remained , we would have used them all and directed them against the very heart of the United States , including New York , in our defense against aggression . 
And a couple of years later , at the United Nations , he was true to form :  As Marxists we have maintained that peaceful coexistence among nations does not include coexistence between exploiters and the exploited . 
Guevara distanced himself from the Soviet Union in the last years of his life .
He did so for the wrong reasons , blaming Moscow for being too soft ideologically and diplomatically , for making too many concessions unlike Maoist China , which he came to see as a haven of orthodoxy .
In October 1964 , a memo written by Oleg Daroussenkov , a Soviet official close to him , quotes Guevara as saying :  We asked the Czechoslovaks for arms ; they turned us down .
Then we asked the Chinese ; they said yes in a few days , and did not even charge us , stating that one does not sell arms to a friend . 
In fact , Guevara resented the fact that Moscow was asking other members of the communist bloc , including Cuba , for something in return for its colossal aid and political support .
His final attack on Moscow came in Algiers , in February 1965 , at an international conference , where he accused the Soviets of adopting the law of value ,  that is , capitalism .
His break with the Soviets , in sum , was not a cry for independence .
It was an Enver Hoxha like howl for the total subordination of reality to blind ideological orthodoxy .
The great revolutionary had a chance to put into practice his economic vision his idea of social justice as head of the National Bank of Cuba and of the Department of Industry of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform at the end of 1959 , and , starting in early 1961 , as minister of industry .
The period in which Guevara was in charge of most of the Cuban economy saw the near - collapse of sugar production , the failure of industrialization , and the introduction of rationing all this in what had been one of Latin Americas four most economically successful countries since before the Batista dictatorship .
His stint as head of the National Bank , during which he printed bills signed  Che ,  has been summarized by his deputy , Ernesto Betancourt :  [ He ] was ignorant of the most elementary economic principles . 
Guevaras powers of perception regarding the world economy were famously expressed in 1961 , at a hemispheric conference in Uruguay , where he predicted a 10 percent rate of growth for Cuba  without the slightest fear ,  and , by 1980 , a per capita income greater than that of  the U.S. today .
In fact , by 1997 , the thirtieth anniversary of his death , Cubans were dieting on a ration of five pounds of rice and one pound of beans per month ; four ounces of meat twice a year ; four ounces of soybean paste per week ; and four eggs per month .
Land reform took land away from the rich , but gave it to the bureaucrats , not to the peasants .
( The decree was written in Ches house . )
In the name of diversification , the cultivated area was reduced and manpower distracted toward other activities .
The result was that between 1961 and 1963 , the harvest was down by half , to a mere 3.8 million metric tons .
Was this sacrifice justified by progress in Cuban industrialization ?
Unfortunately , Cuba had no raw materials for heavy industry , and , as a consequence of the revolutionary redistribution , it had no hard currency with which to buy them or even basic goods .
By 1961 , Guevara was having to give embarrassing explanations to the workers at the office :  Our technical comrades at the companies have made a toothpaste ... which is as good as the previous one ; it cleans just the same , though after a while it turns to stone .
By 1963 , all hopes of industrializing Cuba were abandoned , and the revolution accepted its role as a colonial provider of sugar to the Soviet bloc in exchange for oil to cover its needs and to re-sell to other countries .
For the next three decades , Cuba would survive on a Soviet subsidy of somewhere between $ 65 billion and $ 100 billion .
Having failed as a hero of social justice , does Guevara deserve a place in the history books as a genius of guerrilla warfare ?
His greatest military achievement in the fight against Batistataking the city of Santa Clara after ambushing a train with heavy reinforcements is seriously disputed .
Numerous testimonies indicate that the commander of the train surrendered in advance , perhaps after taking bribes .
( Gutiérrez Menoyo , who led a different guerrilla group in that area , is among those who have decried Cubas official account of Guevaras victory . )
Immediately after the triumph of the revolution , Guevara organized guerrilla armies in Nicaragua , the Dominican Republic , Panama , and Haitiall of which were crushed .
In 1964 , he sent the Argentine revolutionary Jorge Ricardo Masetti to his death by persuading him to mount an attack on his native country from Bolivia , just after representative democracy had been restored to Argentina .
Particularly disastrous was the Congo expedition in 1965 .
Guevara sided with two rebels Pierre Mulele in the west and Laurent Kabila in the east against the ugly Congolese government , which was sustained by the United States as well as by South African and exiled Cuban mercenaries .
Mulele had taken over Stanleyville earlier before being driven back .
During his reign of terror , as V.S. Naipaul has written , he murdered all the people who could read and all those who wore a tie .
As for Guevaras other ally , Laurent Kabila , he was merely lazy and corrupt at the time ; but the world would find out in the 1990s that he , too , was a killing machine .
In any event , Guevara spent most of 1965 helping the rebels in the east before fleeing the country ignominiously .
Soon afterward , Mobutu came to power and installed a decades - long tyranny .
( In Latin American countries too , from Argentina to Peru , Che - inspired revolutions had the practical result of reinforcing brutal militarism for many years . )
In Bolivia , Che was defeated again , and for the last time .
He misread the local situation .
There had been an agrarian reform years before ; the government had respected many of the peasant communities  institutions ; and the army was close to the United States despite its nationalism .
 The peasant masses dont help us at all was Guevaras melancholy conclusion in his Bolivian diary .
Even worse , Mario Monje , the local communist leader , who had no stomach for guerrilla warfare after having been humiliated at the elections , led Guevara to a vulnerable location in the southeast of the country .
The circumstances of Ches capture at Yuro ravine , soon after meeting the French intellectual Régis Debray and the Argentine painter Ciro Bustos , both of whom were arrested as they left the camp , was , like most of the Bolivian expedition , an amateurs affair .
Guevara was certainly bold and courageous , and quick at organizing life on a military basis in the territories under his control , but he was no General Giap .
His book Guerrilla Warfare teaches that popular forces can beat an army , that it is not necessary to wait for the right conditions because an insurrectional foco ( or small group of revolutionaries ) can bring them about , and that the fight must primarily take place in the countryside .
( In his prescription for guerrilla warfare , he also reserves for women the roles of cooks and nurses . )
However , Batistas army was not an army , but a corrupt bunch of thugs with no motivation and not much organization ; and guerrilla focos , with the exception of Nicaragua , all ended up in ashes for the foquistas ; and Latin America has turned 70 percent urban in these last four decades .
In this regard , too , Che Guevara was a callous fool .
In the last few decades of the nineteenth century , Argentina had the second - highest growth rate in the world .
By the 1890s , the real income of Argentine workers was greater than that of Swiss , German , and French workers .
By 1928 , that country had the twelfth - highest per capita GDP in the world .
That achievement , which later generations would ruin , was in large measure due to Juan Bautista Alberdi .
Like Guevara , Alberdi liked to travel : he walked through the pampas and deserts from north to south at the age of fourteen , all the way to Buenos Aires .
Like Guevara , Alberdi opposed a tyrant , Juan Manuel Rosas .
Like Guevara , Alberdi got a chance to influence a revolutionary leader in power Justo José de Urquiza , who toppled Rosas in 1852 .
And like Guevara , Alberdi represented the new government on world tours , and died abroad .
But unlike the old and new darling of the left , Alberdi never killed a fly .
His book , Bases y puntos de partida para la organización de la República Argentina , was the foundation of the Constitution of 1853 that limited government , opened trade , encouraged immigration , and secured property rights , thereby inaugurating a seventy - year period of astonishing prosperity .
He did not meddle in the affairs of other nations , opposing his countrys war against Paraguay .
His likeness does not adorn Mike Tysons abdomen .
Mr Cocker warned in a cable obtained by the Washington Post that unless Iraqi employees were given hope of finding safe haven in America they would quit , weakening the ability of the Bush administration to make an impact in Iraq .
He said that Iraqis in US government employment " work under extremely difficult conditions , and are targets for violence including murder and kidnapping .
Unless they know that there is some hope of a [ visa ] in future , many will continue to seek asylum , leaving our mission lacking in one of our most valuable assets " .
The US government and its main coalition partner in Iraq , Britain , have both been criticised by human rights and refugee organisations for failing to allow significant numbers of Iraqi asylum seekers into their countries .
The US has admitted 825 Iraqis since the invasion in 2003 .
The British government granted asylum to about 100 Iraqis between 2003 and 2005 , but figures since then are unknown .
It has refused to consider applications from among the 2 million Iraqis who have fled to Jordan , Syria and other neighbouring states .
In the wake of heavy criticism , the Bush administration expanded its Iraqi refugee programme , promising to admit 7,000 by October .
However , it has processed just 133 since last October .
The United Nations estimates that up to 20,000 Iraqis will never be able to return to Iraq .
Other countries have accepted many more Iraqi refugees .
Sweden has taken in more than any other nation , despite the fact that it is not part of the coalition .
Last week it emerged that Denmark had secretly airlifted out about 200 Iraqi interpreters and their families .
The move was made in advance of the imminent withdrawal of 470 Danish troops stationed in Iraq .
Yes , we had already photos of trucks missing one wheel on Russian roads , but they were without rear wheels .
Now meet the Russian truck without a front wheel moving across a public road in the left lane .
It seems that one wheel is enough to move , how about to turn ?

After the shutdown
Grrr ,
If only I 'd known they were going to shut it down in 1994 I 'd fully have dropped everything and gone again .
They should really announce things like that on national televison .
For the full story of the shutdown of the ride go to the history page .
Just before the shutdown the 20 Kers had a feeling something was up so took this final group shot .
( From the collection of Bill Schmidt , who 's in there somewhere . )
After the shutdown the subs sat in the lagoon for a while .
Is n't the stillness of the water eerie ?
I look at this picture and I just want to yell , " Hey !
You 've still got the water and the tracks and the submarines and all the anamatronics !
Just bring back the sailors and turn it back on ! "
These pictures were taken from the Skyway shortly after the shutdown .
Imagine diving off into there .
( Do n't do it . )
This pictures made me wish I 'd gone to sneak into Disney World at night and swim into the cave and see the giant squid still sleeping there .
Although if I had it would probably have scared me so bad I 'd panic and drown .
Satellite shot of the abandoned lagoon .
Meanwhile the subs went to the disney Bone Yard .
All I can say is , what an incredible waste of submarines .
You know what they should have done ?
They should have taken them all to the coast , pointed them due East , and just turned them on full speed .
The crews would have stood at attention on the shore as a 21 gun salute went off and the subs dissapeared into the sunset ( er , sunrise ) .
A 2002 Satellite shot of the Bone Yard , note that two subs are missing ; more on that to follow .
On the right there you see some of the icebergs from the caverns .
( Thank to Jeff Lange DVD for his sweet shot and many others in this gallery .
Thanks to Nick Petronella for hunting them down ! )
Cooool .
I 'm gonna cry .
They cut all their points off !
How could they !?
Just kidding , the subs never had long points like the Nautilus in the film .
Disney was afraid someone would get skewered ?
Now this is bizarre , I also found these photos where one of the subs is painted red ...
The site I found these on said the subs were being re-painted red as part of a rehabilitation of the ride , but William Babington wrote in to let me know that actually the red color refurbishment was done for color contrasting reasons as this was the sub that went to be sunk in the snorkeling lagoon of Disney 's Caribbean resort island , Castaway Cay .
Yes !
At one point you could have gone dive on the Nautilus on the last day of any Disney cruise !
Anyway , once they sunk it the contrast became just hues of blue , just like the film .
Who would have thought ?
Now look at this crazy photo Rich Allsmiller sent to Will !
I can only assume these subs are parked here while awaiting placement .
The red one went out into the lagoon and supposedly the green one was half buried in the sand somewhere so kids can play on it .
But then , what 's this ?
A sub a low tide ?
Here is is !
The sub in the ocean !
No idea what the netting over it is for .
Here 's Tony Crane 's spine tingling report of swimming near this sub :
" The sub at Castaway Cay is completely submerged …
With the top of the sub probably 6 feet under .
It DOES have a rope line around it …
But it lets you get fairly close , and if you wanted to it ’d be quite easy to get right up on it .
What kept me personally from doing this was the 4 foot long barracuda sitting right on top of it .
Honestly .
That thing was freaking me out .
But the sub looked at home there …
Fish swimming by it , completely underwater , in the ocean , not on a track …
And let me tell you , when you ’re floating along it , the thing is HUGE … It ’s almost eerie floating above something that big .
I probably spent 30 minutes just staring at it , knowing there was a chance I would n’t see it again .
They have a HUGE roped off area to snorkel in …
I mean literally acres big …
And the sub is located WAY out in a back corner of this area .
Basically , if you ’re out where the sub is at , you ’re there for a reason .
And there I was , the only person out around the sub at the time .
In fact , to be honest , it was a LOT of work to get back to shore afterward , I was exausted .
The other thing I would mention is that my cruise was the first ship back to Castaway Cay after the center of the hurricane ( Irene , I think ) bowled directly over it last Sept …
We did n’t even know if we were going to go to the island because they did n’t know it ’s condition when the cruise started .
But all the plants were dead from seawater , all the buildings showed some sign of wear from the storm …
But there the sub was , out in the extremely clear blue water , no worries at all .
It weathered the storm perfectly .
About the only weird thing was that a good portion of it was covered in what looked almost like cargo netting ?
Do n’t know what that was about .
Possibly to give ocean life a better foothold to grow upon ? "
Later reports say both Castaway Cay subs have dissapeared , perhaps removed by disney , perahps the victims of a hurricane , perhaps simply crumbled away , but who can say ?
I wish I 'd made it down there !
This is the cut off top of a sub that was in the shallow pool near the queue for the Disney MGM Studios Special Effects
Tour for a while .
It 's actually just the fiberglass outer hull from the dorsal fin forward .
My god kids , what are you looking at that could possibly be more interesting that that sub over there ??
Eventually the hull was removed from the queue area has been used for various special events and conventions since .
Here it appears in a diorama at an Epcot pin trading event .
That replica 20 K diving suit there used to be on display in the Living Seas in Epcot .
Between events the hull has been spotted on a trailer hanging out in various places around the park .
Jennifer sent in this shot she took in January of 07 from the back window of her bedroom window in the Beach Club Villas .
It appeared to be parked behind the Soarin ' building in Epcot , awaiting its next event .
Man , let 's hijack that thing and drive off with it ; would look so good in my yard !
Shortly after the shutdown Disney auctioned off most of the sub portholes on ebay .
Mounted porthole detail from an auction .
Years later we can see all the portholes gone as the subs rot away .
Years later , scrap dealer were given full access to the subs and stripped off everything that could conceivably be sold on ebay before the remaining subs were literally ground up and buried in the landfill .
( How wrong is that !
But there was also a rumor that one sub was sent to the Smithsonian Institution .
Probably not true , but if it is , how great is that ? )
Apparently the remains had to be buried in sealed containers because the paint contained lead , and Disney even tried to recall some of the parts the scrap dealers had bought .
So if you got a 20 K part on ebay , do n't lick it !
Inside not stripped bare .
Inside stripped bare .
What follows are numerous photos from 20 K parts auctions over the years .
Rider seat .
Sub control panels .
A later model than the one that appears on the Behind the Scenes page .
Note how on this even later edition contorl panel some of the sound controls have been removed .
This is probably from when the audio was switched from 8 - track to CD .
This is a later model audio control panel ; probably controlled the CD audio that replaced the original 8 - track .
Interior dome lights .
Top vent .
Some random panel .
Now they 're reaching bit who would pay for this ?
Okay , I would .
A windshield .
ED
Tucker spotted this ring from a Nautilus windshield just propped up on the wall in a Disney employee - only store .
How odd !
This box of replacement seaweed appeared on ebay in late 2003 .
The seaweed box above was bought by Marc Best , who gave me a piece .
I used it to decorate my bathroom .
Thanks Marc !
In my bathroom you 'll also find a seahorse tha was plucked from the doomed lagoon .
Big thanks to the man on the inside who nabbed it for me .
We have here corroded Mardi Gras coins fished from the lagoon pre-demolition .
( The small coins in front are various international coins with sealife on them . )
Here we have 20 Ker Mike Buchanan 's artifacts .
Picked up during a cleaning when he was told they were just going to be thrown out !
Presumably his seahorse is in much better shape than mine because it did n't bake in the sun for 10 years .
The green bit on the right is a piece torn off the dock Mike is a crazy fan like that !
Go man !
This shark was hanging in Sherry 's house !
It was given to her by one of the divers who did the inital animatronics removal in 1994 .
These photos are from the shark 's listing on ebay , where the starting bid was set to $ 8500 .
Of course it did n't sell , but you can't blame her for trying .
Look at those buck teeth !
That goofy eye !
Anatomically ridiculous and I love it .
These parts of one of the divers also showed up on ebay .
Why someone would separate them from the diver they belonged to is beyond me .
The documentation that came with them shows how one of parts fit on the body .
It would appear to be one of the Turtle Wranglin ' divers .
See how is says 1971 - 1994 ?
With this pin we see Disney 's first admission that the ride was dead for good .
Much later Disney released this commemorative pin .
In the bubble there are two thin cross-section slices of a 20 K sub porthole .
Whoop - dee - do .
How lame .
What 's crazy is that these actually go for almost $ 200 on ebay .
Yeah right !
The pin art is nice though .
Will sent in these shots of this great 12 " model of a 20 K ride sub artist Randy Noble did for the 35th anniversary of WDW .
A limited edition of 500 , they were sold for $ 75 at the Art of Disney Store in Epcot .
It 's a cold comfort , but thank you Disney , we appreciate it .
Okay , back to the story of the lagoon .
For many years the lagoon was called " Ariel 's Grotto " on the map ; pretty sad attempt at a cover up if you ask me .
These images are from March of 2003 .
( Thanks to my best bud Ben Coccio . )
Oh yes !
A spouting statue of King Titan ( or Tritan or Triton or whatever the hell his name is ) is a much better use of the lagoon than The Best Ride of All Time !
Stupid Disney .
( Excuse my harshness , I 'm a little bitter . )
The drinking fountains reminded us of better days ...
The cavern entrance had camo draped forlornly over it ; its waterfall run dry ....
The control room door was sealed forever ... ( or become a break room ) Strange , forboding crates sat on the loading dock ...
Birds of prey feasted on french fry carcasses that lined the shores of the once pristine lagoon ...
And what was once the waiting area for The Best Ride of All Time is was used as a meet - and - greet called the " Fantasyland Character Festival " ...
What !?
Oh and look !
It 's Ariel !
La-de - da !
You 're not even a real mermaid so why do n't you just get the heck out of here .
Someone should have told these kids all about the legendary 20 K ride that existed right on the very hallowed ground they 're standing on .
And then they would have had to to show proper reverence .
Then in 2004 Triton dissapeared and things started to get really ugly .
A green wall went up around the lagoon .
Then the lagoon was mostly drained .
Many thanks again the man on the inside ( who wishes to remain anonymous ) who sent in the amazing series of photos you 're about to see !
A starfish bakes in the harsh Florida sun .
Those crates were empty !
Views from the rear mountain .
Apparently walking on the sub track was rather precarious .
Our man went to great lenghts and faced great danger to bring these amazing shots to us .
We owe him everything .
The entrance to the drydock .
The empty drydock .
What those fake rocks are doing out in the drydock I have no idea .
Icebergs ?
The polar ice caps that never melted .
Okay , here 's where things get really amazing .
Prepair to be blown away .
A viking ship frozen in a iceberg !
I 've got chills .
Can you really believe all this stuff was down there in the water rotting silently for 10 years ?!
It 's reported that this ship was saved from destruction by Disney employees .
The Graveyard of Lost Ships .
The sharks that used to swim above it were removed after the initial shutdown in 1994 .
A mast fallen across the track .
Look out !
The Lost City of Atlantis !
Can you believe we 're seeing this ??
Do you see that tip of a tail on the left ?
Here he comes !
My god !
I mean can you really believe this ??
And here 's the twin on the other side of the track .
The treasure has certainly lost its luster over the years ...
After all the stress those Tottering Columns caused all those thousands of people , they never frigging fell !
Fall damn you !
Twin squids !!
I 'm gonna have a heart attack .
That eye is still horrifying .
The Nautili they used to grip appear to have fallen to pieces .
Fast forward a few months , the eyes have been saved for posterity .
A squid tentacle streched out on the catwalk .
Fast forward again here 's where things start to get really ugly ; you may want to get the children out of the room .
Though this squid was clearly destroyed , the other one was rescued and is in the possession of a Disney Imagineer .
Whew !
A Nautilus dome also saved for posterity .
It 's surprising how small all this was !
I tried to talk the guy who has the head into mounting it on his living room wall .
How fantastic would that be ?
Smashed .
Just smashed to bits .
Not a very fitting end if you ask me .
I 'm trying not to cry .
I 'm trying to be strong .
Meanwhile things were n't any prettier on the outside .
( This image is a huge panorama , you may really want to click on it . )
The lagoon was drained completely .
The waiting area was taken apart .
And all the coral was demolished .
Look at them , the guests here have no idea of the great loss happening right on the other side of that wall .
They did n't get the water fountains yet !
At least the demolition crew knew what they were doing was historic enough to warrant a commemorative T - shirt .
After the demolition the lagoon was partially filled in with dirt and they began to plant trees .
And here in mid 2005 we have a ' Pooh 's Playful Spot ' .
( Thanks to Miss M. Turner for these photos . )
Game Over .
End of story .
Have fun in your tree kid .
At least 20 K was not completely forgotten though the designers put a small , barely noticable knot above the door to Pooh 's house ...
It 's the Nautilus !
On October 21st , 2006 , I held a blast of a 20 K party to celebrate this site 's ' completion ' .
We watched the 20 K movie with the rules being to drink whenever :
- The Nautilus rams a ship
- The First Mate says ' Aye - aye Captain ! '
- The seal barks
- The Professor says Nemo is a genius
- Peter Lorrie says something sounds like a bad idea
- Kirk Douglas talks about escaping
- Kirk Douglas has to be restrained
- The melody from ' A Whale of a Tale ' is heard ( this one was a killer )
It was also a notable night in that we had no less than three 20 kride.com t- shirts in the same room AND a mermaid  that 's got to be a record !
My friends are wonderfully supportive of my madness .

Kucinich ' seriously thinking ' about forcing vote on Cheney impeachment Nick Juliano

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says he is so concerned about what he sees as the Bush administration 's push for a war with Iran that he is considering using a parliamentary measure to force the House of Representatives to vote on impeaching Vice President Dick Cheney .
" We 're preparing for another war , and they 're going to destroy America , " the Ohio Democrat said Thursday on the Ed Schultz show .
" We have a government in place right now that has to be challenged .
I 'm seriously thinking about calling a privileged resolution on impeachment of the vice president and forcing a vote on the floor of the House . "
A privileged resolution would force the full House to debate about whether to proceed with impeachment , but it remains unclear precisely how , when or whether Kucinich would be able to introduce such a resolution .
Privileged measures " may be called up on the floor whenever another measure is not already pending " and the House agrees to consider it , according to the Congressional Research Service .
Privileged measures can include questions of House privileges or resolutions of inquiry , according to the CRS report .
A conservative site set up to push for former President Bill Clinton 's impeachment lays out a strategy to bring such a measure to the House floor .
" According to Jerome Zeifman , however , it is possible that such a resolution could be called up for an immediate vote , " the Conservative Caucus site observes .
" But that option appears to be within the control of the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader . "
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who took control after last year 's Democratic takeover of Congress , maintained that impeachment is " off the table " as recently as this week in an interview with CNN .
Kucinich introduced a resolution calling for Cheney 's impeachment this spring .
Since then the bill has gained more than a dozen co-sponsors , but it seems to be dying a slow death in the House Judiciary Committee .
It 's chairman , John Conyers , has stood with Pelosi in refusing to debate the impeachment resolution or bring it to the House floor for a vote .
A Kucinich spokeswoman declined to comment when contacted by RAW STORY .
An official in the House Parliamentarian 's office did not return a call seeking comment .

Pentagon blocks testimony of former Marine prosecutor who alleges torture Jason Rhyne
Published : Thursday November 8 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email
This A former Marine Corps prosecutor was set to testify before Congress on Thursday that harsh interrogation techniques had tainted his case against an alleged Al Quaeda terrorist -- until a last minute email from the Pentagon told him not to .
Lt. Col. Stuart Crouch , a former lawyer with the Marines now working as a military judge , was prepared to tell a House Judiciary subcommittee about his refusal to prosecute suspected terrorist Mohamedou Slahi in 2004 after reportedly discovering that severe measures had been used to extract incriminating statements from the Guantanamo Bay detainee .
Crouch considers the methods used by interrogators to be torture , according to the Wall Street Journal , who first reported the story .
Crouch told the Journal that he had previously told superiors about the scheduled appearance and received no objection .
But on Wednesday he received an email informing him that the Pentagon 's general counsel had determined that " as a sitting judge and former prosecutor , it is improper for you to testify about matters still pending in the military court system , and you are not to appear before the Committee to testify tomorrow . "
House Judicary Chair John Conyers told the paper that he was " outraged that the Defense Department is refusing to allow Lt. Col .
Couch to testify before this committee , in his personal capacity and not on behalf of the government , concerning what he saw and heard relating to interrogation practices at Guantanamo . "
The committee is considering subpoenaing Couch 's testimony if the Pentagon does n't reverse course .
" Mr. Slahi , who is alleged to have helped recruit several of the Sept. 11 hijackers , is one of two high - value Guantanamo prisoners who were authorized to undergo ' special ' interrogation methods , " the Journal 's Jess Bravin writes .
" In addition to allegedly suffering physical beatings and death threats , Mr. Slahi was led to believe that the U.S. had taken his mother hostage and might ship her to Guantanamo Bay , where she would be the sole female amid hundreds of male prisoners . "
In a March interview with the Journal , Crouch had said his decision not to prosecute Slahi 's case was a difficult one : he had lost a friend in the Sept. 11 attacks , a co-pilot of the second plane to strike the World Trade Center towers .
" Here was somebody I felt was connected to 9/11 , but in our zeal to get information , we had compromised our ability to prosecute him , " Crouch said of Slahi at the time .
He told the paper that he informed former Army chief - prosecutor Col.
Bob Swann in 2004 that he was " morally opposed " to the interrogation techniques used against the detainee , and refused to participate in a prosecution on those grounds alone .
Testifying before Thursday 's House Judiciary hearing on the treatment of detainees -- where Couch was originally slated to appear -- a former Navy instructor categorically defined the controversial interrogation tactic of waterboarding as torture .
" Waterboarding is torture , period , " Malcolm Nance , an ex-interrogator himself , told the House panel .
" I believe that we must reject the use of the waterboard for prisoners and captives and cleanse this stain from our national honor . "
Newt Gingrich is n’t running !
The former House speaker , who once shut down the federal government because Bill Clinton gave him a bad seat on Air Force One , has decided that his extremely promising candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination will have to be nipped in the bud due to the tyranny of campaign finance reform .
“ The McCain - Feingold Act criminalizes politics , ” he growled to George Stephanopoulos , launching into an explanation about how the law would have cruelly required him to sever his ties with a political advocacy group in order to run for the most powerful job on the planet .
Who said campaign finance reform would n’t accomplish anything ?
But , look , here comes Alan Keyes !
The former Reagan administration official and career loser - of - elections seems to have snuck into the race while nobody was looking .
There he was , in the Republican debate at Morgan State University the other day , appearing absolutely the same as he did in 2004 , when he suddenly popped up in Illinois just in time to lose the Senate race to Barack Obama .
Before his unhappy collision with McCain - Feingold , Newt Gingrich had apparently surveyed the field and decided there was room for one more recovering womanizer among the front - runners .
Keyes must have checked out the second tier and detected the need for more unelectable right - wing candidates who are obsessed with abortion .
A recent study has shown a steep decline in literary reading among schoolchildren .
PHILIPPE PETIT - ROULET
In 1937 , twenty - nine per cent of American adults told the pollster George Gallup that they were reading a book .
In 1955 , only seventeen per cent said they were .
Pollsters began asking the question with more latitude .
In 1978 , a survey found that fifty - five per cent of respondents had read a book in the previous six months .
The question was even looser in 1998 and 2002 , when the General Social Survey found that roughly seventy per cent of Americans had read a novel , a short story , a poem , or a play in the preceding twelve months .
And , this August , seventy - three per cent of respondents to another poll said that they had read a book of some kind , not excluding those read for work or school , in the past year .
If you did n’t read the fine print , you might think that reading was on the rise .
You would n’t think so , however , if you consulted the Census Bureau and the National Endowment for the Arts , who , since 1982 , have asked thousands of Americans questions about reading that are not only detailed but consistent .
The results , first reported by the N.E.A. in 2004 , are dispiriting .
In 1982 , 56.9 per cent of Americans had read a work of creative literature in the previous twelve months .
The proportion fell to fifty - four per cent in 1992 , and to 46.7 per cent in 2002 .
Last month , the N.E.A. released a follow - up report , “ To Read or Not to Read , ” which showed correlations between the decline of reading and social phenomena as diverse as income disparity , exercise , and voting .
In his introduction , the N.E.A. chairman , Dana Gioia , wrote , “ Poor reading skills correlate heavily with lack of employment , lower wages , and fewer opportunities for advancement . ”
This decline is not news to those who depend on print for a living .
In 1970 , according to Editor & Publisher International Year Book , there were 62.1 million weekday newspapers in circulation — about 0.3 papers per person .
Since 1990 , circulation has declined steadily , and in 2006 there were just 52.3 million weekday papers — about 0.17 per person .
In January 1994 , forty - nine per cent of respondents told the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press that they had read a newspaper the day before .
In 2006 , only forty - three per cent said so , including those who read online .
Book sales , meanwhile , have stagnated .
The Book Industry Study Group estimates that sales fell from 8.27 books per person in 2001 to 7.93 in 2006 .
According to the Department of Labor , American households spent an average of a hundred and sixty - three dollars on reading in 1995 and a hundred and twenty - six dollars in 2005 .
In “ To Read or Not to Read , ” the N.E.A. reports that American households ’ spending on books , adjusted for inflation , is “ near its twenty - year low , ” even as the average price of a new book has increased .
More alarming are indications that Americans are losing not just the will to read but even the ability .
According to the Department of Education , between 1992 and 2003 the average adult ’s skill in reading prose slipped one point on a five - hundred - point scale , and the proportion who were proficient — capable of such tasks as “ comparing viewpoints in two editorials ” — declined from fifteen per cent to thirteen .
The Department of Education found that reading skills have improved moderately among fourth and eighth graders in the past decade and a half , with the largest jump occurring just before the No Child Left Behind
Act took effect , but twelfth graders seem to be taking after their elders .
Their reading scores fell an average of six points between 1992 and 2005 , and the share of proficient twelfth - grade readers dropped from forty per cent to thirty - five per cent .
The steepest declines were in “ reading for literary experience ” — the kind that involves “ exploring themes , events , characters , settings , and the language of literary works , ” in the words of the department ’s test - makers .
In 1992 , fifty - four per cent of twelfth graders told the Department of Education that they talked about their reading with friends at least once a week .
By 2005 , only thirty - seven per cent said they did .
The erosion is n’t unique to America .
Some of the best data come from the Netherlands , where in 1955 researchers began to ask people to keep diaries of how they spent every fifteen minutes of their leisure time .
Time - budget diaries yield richer data than surveys , and people are thought to be less likely to lie about their accomplishments if they have to do it four times an hour .
Between 1955 and 1975 , the decades when television was being introduced into the Netherlands , reading on weekday evenings and weekends fell from five hours a week to 3.6 , while television watching rose from about ten minutes a week to more than ten hours .
During the next two decades , reading continued to fall and television watching to rise , though more slowly .
By 1995 , reading , which had occupied twenty - one per cent of people ’s spare time in 1955 , accounted for just nine per cent .
The most striking results were generational .
In general , older Dutch people read more .
It would be natural to infer from this that each generation reads more as it ages , and , indeed , the researchers found something like this to be the case for earlier generations .
But , with later ones , the age - related growth in reading dwindled .
The turning point seems to have come with the generation born in the nineteen - forties .
By 1995 , a Dutch college graduate born after 1969 was likely to spend fewer hours reading each week than a little - educated person born before 1950 .
As far as reading habits were concerned , academic credentials mattered less than whether a person had been raised in the era of television .
The N.E.A. , in its twenty years of data , has found a similar pattern .
Between 1982 and 2002 , the percentage of Americans who read literature declined not only in every age group but in every generation — even in those moving from youth into middle age , which is often considered the most fertile time of life for reading .
We are reading less as we age , and we are reading less than people who were our age ten or twenty years ago .
There ’s no reason to think that reading and writing are about to become extinct , but some sociologists speculate that reading books for pleasure will one day be the province of a special “ reading class , ” much as it was before the arrival of mass literacy , in the second half of the nineteenth century .
They warn that it probably wo n’t regain the prestige of exclusivity ; it may just become “ an increasingly arcane hobby . ”
Such a shift would change the texture of society .
If one person decides to watch “ The Sopranos ” rather than to read Leonardo Sciascia ’s novella “ To Each His Own , ” the culture goes on largely as before — both viewer and reader are entertaining themselves while learning something about the Mafia in the bargain .
But if , over time , many people choose television over books , then a nation ’s conversation with itself is likely to change .
A reader learns about the world and imagines it differently from the way a viewer does ; according to some experimental psychologists , a reader and a viewer even think differently .
If the eclipse of reading continues , the alteration is likely to matter in ways that are n’t foreseeable .
WASHINGTON -- After 60 years of inattention and even denial by the U.S. media , newly - uncovered government documents in The National Archives and Library of Congress reveal that Prescott Bush , the grandfather of President George W. Bush , served as a business partner of and U.S. banking operative for the financial architect of the Nazi war machine from 1926 until 1942 , when Congress took aggressive action against Bush and his " enemy national " partners .
The documents also show that Bush and his colleagues , according to reports from the U.S. Department of the Treasury , tried to conceal their financial alliance with German industrialist Fritz Thyssen , a steel and coal baron who , beginning in the mid-1920s , personally funded Adolf Hitler 's rise to power by the subversion of democratic principle and German law .
Furthermore , the declassified records demonstrate that Bush and his associates , who included E. Roland Harriman , younger brother of American icon W. Averell Harriman , and George Herbert Walker , President Bush 's maternal great - grandfather , continued their dealings with the German industrial tycoon for nearly a year after the U.S. entered the war .
No Story ?
For six decades these historical facts have gone unreported by the mainstream U.S. media .
The essential facts have appeared on the Internet and in relatively obscure books , but were dismissed by the media and Bush family as undocumented diatribes .
This story has also escaped the attention of " official " Bush biographers , Presidential historians and publishers of U.S. history books covering World War II and its aftermath .
The White House did not respond to phone calls seeking comment .
The Summer of ' 42 The unraveling of the web of Bush - Harriman - Thyssen U.S. enterprises , all of which operated out of the same suite of offices at 39 Broadway in New York under the supervision of Prescott Bush , began with a story that ran simultaneously in the New York Herald - Tribune and Washington Post on July 31 , 1941 .
By then , the U.S. had been at war with Germany for nearly eight months .
" Hitler 's Angel Has $ 3 Million in U.S. Bank , " declared the front - page Herald - Tribune headline .
The lead paragraph characterized Fritz Thyssen as " Adolf Hitler 's original patron a decade ago . "
In fact , the steel and coal magnate had aggressively supported and funded Hitler since October 1923 , according to Thyssen 's autobiography , I Paid Hitler .
In that book , Thyssen also acknowledges his direct personal relationships with Adolf Hitler , Joseph Goebbels and Rudolf Hess .
The Herald - Tribune also cited unnamed sources who suggested Thyssen 's U.S. " nest egg " in fact belonged to " Nazi bigwigs " including Goebbels , Hermann Goering , Heinrich Himmler , or even Hitler himself .
Business is Business
The " bank , " founded in 1924 by W. Averell Harriman on behalf of Thyssen and his Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. of Holland , was Union Banking Corporation ( UBC ) of New York City .
According to government documents , it was in reality a clearing house for a number of Thyssen - controlled enterprises and assets , including as many as a dozen individual businesses .
UBC also bought and shipped overseas gold , steel , coal , and U.S. Treasury bonds .
The company 's activities were administered for Thyssen by a Netherlands - born , naturalized U.S. citizen named Cornelis Lievense , who served as president of UBC .
Roland Harriman was chairman and Prescott Bush a managing director .
The Herald - Tribune article did not identify Bush or Harriman as executives of UBC , or Brown Brothers Harriman , in which they were partners , as UBC 's private banker .
A confidential FBI memo from that period suggested , without naming the Bush and Harriman families , that politically prominent individuals were about to come under official U.S. government scrutiny as Hitler 's plunder of Europe continued unabated .
After the " Hitler 's Angel " article was published Bush and Harriman made no attempts to divest themselves of the controversial Thyssen financial alliance , nor did they challenge the newspaper report that UBC was , in fact , a de facto Nazi front organization in the U.S. Instead , the government documents show , Bush and his partners increased their subterfuge to try to conceal the true nature and ownership of their various businesses , particularly after the U.S. entered the war .
The documents also disclose that Cornelis Lievense , Thyssen 's personal appointee to oversee U.S. matters for his Rotterdam - based Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V. , via UBC for nearly two decades , repeatedly denied to U.S. government investigators any knowledge of the ownership of the Netherlands bank or the role of Thyssen in it .
Brown Brothers Harriman sent letters to the government seeking reconsideration of the seizures by using false information .
UBC 's original group of business associates included George Herbert Walker , President Bush 's maternal great - grandfather , who had a relationship with the Harriman family that began in 1919 .
In 1922 , Walker and W. Averell Harriman traveled to Berlin to set up the German branch of their banking and investment operations , which were largely based on critical war resources such as steel and coal .
The Walker - Harriman - created German industrial alliance also included partnership with another German titan who supported Hitler 's rise , Friedrich Flick , who partnered with Thyssen in the German Steel Trust that forged the Nazi war machine .
For his role in using slave labor and his own steel , coal and arms resources to build Hitler 's war effort , Flick was convicted at the Nuremberg trials and sentenced to prison .
The Family Business
In 1926 , after Prescott Bush had married Walker 's daughter , Dorothy , Walker brought Bush in as a vice president of the private banking and investment firm of W.A. Harriman & Co. , also located in New York .
Bush became a partner in the firm that later became Brown Brothers Harriman and the largest private investment bank in the world .
Eventually , Bush became a director of and stockholder in UBC .
However , the government documents note that Bush , Harriman , Lievense and the other UBC stockholders were in fact " nominees , " or phantom shareholders , for Thyssen and his Holland bank , meaning that they acted at the direct behest of their German client .
Seized On October 20 , 1942 , under authority of the Trading with the Enemy Act , the U.S. Congress seized UBC and liquidated its assets after the war .
The seizure is confirmed by Vesting Order No. 248 in the U.S. Office of the Alien Property Custodian and signed by U.S. Alien Property Custodian Leo T. Crowley .
In August , under the same authority , Congress had seized the first of the Bush - Harriman - managed Thyssen entities , Hamburg - American Line , under Vesting Order No. 126 , also signed by Crowley .
Eight days after the seizure of UBC , Congress invoked the Trading with the Enemy Act again to take control of two more Bush - Harriman - Thyssen businesses - Holland - American Trading Corp . ( Vesting Order No. 261 ) and Seamless Steel Equipment Corp .
( Vesting Order No. 259 ) .
The documents from the Archives also show that the Bushes and Harrimans shipped valuable U.S. assets , including gold , coal , steel and U.S. Treasury bonds , to their foreign clients overseas between 1931 - 33 , as Hitler engineered his rise to power .
Still No Story ?
Since 1942 , the information has not appeared in any U.S. news coverage of any Bush political campaign , nor has it been included in any of the major Bush family biographies .
It was , however , covered extensively in George H.W. Bush : The Unauthorized Biography , by Webster Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin .
Chaitkin's father served as an attorney in the 1940s for some of the victims of the Bush - Harriman - Thyssen businesses .
The book gave a detailed , accurate accounting of the Bush family 's long Nazi affiliation , but no mainstream U.S. media entity reported on or even investigated the allegations , despite careful documentation by the authors .
Major booksellers declined to distribute the book , which was dismissed by Bush supporters as biased and untrue .
Its authors struggled even to be reviewed in reputable newspapers .
That the book was published by Lyndon LaRouche 's organization undoubtedly made it easier to dismiss , but does not change the facts .
The essence of the story has been posted for years on various Internet sites , including BuzzFlash.com and TakeBackTheMedia.com , but no online media seem to have independently confirmed it .
In the 1990s , former U.S. Justice Department Nazi war crimes prosecutor John Loftus , now honorary president of the Florida Holocaust Museum , wrote a book and launched a web site ( <>www.john-loftus.com) which did breakthrough reporting , including establishing the link between Prescott Bush , Consolidated Silesian Steel Corporation and forced labor at Auschwitz .
Although the widely - respected Loftus established a successful international speaking career with his information , no U.S. newspaper or major TV news program acknowledged his decade of work , nor did he ever see many of the recently released documents .
Meanwhile , the mainstream media have apparently made no attempt since World War II to either verify or disprove the allegations of Nazi collaboration against the Bush family .
Instead , they have attempted to dismiss or discredit such Internet sites or " unauthorized " books without any journalistic inquiry or research into their veracity .
Loyal Defenders
The National Review ran an essay on September 1 by their White House correspondent Byron York , entitled " Annals of Bush - Hating . "
It begins mockingly : " Are you aware of the murderous history of George W. Bush - indeed , of the entire Bush family ?
Are you aware of the president 's Nazi sympathies ?
His crimes against humanity ?
And do you know , by the way , that George W. Bush is a certifiable moron ? "
York goes on to discredit the " Bush is a moron " IQ hoax , but fails to disprove the Nazi connection .
The more liberal Boston Globe ran a column September 29 by Reason magazine 's Cathy Young in which she referred to " Bush - o - phobes on the Internet " who " repeat preposterous claims about the Bush family 's alleged Nazi connections . "
Poles Tackle the Topic Newsweek Polska , the magazine 's Polish edition , published a short piece on the " Bush Nazi past " in its March 5 , 2003 edition .
The item reported that " the Bush family reaped rewards from the forced - labor prisoners in the Auschwitz concentration camp , " according to a copyrighted English - language translation from Scoop Media ( <>www.scoop.co.nz).
The story also reported the seizure of the various Bush - Harriman - Thyssen businesses .
Still Not Interested Major U.S. media outlets , including ABC News , NBC News , CNN , The New York Times , Washington Post , Washington Times , Los Angeles Times and Miami Herald , as well as Knight - Ridder Newspapers , have repeatedly declined to investigate the story when information regarding discovery of the documents was presented to them beginning Friday , August 29 .
Newsweek U.S. correspondent Michael Isikoff , famous for his reporting of big scoops during the Clinton - Lewinsky sexual affair of the 1990s , declined twice to accept an exclusive story based on the documents from the archives .
Aftermath In 1952 , Prescott Bush was elected to the U.S. Senate , with no press accounts about his well - concealed Nazi past .
There is no record of any U.S. press coverage of the Bush - Nazi connection during any political campaigns conducted by George Herbert Walker Bush , Jeb Bush , or George W. Bush , with the exception of a brief mention in an unrelated story in the Sarasota Herald Tribune in November 2000 and a brief but inaccurate account in The Boston Globe in 2001 .

CMU Wins 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge
11 robot vehicles entered the course and 6 were able to finish .
CMU came out on top while Stanford got second place — a reversal from 2005 's Grand Challenge .
Wikipedia has the complete race results .
I took pictures , and some video .
So did everyone else .
There 's a torrent for the complete DARPA webcast , but the video was very glitchy for me .
Highlights :
The customer reviews of Victorville 's hotels ( e.g .
“ On this stay I was alarmed by the condition of my room and was concerned about the types of people that were loitering about the walkways .
It seems this hotel is housing alot of displaced people , who seem to live there on a permanet basis : also alot of male truck drivers who watched us when we used the spa .
This is not a hotel you would take your family to . ” ) .
Hardly any militaristic cheerleading from the race announcers .
Terra
Max trying to plow through a building .
MIT 's vehicle smashing into the Cornell bot .
The moment when several bots reached a 4 - way stop at the same time , and everyone watching the video feed realizing that this could be the end of the race if the bots deadlocked , and then seeing the bots eventually work it out for themselves .
Commentary from MythBusters Jamie Hyneman and Grant Imahara , and overall a much better effort by DARPA to provide info during the race compared to previous years .
Being able to stand within a few feet of much of the course and practically feel the vehicles driving by .
DARPA 's decision to give teams the list of GPS waypoints only 5 minutes before the race , compared to two hours in 2005 .
Some people felt that in 2005 CMU violated the spirit of the competition by having a dozen people process the waypoints into a final route for their vehicle .
This comment from a DARPA traffic vehicle driver : “ ... this was not a game of horseshoes , having participated today for more then seven hours with the bots as a traffic vehicle driver you get a real taste of the what ifs when you are face to face with a vehicle like Terramax , I had to take evasive action to keep from getting run over today . ”
Not as highlighty :
The Circle K I stopped in that had 2 working gas pumps out of 36 , and a bathroom that made me think of a Francis Bacon painting .
DARPA 's scoring process being pretty opaque — what scores did the teams get ?
And why ?
DARPA has n't even revealed which vehicles got 5th and 6th place , as far as I know .
Overall the teams did better than I expected at handling the urban environment , with its lanes and curbs and moving obstacles .

A Taste of Haskell ( Functional Programming Language )
Description :
Haskell is the world 's leading purely functional programming language that offers a radical and elegant attack on the whole business of writing programs .
In the last two or three years there has been an explosion of interest in Haskell , and it is now being used for a bewildering variety of applications .
I was about to post video lectures in Business and Management when I found an amazing collection of undergraduate ( and a few graduate ) Computer Science video lecture courses .
Do n't forget to check my other posts on Computer Science and Theoretical Computer Science video lectures .
Here are this month 's video lectures , most of them from New Jersey Institute of Technology and some from Google , and other places .
In this tutorial , the lecturer will try to show you why programming in Haskell is such fun , and how it makes you think about programming in a new way .
He 's going to use xmonad as his running example ; it's an X11 window manager written entirely in 500 lines of Haskell .
Based on xmonad he will show you how to
write functional programs
test them using QuickCheck
write imperative programs
call foreign functions
use Haskell for scripting applications
The lecturer wo n't assume you know any functional programming at all , but he will assume that you are an experienced professional programmer , so he 'll will move along quite briskly .

Tangible Functional Programming ( by Conal Elliott )
Lecture abstract :
We present a user - friendly approach to unifying program creation and execution , based on a notion of " tangible values " ( TVs ) , which are visual and interactive manifestations of pure values , including functions .
Programming happens by gestural composition of TVs .
Our goal is to give end - users the ability to create parameterized , composable content without imposing the usual abstract and linguistic working style of programmers .
We hope that such a system will put the essence of programming into the hands of many more people , and in particular people with artistic / visual creative style .
In realizing this vision , we develop algebras for visual presentation and for " deep " function application , where function and argument may both be nested within a structure of tuples , functions , etc.
Composition gestures are translated into chains of combinators that act simultaneously on statically typed values and their visualizations .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Homosexual Lutheran clergy who are in sexual relationships will be able to serve as pastors , the largest U.S. Lutheran body said on Saturday .
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ( ELCA ) passed a resolution at its annual assembly urging bishops to refrain from disciplining pastors who are in “ faithful committed same - gender relationships . ”
The resolution passed by a vote of 538-431 .
“ The Church ... has just said ‘ Do not do punishments ’ , ” said Phil Soucy , spokesman for Lutherans Concerned , a gay - lesbian rights group within the church .
“ That is huge . ”
The ELCA , which has 4.8 million members , had previously allowed gays to serve as pastors so long as they abstained from sexual relations .
The conference also instructed a committee that is developing a social statement on sexuality to further investigate the issue .
The committee is scheduled to release its report in 2009 .
Since the ELCA was founded in 1988 , the group has ordered three pastors in gay relationships to be removed from their ministries .
The most recent case was decided in July when the ELCA ’s committee on appeals voted to remove an openly gay pastor from St. John ’s Lutheran Church in Atlanta .
The gay clergy issue has become a flashpoint in other faiths , including the Anglican Church .
Intel report : Iran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003 David Edwards
Published : Monday December 3 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This ( Update : National security adviser : ' We were right ' to be worried about Iranian nuclear ambition ) A new US intelligence report indicates that Iran halted its nuclear weapons development program four years ago -- but the White House on Monday nevertheless urged global powers to " turn up the pressure " on the country .
Newly declassified portions of the National Intelligence Estimate find that Iran abandoned its nuclear program in the fall of 2003 and does not currently possess a nuclear weapon .
The country is still enriching uranium , however , and could still develop a weapon between 2010 and 2015 , according to senior intelligence officials .
White House National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley stated on Monday that the findings suggested that the US strategy of isolating Iran diplomatically while pursuing negotiations was working .
" The bottom line is this : for that strategy to succeed , the international community has to turn up the pressure on Iran -- with diplomatic isolation , United Nations sanctions , and with other financial pressure -- and Iran has to decide it wants to negotiate a solution , " said Hadley .
In a Monday afternoon briefing with reporters , Hadley added that the estimate was " good news " and said it proved that the White House had been right to fear Iranian nuclear ambition .
" On one hand it confirms that we were right to be worried about Iran seeking to develop nuclear weapons , " said Hadley .
" On the other hand , it tells us that we have made some progress in trying to ensure that that does not happen . "
Asked if the report would undercut the Bush administration 's efforts to build an international coalition to continue sanctions against the country , Hadley warned that Iran still had its eye on obtaining weapons - grade nuclear uranium .
" I think there is going to be a tendency for a lot of people to say ' the problem is less bad than we thought , let 's relax ' and I think our view is that would be a mistake , " he said , adding that Iran 's continued uranium enrichment was its " path " to obtaining nuclear weapons .
The new NIE represents a change from two years ago , when US intelligence agencies believed Tehran was determined to develop a nuclear capability and was continuing its weapons development program .
A 2005 report stated that Iran was " determined to develop nuclear weapons despite its international obligations and international pressure . "
" Tehran 's decision to halt its nuclear weapons program suggests it is less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we have been judging since 2005 , " states the summary of the new NIE .
Despite the suspension of its weapons program , Tehran may ultimately be difficult to dissuade from developing a nuclear bomb because Iran believes such a weapon would give it leverage to achieve its national security and foreign policy goals , the assessment suggests .
To develop a nuclear weapon , Iran needs a warhead design , a certain amount of fissile material , and a delivery vehicle such as a missile .
The intelligence agencies now believe Iran halted design work four years ago and as of mid-2007 had not restarted it .
But Iran is continuing to enrich uranium for its civilian nuclear reactors .
That leaves open the possibility the fissile material could be diverted to covert nuclear sites to make enough highly enriched uranium to make a bomb .
" We judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date Iran would be technically capable of producing enough highly enriched uranium for a weapon is late 2009 , but that this is very unlikely , " the report concludes .
" A more likely time frame for that production is between 2010 and 2015 ... "
The summary also assesses " with moderate - to - high confidence that Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons ... Tehran 's decisions are guided by a cost - benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political , economic and military cost . "
Hadley was asked reporters if the new NIE revelations would impact the credibility of the Bush administration on Iran and other perceived threats to the US .
" You know , these are not puzzles that once you solve them you solve them for all time , " he responded .
" These are challenges that are ongoing against very hard targets that lie , that try and prevent things from becoming public ...
The answer is , in some sense , welcome to the real world . "

This video is from CNN's Your World Today , broadcast on December 3 , 2007 .
All people in the world want to be rich and they do n’t want to get the difficult and also hard life to even survive for long .
That is why , many people think gambling ceme as the fastest way to be rich and betting can change your life easily .
You do n’t need to be so greedy when it comes to gambling and sometimes , you have to know the limit .
When you are greedy to get more and more or the instant wealth , then you might end up getting zero on the game and you lose everything .
The Effect of Greediness in Gambling Ceme Online
﻿
When you talk about ceme online , it is so natural for players to be rich because when they win the game , they will end up with much money at the same time .
No wonder that betting is the most wanted and most favorite activity in the world done by many people .
The system to do it is so easy for players .
They just want to bet small but they expect to get the huge winning naturally without feeling guilty at all after losing some money when they lose .
However , the reality is not as easy as you think .
All players which like to place the bets chase the thrilling moment to win the bet more seriously and they place the cheap bets but they really want to get more .
At least , this is what all players in the world want from betting .
There is the natural desire for you to win big to get the big amount of money using the small bet .
Some might go out of their own way to lure the people for placing many smaller bets and also selections at the same time .
You will not even see the professional gamblers making many bets at once .
You will not find any of them does the multiple bets with dangerous moment like that .
In fact , most players ipoker88.org and also the professionals just make the singular bets and they will avoid to place more outside the amount you can afford .
The reason is for the longevity of gambling because you will not make much money even though you play for several times and you will get less chance to win and it is better not to force yourself in betting more because this is the sign for you being so greedy .
Do n’t be Greedy in Gambling Ceme Online to Play More and More
Some games of gambling online will show you the profit margin that will not favor you at all .
Remember , all games will favor the house or the casino and it means , you need to limit yourself to bet and go crazy about it .
The rational thing is when you want to get more money , you should make more selections on the game or even play in long run for the casino and in other words , you have to increase the money ay the same tie to get what you want .
The casino will also get the commission .
If you had 2 selections and you have them all both win in the game , the bookies will get the profits around 30 % .
You can also double the win and get much bigger in the same bets .
However in the long run of the game , the bookies might be chipping away and they will swallow all your finance to increate the winning rate over you .
You do n’t have to spend much time to debate on the multiple bets at all in gambling site .
You just need to act like the leader to know and understand the outcome of game .
If you are seriously lucky , you can get the money easily .
However , the perfect bet you can go is the single bets only because it is much better for you and this is the very best option you can go with .
Some professional players which do the multiple bets will get the higher risk to lose the all their betting money .
Perhaps , you can trigger the jackpot but the chance to win the odds is so little .
That is why , you need to ban the greediness inside you and you have to be satisfied for what you have .
The successful player of gambling online uses smaller amounts to bet and no matter how much money you want to bet , it is better to go with the amount you may afford to lose .
Placing big bets on the game is better because it will trigger the jackpot faster that what you though .
However , it is better to avoid the potential scenario that will make them lose everything they have .
If you can understand this thing better , you can win max and you have enough time to collect much money for continue betting on the game .

There are many ways to get your favorite shows , you can watch them at their scheduled time on television , record them with your PVR or VCR ( does anyone use a VCR anymore ? ) or watch them on the broadcast companies website .
If none of these choices work well for you , sometimes you can catch them on sites like TVLinks ( tv-links.co.uk ) , where they link to illegally uploaded videos on various video hosting websites , which allows you to view them at your convenience .
I do n’t want to focus on the legality of this whole thing , but for the many people that use such sites , a sad thing has happened : TVLinks has been shut down .
Not only has the site been taken down , but the owner , a 26 - year - old man from Cheltenham , UK , has been arrested .
Though he does n’t host the content himself , only providing links to the material on major video hosting sites , he has apparently been charged with the “ facilitation ” of copyright infringement .
Personally , while I agree that the service was n’t entirely legal , I think it provided a remarkable video on demand service for shows both on and off the air , and should continue to prove to studios , production companies , and cable providers that the audience demands to have their media at their disposal .
I hope that the charges are dropped .
Also , as they have started to realize with both video and audio , consumers will get what they want , any way they can and companies can adjust , or try to bully people using the legal system .
Unfortunately , bullying wo n’t get them very far .
Proof of this is the number of such video linking websites , torrent websites , and private content sharing networks still out there today .
Now is your chance to chime in on the discussion .
Was it right for the site to be taken down and the owner arrested ?
Will the removal of TVLinks stop you from watching television shows and movies online , or will you find another source ?
Do you believe that the future of both video and audio is a complete multimedia on demand service ?
If so , how much would you pay every month to access any and every movie and song available in a massive library ?
Please do not link to any video sharing , torrent or any other illegal or grey area websites as such comments will be moderated .
Geeks are Sexy does not condone piracy , but we do believe that certain , currently illegal , models are proof that the handling of media is rapidly evolving and changing to a very consumer focused model .
Dissecting the argh - scape :
An exercise in 4 dimensions
What is the argh - scape ?
When people express frustration , they sometimes emit a sound that English - speakers would spell " argh " .
The problem with the written transcription is that it is impossible to express the richness and emotion of the utterance .
Writers have taken to using capital letters or longer versions of the word for emphasis , e.g. " ARGHHHH " or " AARRRGH ! "
I am interested in the variations of the number of letters people use to express this word .
It consists of four different letters , each of which can be repeated an arbitrary number of times .
Since writers rarely permute the ordering of the letters ( e.g. " ARGHGR ! " ) , most instances of " argh " can be expressed as a 4 - tuple , where each value is the number of times each letter is repeated .
So " argh " is ( 1,1,1,1 ) , " aargh " is ( 2,1,1,1 ) , and so on .
These tuples can also be thought of as coordinates on a tesseract , or 4 - dimensional hypercube .
The argh - scape is the 4 - dimensional matrix representing the observed frequencies of the variants of the written word " argh " .
Each index of the matrix represents one of the four letters , and the matrix entries contain the frequencies with which the corresponding spelling is used .
I used Google 's search engine to estimate these frequencies in the World Wide Web 's content .
Because the space is 4 - dimensional , it is not obvious how to visualize it .
One can present summary statistics or take two - and three - dimensional " slices " of the hypercube .
I took a few small samples of argh - space from Google ( small so as not to annoy the Google sysadmins again ) , and I will try to convey this information to you .
My main source of data is one 4x4x4x4 sample , a few 8x8 slices , and several 1 - dimensional transects of argh - space on Google .
A few common spellings of " argh "
spelling # of hits on Google argh 121000 aargh 18600 arrgh 15700 aaargh 15500 arrrgh 10200
I believe these to be the five most common spellings of " argh " .
The longer variants drop in frequency rapidly .
The graph below is the ranked frequency distribution of the 256 arghs in the 4x4x4x4 corner of argh - space which encompasses all spellings of argh that contain 4 or fewer of each letter .
Note that the y - axis is log scale .
The flatness in the middle of the curve is probably due to the fact that the 4x4x4x4 tesseract has only one word with length 4 ( " argh " ) , one of length 16 ( " aaaarrrrgggghhhh " ) , and the most words of intermediate length , which likely have similar frequencies .
One - dimensional transects of the argh - scape
The 4 one - dimensional transects fix three of the coordinates at 1 , while varying the remaining coordinate .
Thus , one of the transects samples " argh " , " aargh " , " aaargh " , etc. , while another traverses " argh " , " arrgh " , " arrrgh " , and so on .
The plots below are the frequencies sampled along these transects .
a
r
g
h
These plots provide a rough idea of which letters are more likely to be repeated .
The curves approximately follow an exponential decay ( thank god it 's not a power law ) , and , judging from the slopes , " a " and " h " decay the slowest , followed closely by " r " , and " g " takes a distant fourth .
In other words , people are more likely to write " aaaaaaaargh " than " arggggggggh " , which looks stupid .
Two - dimensional slices of the argh - scape
I took six 8x8 2 - dimensional slices of the argh - scape , keeping the numbers of two letters fixed at 1 and varying the number of the remaining two .
The red squares represent high values , blue low , and gray intermediate .
Brightnesses in all plots are scaled the same .
The axes represent the number of one of the letters varying .
For the first plot : the top left corner is " argh " , the bottom left corner is " aaaaaaaargh " , and the bottom right is " aaaaaaaarghhhhhhhh " , which was found only once by Google .
The brightest red square in all plots represents coordinate ( 1,1,1,1 ) , the word " argh " .
H
A R
A G
A G
R H
R H
G
The values along the axes appear to be higher than their neighbors , implying that people typically pick one letter to repeat and only type one of each of the other three .
If there were only three plots , they could be attached along their common edges to form the faces of half a cube .
As there are six , they would form three inverted half - cubes that meet at one corner .

Discussion
In a major defeat for automakers , a federal judge in Fresno ruled Wednesday that California could set its own standards on greenhouse - gas emissions from vehicles .
But the state still needs permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to implement the rules .
“ Both EPA and California . . . are equally empowered through the Clean Air Act to promulgate regulations that limit the emissions of greenhouse gases , principally carbon dioxide , from motor vehicles , ” U.S. District Court Judge Anthony W. Ishii said , citing recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal court in Vermont .
Automakers had argued that only the federal government had such power .
The decision is the second time this year that courts have rebuffed the auto industry ’s attempts to forestall regulation of tailpipe emissions by states , which have grown impatient with the Bush administration on the issue of global warming .
The Supreme Court has ruled that greenhouse - gas regulation falls to the EPA under clear - air legislation , but the agency has issued no regulations on carbon dioxide and other heat - trapping emissions .
Nor has it granted California the right to enact its own rules .
California already has the power to regulate pollutants such as particulates from vehicles .

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called Wednesday ’s ruling “ another important victory in the fight against global warming , ” adding , “ California and other states will prevail in our goal to take aggressive action on climate change . ”
California has plans to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions by 30 % from 2009 to 2016 , under a plan passed by the California Air Resources Board in 2004 .
State Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown , though enthusiastic about Wednesday ’s ruling , expressed concern that the EPA could drag its feet indefinitely in making a decision on the state ’s waiver request , which has been pending for nearly two years .
In November , California sued to force an EPA ruling .
“ Dragging it out would be a disaster and a gross dereliction in duty , ” Brown said .
A spokeswoman for the EPA said the Fresno ruling should n’t affect EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson ’s pledge to issue a ruling on California ’s waiver request by the end of the year .
EPA lawyers , however , are reviewing the ruling to determine whether “ there are any relevant ramifications ” for how the agency decides on the matter , the spokeswoman said .

Environmental groups were jubilant in the wake of the decision .
“ This is a huge win for clean air and a cooler planet , ” said Vickie Patton , senior attorney with Environmental Defense , which intervened in the case on behalf of the defendant , the California Air Resources Board .
Roland Hwang , director of clean vehicle programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council , which also intervened for the state , said the ruling in effect finished legal debate over the right of states to regulate tailpipe emissions .
“ The handwriting is on the wall , ” he said .
“ The automakers can send their lawyers home and put their engineers to work on building clean cars . ”
Advertisement
Automakers have argued that regulating emissions is tantamount to regulating fuel economy , an authority that only the federal government has .
According to some estimates , California ’s more stringent standards would raise the fuel economy of gasoline - fueled cars to an average of 43.5 miles per gallon by 2016 , up from 27.5 mpg today .
California says that its regulations concern only air quality and that fuel economy is not a factor in its calculations .
The case Ishii ruled on was filed in 2004 by a group of San Joaquin Valley auto dealers and the Washington - based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , a trade group representing 10 large car and light - truck manufacturers , including General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp .
“ We can all agree that higher fuel economy is important , but the issue here was about federal fuel economy law , ” Dave McCurdy , chief executive of the alliance , said Wednesday .
“ Under federal law , only the federal government can set fuel economy standards for all 50 states .
We need a consistent national policy for fuel economy . ”
Michael J. Stanton , CEO of the Assn. of International Automobile Manufacturers , which represents other automakers including Honda Motor Co. but was not directly involved in the suit , said the group was “ very disappointed . ”
He added that a “ state - by - state approach . . . will ultimately limit consumer choice . ”
Advertisement
Danielle Fugere , attorney for Friends of the Earth , which also intervened in the case , said the ruling was somewhat ironic because automakers filed the suit in the Fresno jurisdiction because of its reputation as a conservative bench .
The case was originally assigned to Judge Robert E. Coyle , who in 2002 blocked California from moving ahead with a Zero Emissions Vehicle program .
Coyle has since retired , and the case was reassigned to Ishii .
Ishii was unequivocal in ruling against the automakers , saying , “ It would be the very definition of folly if EPA were precluded from action simply because the level of decrease in greenhouse - gas output is incompatible with existing mileage standards . ”
The decision comes as the Senate debates an energy bill passed last week by the House that would raise federal fuel - efficiency standards for cars and light trucks to 35 mpg by 2020 , a 40 % increase over the current 25 - mpg combined standard .
Senate leaders have said they were confident of getting the required votes before Christmas , but on Friday , the White House threatened a veto , contending that the bill , among other things , must “ clarify one agency as the sole entity . . . responsible for a single national regulatory standard for both fuel economy and tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles . ”
Advertisement
Separately , Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) has said he wants to clarify the language of the bill to “ make sure there is no conflict between the role of the EPA ” and the role of the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration , which sets fuel economy standards for the Transportation Department .
Frank O’Donnell of Clean Air Watch , a Washington - based environmental group , said the maneuvers were “ a bid to kneecap EPA and states led by California that seek to enforce tougher greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles .
EPA would become subordinate to the Transportation Department .
And states like California would be left out in the cold . ”
California is the only state that can set its own vehicle pollution standards because it began regulating air pollution before the EPA ’s creation .
Under the Clean Air Act , however , other states can select either California ’s rules or federal ones .
Fifteen other states have adopted California ’s limits , most recently New Mexico late last month .
In sum , those 16 states account for about 40 % of the U.S. population .

Bean I believe was around 16 years old in Giant ( or at least that 's what wikipedia says ) .
I have n't read Giant recently so I do n't really know for certain .

Actually , there 's supposed to be one book about Ender and Bean 's lost baby , and one about Bean 's offspring still on the ship eventually appearing post - CotM after Ender is dead .
So far , there 's no evidence the two of them will be physically meeting again in either of the planned books .

I would be very surprised if Bean appeared at all .
Unless Card decides to use my " giant , pulsating brain filling the interior of the spaceship , over which his freaky mutant children crawl and frolic " idea .

I mean , is Bean just going to show up 3000 years later in the future and say " Hey Ender old buddy , let 's go on an adventure like the good old times !
Oh , and I brought my genetically freaky children with me also . "
I 'd hate to say it but this whole scenario seems kinda ... far - fetched or at least stretching the story thin for stretchings sake .
It 's actually quite concevable that they would both meet in the future .
Remember that Card's Speaker For The Dead takes place 3000 years after Ender 's Game , but this book is not going to be during that era .
This is going to take place around the time Ender begins to travel after writing The Hive Queen and the Hegemon .
Sense Randi and Bean both go in to space around the same time , they could both stay within the same time .
I 'd say that the only coincidence would be that all three of them end up on the same planet , or that Bean ends up on a planet at all .
Especially sense Ender does spend a conciderable amount of time on his own planet .
Unless that is , they all end up on Ender 's planet .

Is it possible for Petra to leave earth after Peter dies to meet up with an aged bean and their babies all grown up ?
It never stated that she died on earth and I think the tragedy of her leaving Bean and moving on to Peter could be not the final end .
Her love and devotion for Bean could last into her old age where they meet on the colony after she takes a FTL trip and he grows old ( of course there 's a cure for his growth .
just remove the petuitary gland or something easier than recoding his DNA ) Posts : 1 | Registered : Mar 2008 | IP : Logged |

Keep in mind that in the new books , it is the Ender story line that meets up with the Bean story line , and not Ender meeting Bean .
If you had read the whole thread , or at least the first part of it , you would know that Bean will be dead when the Ender characters ( but not Ender ) meet Bean 's children .
I suspect Bean 's kids will meet new Peter , keeping in mind that new Peter is carrying the soul of old Ender .
I further suspect that Peter will bring them all back to Lusitania where they will prefect the means of correcting the flaws in Anton 's Key .
Keep in mind that Bean 's kids , while the first signs of gigantism will be showing , are still young enough to be saved .
As for old Petra meeting old Bean , that is not going to happen ; wonderful thought though it is .
Bean at best only had a few years to live even in space .
I give him 5 to 7 years at the absolute most ; and that is being extremely optimistic ; 3 to 4 years is probably pushing it .
But that would have been enough time for him to educate his own kids and teach them how to run the ship , and to further grant them access to his , by then , substantial fortune .
That is the story I 'm most interested in , but I 'm not sure a full novel could be found there .
But a short story of Bean and his kid in flight , and how Bean and his kid developed , and finally , how Bean met his end as he most surely did .
That is a story that I am desperate to hear .
Still Bean 's kids meeting New Peter will be interesting too .
I also suspect the Driscolata 's will play a role in that story .
Just a thought .

That is quite funny because I actually did read Card 's post and just now reread it .
The story of which you speak will be Shadows in Flight .
This thread is NOT about the book that will tie together the Ender story line and the Bean story line .
If you had read the first part of it , you would know that this thread is about people 's opinion on the name of the new novel Card has decided to write .
It takes place " before he met Jane , and WAY before Speaker for the Dead " according to Card , and is about Ender meeting Bean 's child , raised by Randi .
So therefore it is quite possible that Bean and his children could tie in with this story because he in fact NOT dead , as he leaves Earth around the same time that Randi does .
In the future read what the thread is about before you accuse others of not doing so .

Correct me if im wrong , but is n't Bean supposed to be making an indefinite space flight while waiting for a cure .
I do n't see how he could meet with young Ender in this book ;
Bean is not making random , unscheduled stops at colony worlds .
I think any encounter with Bean or his children ( excluding the one with Randi ) will have to wait for the other book .
As for when Bean 's children do meet up with the Ender characters such as new Peter , it seems that curing them would be a simple part of the story .
The scientists on Lusitania are already good at modifying virus's , so could n't they do the same thing they did with the Descolada ?
Just go outside and get a cure .
Or Something ...
Hopefully we will also get a conclusion to the Descoladores problem .
Actually I 'm sure OSC will continue on that subject , after all , it 's pretty important .
Maybe Bean 's children will join forces with the Ender characters and find a way to communicate with the descoladores .
They are surely going to be Genius 's after all .

There are actually two books being discussed .
Though the original topic was a name for the ' young Ender meets the one obscure Beanie Baby thought to be the son of Achilles ' ( likely ' Ender in Exile ' ) .
It has morphed into a discussion of the names and themes for both the above book and the book tentatively called ' Shadows in Flight ' in which , as I said , the Bean and Ender story lines cross in the very distant future .
Though , admittedly , with +1300 posts in 27 pages , you might not know that .
And , I was responding to recent assertions that Petra would meet Bean or the Beanie Babies .
Plus if you read the most recent pages , there was speculation of the Bean and Ender story lines connecting .
I was merely trying to put those recent speculations into perspective .
But in earlier discussion of " Shadows in Flight " in this same thread , it has been established that when the Ender and Bean story lines cross again , Bean will be gone .
Which I will find very sad indeed if no accounting of Bean 's death is given .
Confusing to have the two separate stories discussed in the same thread .
Though I am pretty sure the book titles have been decided on long ago .
I think ' Ender in Exile ' and ' Shadows in Flight ' have a nice symmetry to them ; both are ' something ' IN ' something ' , and both reflect the theme of the stories nicely .

An author can change any story to be what he or she wants .
Since it is possible that they can meet given the ending of Shadow of the Giant , Card can write it so that Bean , Ender , and Randi all come together .

Yes , but I think more likely the confusion is coming from the fact that two separate books are being discussed .
In one book , young Ender meet on of Bean 's children in the form of the boy who is thought to be the son of Achilles .
In the other books MANY years in the distant future , the children of Bean meet the characters for the end of the Ender Sage .
In other words , the Beanie Babies meet New Peter .
There is a ' Bean ' connection in both stories , though his children , but Bean himself appears in neither .
Likely in the first books , Bean and his other kids are on their space voyage .
In the second book , the first book is long over , and Bean is dead .
Only his children remain , and then only because of prolonged Near Lightspeed Space Travel .
Still , as Bean and the Beanie Babies travel through space , they can't continue on for infinity .
At some point they may need to stop here and there for various reasons , but two or three days in orbit around a planet is not going to kill Bean , and it allows them to take on supplies , update their libraries , and make repairs and upgrades .
Keep in mind that the Time Dilation is massive .
I think Ender lives approximately 12 year in apparent time , while planet - side time spans 3,000 years .
In 3,000 years , technology advances tremendously .
At some point , Bean 's most advanced ship is going to look like a quaint old antique .
So , Bean and his kids might be able to go several years without resupplying food , but when they did stop for supplies , planet - side technology would have made astronomical advances .
Some of those advances may have been helpful to the ship .
And , they would certainly want to update their bank of technological information to see what advances there had been in genetics as well as general technology .
In short , I do n't think they were quite as isolated and many people speculate they were .
I 'm assuming that Jane is managing Bean 's wealth , and that in MANY years of earth - time , his fortune grows substantially .
It likely grows very much in proportion to how much Ender 's wealth grows .
So , at each stop Bean would discover that his fortune had grown , and at some point , he may have traded his outdated ship for a more modern one just as ( to some extent ) Ender did .
My point is , there are necessary reasons for Bean and the Babies to stop now and then .
I think those stops have the potential for exciting stories in themselves , and would love to hear them .
So , in one story Ender meets the one Beanie Baby they never found .
Many centuries later , in the other books , New Peter meet the remaining Beanie Babies .
Which also seems like an exciting story as long as it contains a fair and reasonable account of Bean 's life and death .
Just passing it along .

posted 09:25 PM i've a question .
why do authors tend to go back beyond their first book in the series ?
too many ' prequals ' over - crowd the complex stories they 've already told - which is why i've not gone back to read more about the enderverse beyond ' children of the mind ' and why i've not bothered with the ' shinara ' books past the ' scions of shinara ' .
do authors really lack new story ideas that they have to go back ?
i've always thought that a good author would n't rehash their serials with over - crowding .
i could be wrong , however , since i've not read any of the ' prequals ' .

So you say that they must make stops .
I agree , in order to meet up with Ribeiras during their lifetime , the " beanie babies " as you so call them , would have to make several stops .
In fact , it would be quite difficult for them to meet up with the Riberias so close to Ender 's arrival without almost following Ender 's trail .
Just one jump from one planet to another could be 100 years which would easily put the Ribeiras in their grave before he arrived .
This is just one of those thing authors have to do to make a story .
You have to do something that 's against all the odds and say This is what happened .
What I ask is if they must make stops to set up their story to fit in time , why could n't their first stop be that of Ender 's world ?
In fact , if the word were to reach Bean that his last child was on that planet , would n't he most certianly go to that planet ?

I think it is you who is a minority .
Authors do n't write prequals because they lack imagination .
They do it because many people , including the author , fall in love with the story and want to hear more .
I myself do n't care if it's a sequal or a prequal , I love to read stories from the Enderverse .
Prequals and sequals are just ways to add stories .
They both have their perks as well .
Sequals tell you what happens next , but Prequals tell you how it got to be that way .

Josh Cooper :
So you say that they must make stops .
I agree , in order to meet up with Ribeiras during their lifetime , the " beanie babies " as you so call them , would have to make several stops .
In fact , it would be quite difficult for them to meet up with the Riberias so close to Ender 's arrival without almost following Ender 's trail .
I see your points , but it 's not necessarily true .
Keep in mind that Ender and Valentine stop for months at a time on various planets .
They do n't just stop for Ender to do a Speaking , they also stop so Valentine can research her new book .
Those month or months planet sided add up to tremendous amounts of space travel by Bean and his kids .
Bean and his kids on the other hand , would only stop briefly for necessary resupplies , and likely by the time of the first stop , Bean would be unable to go planet side because he could n't handle the gravity .
That would mean the ' Beanie Babies ' would have to go planet side and negotiate for upgrades and resupplies .
I think it would be wonderfully interesting stories to hear how the ' Beanie Babies ' handled the planet side jaunts .
Now , as to bringing together New Peter and Bean 's kids , they ( Bean 's kids ) do n't necessarily have to follow Ender through space and time , and the age of planet side people really means nothing .
Keep in mind that the Ribeiras were countless generations unborn when Bean and the Beanie Babies set off on their travels .
Now back to New Peter and Bean 's kids coming together , New Peter has faster than light speed travel at his finger tips .
He is not bound by Time Dilation in his travels .
It 's possible that they may stubble across each other on another planet by accident .
It 's possible the news of the genetic engineering on the planet Lusitania might reach their ears .
It 's possible Jane will recall a distant memory of Bean and realize that their discoveries may be the key to curing the Beanie Babies if they can be found .
It is possible that the Beanie Babies will visit the planet Path , and discover the existence of Jane and New Peter and thereby discover their base of operation is Lusitania .
There are any number of ways that these characters can come together .
Even if the Beanie Babies travels mirror the realtime of Ender , they will still only be 12 or 13 years old when they finally meet New Peter .
Still plenty of time to save them .
Also , keep in mind that they are not wandering the entire universe , there are 100 known planets in the ' federation ' and a few unincorporated planets that have not been made members yet .
So , rather than wander aimlessly through space , it would seem logical for Bean and his kids to contain their travels to the known 100 worlds and a few outlying territories .
I think this ( Shadow in Flight ) will be an incredibly fascinating book .
I 've always wondered about the aftermath of the Ender Sage and the Fate of Bean in flight with his kids .
In the Adventures of New Peter , I wonder if Peter will run afoul of Star Congress .
Suddenly a new and powerful weapon appears on the horizon .
Peter having and controlling Faster than Light travel would be viewed as a politically dangerous thing by Congress .
Peter did after all single handedly defeat a large fleet of Starcraft .
What of Jane , will Star Congress try to control her ?
Will the continue to threaten her ?
How will they react to the knowledge that the Buggers are not only alive , but are flourishing and expanding ?
Will they feel that New Peter with faster than light travel AND in league with the Buggers are a massive threat to Star Congress ?
Will Jane have sufficient power to expand Faster Than Light Travel ( FTLT ) into a commercial enterprise , and who will control that commercial enterprise ?
Or , will FtLT be limited to a few elite members of society , and will Congress and Business fight to see who controls and managers that process ?
So , many unanswered questions .
As to Bean and his kids in their travels ; I think Bean having to deal with a group of extremely intelligent , precocious and mischief - making kids as extremely funny .
And I think Bean 's later life is extremely and painfully heartbreaking .
And I think of the sadness when their father finally dies and the Beanie Babies have to make it on their own .
How much of their fate will their father have told them ?
Will it matter after so many many centuries ?
Though I also think that anyone foolish enough to think they can pull one over on the Beanie Babies is in for a very rude ( but hilarious ) awakening .
I see tremendous story potential in The Flight of the Beanie Babies , and ache to hear the story of Bean 's final demise .
Even as I type this I am overwhelmed with sadness at the thought of Bean 's life and his ultimate untimely end .
As interesting as it will be for Ender to meet the presumed son of Achilles , it is really the meeting of New Peter and Bean 's kids that interests me .
But I also long for the story of Bean in flight , I see so much potential for both humor and pathos in that story .
Just a few rambling thoughts .

I will add one addition to Josh Cooper 's comment , which I think addresses his central point .
Because Time Dilation is so massive , the odds of ' Ender Time ' and ' Bean Time ' being synchronized at the end is extremely thin .
It is certainly possible , but the odd against that exact synchronization of time are astronomical .
That is a point I will concede .
But , if Bean stopped periodically to allow his kids planet access and access to something approximating a normal life , and those planet side times were roughly equal to Ender 's planet side times , it might be possible for Bean 's kids and New Peter to meet at some point in time .
Just a thought .

Still , I can't help but be a bit sorry that it's not " Shadows in Flight " coming out this year instead .
We 've been waiting for that one longer , and I 'm much more interested in a post - CotM story , and this probably means that we 'll have to wait another 3 - 4 years for it .
Still , this really makes me happy .

I 've never posted here before , and I know this topic is way in the past for some of you , but I 'm excited about a new Ender novel .
I wanted to add my suggestion of Ender : At Shadows Edge .
I was kinda excited about the lost child meeting up with Bean and his children in the future .
However , Mr. Card , I would n't mind to see Bean and his children come running to a certain planet inhabitting a 4th gene manipulating species in order to possibly find a cure , or battle a very intelligent enemy .

New member , just read the beginning and end of the thread .
My brother and I have been speculating about a new story ever since Shadow of the Giant came out .
I have some ideas about Shadows in Flight .
Our old theory now has at least one hole from what has been revealed here , but I think it bears watching .
Volescu is sent out on a colony ship and Graff makes some offhand comment to the effect of " What harm can he do there ? "
I think Volescu is somehow the origin of the Descoladores .
Think about it .
A totally amoral and brilliant scientist arrives on a backwater world decades after most of those who hate him have died , and they 're lightyears away anyhow .
Out of sight , out of mind , certain powerful interests provide Volescu with resources to continue his genetic study .
Centuries later , the fruit of this research in the hands of the government eventually ends up in a world of people suspiciously like Bean - - geniuses hobbled by a genetic defect .
In the interim , either Volescu himself or some later evil scientist sharing his ( non -) ideals devises new experiments and eventually a way off planet .
That individual certainly would have appropriated substantial resources , and possibly a group of like - minded people .
They disappear into uncharted space , " off - the - grid " if you will .
Give that unrepentant and amoral philosophy , coupled with scientific genius , thousands of years to flourish , totally cutoff and unknown from the rest of human society , and voila ... descoladores who use entire planets and ecosysytems for their experiments .
I used to think it was also related to Bean 's lost kid , son of Randi .
They would hook up somehow and warped genius child would direct the larger scheme behind settling a new planet to escape the evil government powers his mother told him about , using Volescu for his own ends .
That possibly extends to a plan to eventually use the viruses to overthrow the rest of humanity .
Maybe that is incorrect if the Ender in Exile storyline fully resolves evil Bean child , but there could easily be at least an indirect connection millenia later .

Except that the descolada existed on Lusitania for many thousands of years before Volescu was born .

posted 04:43 PM other people have suggested that idea- that Volescu was responsible for the Descaladores .
But that would mean that after x amount of time they release the descolada onto Lusitania .
And we know that the descolada took a long time to bring about that much change in Lusitania - their best bet for recent is within the past 100,000 years .
The descaladores are their own species .

Noemon , thank you for the welcome !
And Maybe , that was a very interesting idea even with Volescu not being a possible candidate .
It does bring up a question for me :
If Bean 's child escapes that first colony before Ender leaves is n't it possible for him to be the very evil genius that creates the descoladores ?
He is being raised to believe he is Achilles heir and told a nice little lie about how Achille was .
Could n't it be possible that he also has access to all of Volescu 's genetic research / findings ?
Oh yea , and is it just me or do I remember that first colony being named " Shakespeare " ?

Shawshank 's response explains why that is not a viable theory .
And yes , the first colony was named " Shakespeare , " but I 'm pretty sure the planet was called a different name at some point in the series .

Good point Shawshank !
The amount of time it would take a planet to make a change like that would offset the time dialation of even Bean 's children ..... I think .... I'm not good with this stuff .
I think the planet was called another name to CRash ..... the most recent book I read was " Shadow of the Giant " and that 's where I saw " Shakespeare " as the name .... I believe there may be a contradiction and that 's why I mentioned it .

I believe the first colony world was referred to as " Rov " .
I do n't think it 's a contradiction though .
The planet is " Rov " and the settlement is " Shakespeare " .

Right Nick , Bean was already a giant when he left .
He was already feeling the effects of being so large , though he was certainly still able to function .
So , my impression is that space flight and the corresponding lack of gravity , only bought him a few extra years at best .
I 'm guessing on earth , he had maybe two to three years at the most .
In space fight , he would have had perhaps 5 to 6 years at the most .
What that 5 to 6 years translates to in subjective earth time depends on how close to light speed he was traveling .
It seems his ship was one of the most advanced of it 's time .
Though , I 'm sure earth and colony technology would rapidly surpass it .
While not constantly in space flight , in ' The Investment councilor ' , Ender is subjectively age 20 and Valentine is roughly age 25 , yet , it is about 500 years in the future .
When we see Ender again , it is 3,000 years in the future , and I 'm guessing Ender is about 30 .
Just as a guess , in the moment , I would say that 5 years of Bean 's space flight might have bought him a few hundred years of earth 's advancement .
The question is , after a few hundred years , would anyone left on earth remember who Bean was , and more importantly , where he was and why ?

There may be a popular loss of faith in bonds by mid 2011 .
At that point USA will have to increase interest rates , as noted above .
Alternatively , it could repudiate payment of interest on bonds .
This would cause full loss of faith in Treasury bonds .
The USA could then simply physically print additional cash money - dollar bills - to service its debt .
This is no different to issuing bonds in principle - it is a form of deflation of monetary value - but would popularly be perceived as ' Zimbabwean ' money printing . ]

Unabashed comment of former Fed employee Ben S. Bernanke in a speech in 2002 .
Half of what he said is true .
in theory
[ note from early 2010 - deep recession will certainly tip into depression much earlier than the above estimate .
What was n't taken into account was the increase in population in oil exporting countries .
As their populations burgeon , they use more of their resource domestically , and the amount available for export falls steadily , even if total annual production is unchanged .
Exportable oil will likely have fallen by about 25 % by end 2014 , so there is a rough estimate is even odds ( 50:50 ) depression will commence in USA by the end of 2014 .
Obviously , there it is possible , but less likely , that it may start earlier .
Obviously , the likelihood increases every year after end 2014 , but not steadily , rather , at a constantly year - on - year accererating rate - reflecting oil depletion rates , which in turn influence availability of oil for export . ]

China has prohibited silver export , physically shifted some of its gold from vaults in London to vaults in Hong Kong , made purchase and import of foreign gold by its citizens relatively easier than most Western countries , and is heavily - and successfully - promoting citizen gold ownership via state propoganda and street - side facilities .
There are but a very few similar facilities for the average Western citizen . ]
In this scenario , the USA may slip into a depression suprisingly quickly - far more quickly and dramatically than current base - line conditions would predict .
The advent of depression may be sooner in USA than the rest of the industrialised world .

In this scenario , a sudden and dramatic early onset of depression may be largely localised to USA ( and probably Japan and China ) .

DISCLAIMER
The information in this site is largely informed opinion , although it is written in good faith .
It is up to the reader to criticize , read alternative opinions and assertions , and come to an independent view .
Do not rely on anything in this site being current , correct or factual .
Note from early 2010 : this opinion piece was written in 2007 , before the financial crash of 2008 .
It is a forward - looking historical fact - based ' scenarios ' consideration , out to about 2025 .
First , a depression generally follows a period of recession .
An overview of the features of a steadily deepening recession has already been given Briefly , recession is caused by business slowdown as the much higher prices of oil feed into the industrialised economies .
Businesses lose confidence , retrench , lay off staff , and reduce investment in new plant and machinery ; retailers see less consumer spending ; inflation reduces spending power ; interest rates rise .
This will cause recession , but not arecession .
For there to be a deep recession , there first has to be a credit bubble - a high level of personal indebtedness in the community .
This certainly exists in 2007 .
Most industrialised countries have seen a huge speculative real estate frenzy by ' mom and pop ' investors .
Overvalued properties have been bought with loans by banks that cover almost the entire purchase price .
The banks have been thrusting money into peoples hands on a rising property market , willfully ignoring prudence and history .
Interest rates have been artificially low , driven by the insatiable USA need to sell its federal junk bonds in order to finance oil imports and massive military liabilities .
The stage is set .
When interest rates rise , mortgage repayments far exceed the wage earners ability to meet the monthly loan installment .
People default .
Houses are sold in mortgagee sales for lower values .
The inflated house prices collapse .
People hold mortgages costing more than the new , more realistic , resale value of their house .
Many chose bankruptcy to clear debt .
Collapse of the housing bubble is enough to trigger a deep recession .
But it is not enough to trigger a depression .
More is required .
Share value collapseswith banking collapses and a ' run ' on cash , , will trigger depression .
Butbanking collapses andsharemarket collapses wo n't .
Are today 's banks for practical ' everyday ' purposes sound ?
Yes .
Banks will hold large amounts of ' unrecoverable ' debt following the inevitable property bubble collapse .
They will hold large amounts of unrecoverable debt from loans to some businesses that fail when consumer spending drops and unemployment rises .
But much bank lent money is essentially a ' fiction ' , and is book entry ' notional ' funds lent far in excess of existing real - money deposits ( usually more than ten times the amount of actual deposits is ' available ' for lending ) .
' Losses ' from bad loans are essentially ' book - entry ' losses from ' book - entry ' created money .
' Book - entry ' payments from government printing presses can wipe the worst loans .
Government will then own the banks .
Remaining loans can then be defaulted on .
Bad loans - even brief ' runs ' on deposits - willtrigger a depression .
What about the world sharemarkets ?
Could they implode and trigger a depression ?
No .
The sharemarket crash of 1929 was a vast ' speculative bubble ' founded on buying and selling companies that were often producing little more than self promotional hot air .
Much of the money for the speculation was ' ponzi ' loan credit created by out - of - control banks .
Today 's sharemarkets are constantly re-adjusting and re-valuing companies .
Some companies are valued for earning streams , and some companies are valued because they are believed to be growing in size and assets .
In a deep recession some will rightly reach ' junk ' status because their business is a fading star .
Others , even with a reduced earning stream , will retain a reduced butvalue ( a select few will even rise as investors ' re - weight ' their choice of company sectors to invest in ) .
Most importantly , there is no culture of ' mom and pop ' ignorant speculation in what are little more than shell companies ( except in the highly distorted Chinese share market ) .
Yes .
At some point in the duration of a deep recession .
First , the credit bubble has to collapseNext , oil has to becomeexpensive .
A reasoned guess post - credit - collapse would be when oil both reaches anda price of close to $ US80 a barrel .
Temporary spikes to around $ US100 a barrelindicate depressionary conditions .
At the point of oil settling at or over $ 80 for a year or longer there is likely to be structural ( oil component of goods price adjustment ) inflation of 10 % - 20 % .
At this point , if price movements in 2005 are a guide , petrol may reach close to $ US4 a gallon at the pump .
This will make petrol effectively unaffordable for many low income people who have no other transport options ( chiefly a USA condition ) .
New refinery capacity for heavy oil has kept pace with increased reliance on heavy oil as light oil supplies diminish .
Mildly recessionary conditions in late 2006 caused demand to fall and reduced prices .
Aby reduced demand ( mainly in Asia ) following oil spiking to $ US77 a barrel in July 2006 .
Business nervousness , changing consumer behaviour , and seasonal slacking of oil demand will likely make any spike temporary , should it occur .
Increased bilateral trading in oil ( direct from producer to consumer ) outside the betting floor of the futures traders has increased , meaning price is more stable .
Whether it stabilises at a higher or a lower level depends on the USA economy and on whether Mexico , Venezuela , and Saudi Arabia are able to forego production in the interests of holding prices up .
Their domestic situations may force them to sell at a lower price than they would like .
A credit bubble collapse will likely be triggered by rises in USA treasury interest rates .
Higher interest rates will likely combine with oil price inflation to remove a larger percentage of tax - paid disposable income from circulation in the economy .
Considering the vast USA government debt , the on - going dollar cost of seizing and guarding Iraqi oil ( $ US5 billion a month by december 2005 ) , and the beginning of a move away from the essentially valueless USA dollar as a currency of international settlement , then the USA Federal reserve will probably need to move within the next few years to make it 's bonds more attractive .
The mechanism is to increase interest rates payable on the bonds .
( The US could of course back the dollar with oil by seizing all Iraqi oilas ' spoils of invasion ' . )
Oil prices might reach or exceed the historic oil price high reached in 1980 by mid 2008 , driven mainly by decline in mega fields , but tempered by price driven demand reduction .
Winter fuel oil shortages 2007 / 2008 and large hike in natural gas prices - and therefore electricity prices - in USA will add to economic slowdown .
Recession beginning by the end of 2008 is somewhat likely , and USA treasury bonds lose their attractiveness as a consequence .
Yet the USA will need to finance an evengovernment deficit as structural inflation raises all governance costs , and as unemployment costs rise .
US interest rates must then be raised by the end of 2009 , no matter how unwilling the government may be to do so .
The only alternative is massive government spending cuts , on a scale never before seen .
These cuts areunlikely .
The ' structural ' pumping capacity bottleneck will likely occur in december 2008 or 2009 , cause a spike to $ US90 a barrel ( unless new Saudi ' sweet oil ' fields do come on stream as promised ) .
It is uncertain whether or not oil might remain at or around the $ 80 per barrel level thereafter .
It depends on the price - driven change in consumer behaviour in how much petrol and diesel consumersto burn , against how much they areto burn in the essentials of living .
It depends on what degrees of freedom consumers have to buy smaller cars or motorbikes , to live closer to work , to substitute public transport .
It depends on whether consumers believe oil shortage is a temporary blip , or a long term trend .
The conditions should be clearer in 2008 / 9 .
Recession in itself reduces demand .
Oil consumption drops .
Reduced demand weakens oil prices .
However , at some point , the year on year reducing production from large high - volume oilfields ( that have passed their peak of production ) reduces global supply until it matches the reduced global annual demand .
From then on , as pumpable supply drops below even new reduced global demand levels , prices once more increase .
The best guess for this point is around 2015 .
Deep recession may start before 2015 .
It may be triggered ' early ' if any of the major Saudi or Mexican fields collapse , or if climate causes electrical energy supply shortfall , water shortage , significant crop failure , and if resultant socially hysterical hyper- reaction causes a precipitous collapse in business confidence and employment .
At the point at which 25 % to 30 % of the population are unemployed , many more part - time and on - call workers have less work than they want , when there are few business start - ups , when the tax take of government is insufficient to meet its expenditure , food prices have doubled , and when the trend is for no improvement in these conditions .
A depression is more or less a recession that does n't end .
It does n't come as a single dramatic event , easily identified and widely reported in the news .
A ' depression ' exists in deeply recessionary times when things have been bad for so long without significant recovery that people start saying we are slipping into a depression .
Most people are generally optimistic , and are unwilling to assume the worst simply because business , employment , and spending power conditions are tough .
But people will know when they are living in a depression , they wo n't have to hear about it on the radio .
It will be self evident .
Even so , before then , we do worry , and psychologically need to ' know ' the signs of the ' worst case ' , the signs indicating the possible ' start ' of a depression .
We could possibly use the point at which oil is so expensive that most low income earners cannot afford to run a car , and food and retail prices in general have increased by 20 % .
At this point , the cost of getting to work may use up a huge portion of the wages earned .
Countries such as USA with relatively sprawling towns and suburbs with poor public transport would be worst hit .
Older European cities with residency and work embedded within densely populated cities , and excellent public transport , fare better .
At this point , it is impossible that only low income workers are affected .
Whereas past depressions have been characterised by an initial imprudent credit hyper - expansion followed by huge and prolonged lack of business and consumer confidence - even in the face of sufficient energy and sufficient capital to keep business growing and employment and money circulating -' depression ' may be fundamentally different .
The never - before - seen factor this time is that insufficient energy supply limits the possibility of recovery .
This time , business and consumers are better informed and more confident due to better education and information sharing , and a fairly good social security ' safety net ' .
We should be far better equipped to intelligently face economic downturns .
But the various ' traditional ' cures for dips in economic activity - increasing government spending , decreasing business tax , slashing government services , ' fixing ' interest rates to a very low level , subsidising domestic industries , removing subsidies from industries to re-orient them , subsidising raw materials , subsidising the shift of production bases to low wage - low care countries - no longer work .
Why ?
Because the game has changed .
Up until now , economists have never had to weight the cost of energy heavily in their models of how economies work .
Energy has always been cheap and abundant .
The economists tools in an era of cheap energy - ' tweaking ' of government policies , taxes , and laws - now have minimal effect .
These economic devices arenew energy sources .
In an age of astonishing new technologies economists expect ' more investment ' in energy technology to substitute for energy shortage .
Lets be clear .
Technology isan energy source .
True , both government policy tweaking and technology can help efficiently useg energy sources , and thus reduce costs , but this effect is marginal in the bigger picture of reducing global supply ofenergy .
Previous depressions were not limited by energy - they were limited by confidence and government competence .
Do n't look to history for guidance .
While this ' limit to energy factor ' has never been seen before in the history of modern democratic industrialised nations , its trajectory can at least be broadly understood and predicted .
How ?
By the trajectory of oil , gas , and coal depletion .
But there are many other factors - chiefly climatic , economic and political that could ( and probably will ) - make nonsense of this guess .
These influences are far more difficult to predict and therefore take into account .
The USA is the most heavily car dependent nation on earth , has low population densities in cities , relatively rapidly growing population numbers , relatively poor public transport , is coming up to shortages in natural gas for electricity generation , already has a large number of impoverished people , has no saved reserves to pay for social security , has a private credit bubble , has many industries distorted by taxpayer subsidies , has a government living on overseas credit , and is in the unique position of having most of the worlds banks using the USA currency as a default international standard currency of value .
Loss of faith in the currency will make it of low value .
The backing for the dollar is oil .
Oil backing is almost the sole reason banks have faith in the currency .
The dollar has oil backing for two reasons - 1. Historically the feudal Saudi ' royal family ' was elevated to power by the USA in return for it accepting only US dollars for oil sales .
2. USA has captured the Iraqi oil fields .
Deep recession in the USA willfairly certainly tip into depression in 20 years time ( 2025 ) when light oil production naturally fades to about that of the late 1960's .
Even if the USA invaded Iran , Saudi Arabia , Venezuela and Nigeria and seized their oil for the exclusive use of the USA , almost all the light sweet crude in these countries would be used up by about 2040 .
This is , of course , an absurd notion , but it illustrates the point that even expanded theft and sequestration cannot save the most powerful nation on earth from theof depression .
But we must consider one fundamental factor unique to USA - the dollar is theglobal reserve currency , and has been since 1973 when banks stopped backing their currency with gold .
But , in spite of the huge USA internal economy , the dollar is fundamentally unsound .
The world banking system has historically been manipulated by the USA into using the dollar as reserve currency .
This has easily been achieved - trading in oil has been in dollars , an arrangement cemented decades ago with the Saudi dictatorship .
All countries want to buy oil .
All countries must buy USA dollars to pay for oil .
In this way , the USA has been able to print money to pay for its budget and trade deficits .
It is virtually the only country in the world that has been able to export its domestic inflation .
Banks around the world have large accumulations of dollars as a result .
The USA currency can onlyits ' acquired ' value so long as oil producing nations insist on dollars as payment for their oil .
While USA is regarded as a very , very , good friend indeed of the Saudi regime , it is not well liked in the other major middle eastern countries ( and especially Iran and Iraq ) .
Then why does the Middle East support the USA dollar by insisting on payment in the greenback ?
In fact , most would slash their dollar holdings - punish USA - tomorrow .
But the international oil exchange bourses in New York and London have called the shots on payment for oil until now .
Recently , Iran has made some sales directly to adjacent European countries and to India and China , and insisted on payment in euros and other regional currencies .
This must worry the presidential / business / military complex in power in USA .
Saudi Arabia has relatively recently repatriated many USA investments back to the kingdom and re-invested in the region .
Saudi has re-invigorated its interest in gold .
Since the end of World War II , an ounce of gold has fairly constantly been worth 15 barrels of oil .
The ratio has been disconnected over the last four years , and an ounce of gold buys only 7 barrels of oil .
Whatever the underlaying reason , gold in the bank or oil in the ground may be the best long term stores of value .
In the first quarter of 2005 , 20 % more gold was sold than the same period last year .
While Saudi has not yet asked for payment in gold , it has mooted accepting payment for oil in a basket of regional currencies as well as the dollar .
Iran plans to open an international oil trading bourse over the internet in mid 2007 .
Payment to be in the currency of your choice .
Iran already supplies large quantities of oil and gas across the border to Europe .
Russia also trades gas and oil heavily into Europe - around half its production .
In 2004 , it , too , mooted payment in euros .
Venuezuela , heavily exposed to the USA economy through large oil exports to that market , is looking to diversify its crude oil sales , including selling directly to China .
The trend may be unstoppable .
When a certain portion of the world trade in oil is in a mix of currencies ( and in gold ) , with the dollar simply one part of the mix , central banks may become very nervous .
They would be negligent if they did not diversify and rebalance their various currency holdings away from heavy overweighting in the USA dollar - and also re-invest in some gold .
Central bank sell downs will tend to drive down the value of the dollar .
The effect could be a cascade - a lower value dollar causes those who have overaccumulated the dollar to quit a large part of their holdings before the value falls even further .
This drives the dollar down in a self ratcheting fashion .
What is the end result ?
A dollar then wo n't buy as much oil as it did previously .
The cost of oil and oil products within USA becomes higher .
With the USA having to buy a far greater portion of its oil needs on the international market , it needs to spend more devalued dollars to buy it .
But these dollars are largely ' printing press ' fictitious dollars backed by USA treasury bonds .
With the dollar not attracting a lot of interest , bond yields must be racked up by increasing the interest rate payable on them .
Higher interest rates on federal bonds leads to higher interest rates on mortgages .
Higher mortgages leads to homeowners being unable to pay , mortgage defaults , and then higher costs to the federal mortgage guarantee system .
All this may happen at a time when stocks are sliding as investor confidence slides .
( Some claim that there is evidence the USA government has from time to time recently been ' insider trading ' with selected brokers to keep stocks values high and confidence in place .
A similar claim is made the USA government has been trading to artificially lower gold prices . )
Of course , many small businesses in the service industries and allied discretionary spending would fail as more and more of the family budget goes on higher petrol , gas , electricity , and winter fuel oil costs .
These are deeply recessionary conditions .
So the artifice by which the USA has manouvered its currency as the currency of oil trade in order to vastly overspend its productive capacity may ultimately be exposed as based soley on confidence .
If confidence is lost , it may fall like a pack of cards .
But not much sooner .
Ultimately , there arefrom depression for any country .
Can the USA prevent the cascade ?
Yes , it can .
It can hold a gun to the head of every major oil producing nation and say " you will only accept US dollars for oil - or else . "
This may be the only credible explanation for the propoganda demonisation of Iran in january 2006 , and again in january 2007 .
It may be planning a demonstration of power - destruction of key elements of military and domestic infrastructure as a warning of the consequences of non-compliance with the US arrangement for marketing oil .
Iran , in spite of its florid hyperbolous rhetoric , is about as likely to use a nuclear weapon as any other regional state , such as Pakistan or India .
That is , even if Iran acquired nuclear weapons , it dare not use them .
The result of use of a nuclear weapon by Iran would be an almost instant cremation of the greater part of the population .
In contrast , North Korea , as unstable a country as is possible to find - and quite likely to be crazy enough to use them regardless of consequences - is making nuclear weapons without a murmur from USA .
Where a nuclear strike from Iran is extremely unlikely , a much more likely scenario would be for North Korea to be hired by virtually any country or group ( with North Korean contacts ) as a ' willing agent ' to smuggle remote - detonated neutron bombs ( made in China or Russia , and either corruptedly obtained or willingly supplied ) into USA or west Eurasian cities .
If Iran with nuclear missiles might one day be a threat to West Eurasia or USA oil interests , bombing its nuclear facilities to remove real or fictitious weapons research capacity does not remove the threat .
Iran - or any country or terrorist group - could contract out the ' hits ' .
Nuclear conflagration aside , .
It seems increasingly likely that USA will use a show of force to enforce the ' dollars for oil ' rule .
This will only delay depression in the short run .
In the end , geological reality trumps guns .
In the medium to long run oil will be priced in other currencies ( almost ) no matter what the USA does , and countries will increasingly peg their currency to national reserves of gold .
The joker in the pack for this last scenario is climate variation .
USA is one of the few countries able to grow surplus grain .
In a time of climate - caused grain shortage in an era of a heavily devalued dollar , it would be very profitable to turn grain into oil .
A carbohydrate into a hydrocarbon .
The reason is that a devalued dollar would make USA grain exports cheap .
And an oil - rich region with a burgeoning population
It is possible the USA may be able to make a ' managed landing ' of the overvalued USA dollar on the back of its rich black prairie loams .
An oil for grain strategy will not prevent depression in the longer run - it might initially delay it .
It might change a cliff into a slope .
These other countries are usually less car dependent , have higher population densities in cities , stabilised populations , usually excellent public transport , are also facing shortages of natural gas for electricity generation , have a smaller number of impoverished people , have some reserves for social security , have a smaller private credit bubble , have more people renting rather than mortgaged , have higher per person savings as a result , have industries distorted by taxpayer subsidies in Eurasia ( less so or not at all in industrialised Oceania ) , have governments owing relatively little or no overseas debt , and whose banks using the USA currency as reserves but which are also weighted toward the euro .
The backing for the euro is trade .
Trade - financial soundness and prudence of governments - is almost the sole reason banks have faith in the currency .
The euro has very little oil backing right now .
( But that may be changing . )
Deep recession in many ( but not all ) industrialised Eurasian and Oceanian countries willalso fairly certainly tip into depression in 20 years time ( 2025 ) when light oil production naturally fades to about that of the late 1960's .
Compact countries such as Switzerland that have already invested heavily in energy efficiency , renewable energy , public transport , and sustainable land use may not experience depression conditions until some years into a broader Eurasian depression .
China , as a recently industrialising country , still has most of its population living as low income , poorly educated ( or uneducated ) peasants on small farms .
This rural diaspora provides a ' sponge ' to soak up the jobless from the cities - a circumstance unique to China .
In general , the only difference between Eurasia ( and Canada ) and the United States is that there is a bigger societal and governmental buffer to take the initial impact of depression .
It is extremely unlikely that any Eurasian country - including China - would attempt to seize any significant sized oil fields in another country .
Equating the onset of depression solely by the onset of geologically determined fade - off of oil pumping capacity of a reserve known to be finite is simplistic .
The ' classic ' bell curve willhappen if oil is pumped out as if demand is constant , no matter how high the price .
Obviously , as the oil supply becomes less than the amount the market demands , that oil - dependent market is disrupted .
People become unemployed and consume less .
People adjust their driving habits .
People buy motorbikes and small cars that use less petrol .
People stop buying frivolous junk .
Cheap plastic junk becomes expensive plastic junk .
Businesses fail , and the oil demand of that business becomes zero .
Therefore , once recession has bitten deep , slackened demandAs a result , oil consumption fall enough todepression .
For how long ?
It is impossible to know , because it is measured against a theoretical ' event ' - an earlier depression - that did n't happen .
But even halving consumption rates will not double the time until depression , as the peak of production and subsequent decline of the mega fields is the major factor in an oil dependent global economy .
Most mega fields have either peaked , or will peak in the next few years .
Most are already being pressurised , so the ' truth ' of the decline is .
As a result , .
The decline rate may not be 3 % or so a year .
These mega fields may decline by closer to 13 % a year .
Shall we say depression might be staved off by a decade if prolonged deep recession , coupled with massive government investment in coal gasification , conserves petrol globally , and thus oil demand ?
It is an unreasoned guess .
The USA has sold an enormous numbers of Treasury Bonds - creating a huge expansion of money supply and enormous US government debt .
This vast US credit bubble is kept inflated by faith in the dollar , supported by oil denominated in dollars .
As USA faces massive oil costs with oil bottlenecks and a hugely oil dependant economy , it is only a matter of time before those holding dollars start nervously watching other dollar debt holders to see who will move to sell first .
First movers will ' capture ' the greatest return , as the dollar willbe relatively strong .
Countries with large dollar reserves could quietly quit them in fear of an ultimate US dollar value collapse .
This could trigger automated ' sell ' orders from currency speculators , creating a ' selling climate ' and a fear of being left with the ' hot potato '- in turn leading to a massive dollar sell - down .
While this would be very good for US exports , it would remove the USA 's main source of government income - sale of US treasury bonds .
Pensions and other social security payments would be at risk , but worst of all , either funding for the military would have to be slashed , or medical and education budgets would have to be gutted .
Prolonged drought affecting wheat and maize production in USA , Australia and China might cause a grain shortfall sufficient to evaporate surplus supplies from the world market .
If Thailand , the worlds major rice exporter , also co-incidentally has a smaller harvest , there could be insufficient grain to feed the Middle East .
Food riots in the huge and already disaffected local populations could lead to disruption or damage to major Middle East oil fields , triggering a temporary but dramatic cut in world supply and pushing deep recession into depression in many countries .
Some might argue religious fundamentalism might get ' out of hand ' in Saudi Arabia , leading to overthrow of the current regime and restrictions on supplies to the west .
This is very unlikely , as Saudi Arabia enters into boom times , with hugely increased revenues , historically low government debt , and strong local private sector investment in local business and economic activity .
Others argue war may break out in the Middle East , disrupting supply .
This is highly improbable .
The Americans have replaced their puppet Saddam Hussein and his thugs with a democratically elected government .
That government is now entering close co-operation with Iran , a country that Husseins regime had previously attacked in 1980 .
American military based in Iraq ensures Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and the other minor Gulf states are safe from invasion from anyone .
While America may destroy Iran 's nuclear facilities ( via its only reliable arab ally , Israel ) it cannot in any sense afford a full - scale invasion of an additional country , no matter how oil - rich ; albeit a strike may shore up the dollar system for a time .
High oil prices have already set recessionary conditions in train to greater or lesser extent .
( Unemployment , business failure and reduced business investment are the most obvious indicators . )
The most likely scenario is for the deeply indebted USA to raise interest rates by the end of 2008 ( or soon after ) , which is likely to co-incide with a spike in oil prices to $ US90 due to pumping constraints .
A combination of increased unemployment flowing from oil - price structural inflation of 10 % - 20 % and mortgage defaults due to unmeetable monthly repayments collapses the credit bubble .
Weakened demand due to recession combines with temporary surges in new sweet crude supply .
Oil prices fall , but natural decline in world oil pumping capacity sinks under even a reduced demand by about 2015 or a little earlier .
Recession slips into deep recession by somewhere around the end of 2014 .
( There is a medium odds chance the USA dollar will lose its position as the currency of oil and set off aconfidence cascade into full - on depression in USA by end 2011 .
Deeply recessionary conditions drag on until conditions slowly slip into depression , some time after 2015 but before 2026 .
Climatic , economic or political events in the intervening period may act toorthe onset of depression .
From about 2026 onward , depression becomes a long drawn out adjustment , an adjustment made easier - but not easy - by strong democracy .
Undemocratic andmay ultimately fail to adjust , and the population becomes subjected to terrorist violence from thugs and gangsters employed and manipulated by powerful ideologues and demagogues .
The projections for fading oil supply on the ' down ' side of the Hubbert curve are based on presentation chart 43 from a Presentation at the Technical University of Clausthal , Germany , by petroleum geologist Colin J. Campbell in december 2000 .
There are more up - to - date projections , but the 2000 projections are only trivially out of date .

What is it ?
Ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel TCP connections to a remote host using ICMP echo request and reply packets , commonly known as ping requests and replies .
At first glance , this might seem like a rather useless thing to do , but it can actually come in handy in some cases .
The following example illustrates the main motivation in creating ptunnel : Setting :
You 're on the go , and stumble across an open wireless network .
The network gives you an IP address , but wo n't let you send TCP or UDP packets out to the rest of the internet , for instance to check your mail .
What to do ?
By chance , you discover that the network will allow you to ping any computer on the rest of the internet .
With ptunnel , you can utilize this feature to check your mail , or do other things that require TCP .
Features and requirements
Ptunnel is not a feature - rich tool by any means , but it does what it advertises .
So here is what it can do : Tunnel TCP using ICMP echo request and reply packets
Connections are reliable ( lost packets are resent as necessary )
Handles multiple connections
Acceptable bandwidth ( 150 kb / s downstream and about 50 kb /s upstream are the currently measured maximas for one tunnel , but with tweaking this can be improved further )
Authentication , to prevent just anyone from using your proxy
So what do you need for all this to work ?
One computer accessible on the internet that is not firewalled ( or at least allows incoming ICMP packets )
firewalled ( or at least allows incoming ICMP packets )
A computer to act as the client ( this will usually be your laptop , on the go .. )
Root access , preferably on both computers
A posix - compliant OS , with libpcap ( for packet capturing ) and its associated headers installed ( typically available in a dev-package on Ubuntu )
Or : Windows with mingw and WinPcap installed Compiling the sources simply consists of running make .
No ./ configure , make , make install , just make .
On Windows , you 'll need to run make ptunnel .exe , but that 's it .
The resulting binary is called ptunnel .
See the usage section below for info on running it .
How it works
This is a technical description of how ptunnel works .
If you 're not interested in low - level networking details , you can skip this section .
It might help to read it either way , as it provides some insights into the situations where ptunnel does n't work .
Ptunnel works by tunneling TCP connections over ICMP packets .
In the following , we will talk about the proxy , the client and the destination .
The proxy is the " endpoint " for our ping packets , i.e. the computer that we send the ping packets to .
The client is the computer we 're trying to surf the net from , and the destination is the computer we would normally be trying to access over TCP ( such as a web site or an ssh server somewhere ) .
So , in order to accomplish this , we need the ability to send and receive ping packets .
Many operating systems enable us to do this using so - called raw sockets .
Raw sockets is the preferred mechanism for sending ICMP packets , and is used by both the proxy and the client .
Unfortunately , raw sockets require root , so there is a provision for using standard datagram sockets if they are supported by the operating system ( Mac OS X 10.2 or later supports this , but Linux systems will require root either way ) .
Ptunnel supports this , however it is not recommended for actual use .
We 'll get back to the reason later .
The client will perform all its communications using ICMP echo request ( ping ) packets ( type 8 ) , whereas the proxy will use echo reply packets ( type 0 ) .
In theory , it is possible to have the proxy also use echo request packets ( and thus make it operate without root ) , but these packets are not necessarily forwarded to the client beyond the host network , so they are not used .
Figure 1 . Networking setup .
The protocol
The proxy protocol uses four different message types combined with sequence numbers and an acknowledgement field .
A magic number is used to differentiate our ping requests and replies from " usual " pings .
The general packet format ( not including the IP or ICMP headers ) can be seen in the figure below .
Figure 2 .
The packet format used to exchange messages between client and proxy .
The IP and port fields are only used in packets from the client to the proxy .
They indicate where the client wants the received packets to be forwarded ( they are really only used once - when the proxy receives the first message with state code kProxy_start ) .
State codes :
k Proxy_start = 0 ;
k Proto_data = 1 ;
k Proto_ack = 2 ;
k Proto_close = 3 ;
kProto_authenticate = 4 ;
Identifier flags :
kUser_flag = 1 << 30 ;
k Proxy_flag = 1 << 31 ;
The state code serves a dual purpose .
First , it indicates what kind of message is being received - either a message starting a new proxy session ( kProxy_start ) , a message containing data to be forwarded ( kProto_data ) , an explicit acknowledgement of received packets ( kProto_ack , a close message ( kProto_close ) or an authentication challenge / response ( kProto_authenticate ) .
Second , it indicates who sent the message : A message sent by the client will have the kUser_flag bit set , whereas a message sent by the proxy has the kProxy_flag bit set .
This is necessary since a ping request will cause the operating system on the proxy computer to return its own echo reply , which is identical to the packet we just sent to the proxy .
The ack and seq fields are tightly related .
Modelled after the use of acknowledgements in TCP , the ptunnel protocol places the sequence number of the last packet received into the ack field of any outgoing message .
The seq field is a monotonically increasing 16 - bit counter , that is allowed to wrap around ( ok , so I guess it 's monotonic until it wraps around ) .
Whenever an outgoing packet has been waiting for an acknowledgement too long , the peer will attempt to resend the first packet not yet acknowledged .
The length field simply indicates the length of the data portion of the packet , and is 0 for all other state values than kProto_data .
Finally the rsv field contains two bytes that are reserved ( for now they serve as padding ) .
On receiving a kProxy_start request , a proxy will open a TCP connection to the server given by the ip and port fields .
As data comes in over the TCP connection , the proxy will convert the data to ICMP echo reply packets , and send them to the remote peer .
The client will do the same , except its packets will always be echo request packets .
Authentication
As of version 0.60 , Ping Tunnel supports authentication .
The authentication used is very simple , and works as follows .
The user first specifies a password or passphrase , which is then hashed using the MD5 algorithm ( Ping Tunnel uses the implementation by L. Peter Deutsch , available here .
Note that the implementation is included with Ping Tunnel , so there is no need to download it separately ) .
Whenever a proxy receives a request for a new tunnel , it will respond with an authentication challenge .
The challenge consists of a timestamp augmented with random data , totalling 32 bytes .
The response is calculated as follows ( the + denotes string concatenation ) : md5 ( challenge + md5 ( password ) )
The proxy verifies the result by computing the same md5 sums , and then comparing the two .
If authentication succeeds , the proxy allows TCP traffic to start flowing in either direction ; if not , the connection is torn down .
Handling multiple connections
The proxy handles multiple different connections by using the ICMP identifier field .
A client will randomly generate an identifier when it starts a session , and the remote peer will use this identifier to associate the packets with a connection .
The mechanism is not foolproof , but works acceptably as long as no two instances attempt to use the same identifier ( there is currently no mechanism for reporting such errors ) .
The ICMP sequence number field is not used by ptunnel , mostly due to fears that some routers might drop packets whose sequence number repeats .
Instead , a separate sequence number is used as part of the ptunnel packet format ( see above ) .
Send and receive windows
Ptunnel uses the simple concept of send and receive windows for controlling the number of packets that can be in - flight at the same time .
The window is currently statically allocated at 64 packets , but the number can be tweaked by modifying the ptunnel header file ( yes , a recompile is required ) .
Increasing the window size will improve the maximum potential bandwidth .
The send and receive windows are simply implemented as a set of circular arrays , with pointers indicating the next available send / receive slot , and the first non-acked packet .
Handling packet loss Ptunnel handles packet loss by resending ( presumably ) lost packets .
As it sends packets , it will increment a sequence number .
Both the client and proxy maintain their own sequence number , and also a number indicating the last sequence number acknowledged by the remote peer .
Whenever too much time ( 1.5 seconds ) passes without a packet being acknowledged , the peer will resend that packet .
Note that the peer will only resend the first missing packet .
Once that packet has been acknowledged , it may resend the next packet ( s ) , depending on how many packets were acknowledged .
If the next few packets are acknowlegded as well , they are removed from the send queue .
It is not uncommon for one packet to get lost , with most of the others making it through .
This mechanism avoids unecessary resends as much as possible .
Congestion control Ptunnel currently does no explicit congestion control .
It will send as many ping packets as the window size allows , as slowly or as quickly as it sees fit .
This might be improved in the future , if it turns out to be a problem ( which is not at all unlikely .. ) .
When things do n't work
There are a number of situations where ptunnel will fail .
They can briefly be put into the following categories :
Outgoing / incoming ping not allowed , or filtered by a gateway somewhere along the way Operating system causing trouble Probably some other failures as well ;)
We can't handle the first failure - if our packets are filtered before we can get at them , there 's little we can do .
It is possible to deal with the second scenario by using the packet capturing library to get the packets before the OS sees them .
This is necessary on Mac OS X , and may be necessary on other platforms as well .
The problem lies in that the OS may occasionally not deliver ICMP packets to the raw socket we have opened for sending and receiving .
This happens when the ICMP packet is an echo request ( which the OS handles by itself ) or when the ICMP packet is a resend ( for some weird reason ) .
The workaround is to use packet capture , however this tends to diminish bandwidth by quite a bit .
For this reason , you should always try to run the proxy without packet capturing , and see if that works first .
( This is the default mode . )

Recent changes made by many travel insurers expand the cover offered by their policies in case of terrorist acts , but there ’s a wide variation in what expenses are covered .
Many insurers reviewed the terms of their travel insurance policies and / or the way their policies are applied to specific events after terrorist attacks in early this decade .
The definition of terrorism and the nature of cover for terrorism may vary from insurer to insurer .
It is worth taking the time to understand how terrorism is dealt with in your travel insurance policy if you are considering buying travel insurance for a future trip or you already have travel insurance and are about to travel or are considering canceling a trip because of the threat of terrorism .
Speaking of not being covered , if a policy you are considering says that it covers acts of terrorism but then has a huge laundry list of exceptions , you might want to look elsewhere .
If you are considering buying a policy you should find out exactly what it does and what it does not cover by asking for a copy of the document and reading it carefully , paying particular attention to the exclusions or contacting the insurance company directly .
Read
In your policy ‘ exclusions ’ are things you will not be covered for ?
A general rule with exclusions is ‘ the more exclusions ( or the wider the exclusion ) , the less the cover ’ .
If your policy contains exclusion for ‘ terrorism ’ then just what violent acts are you covered for ?
The answer depends on what acts are considered to be ‘ terrorism ’ .
Some insurance policies define ‘ terrorism ’ to include many acts , for example , as ‘ a violent act or a threat of violence used by a person or organization to promote their cause or beliefs ’ .
Sometimes ‘ terrorism ’ is defined to even include ‘ military force to prevent terrorist attacks ’.
You are covered for a larger range of violent acts if terrorism is an exclusion in your policy and only a small range of acts are defined as ‘ terrorism ” .
Travel insurance policies include different types of cover , for example , medical , luggage and cancellation .
Most insurance policies have general exclusions for all of these types of cover and specific exclusions for only some of these types of cover .
Many travel insurance policies do not cover you for losses arising from terrorism and acts of war .
For example , the policy will list ‘ terrorism and acts of war ’ in the general exclusions or include statements like ‘ we will not pay for any loss that arises from civil war , foreign war , terrorism or any act carried out by a terrorism .
Some travel insurance policies only exclude terrorism from specific types of cover .
This may mean that for any losses arising from terrorism : you are covered for death or medical expenses but you are not covered for other losses , for example , costs resulting from canceling your trip .
Even if your travel insurance policy contains exclusion for terrorism , it may be worth checking with the insurer in case they have reviewed the way their policy applies to a specific event .
WASHINGTON  Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey has firmly rejected Congressional demands that he provide information about the Justice Department ’s investigation into the Central Intelligence Agency ’s destruction of videotapes showing interrogations , a stance that inflamed a feud between Capitol Hill and the administration this afternoon .
“ The department has a long - standing policy of declining to provide nonpublic information about pending matters , ” Mr. Mukasey wrote , in letters to Senate and House committee leaders , in which he noted that the Justice Department ’s National Security Division and the C.I.A. ’s inspector general ’s office have already opened an inquiry into the episode .
Taking a position that annoyed a prominent Republican as well as Democrats , the attorney general wrote , “ This policy is based in part on our interest in avoiding any perception that our law enforcement decisions are subject to political influence . ”
He also rejected suggestions that he appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter , declaring that he was “ aware of no facts at present ” that would make such a step necessary .
The recent disclosure that the videotapes showing the questioning of Al Qaeda suspects were destroyed within the C.I.A. is the latest flare - up in the long - running controversy over what methods have been used in interrogations , and in particular whether any should be considered torture .
Stephon Marbury made a shocking revelation yesterday , saying that when his contract expires with the Knicks in two years , he ’s planning to play in Italy .
Marbury , amidst his 38 - city , cross-country bus tour to promote his discount Starburys sneakers , told The Post he wants to eventually leave the NBA after having visited Italy in May with his wife .
“ I ’m not just thinking of doing it , I ’m going to do it , ” Marbury vowed yesterday .
“ My wife loved it there .
It ’s like a [ David ] Beckham thing . ”
The Marburys visited Rome , Milan and Tuscany .
Marbury has one year left on his contract with Steve & Barry ’s and has told friends he wants to take his sneakers global .
Marbury will be 32 when his contract expires .
“ I would ’ve played 13 years in the league , ” said Marbury , who is writing a Web blog for The Post .
“ That ’s a lot .
Most guys do n’t get to seven . ”
Asked if the Knicks were on the verge of a title in two years , Marbury said , “ We ’re on the verge right now in my mind . ”
Marbury , who said he would n’t want to play anywhere else , says he ’s not sure if the Knicks would re-sign him at age 32 because of knee tendinitis .
Last summer Marbury said he wanted to die a Knick .
There ’s always been speculation Isiah Thomas would trade Marbury during the final year of his contract when it ’s a trade asset for a team looking to clear cap room .
There also are reports the Knicks were trying to get under the cap when Marbury ’s contract expired , but that notion blew up with the Zach Randolph trade on draft day when they took on his four - year deal .
Marbury will make $ 20.1 million this season and $ 21.9 M in his final year .

Despite their radical difference in size , these two dogs have something in common - Gibson the Great Dane and Boo Boo the toy Chihuahua are both world record holders .
Measuring a whopping 107 cm , gentle giant Gibson was named tallest dog back in 2004 .
Joining him in the hall of fame for 2007 is tiny Boo Boo who only measures 10.16 cm tall and is smaller than Gibson 's head .
Scroll down for more ...
The two celebrity hounds , who were both bred in America , met up to celebrate Guinness World Records Day 2007 outside the White House in Washington D.C .
Boo Boo's owner Lana Elswick has bred Chihuahuas in Kentucky for 19 years and said she always knew her one - year - old pooch was special .
The tiny mutt was only about the size of a thumb when she was born ; so small , in fact , that she had to be fed with an eye dropper every two hours before she could eventually nurse a bottle .
Now she is a diminuitive diva .
" She has the attitude of a big dog she would let me know if anyone was around and she would try to guard me if she could , " said Ms Elswick .

Owner Sandy Hall lives with her dog Gibson in Sacramento , California .
The Great Dane is also the world 's tallest therapy dog and regularly visits children 's hospitals .
" He just puts a smile on people 's faces , " Ms Hall said .
" In one split second , people forget their cares and worries . "
Chuck Close at last night ’s Whitney Gala .

After all this time , Chuck Close still does n’t know what to make of his fans .
Last night at the Whitney ’s Gala and Studio Party in his honor , the 67 - year - old artist claimed that he ’s still “ poor white trash from the state of Washington ” and wondered “ what the hell ” he was doing there .
When Michael Ovitz interrupted Vulture ’s chat with him to demand a painting , we began to understand his perspective .
How did you feel about Jerry Saltz ’s article in New York about the Guggenheim ?
I do n’t care about the Guggenheim .
The Guggenheim is n’t involved in anything that I am interested in .
I do n’t care about motorcycles and Armani suits .
What about the licensing out of art - world names to extend art to a larger audience ?
Everything the Guggenheim does … I do n’t understand why they want to franchise it out like a Kentucky Fried Chicken .
So I guess you are n’t a fan of what Steve Wynn has done in Las Vegas .
Any artist who goes to Las Vegas is an idiot as far as I am concerned .
Whoever goes to Las Vegas can stay in Las Vegas .
How do you go about choosing your next portrait subjects ?
I paint my family and friends and other artists .
How does one get to be a part of that circle if he wants you to be inspired to paint him ?
I do n’t work with inspiration .
Inspiration is for amateurs .
I just get to work .
Let ’s talk about the Whitney .
The Whitney knows that as far as this gala is concerned , I am the worm on the hook to get people to come to the museum daily .
But since I am being honored , the thing I wanted to do is celebrate the relationship … [ interrupted by Michael Ovitz ]
Ovitz : Did you tell her that you owe me a painting ?
Close : I owe Michael Ovitz a painting .
Do you encourage a mainstream appreciation of your work , or is art for the elite ?
I ’m poor white trash from the state of Washington .
The fact that art was available to me , a person of no financial means , that galleries were open and the museums provided a smorgasbord of the greatest art in the world … I only want my work in public collections .
I am not interested in it being in private people ’s homes .
At an event honoring your body of work , do you still feel like “ poor white trash ” ?
I ’m not changed .
Let me tell you something .
I go once every four years to the big-boy , tall - boy , fat - guy store .
I buy a new suit , a couple of shirts , a few sweaters , and underwear .
I have size 15 feet so I go to the only shoe store that has shoes my size .
I buy four identical pairs of shoes , and at the end of the first year , I throw one away .
These shoes are the shoes I wear every day to paint in .
I wear them to black - tie events .
I could n’t care less about fashion .
Well , you ’re wearing pretty fancy eyewear .
They are French .
I do n’t know what they are .

Chuck Close at His Gala Party : Eff You Every Much
Great BitTorrent releasers are a comparatively rare breed and until recently , a huge collection of them were safely locked inside a fenced Pink Palace .
Now , thanks to the IFPI , trackers around the world and greater numbers of people than ever before are starting to benefit from an influx of talented OiNK refugees .
OiNK was considered by many to be the finest BitTorrent music tracker the world has ever seen .
Tracking only the finest recordings from virtually every musical genre , beautifully labeled and cataloged releases were its trademark , created by people who thrived under some of the harshest releasing rules the torrent community had ever seen .
Nothing less than the highest quality was good enough for OiNK .
Then the IFPI huffed and puffed and blew down the little pigs home and they had ‘ won ’ .
Not quite .
Did the entire OiNK indexed music library disappear ?
Did the releasers all see the error of their ways and stop releasing there and then ?
Did all the ex-members give up sharing ?
No , of course not .
OiNK did n’t carry any content , its users did .
Taking out the OiNK site did n’t remove a single song from any of OiNK ’s users libraries and they are taking their collections with them as they migrate to other sites , ready to share another day .
TorrentFreak has been listening to some interesting comments from some specialist music trackers ( such as those on this list ) who are not only getting record numbers of signups in the last few days but are also delighted to welcome talented OiNK releasers who seem really keen to share .
One admin told us : “ Since the shutdown of OiNK we ’re getting a spike in new memberships , at least 6 times more .
Normally some of these can be bad members who do not share or are making trouble in the forum but I am happy to say that many come from OiNK and they are behaving like gentlemen ( and ladies ! ) ”
He continued : “ We have an uploader application form on our tracker and we ask a few questions to the guy , then we make a decision if he is reliable etc before we give him releasing rights .
On a regular day that list has many applications from novices with no experience ( which can be trouble ! ) .
Now we get many OiNK members asking to release in this one week .
They have amazing collections and make a 100 % perfect release each time .
It ’s a great boost for our community . ”
TorrentFreak spoke with the admins of three genre - dedicated music trackers who all confirmed that they picked up lots of ex-OiNK members and offers to release this week .
This could be the tip of a very , very large iceberg – OiNK covered just about every genre imaginable and all of those sharers were made homeless after the raid – many of them for up to 10 minutes – but immediately settled in elsewhere , ready to share again .
The Pink Palace may be closed , but the beats go on and on as some of the best sharers in the world spread their wings to trackers far and wide .
Maybe pigs can fly after all .
Jan. 5 , 2007  --
At the moment , Republican strategists and Clinton loyalists share a common dream , an identical yearning and an increasingly forlorn hope : wishing with prayerful fervor for some revelation or scandal or personal weakness that will block Barack Obama 's candidacy for president .
In that context , The Washington Post raises the pre-emptive question of the senator 's direct confession ( in his intimate memoir , " Dreams of My Father " ) that he used cocaine and marijuana in high school and college .
Much to the disappointment of his rivals in both parties , these disclosures stand no chance of derailing his potential campaign and may end up adding to Obama 's unconventional appeal .
First of all , Obama is hardly the first prominent politician to acknowledge youthful indiscretions involving illegal drugs .
Fourteen years ago , Bill Clinton easily survived his discussions of smoking marijuana , and drew far more criticism for his dodgy , weasel - words regarding his experience ( " I smoked , but I did n't inhale " ) than for his one - time exposure to the demon weed .
Al Gore also admitted to dope indulgence ( and reportedly became a heavy user at Harvard , which may help explain the spectacularly weird workings of his mind ) as did Newt Gingrich and John Kerry .
George W. Bush refused to share specifics of his own drug experience beyond a general acknowledgment of a rowdy youth ( " when I was young and stupid , I was young and stupid " ) .
Still , he did little to contradict ubiquitous reports of his consumption of booze , marijuana and even cocaine .
If the American people managed to elect ( twice ) a stonewalling , wealthy frat boy from a spectacularly privileged family despite his reported involvement with illegal substances , they will readily forgive ( and even embrace ) a mixed - race kid from a troubled background whose father abandoned him in his infancy and who wrote candidly , long before his presidential campaign , of his regrettable participation in the drug culture .
Obama suggests in his books that he used marijuana and " blow " to ease the pain of his ongoing struggle to define his racial identity , and that association makes it all but unthinkable that even the most ruthless political operative would attempt to make an issue of long - ago substance abuse .

He blogs at http://michaelmedved.townhall.com/
In fact , Obama 's pre-campaign confessions only add to the seductive sense that there 's something fresh and unprecedented about his candidacy .
He 's not only the first serious candidate of color and 10 years younger than any of his prominent rivals .
He 's also the first presidential possibility in memory who admitted to his drug involvement long before he embarked on a national campaign .
So far , everything about the 2008 race suggests that the American people powerfully crave new and different above more of the same -- and that 's wonderful news for Obama and a serious obstacle for the likes of Hillary Clinton , John McCain , John Kerry , John Edwards and even Al Gore .
This election may represent the first time in recent history that a prior run for president or vice president does n't constitute a formidable advantage .
In that sense , Obama 's drug confessions only add to the sense that he 's a radically different sort of candidate -- and it's hard to see how the confessions will work against him .
At this point , the senator 's potential opponents in both parties need to find a way to make him look less daring and distinctive and refreshing .
Republicans in particular should emphasize the senator 's conventionally liberal voting record and policy positions that echo the tired old lefty nostrums of Ted Kennedy .
His pose as a " new kind of politician " has far more to do with his transracial identity and persuasive rhetorical style than it does with his political platform .
With Hillary apparently determined to burnish her own centrist credentials , she will need to focus her campaign on demonstrating to primary voters and the public at large that Obama does n't qualify as a real " New Democrat " in any sense of the term .

The first comprehensive , nationally representative survey on the prevalence of sexual activity among older Americans provides a portrait of the intimate lives of people ages 57 to 85 .
A majority of older Americans are sexually active and view intimacy as an important part of life , despite a high rate of “ bothersome ” sexual problems , according to a new report in the Aug. 23 , 2007 , issue of The New England Journal of Medicine .
The findings come from the National Social Life , Health and Aging Project , research supported by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) .
The findings shed new light on the intimate social relationships and health of people ages 57 to 85 , informing health care providers and patients about sexual norms in the older U.S. population .
The project is the first comprehensive , nationally representative survey to assess the prevalence of sexual activity , behaviors and problems in relation to health status among people in their late 50s and beyond .
The study provides information about a number of important aspects of health and sexuality with age , including sexual problems in relation to specific chronic health conditions such as arthritis , diabetes and hypertension ; relationships between physical health problems or limitations generally and sexual activity ; and physician communication about sexuality at older ages .
Physical health , the researchers found , was more strongly associated with many sexual problems than age alone .
The study has implications for health education efforts to prevent sexually transmitted disease in older people .
Although data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests stability in HIV diagnoses among Americans aged 50 and older , the number of older people diagnosed with AIDS and living with HIV is increasing , as individuals who were infected with HIV at younger ages are living longer before progressing to AIDS .
However , sexual activity among older adults poses risks for new cases of HIV , as approximately 15 percent of newly diagnosed HIV infections are among Americans over age 50 .
Led by Stacy Tessler Lindau , M.D. , who conducted the study with Linda Waite , Ph.D. , and others at the University of Chicago , the research was funded primarily by the National Institute on Aging ( NIA ) , a component of NIH .
Additional funding came from NIH ’s Office of Research on Women ’s Health , Office of AIDS Research and Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research and from private - sector sources .
Data collection was supported by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago .
Georgeanne E. Patmios of NIA ’s Behavioral and Social Research Program is program officer for the project .
“ Despite the aging of the population , little had been known about the intimate lives of older adults , ” said NIA Director Richard J. Hodes , M.D. “ This study expands our knowledge by reporting , on a national scale , data about sexual functioning and health among older adults . ”
Dr. Lindau expects the study to help open a dialogue between older patients and their doctors as older Americans were very receptive to the survey and its questions .
This openness suggests that , when asked , many older people want to talk about this part of their lives .
“ We found , despite the high prevalence of problems , that most older adults have never discussed sex with a physician .
From a medical and a public health perspective , we have an opportunity and an obligation to do better patient education and counseling about health - related and potentially preventable and treatable sexual problems , ” Dr. Lindau said .
The researchers gathered information from a nationally representative sample of 3,005 men and women ages 57 to 85 years , asking about each person ’s marital or other relationship status , frequency and types of sexual activity during the past 12 months , physical health , and communication with a physician about sex .
They also queried sexually active respondents about the presence of sexual problems .
“ This study breaks new ground in social and behavioral research , ” said Richard Suzman , Ph.D. , director of NIA ’s Behavioral and Social Research Program .
“ Its portrait of this aspect of older Americans ’ lives suggests a previously uncharacterized vitality and interest in sexuality that carries well into advanced age , which perhaps has not been appreciated as an important part of late life . ”
The study found that many older adults are sexually active , but about half of the men and women surveyed reported at least one sexual problem and about a third report at least two problems .
Specifically :
--
In general , older adults are sexually active .
A large portion of respondents said they were sexually active in the preceding 12 months , but the percentage declined with age — from 73 percent of those age 57 to 64 , to 53 percent of those age 65 to 74 , to 26 percent of those age 75 to 85 .
Older women , however , were significantly less likely to report sexual activity than older men and less likely to be in intimate relationships , due in part to women ’s status as widows and the earlier mortality , on average , of men .
-- Healthier people are more likely to report being sexually active .
Eighty - one percent of men and 51 percent of women reporting excellent or very good health said they had been sexually active in the past 12 months .
Of those in fair or poor health , a considerably lower percentage ( 47 percent of men and 26 percent of women ) reported activity in the previous year .
Diabetes and hypertension were strongly associated with some sexual concerns .
-- About half of sexually active older adults report at least one “ bothersome ” sexual problem .
Thirty - seven percent of sexually active men said they had erectile difficulties .
Women most often reported low desire ( 43 percent ) , difficulty with vaginal lubrication ( 39 percent ) , and inability to climax ( 34 percent ) .
-- Most older adults have not discussed sex with their doctors .
Despite the high prevalence of sexual problems , only 38 percent of men and 22 percent of women said they had discussed sex with a physician since age 50 .

What holds the sky up ?
Why do some people get bitten by midges while others appear immune ?
And do cats have belly buttons ?
A new book tries to answer 300 of these niggling questions about the world around us .
Here , SARAH CHALMERS presents a selection of the most puzzling - and their answers ...
Why do we get dizzy when we stand on top of a tall building ?
Our eyes are used to seeing the ground somewhere near our feet .
So if the ground suddenly appears to be much further away from our head than normal , our brains get thoroughly confused .
This means it tries to correct the different perspective back to what our eyes are used to seeing .
This over - correction by the brain makes us feel dizzy and can also lead to a feeling of anxiety .
What causes the feeling of butterflies in the stomach ?
These are actually small muscle contractions in the digestive tract .
The gut 's muscles are normally well co-ordinated - but when disrupted by stress , the body 's priority is no longer digestion .
So , rather than wasting vital blood and oxygen supplies on processing food , the body diverts them to the legs where they can be better used - for example , to help us run out of the way of danger .
The gut is therefore shut down by the brain , leaving it with irregular rhythmic contractions .
Do babies dream ?
With their limited vision and understanding of the world , it is often impossible to imagine a newborn baby can dream .
But we all dream every night - and babies , in fact , dream more than adults .
This is because most dreaming occurs during the lighter phases of sleep which babies , with their regular naps , have a lot of .
And although their sense of sight and language skills are not developed , they will dream of bright lights and colours , fuzzy images , noises and smells - in fact , any of the physical stimuli they experience while awake .
Why do some people get bitten by midges , while others are immune ?
Everyone has a different smell , and insects can detect these differences and express their preference by feeding on some people and not others .
The difference in our smell is due to the amount of carbon dioxide we expel .
We all expel different quantities in our breath , and it is this gas which attracts insects such as mosquitoes and midges .
Insect repellents work by masking these odours or creating smells insects find repulsive - lemon or garlic usually work well .
Why does a drink fizz up when you drop an ice cube in ?
In a liquid , gas bubbles are formed when they attach to a solid surface .
They form especially well when placed against something rough .
So , in a liquid drink there are thousands of tiny potential bubbles in the dissolved carbon dioxide jostling for position against the wall of the glass , hoping to take shape .
When a rough ice cube is placed in the drink , the carbon dioxide fights to attach itself to the cube so it can shape itself as lots of gassy bubbles .
It prefers the ice cube to the glass because of the roughness of the cube .
If you cut a worm in half will both halves live ?
The end with the head will survive if the cut is made behind the fatty part of the worm , where the major organs are located .
While the worm cannot grow a new head and organs , the nonessential body fat in the lower half of its body can easily be renewed and replaced .
Do cats have belly buttons ?
Indeed they do , and it is located just below the rib cage - similar to humans .
However , the cat 's navel is nothing like ours .
It is hidden under its fur and resembles a scar , rather than the typical human 's round or oval - shaped navel .
This is because it is the remnants of the umbilical cord which the mother cat cuts with her teeth just after the kitten is born .
Why do we never see baby pigeons ?
Ducklings , infant starlings and sparrows are all common sights , yet we never see a baby pigeon .
This is because they do n't leave the nest until they are 35 days old and have fully - formed feathers to allow them to fly .
So by the time we see them leave the nest , they look no different from fully - grown pigeons .
Why do n't birds get electric shocks from standing on high - voltage wires ?
Electricity always prefers to flow through the easiest route .
Metals are the easiest materials for electricity to travel through .
This is because the tiny atoms which make up metals contain even tinier electrons that can move from atom to atom .
So the electrons bounce from atom to atom , taking electricity along with them .
But when birds stand on high - voltage wires , the electrons cannot move to the atoms which make up their feet .
The bird 's feet are highly resistant to electricity .
So when faced with these two routes , the electricity always chooses the wire with its much lower resistance .
What holds the sky up ?
This question is n't as daft as it sounds .
After all , the atmosphere is exclusively made up of gases .
These can be squashed as their molecules have very loose bonds connecting them ( as opposed to any solid material 's molecules , which have very firm bonds holding them together ) .
So if the air is so squashy and flexible , why does n't gravity just act on those loosely attached molecules , pulling them all down nearer the ground ?
Instead of being miles thick , why can't the atmosphere be just a few metres thick ?
In fact , it is these same flexible molecules which keep the air right where it is .
The movement of gases ' molecules is so great that they are never still enough for gravity to act upon them .
But while they bounce around just enough to stop gravity pulling them towards Earth , they do n't move around so much that they become detached from the atmosphere and zip off into space .
Can chewing gum get tangled up in your intestine ?
Many parents have warned their children this might happen - but it simply is n't true .
Although gum can stick to shoes , bus seats , hair and pavements , it makes its way unhindered through the digestive system - passing straight through the stomach and on to the intestines .
It can not adhere to the moist and slippery walls of the gut .
Why do we always see the same side of the Moon ?
Our Moon always keeps the same face turned towards the Earth because the time it takes to orbit us happens to be the exact same time it takes to rotate on its own axis .
The Moon takes 27 days to revolve once around the Earth and 27 days to turn once on its own axis .
Do astronauts grow in space ?
Yes !
In space , the body does not experience the same downward pull of gravity that it does on Earth .
As a result , the gaps between the vertebrae in the spine expand and astronauts do get slightly taller .
When they return to Earth , the gravity quickly squashes them back to normal height , however .
Why are bananas curved ?
Bananas grow on tall trees in big bunches around the top of the trunk .
Their curving shows how efficient nature is .
Their shape means they can fit very closely together , which allows more bananas to grow around the tree - as many as 50 in a bunch .
Why do razor blades become blunt - after all , hair is soft ?
A blade is very thin - the thinner the blade , the sharper the cut .
And the thinner the blade , the fewer atoms there are at the cutting edge .
As the blade passes over the stubble on a chin , the hair knocks individual atoms off the steel blade .
Since there are many thousands of hairs it does n't take long to slightly dull the blade .
Why does n't blood rush to a bat 's head when it hangs upside down ?
All animals are designed to make sure that enough blood circulates round their body regardless of what position they are in .
In this way , bats are no different from humans .
The process involves the force of the heartbeat ensuring that blood is pushed around the relevant parts of the body , through the system of the arteries , capillaries and veins and back to the heart again , without being affected by gravity or the direction of the body .
The fact that bats have proportionately larger hearts than many mammals means the blood is even more efficiently pumped around their bodies and does n't drain to the head just because they are hanging upside down .
If a car travels at 1,000 mph with its headlights turned on , does the light travel faster ?
If a man in a car fired a bullet forward at 500 mph , and the car was doing 1,000 mph , then the bullet would travel at 1,500 mph .
But if he switched on the headlights , the light would travel at its usual speed of 186,000 miles per second , not 186,000 miles per second plus 1,000 mph .
It is one of those quirks of science that light travels at the same speed for everyone in the universe - no matter how fast the actual light source is travelling .

Kill - the - penny bill introduced
Citing spiraling zinc costs , Rep. Jim Kolbe continues his quest to eliminate the 1 - cent piece .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Representative Jim Kolbe wants to do away with the penny - and for a second time has introduced legislation that would effectively kill it .
The Currency Overhaul for an Industrious Nation ( COIN )
Act would force the rounding off of all cash transactions to the nearest 5 cents , making the penny coin useless for everyday transactions .
Representative Jim Kolbe Quick Vote
Should the penny be eliminated ?
Yes No or View results sponsored by
The move is in part a reaction to the rising cost of zinc - the penny 's main ingredient - which at current prices brings the cost of making the coin to 1.4 cents each .
Kolbe introduced similar legislation in 2001 when prices for metals were n't as high .
The bill failed to pass or even to make it to a floor vote .
Since then , however , zinc costs have nearly doubled .
" The penny has been a nuisance for years , " said Kolbe ( R - Arizona ) at a press conference on Tuesday , " but now that the cost of a penny exceeds its value , the landscape of the debate has completely changed . "
Over half of the U.S. Mint 's coin production comes in the form of pennies .
At current prices , the Mint would spend some $ 44 million producing pennies this year , nearly $ 14 million more than in 2005 .
As with the 2001 bill , the new one calls for rounding down any cash transaction that ends in in 1,2,6 and 7 cents ; totals ending in 3,4,8 , or 9 cents would round up .
Chuck Todd , editor - in - chief of the political briefing publication , Hotline , thinks it 's unlikely Kolbe 's bill will have better luck this time .
" The only time these coin bills are successful is when you create a collectible , " Todd says .
The bill does , however , call for various commemorative currencies , including a dollar coin and a $ 2 bill .
A recent Gallup / USA
Today also indicates a tough road ahead for the bill .
Fifty - five percent of respondents consider the penny useful compared to 43 percent who think it should be eliminated .
More telling , 76 percent of respondents said they would pick up a penny if they saw it on the ground .
Kolbe 's home state of Arizona is the largest copper producing state in the nation .
Copper is the main material of the nickel which would benefit by becoming the lowest denomination of currency in circulation .
Other elements
Kolbe 's bill also takes aim at Massachusetts - based Crane Paper , which has been the exclusive supplier of paper to the Bureau of Engraving since 1879 .
Crane has benefited from legislation requirements that effectively makes it the only possible supplier of the paper .
Kolbe 's bill would simply require the paper to be " produced entirely within the United States , " rather than the current requirements that it be produced domestically by a company 90 - percent American owned .
Kolbe , as a freetrader , opposes such protectionism .
COIN also provides for a study of less costly metals to replace zinc , copper and other materials used in American coins .
The bill also calls for organizational changes : Oversight of the U.S. Mint and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing would be transferred from the Department of the Treasury to the Federal Reserve Board .
Kolbe 's office maintains that since the Federal Reserve is in charge of the dollar , moving the currency under the Federal Reserve would remove a layer of bureaucracy .
Others do n't see the wisdom in the proposed move .
" Sure , you 're taking bureaucracy away from the Treasury but you 're adding it to the Federal Reserve , " said Todd .
" Where do you get the efficiency ? "

The fight against the penny
Water sure has come a long way .
In the old days , people used to drink water from streams , rivers or wells .
Then along came plumbing and people raved about tap water .
Then tap water went out of style as Brita filters and bottled water came into fashion .
So what 's next then ?
Aged water of course .
The geniuses over at Suntory Japan decided to pour some water into a bunch of casks , then let it sit around for a good 12 years before selling it at your local convenience store .
Some things improve with age , like wine , cheese and beef , and it seems that water is now on the list as well !
So what happens to water after 12 years ?
Amazingly enough , it becomes alcoholic !
People have always been so busy making alcohol with grapes or barley , etc , I guess it never occured to anyone that you could just forget about stuff like that and let water ferment all by itself .
At 9 % alcohol no less , it 's looking like the invention of the century !
That brownish tinge is something of a turnoff though , but after 12 years of sitting in an oaken cask or whatever , I suppose you can't really expect water to look like water anymore , right ?
Ok , let 's give it a try .
Hmm , it 's the weirdest thing , but it kind of tastes like whisky a little bit .
You do n't suppose that they .... Naaaah .
Have you ever known Japanese companies to make silly label mistakes ?
Anyway wow !
I just find it so hard to believe that no one ever thought of trying this before .
People who say that everything 's already been done sure have n't spent any time in Japan !
What 'll they think of next ? |
Information chips implanted in the brain .
Electromagnetic pulse weapons .
The middle classes becoming revolutionary , taking on the role of Marx 's proletariat .
The population of countries in the Middle East increasing by 132 % , while Europe 's drops as fertility falls .
" Flashmobs " - groups rapidly mobilised by criminal gangs or terrorists groups .
This is the world in 30 years ' time envisaged by a Ministry of Defence team responsible for painting a picture of the " future strategic context " likely to face Britain 's armed forces .
It includes an " analysis of the key risks and shocks " .
Rear Admiral Chris Parry , head of the MoD's Development , Concepts & Doctrine Centre which drew up the report , describes the assessments as " probability - based , rather than predictive " .
The 90 - page report comments on widely discussed issues such as the growing economic importance of India and China , the militarisation of space , and even what it calls " declining news quality " with the rise of " internet - enabled , citizen - journalists " and pressure to release stories " at the expense of facts " .
It includes other , some frightening , some reassuring , potential developments that are not so often discussed .
New weapons
An electromagnetic pulse will probably become operational by 2035 able to destroy all communications systems in a selected area or be used against a " world city " such as an international business service hub .
The development of neutron weapons which destroy living organisms but not buildings " might make a weapon of choice for extreme ethnic cleansing in an increasingly populated world " .
The use of unmanned weapons platforms would enable the " application of lethal force without human intervention , raising consequential legal and ethical issues " .
The " explicit use " of chemical , biological , radiological , and nuclear weapons and devices delivered by unmanned vehicles or missiles .
Technology
By 2035 , an implantable " information chip " could be wired directly to the brain .
A growing pervasiveness of information communications technology will enable states , terrorists or criminals , to mobilise " flashmobs " , challenging security forces to match this potential agility coupled with an ability to concentrate forces quickly in a small area .
Marxism
" The middle classes could become a revolutionary class , taking the role envisaged for the proletariat by Marx , " says the report .
The thesis is based on a growing gap between the middle classes and the super - rich on one hand and an urban under - class threatening social order :
" The world 's middle classes might unite , using access to knowledge , resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest " .
Marxism could also be revived , it says , because of global inequality .
An increased trend towards moral relativism and pragmatic values will encourage people to seek the " sanctuary provided by more rigid belief systems , including religious orthodoxy and doctrinaire political ideologies , such as popularism and Marxism " .
Pressures leading to social unrest
By 2010 more than 50 % of the world 's population will be living in urban rather than rural environments , leading to social deprivation and " new instability risks " , and the growth of shanty towns .
By 2035 , that figure will rise to 60 % .
Migration will increase .
Globalisation may lead to levels of international integration that effectively bring inter -state warfare to an end .
But it may lead to " inter - communal conflict " - communities with shared interests transcending national boundaries and resorting to the use of violence .
Population and Resources
The global population is likely to grow to 8.5bn in 2035 , with less developed countries accounting for 98 % of that .
Some 87 % of people under the age of 25 live in the developing world .
Demographic trends , which will exacerbate economic and social tensions , have serious implications for the environment - including the provision of clean water and other resources - and for international relations .
The population of sub-Saharan Africa will increase over the period by 81 % , and that of Middle Eastern countries by 132 % .
The Middle East
The massive population growth will mean the Middle East , and to a lesser extent north Africa , will remain highly unstable , says the report .
It singles out Saudi Arabia , the most lucrative market for British arms , with unemployment levels of 20 % and a " youth bulge " in a state whose population has risen from 7 million to 27 million since 1980 .
" The expectations of growing numbers of young people [ in the whole region ] many of whom will be confronted by the prospect of endemic unemployment ... are unlikely to be met , " says the report .
Islamic militancy
Resentment among young people in the face of unrepresentative regimes " will find outlets in political militancy , including radical political Islam whose concept of Umma , the global Islamic community , and resistance to capitalism may lie uneasily in an international system based on nation - states and global market forces " , the report warns .
The effects of such resentment will be expressed through the migration of youth populations and global communications , encouraging contacts between diaspora communities and their countries of origin .
Tension between the Islamic world and the west will remain , and may increasingly be targeted at China " whose new - found materialism , economic vibrancy , and institutionalised atheism , will be an anathema to orthodox Islam " .
Iran
Iran will steadily grow in economic and demographic strength and its energy reserves and geographic location will give it substantial strategic leverage .
However , its government could be transformed .
" From the middle of the period , " says the report , " the country , especially its high proportion of younger people , will want to benefit from increased access to globalisation and diversity , and it may be that Iran progressively , but unevenly , transforms ... into a vibrant democracy . "
Terrorism
Casualties and the amount of damage inflicted by terrorism will stay low compared to other forms of coercion and conflict .
But acts of extreme violence , supported by elements within Islamist states , with media exploitation to maximise the impact of the " theatre of violence " will persist .
A " terrorist coalition " , the report says , including a wide range of reactionary and revolutionary rejectionists such as ultra-nationalists , religious groupings and even extreme environmentalists , might conduct a global campaign of greater intensity " .
Climate change
There is " compelling evidence " to indicate that climate change is occurring and that the atmosphere will continue to warm at an unprecedented rate throughout the 21st century .
It could lead to a reduction in north Atlantic salinity by increasing the freshwater runoff from the Arctic .
This could affect the natural circulation of the north Atlantic by diminishing the warming effect of ocean currents on western Europe .
" The drop in temperature might exceed that of the miniature ice age of the 17th and 18th centuries . "
Snow demands reporter change ' twisted words ' in article David Edwards and Will Menaker

White House press secretary Tony Snow took time out from answering questions at Wednesday 's briefing to lecture a veteran reporter on journalism and demand that he change the " twisted words " in an article he had written .
Towards the end of the briefing Snow called on Les Kinsolving , a long time correspondent and talk radio host , famous for his sometimes bizarre questions and cantankerous attitude , whose website touts him " as one of the few who has the guts to ask probing questions and even providing comic relief . "
Kinsolving asked Snow whether the President thinks it would be a good idea for all Americans to prepare an emergency survival kit for a possible terrorist attack or natural disaster .
Snow quickly said he could n't comment , and then proceeded to take time out to lecture Kinsolving on his job , " Let me just point out , " Snow said , " that you need to ask questions that bear on the President 's responsibilities . "
Snow continued to press Kinsolving , " I saw the piece you wrote the other day , that has been thoroughly twisting [ sic ] out of context . "
At this point Kinsolving tried to get a word in , but Snow was having none of it , " You know what I do n't care , because the fact is , if someone is going to take questions about things that do n't fall under the president 's purview , and I answer that question , and it gets twisted , it is a disservice to this White House and the craft of journalism . "
It was never clear exactly what piece Snow was objecting to , but he was annoyed enough to suggest , " that if I were you , I would pick up the phone and tell them to start cleaning up or writing corrections . "
After being scolded , Kinsolving moved to his next question without missing a beat , asking if the President would call a lame - duck session of Congress to try and pass immigration reform again .
In his latest World Net Daily column , publisher Joseph Farah stands up for his White House correspondent .
Farah writes , " Since talk radio has been largely credited with having led to the defeat of the Bush - Kennedy ' Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill , ' the press room resentment of Kinsolving has been apparent not only from Snow  but from unidentified members of the press corps . "
Referring to Snow 's words on Wednesday to Kinsolving , Farah writes , " This is a rebuke , and a threat , and an attempt to control Les Kinsolving and WND 's right to ask questions at the White House . "
Oddly , Farah complains that longtime correspondent Helen Thomas has been " treated with with respect  even deference by Snow , " when compared to Kinsolving .
However , the most notable occurrences inside the briefing room the last few years have been the contentious battles between Thomas and the White House secretary , including the time when Snow thanked her " for the Hezbollah view . "
Farah 's column also announces that " Kinsolving will no longer attend " the " Tony - Snow - censored White House news briefings . "
" We do most sadly regret that under the pressure of such low ratings for President Bush , his press secretary  who puts up with so much abuse from Old Big Media reporters  has decided to discriminate against Les Kinsolving , who will continue to be our White House correspondent ... "
Farah adds .
From now on , WND plans to " publish one question from WND , one from our White House correspondent , Les Kinsolving , and one selected from among our 8 million readers . "
" If Snow answers any of these three questions , we will be happy to so report , " Farah adds .
" What we suspect , however , is that rarely will such questions be either answered , or asked , in the presently Tony - Snow - censored White House news briefings  which Kinsolving will no longer attend . "
The following video is from The White House broadcast on July 25 .
The patient was a 37 - year - old man who had been physically abused as a boy by his schizophrenic mother , often while he lay in bed trying to fall asleep .
Nevertheless , he had grown into a reasonably normal , gainfully employed adult , and he thought that the worst was behind him , until one night he awoke to find an intruder rummaging through his dresser drawers .
After that , his nightmares began — terrifying , recurrent dreams in which the intruder was a middle - age woman and a knife dangled with Damoclesian contempt from the ceiling fan over his head .
“ The old fear memories had not gone away , ” said Dr. Ross Levin , a psychologist and sleep researcher at Yeshiva University in New York .
They “ were easily reactivated by the recent trauma , ” and just as readily twisted into the basis of a repetitive nightmare .
Dr. Levin urged the patient to reframe the dream and rehearse alternatives to swinging blades and frozen fear , until finally the nightmares abated and the man could regain his footing .
Few of us suffer from nightmares crippling and persistent enough to demand treatment .
Yet we all know how bad a nightmare feels , how it surrounds you and surges up to drown you and makes your teeth fall out in chunks and gives you leukemia and look , your 6 - year - old daughter is running back and forth through traffic , and oh no , this train is headed the wrong way and it ’s past midnight , and there you are a cowardly third - grader back on Creston Avenue in the Bronx , no , please , not the Bronx !
And you scream and you thrash and you want to wake up .
By all evidence , outrageously bad dreams are a universal human experience .
Sometimes the dreams are scary enough to jolt the slumberer awake , in which case they meet the formal definition of nightmares — bad dreams that wake you up .
At other times , they are even worse .
The sleeper thinks the nightmare is over , only to step into Your Nested Nightmare , Chapter II .
Whatever the particulars of the plot , researchers say , nightmares and dreadful dreams offer potentially telling clues into the larger mystery of why we dream in the first place , how our dreaming and waking lives may intersect and cross - infect each other , and , most baffling of all , how we manage to construct a virtual reality in our skull , a seemingly life - size , multidimensional , sensorily rich nocturnal roundhouse staffed with characters so persuasive you want to ... strangle them , before they can strangle you .
In cooperation with estateguru I ’m starting a raffle on the blog today .
You ’ll find more details at the end of this post .
I ’ve written very little about estateguru on the blog so far .
Estateguru is currently mixing up the real estate market in the P2P area quite a bit .
Recently the 100 million € threshold was reached , i.e. 100 Mio. € invested in real estate projects , primarily in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania .
Finland should come next and some loans from Spain were already on the site .
100 Mio. € credit volume does n’t seem to be much compared to mintos ( which currently achieve this per month ) , but estateguru is not a marketplace like mintos , it ’s a provider that covers the whole process and therefore I find the growth within 6 years very remarkable .
estateguru ‘s declared goal is to become the leading provider for short - term , real estate secured loans in Europe .
2016 when I came across estateguru , there were not even 5000 investors , currently there are already over 20000 investors and still growing .
In spite of the strong investor growth there have always been enough investment opportunities lately , in 2016 you had to lie in wait for a while and immediately strike when new loans were put online .
The two main reasons for me to invest with estateguru and not on German platforms like exporo , bergfürst and co , were the higher interest rate level and the mostly first - class collateral .
The German platforms almost always offer the loans with secondary collateral , which means that in the event of a default you only get second place , in most cases a bank is registered first .
If something remains after the bank , it is distributed to the investors of the second rank .
According to current statistics , estateguru has over 93 % of the loans with a first - ranking land charge , i.e. the probability of a high realisation rate is significantly better .
Nevertheless , there are of course also defaults at estateguru and there has been a lot of discussion about recovery lately .
In order to improve further , estateguru recently hired the former Head of Retail Credit Risk of Coop as Baltic Risk Manager .
So that we can hope that the recovery rates can be further increased .
The raffle
Now for the exciting part , who registers with estateguru between 18.03 .
and 01.04.2019 via my link and successfully completes the authentication process , automatically participates in the draw .
On 02.04.2019 the two winners will be drawn , both will receive 50 € credit in their estateguru account .
The promotion is only valid for new investors .
The raffle is carried out directly by estateguru , I will not receive any personal data from you .
Looking more closely at the cable universe itself — among the three channels as well as across day parts — PEJ found distinct differences between the three channels , far more than discerned between the three commercial network channels or newspapers .
As an example , we found that coverage of the three biggest stories of the quarter — Iraq policy debate , the 2008 campaign and Anna Nicole Smith differed greatly across the three channels and day parts .
Overall , MSNBC and CNN were much more consumed with the war in Iraq than was Fox .
MSNBC , for instance , devoted nearly a third of the time studied to the war ( 26 % on the policy debate , 3 % on events on the ground and 2 % the homefront ) .
Fox , by contrast , spent less than half that much time on the war — 15 % in all , ( 10 % on the policy debate , 3 % on events in Iraq and 1 % on the homefront ) .
Percent of Newshole Devoted Three Major Stories on Cable TV
Dec. 31 , '06 – Mar. 31 , '07
Iraq War Total
( all 3 threads ) 2008 Presidential Campaign Anna Nicole Smith CNN 25 7 4 Fox News 15 9 10 MSNBC 31 14 6 All Cable 23 % 9 % 7 %
On CNN , Iraq coverage totaled 25 % , again mostly focused on policy debate ( 14 % ) .
Events on the ground received 7 % of the coverage ( coming in second overall ) while the homefront trailed at 3 % .
MSNBC also spent more time on the presidential campaign than its rivals ( 14 % ) , compared with 9 % on Fox and 7 % on CNN .
If Fox was less focused on the Iraq War , what took its place ?
Mostly — according to the numbers — Anna Nicole Smith .
Coverage of her death trailed just barely the airtime spent on the Iraq policy debate , accounting for 9.6 % of all the Fox content studied ( versus 10.1 % for the Iraq policy debate ) .
Fox also stood out for its lack of coverage on the firings of the U.S. attorneys , compared with the other channels .
The story , which gained real momentum in mid March , consumed a mere 2 % of Fox ’s total airtime .
CNN devoted twice that percent ( 4 % ) and MSNBC four times ( 8 % ) .
Another interesting comparison is the percent of time devoted to just a few big stories .
On MSNBC , more than half of its programming consisted of just four stories .
On CNN and Fox , it was n’t until the 9th and 11th stories respectively that we reached 49 % .
Moreover , MSNBC ’s four top stories reveal something about the network ’s identity .
The perennial third - place finisher in the cable news ratings race sometimes seemed to struggle in trying to create a coherent identity and niche .
Officials recently stated their intention to focus on Washington politics and policy .
The study demonstrates that strategy .
The network ’s top four stories — the Iraq policy debate , the 2008 campaign , the fired U.S. attorneys , and the Valerie Plame leak / Scooter Libby trial — are all , at their core , about Washington and politics .
When added together , they accounted for 55 % of MSNBC ’s total coverage .
( The same four stories filled 26 % of the Fox News Channel ’s airtime and 27 % of CNN ’s newshole . )
That emphasis on Beltway topics is even more obvious in a prime - time MSNBC lineup of hosts that includes former Jimmy Carter speechwriter Chris Matthews , outspoken liberal Keith Olbermann , veteran conservative host Tucker Carlson , and former Republican Congressman Joe Scarborough .
Nearly two - thirds ( 62 % ) of MSNBC ’s prime time airtime was consumed by those four stories in the first part of 2007 .
When it comes to the Fox News Channel , there has long been a debate in media circles about whether the cable ratings leader has a clear conservative tilt or whether it is an antidote to a media landscape dominated by liberals .
That argument is beyond of the scope of this report , but Fox gave considerably less coverage than its rivals to two subjects that were largely bad news for the Bush administration — the war in Iraq and the U.S. attorneys scandal .
Cable Coverage of Select Stories
Percent of Newshole ,
Dec. 31 , '06 – Mar. 31 , '07 Iraq War U.S. Attorneys Fox News 15 % 2 % CNN 25 % 4 % MSNBC 31 % 8 %
Aside from its high level of interest in the Anna Nicole Smith saga , one of Fox ’s other top - 10 stories ( that did not make either CNN ’s or MSNBC ’s list ) was a sensational crime tale .
The network devoted 2 % of its total airtime to the January tale of two Missouri teenage boys who were abducted and ultimately rescued from a man now charged with kidnapping , sodomy and attempted murder .
It is harder to characterize CNN — which fell in the first quarter of 2007 somewhere in between the Fox News Channel and MSNBC in its story selection .
The one area of obvious distinction was the network ’s emphasis on the immigration debate , which was its sixth biggest story at 4 % .
The subject was not among MSNBC ’s top - 10 story list and Fox devoted only 2 % of its coverage to the topic .
CNN ’s attention to the issue stems from the relentless coverage by Lou Dobbs , the host of the network ’s 6 pm show , and an outspoken advocate for stricter enforcement of immigration laws .
More than one - third ( 35 % ) of all immigrations stories — across all the media studied — appeared on the Lou Dobbs ’ show .
Cable Differences by Daypart
There are also noticeable differences in cable news depending on the time of day .
Overall , the three channels were much more distinct from each other in the daytime hours .
Each had a different top story in the first quarter of the year .
Fox viewers were most likely to learn about Anna Nicole ( 17 % ) , while MSNBC talked primarily about the upcoming elections ( 16 % ) and CNN spent most time on Iraq policy debate ( 11 % ) .
Again , MSNBC stood out here for spending more time on just a few stories , a narrower or more focused or targeted agenda .
The top three stories — the campaign , Iraq policy and Anna Nicole Smith — amounted to 41 % of all the daytime programming studied , versus about 25 % devoted to the top three stories on Fox and CNN .
Percent of Newshole Devoted Three Major Stories on Cable TV
Dec. 31 , '06 – Mar. 31 , '07
Iraq War Total ( all 3 threads ) 2008 Presidential Campaign Anna Nicole Smith Cable Daytime 15 % 7 % 11 % CNN 20 2 5 Fox News 6 5 17 MSNBC 18 16 10 Cable Evening 25 % 10 % 6 % CNN 26 8 4 Fox News 17 10 8 MSNBC 36 13 4
In the later programs , the biggest difference was in the degree of emphasis , rather than in the selection of stories themselves .
All three channels led with the Iraq policy debate , but MSNBC spent more than twice as much of its airtime ( 30 % ) on the subject than Fox ( 12 % ) or CNN ( 15 % ) .
The second story was also the same across channels — the 2008 elections — again with MSNBC devoting a greater percent to the topic than the other two ( 13 % versus 10 % for Fox and 8 % for CNN ) .
After that , the three channels diverged .
Fox continued it primetime focus on Anna Nicole ( 8 % ) , while CNN moved to events in Iraq ( 7 % ) and MSNBC talked about the fired U.S. attorneys ( 10 % ) .

A pack of killer whales uses waves to knock seals off the ice .
Several orcas work together to make a wave that will wash this seal into the water .
Courtesy of the researchers
Some Antarctic orcas use the cunning tactic of regularly hunting in packs and making waves to wash seals off floating ice , researchers have confirmed .
The behaviour was first seen in 1979 , but at the time it was considered a one - time moment of orca ingenuity .
Now , Ingrid Visser of the Orca Research Trust in New Zealand and her colleagues report on six further observations of the animals using group hunting behaviour to divide ice floes , push them into open water , and create waves to wash animals off them into their waiting jaws .
The behaviour has been seen only along the Antarctic Peninsula and nowhere else in the world , they note , including other icy orca habitats in the Arctic and Antarctic .
The report is published1 in the journal Marine Mammal Science , and a recent video of the behaviour is available on You Tube ( with the key moment happening 2 minutes 40 seconds into the tape ) .
It is not the first time a complex behaviour has been seen in just a few orcas .
In the early 1970s , an orca was seen in Argentina beaching itself next to seals .
At first it seemed to be in distress , but then it lunged at seals nearby , grabbed one by the neck , and dragged it back into the water .
This beaching hunting technique has since been observed hundreds of times in Argentina among a small group of orcas .
Studies have shown that the orcas can time their forays onto land to coincide with the tides , so they run less risk of becoming permanently beached .
Hunting school
Both the beaching and the wave hunting seem to be techniques that pod elders teach to younger animals .
The Argentinean orcas have been seen nudging youngsters onto the shore , encouraging them to try the tactic , often coming up alongside to demonstrate .
In the group at the Antarctic Peninsula , young orcas are often present during the hunt , and adults sometimes put living seals back on the ice after catching them , seemingly so that the young can have another try .
“ This is orca culture , ” says Visser .

The unique cultural characteristics of different orca pods may spur a reconsideration of their conservation status says Astrid van Ginneken at the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor , Washington .
Orcas ( Orcinus orca ) are not considered an endangered or threatened species ; they are found in all the world 's oceans .
Some local populations , however , are threatened by changes to their habitat .
Whether subsets of orcas with unique cultures should be considered separately is a matter that has not really been dealt with , she says .
“ Distinct social populations with specialized traditions are far more at risk than the genetic population , and our conservation policies need to reflect that , ” says van Ginneken .
The several years without an attack on U.S. soil lulled some Americans into thinking that the war on terror was taking place only overseas .
Few corporations increased security spending .
Americans increasingly questioned President Bush 's security policies , the Patriot Act , and Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge 's ridiculed color codes .
In the 2004 presidential election George W. Bush won a second term in part by dismissing such issues as whether the mishandling of the Iraq War had made us less secure , whether we had paid enough attention to al - Qaeda , and whether we were adequately addressing our vulnerabilities at home .
Then the second wave of al - Qaeda attacks hit America .
Since then we have spiraled downward in terms of economic strength , national security , and civil liberties .
No one could stand here today , in 2011 , and say that America has won the war on terror .
To understand how we failed to win , and exactly what has been lost along the way , I want to look at the past seven years in some detail .
2005 : Return to the Homeland Battlefields
The U.S. government had predicted that future attacks , if they came , would likely be on financial institutions , noting that Osama bin Laden had issued instructions to destroy the U.S. economy .
Thus when the casinos were attacked , it was a surprise .
It should n't have been ; we knew that Las Vegas had been under surveillance by al - Qaeda since at least 2001 .
Despite that knowledge casino owners had done little to increase security , not wanting to slow people down on their way into the city 's pleasure palaces .

Theme - park owners were also locked into a pre-9/11 , " it ca n't happen here " mindset , and consequently were caught off guard , as New Yorkers and Washingtonians had been in 2001 .
The first post -9/11 attacks on U.S. soil came not from airplanes but from backpacks and Winnebagos .
They were aimed at places where we used to have fun , what we then called " vacation destinations . "
These places were particularly hard to defend .
Peter and Margaret Rataczak , of Wichita , Kansas , were the first to die on June 29 , 2005 , in a new wave of suicide attacks launched against the United States in retaliation for the killing of Osama bin Laden that spring , and for the continuing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq .
These attacks were every bit as well planned as those of 9/11 and , in typical al - Qaeda fashion , used low - technology means to achieve maximum public impact .
What we know about the attacks ' planning and execution comes in large part from tourists who provided photos and video from their travels .
Without these images we might never have known that the Rataczaks ' killers were non-Arab .
It would also have been harder to discover that they seem to have entered the United States by driving across the border from Canada .

In order to save money for the poker tables that night , Peter chose to stay at an RV campground , parking his Winnebago at around 4:00 p.m.
Shortly thereafter a casually dressed Asian couple approached the Rataczaks ' secluded campsite with a map unfolded in front of them .
Only the birds heard the silenced shots .
The first murders by the group calling itself al - Qaeda of North America had been carried out .
Seeking to impose order on largely unregulated high - seas climate engineers , the International Maritime Organization will soon announce its plans to regulate oceanic geoengineering projects .
I 've reported a lot on ocean fertilization lately , and this is welcome news .
Feeding plankton with iron or urea could be a valuable tool for ridding the atmosphere of greenhouse gases , but there 's potential for abuse : if engineers do n't count the carbon benefits correctly , they could unwittingly release more CO2 than they save .
With large - scale projects having potentially regional , if not global , consequences , it'd be nice if * someone * could make sure they make sense scientifically .
Enter the International Maritime Organization , the high - seas overseers who drafted the London Convention in 1972 .
Until now , the Convention has regulated only ocean pollution .
Dumps of , for example , tons of plankton - feeding iron do n't comee under its purview .
Some have suggested that the Convention 's purview be expanded .
Earlier this summer , the Convention 's own scientific advisors said much the same thing , and expressed concern that ocean fertilization projects could go global before they were adequately understood .
A few minutes ago , Jim Thomas from the ETC Group told me that a London Convention meeting currently being held in
( surprise ) London was about to conclude with a formal declaration of increased ocean fertilization regulation .
As Thomas explained it , the regulation is a little confusing – not through any fault of his , but because maritime law is pretty confusing to begin with .
But the bottom line is this :
From now on , London Convention rules and regulations – those presently existing , and those drafted in the future – will apply to geoengineering projects that occur on the high seas , or in any way involve its 31 signatory countries .
Even if a project happens in non-territorial waters , if it involves one of the 31 countries – a company or research partner is based there , the ship flies under that flag , the materials come from there – then the project needs to be vetted by relevant national bodies .
The national bodies can also defer their regulatory process to that suggested by the Convention .
The only way to conduct an ocean geoengineering project without oversight is to place it in waters belonging to a country that did n't sign the Convention , and make sure that everything and everyone involved traces its origins to a non-signatory country .
So cowboy engineering is still possible , but it 's a lot more difficult – and , more importantly , it just looks
bad .
" Hey , Mr. Big Institutional Investor , take a look at these tests we conducted off the Ivory Coast , and give us a call at our offices in
Mongolia . "
If you 're a geoengineering company , you 're going to want official seals of approval – and to get those , you 'll have to be responsible .
Some people will say this is another unwelcome layer of bureaucracy , added just when climate change threats are urgent and time is running short .
But the Convention 's scientists are n't knee - jerk critics of anything commercial .
They just want to make sure that geoengineering really works .
Companies like Planktos have already agreed , voluntarily , to these sorts of rules .
The Convention also said that it plans to start seriously studying ocean fertilization – and that research should generate valuable knowledge .
When the water settles , critics and climate engineers will both be better off .

Morgan is a 10 - year - old fifth - grader in Roxbury , New Jersey .
She ’s fair - skinned , petite , with freckles across her nose and wavy , light - brown hair .
Her father is a police sergeant on duty until 3 a.m .
Her mother , Heather , works part time , devoting herself to shuffling Morgan and her brother to their many activities .
Morgan plays soccer , but her first love is competitive swimming , with year - round workouts that have broadened her shoulders .
She ’s also a violinist in the school orchestra , with practices and lessons each week .
Every night , Morgan sits down to homework before watching Flip This House or another show with her mother .
Morgan has always appeared to be an enthusiastic , well - balanced child .
But once Morgan spent a year in the classroom of a demanding teacher , she could no longer unwind at night .
Despite a reasonable bedtime of 9:30 p.m. , she would lay awake in frustration until 11:30 , sometimes midnight , clutching her leopard - fur pillow .
On her fairy - dust purple bedroom walls were taped index cards , each with a vocabulary word Morgan was having trouble with .
Unable to sleep , she turned back to her studies , determined not to let her grades suffer .
Instead , she saw herself fall apart emotionally .
During the day , she was noticeably crabby and prone to crying easily .
Occasionally , Morgan nearly fell asleep in class .
Concerned about her daughter ’s well - being , Heather asked the family ’s pediatrician about Morgan ’s sleep .
“ He kind of blew me off and did n’t seem interested in it , ” she recalls .
“ He said , ‘ So she gets tired once in a while .
She ’ll outgrow it . ’ ”
The pediatrician ’s opinion is typical .
According to surveys by the National Sleep Foundation , 90 percent of American parents think their child is getting enough sleep .
The kids themselves say otherwise .
In those same surveys , 60 percent of high schoolers report extreme daytime sleepiness .
In another study , a quarter admit their grades have dropped because of it .
Over 25 percent fall asleep in class at least once a week .
The raw numbers more than back them up .
Half of all adolescents get less than seven hours of sleep on weeknights .
By the time they are seniors in high school , according to studies by the University of Kentucky , they average only slightly more than 6.5 hours of sleep a night .
Only 5 percent of high - school seniors average eight hours .
Sure , we remember being tired when we went to school .
But not like today ’s kids .
It has been documented in a handful of major studies that children , from elementary school through high school , get about an hour less sleep each night than they did 30 years ago .
While parents obsess over babies ’ sleep , this concern falls off the priority list after preschool .
Even kindergartners get 30 minutes less a night than they used to .
There are many causes for this lost hour of sleep .
Overscheduling of activities , burdensome homework , lax bedtimes , televisions and cell phones in the bedroom all contribute .
So does guilt ; home from work after dark , parents want time with their children and are reluctant to play the hard - ass who orders them to bed .
All these reasons converge on one simple twist of convenient ignorance : Until now , we could overlook the lost hour because we never really knew its true cost to children .
Using newly developed technological and statistical tools , sleep scientists have recently been able to isolate and measure the impact of this single lost hour .
Because children ’s brains are a work - in - progress until the age of 21 , and because much of that work is done while a child is asleep , this lost hour appears to have an exponential impact on children that it simply does n’t have on adults .
The surprise is how much sleep affects academic performance and emotional stability , as well as phenomena that we assumed to be entirely unrelated , such as the international obesity epidemic and the rise of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder .
A few scientists theorize that sleep problems during formative years can cause permanent changes in a child ’s brain structure : damage that one ca n’t sleep off like a hangover .
It ’s even possible that many of the hallmark characteristics of being a tweener and teen — moodiness , depression , and even binge eating — are actually symptoms of chronic sleep deprivation .

Dr. Avi Sadeh of Tel Aviv University is one of the authorities in the field .
A couple of years ago , Sadeh sent 77 fourth - graders and sixth - graders home with randomly drawn instructions to either go to bed earlier or stay up later for three nights .
Each child was given an actigraph ( a wristwatchlike device that ’s equivalent to a seismograph for sleep activity ) , which enabled Sadeh ’s team to learn that the first group managed to get 30 minutes more sleep per night .
The latter got 31 minutes less sleep .
After the third night ’s sleep , a researcher went to the school in the morning to test the children ’s neurobiological functioning .
The test they used is highly predictive of both achievement - test scores and how teachers will rate a child ’s ability to maintain attention in class .
Sadeh knew that his experiment was a big risk .
“ The last situation I wanted to be in was reporting to my grantors , ‘ Well , I deprived the subjects of only an hour , and there was no measurable effect at all , sorry — but can I have some more money for my other experiments ? ’ ” he says .
Sadeh need n’t have worried .
The effect was indeed measurable — and sizable .
The performance gap caused by an hour ’s difference in sleep was bigger than the normal gap between a fourth - grader and a sixth - grader .
Which is another way of saying that a slightly sleepy sixth - grader will perform in class like a mere fourth - grader .
“ A loss of one hour of sleep is equivalent to [ the loss of ] two years of cognitive maturation and development , ” Sadeh explains .
Sadeh ’s findings are consistent with other researchers ’ work , all of which points to the large academic consequences of small sleep differences .
Dr. Monique LeBourgeois of Brown University studies how sleep affects pre-kindergartners .
Virtually all young children are allowed to stay up late on Fridays and Saturdays .
Yet she ’s discovered that the sleep - shift factor alone is correlated with performance on a standardized school - readiness test .
Every hour of weekend shift costs students seven points on the test .
Dr. Paul Suratt of the University of Virginia studied the impact of sleep problems on vocabulary - test scores of elementary - school students .
He also found a seven - point reduction in scores .
Seven points , Suratt notes , is significant : “ Sleep disorders can impair children ’s I.Q. ’s as much as lead exposure . ”
Every study done shows a similar connection between sleep and school grades — from a study of second - and third - graders in Chappaqua to a study of eighth - graders in Chicago .
The correlations really spike in high school , because that ’s when there ’s a steep drop - off in kids ’ sleep .
Dr. Kyla Wahlstrom of the University of Minnesota surveyed more than 7,000 high schoolers in Minnesota about their sleep habits and grades .
Teens who received A ’s averaged about fifteen more minutes sleep than the B students , who in turn averaged eleven more minutes than the C’s , and the C’s had ten more minutes than the D’s .
Wahlstrom ’s data was an almost perfect replication of results from an earlier study of more than 3,000 Rhode Island high schoolers by Brown ’s Mary Carskadon .
Certainly , these are averages , but the consistency of the two studies stands out .
Every fifteen minutes counts .
With the benefit of functional MRI scans , researchers are now starting to understand exactly how sleep loss impairs a child ’s brain .
Tired children can’t remember what they just learned , for instance , because neurons lose their plasticity , becoming incapable of forming the synaptic connections necessary to encode a memory .
A different mechanism causes children to be inattentive in class .
Sleep loss debilitates our body ’s ability to extract glucose from the bloodstream .
Without this stream of basic energy , one part of the brain suffers more than the rest : the prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for what ’s called “ executive function . ”
Among these executive functions are the orchestration of thoughts to fulfill a goal , the prediction of outcomes , and perceiving consequences of actions .
So tired people have difficulty with impulse control , and their abstract goals like studying take a back seat to more entertaining diversions .
A tired brain perseverates — it gets stuck on a wrong answer and can’t come up with a more creative solution , repeatedly returning to the same answer it already knows is erroneous .
Convinced by the mountain of studies , a handful of school districts around the nation are starting school later in the morning .
The best known of these is in Edina , Minnesota , an affluent suburb of Minneapolis , where the high school start time was changed from 7:25 a.m. to 8:30 .
The results were startling .
In the year preceding the time change , math and verbal SAT scores for the top 10 percent of Edina ’s students averaged 1288 .
A year later , the top 10 percent averaged 1500 , an increase that could n’t be attributed to any other variable .
“ Truly flabbergasting , ” said Brian O’Reilly , the College Board ’s executive director for SAT Program Relations , on hearing the results .
Another trailblazing school district is Lexington , Kentucky ’s , which also moved its start time an hour later .
After the time change , teenage car accidents in Lexington were down 16 percent .
The rest of the state showed a 9 percent rise .

Although the evidence is telling , few districts have followed this lead .
Conversely , 85 percent of America ’s public high schools start before 8:15 a.m .
Thirty - five percent start at or before 7:30 a.m .
In New York City , each school principal sets his own school schedule , and a randomized sample of 50 of the city ’s 500 public high schools revealed that 30 percent begin by or before 7:30 .
At Midwood , class starts at seven on the dot ; Van Buren lets you slide in at 7:05 .
Obstacles to later start times are numerous .
Having high schools start earlier often allows buses to first deliver the older students , then do a second run with the younger children .
This could mean doubling the size of the bus fleet .
Teachers prefer driving to school before other commuters clog the roads .
Coaches worry their student athletes will miss games because they ’re still in class at kickoff time .
Dr. Mark Mahowald , a University of Minnesota professor who runs a sleep clinic , has been at the center of many school start - time debates , and he dismisses those claims .
“ Of all the arguments I ’ve heard over school start - times , not one person has argued that children learn more at 7:15 a.m. than at 8:30 . ”
Parents and educators might remain skeptical about the importance of the lost hour , but the sleep - research community considers the evidence irrefutable .
Their convictions hardened as scientists began to understand sleep ’s vital role in synthesizing and storing memories .
Dr. Matthew Walker of UC Berkeley explains that during sleep , the brain shifts what it learned that day to more efficient storage regions of the brain .
Each stage of sleep plays a unique role in capturing memories .
For example , studying a foreign language requires learning vocabulary , auditory memory of new sounds , and motor skills to correctly enunciate new words .
The vocabulary is synthesized by the hippocampus early in the night during “ slow - wave sleep , ” a deep slumber without dreams .
The motor skills of enunciation are processed during Stage 2 non-rem sleep , and the auditory memories are encoded across all stages .
Memories that are emotionally laden get processed during R.E.M. sleep .
The more you learned during the day , the more you need to sleep that night .
To consolidate these memories , certain genes appear to up - regulate during sleep ; they literally turn on , or get activated .
One of these genes is essential for synaptic plasticity , the strengthening of neural connections .
The brain does synthesize some memories during the day , but they ’re enhanced and concretized during the night :
New inferences and associations are drawn , leading to insights the next day .
Perhaps most fascinating , the emotional context of a memory affects where it gets processed .
Negative stimuli get processed by the amygdala ; positive or neutral memories get processed by the hippocampus .
Sleep deprivation hits the hippocampus harder than the amygdala .
The result is that sleep - deprived people fail to recall pleasant memories yet recall gloomy memories just fine .
In one experiment by Walker , sleep - deprived college students tried to memorize a list of words .
They could remember 81 percent of the words with a negative connotation , like cancer .
But they could remember only 41 percent of the words with a positive or neutral connotation , like sunshine or basket .
“ We have an incendiary situation today , ” Walker remarks , “ where the intensity of learning that kids are going through is so much greater , yet the amount of sleep they get to process that learning is so much less .
If these linear trends continue , the rubber band will soon snap . ”
While the neurocognitive sleep discoveries are impressive , there ’s equally groundbreaking research on how sleep affects metabolism .
Five years ago , already aware of an association between sleep apnea and diabetes , Dr. Eve Van Cauter at the University of Chicago discovered a “ neuroendocrine cascade ” that links sleep to obesity .
Sleep loss increases the hormone ghrelin , which signals hunger , and decreases its metabolic opposite , leptin , which suppresses appetite .
Sleep loss also elevates the stress hormone cortisol .
Cortisol is lipogenic , meaning it stimulates your body to make fat .
Human growth hormone is also disrupted .
Normally secreted as a big pulse at the beginning of sleep , growth hormone is essential for the breakdown of fat .
It ’s drilled into us that we need to be more active to lose weight .
So it spins the mind to hear that a key to staying thin is to spend more time doing the most sedentary inactivity humanly possible .
Yet this is exactly what some scientists seem to be finding .
In light of Van Cauter ’s discoveries , sleep scientists have performed a flurry of analyses on children .
All the studies point in the same direction :
On average , children who sleep less are fatter than children who sleep more .
This is n’t just in the U.S. ; scholars around the world are considering it , as they watch sleep data fall and obesity rates rise in their own countries .
Three foreign studies showed strikingly similar results .
One analyzed Japanese elementary students , one Canadian kindergarten boys , and one young boys in Australia .
They all showed that kids who get less than eight hours of sleep have about a 300 percent higher rate of obesity than those who get a full ten hours of sleep .
Within that two - hour window , it was a “ dose - response ” relationship , according to the Japanese scholars .
In Houston public schools , according to a University of Texas at Houston study , adolescents ’ odds of obesity went up 80 percent for each hour of lost sleep .
Sleep ’s role in obesity is a comparatively new theory , and one difficult to prove in a controlled experiment .
But the traditional approach to solving childhood obesity is an abject failure .
The federal government spends over a billion dollars a year on nutrition - education programs in our schools .
A recent analysis by McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario , found that of 57 such programs , 53 had no effect whatsoever , and the four remaining programs ’ results were meager at best .
For a long time , there ’s been one culprit to blame for these failed efforts : television .
Rather than running around the neighborhood like when we were young , today ’s kids sit in front of the boob tube an average of 3.3 hours a day .
The connection to obesity seemed so obvious that few people thought it needed to be supported scientifically .
Last year , Dr. Elizabeth Vandewater at the University of Texas at Austin got fed up with hearing scholars blame it all on television .
“ It ’s treated as gospel without any evidence , ” she says .
“ It ’s just bad science . ”
Vandewater analyzed the best large data set available , the Panel Study of Income Dynamics , which has extensively surveyed 8,000 families since 1968 .
She found that obese kids watch no more television than kids who are n’t obese .
All the thin kids watch massive amounts of television , too .
There was no statistical correlation between obesity and media use , period .
“ It ’s just not the smoking gun we assumed it to be . ”
Vandewater examined the children ’s time diaries , and she realized why the earlier research had got it wrong .
“ Children trade functionally equivalent things .
If the television ’s off , they do n’t go play soccer , ” she says .
“ They do some other sedentary behavior . ”
In fact , while obesity has spiked exponentially since the seventies , kids watch only seven minutes more TV a day .
Although they do average a half - hour of video games and Internet surfing on top of television viewing , the leap in obesity began in 1980 , well before home video games and the invention of the Web browser .
This does n’t mean it ’s healthy to watch television .
But it does mean that something other than television is making kids heavier .
“ We ’ve just done diet and exercise studies for a hundred years and they do n’t work well , and it ’s time to look for different causes , ” says Dr. Richard Atkinson , co-editor - in - chief of the International Journal of Obesity .
Despite how persuasive all this science is , somehow it still seems like a huge leap of faith to consider giving back an hour of our children ’s lives to slumber .
Statistical correlations are fine evidence for scientists , but as parents , we want more — we want control .
Dr. Judith Owens runs a sleep clinic in Providence , Rhode Island , affiliated with Brown .
Recently , a father came in with his 15 - year - old daughter , who was complaining of severe headaches .
Interviewing the patient , Owens quickly learned that her daily routine was a brutal grind ; after violin lessons , bassoon lessons , dance classes , and the homework from honors classes , she was able to get only five hours of sleep a night before waking every morning at 4:30 to hustle off to the gym .
The father wanted to know if a lack of sleep could be causing her headaches .
Owens told him that was probably the case .
She recommended his daughter cut back on her schedule .
The word probably made this father hesitant .
He would let her cut back , but only if Owens could prove , in advance , that sacrificing an activity would stop the headaches .
Sure , he knew that sleep was important , but was it more important than honors French ?
Was it more important than getting into a great college ?
Owens tried her standard argument .
“ Would you let your daughter ride in a car without a seat belt ?
You have to think of sleep the same way . ”
But in the father ’s mind , he saw the transaction the other way around : Cutting back was putting his daughter at risk .
What if the headaches did n’t stop and she gave up one of her great passions , like dance , for no reason ?
Long before children become overscheduled high schoolers gunning for college , parents start making trade - offs between their kids ’ sleep and their other needs .
This is especially true in the last hour of a child ’s day , a time zone let ’s call “ the Slush Hour . ”
The Slush Hour is both a rush to sleep and a slush fund of potential time , sort of a petty - cash drawer from which we withdraw ten - minute increments .
During the Slush Hour , children should be in bed , but there are so many competing priorities .
As a result , sleep is treated much like the national debt —
What ’s another half - hour on the bill ?
We ’re surviving ; kids can , too .
Sleep is a biological imperative for every species on Earth .
But humans alone try to resist its pull .
Instead , we see sleep not as a physical need but a statement of character .
It ’s considered a sign of weakness to admit fatigue , and it ’s a sign of strength to refuse to succumb to slumber .
Sleep is for wusses .
But perhaps we are blind to the toll it is taking on us .
The University of Pennsylvania ’s David Dinges did an experiment shortening adults ’ sleep to six hours a night .
After two weeks , they reported they were doing okay .
Yet on a battery of tests , they proved to be just as impaired as someone who has stayed awake for 24 hours straight .
Dinges did the experiment to demonstrate how sleep loss is cumulative , and how easily our judgment can be fooled by sleep deprivation .
Nevertheless , it ’s easy to read his research and think , “ I would suffer , but not that bad .
I would be the exception . ”
We ’ve coped on too - little sleep for years and managed to get by .
But when it comes to a child ’s developing brain , is just getting by enough ?

According to police , the two Hungarians and a Ukrainian had just under half a kilogram ( about a pound ) of uranium in powder form that investigators believe came from an unspecified ex-Soviet republic .
" It was possible to use it in various ways for terrorist attacks , " a senior police official , Michal Kopcik , said .
He said police had intelligence suggesting that the suspects - whose names were not released , but were aged 40 , 49 and 51 - originally had planned to sell the material early this week .
One of the Hungarians had been living in Ukraine .
Police moved in when the sale did not occur as expected , he said .
Kopcik said investigators were still working to determine who ultimately was trying to buy the uranium , which the trio allegedly was selling for $ 1 m ( £ 485,000 ) .
Three other suspects - including a Slovak national identified only as Eugen K - were detained in the neighbouring Czech Republic in mid-October for allegedly trying to sell fake radioactive materials .
It was unclear to what degree , if any , they played a role in the thwarted uranium sale .
Police said a total of 481.4g of uranium had been stored in unspecified containers .
Investigators concluded that the material consisted of 98.6 % uranium - 235 .
Uranium is considered weapons - grade if it contains at least 85 % uranium - 235 .
" According to initial findings , the material originated in the former Soviet republics , " Kopcik said .
Western officials have long harboured concerns over the risk of nuclear smuggling from the former Soviet Union , although US - funded safeguarding programmes have reduced the danger of nuclear trading .
Slovakia 's border with Ukraine is the EU 's easternmost frontier , and authorities have spent millions tightening security in the past few years , amid fears of nuclear smuggling into the EU .
In 2003 , police in the Czech Republic , which borders Slovakia , arrested two Slovaks in a sting operation in the city of Brno after they allegedly sold undercover officers natural depleted uranium for $ 715,000 .
Slovak and Hungarian police worked together on the new case for several months , said Martin Korch , a Slovak police spokesman .
He would not say how long the suspects were under surveillance , or give details about the arrests and to whom they were trying to sell the material .
The Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN nuclear watchdog , said that last year alone there were 252 reported cases of radioactive materials that were stolen , missing , smuggled or in the possession of unauthorised individuals - a 385 % increase since 2002 .
But the IAEA cautioned that the jump was due at least in part to better reporting and improved law enforcement efforts .
Of the 252 cases , about 85 involved thefts or losses , and not all the material was suitable for use in a weapon .
The US - based Nuclear Threat Initiative , an organisation dedicated to reducing the global threat from nuclear weapons , reported last year that Russia remains the principal country of concern for contraband nuclear material , given the decline in security at nuclear - related industries after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
In 2006 , Georgian agents working with CIA officials set up a sting that led to the arrest of a Russian citizen who tried to sell a small amount of weapons - grade uranium that he had in a plastic bag in his jacket pocket .
In 1997 , seven men who officials said planned to smuggle 5kg of enriched uranium to Pakistan or China were arrested in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk .
That uranium reportedly had been stolen from a plant in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan .
Roughly 25kg of highly enriched uranium or plutonium is needed in most instances to make a crude nuclear device .
But a tiny fraction of that is enough for a dirty bomb - a weapon designed to sow fear and chaos , rather than inflict human casualties .
( CNN ) --
The chief operating officer of the National Children 's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet , authorities said .
Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12 - year - old girl and her 33 - year - old mother , according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York .
In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department .
Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer 's computer at the museum , according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement .
The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are " horrified " by news of Singer 's arrest .
They reported that he has been suspended from his post , effective immediately , and is barred from the property .
Singer , 49 , was arrested at his home in Falls Church , Virginia , by federal agents , according to the prosecutors ' statement .
Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging " chats " and e-mail communications with the undercover detective , posing as the woman and her daughter , from August to September .
He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce .
If convicted on each count , he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count , prosecutors said .
Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective , posing as the mother , in an America On Line chat room called " Cuties . "
The chat room attracts people who " are known to trade in pornographic images , including child pornography , " according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
" On five separate occasions in August 2007 , Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter , including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation , " prosecutors said .
In his communications with the supposed daughter , Singer pretended to be a 15 - year - old boy , authorities said .
In August 2007 , he sent her two images featuring child pornography , according to the affidavit , with the instruction , " just delete it when you are done . "
A search of Singer 's AOL account activity showed that from July to September , he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective , authorities said in the statement .
Also , the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography .
Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday .
He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children 's Museum , but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months .
He has been employed by the museum for four years , she said .
In a written statement , the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer 's arrest .
" We are horrified by the charges , " the statement said .
" This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children 's Museum family . "
" As its essence , the National Children 's Museum is about enriching the lives of children , " the statement said .
" We are educators , child advocates and parents .
Anyone who does anything that might endanger the welfare of a child has no place here .
Harming children is against everything we stand for as an organization and as individuals . "
The museum , formerly known as the Capital Children 's Museum , has been closed to the public since 2004 , and operates from administrative offices , the statement said .
A new facility is being built and is scheduled to open in 2012 .

Do you ever have an idea , then somebody else has the same idea , but they screw it up ?
Well , I just had that happen to me .
I stumbled on this article on Fast Infoset today .
Fast Infoset is a specification for a binary version of XML .
I had this same idea a couple of years ago , and the execution is amazingly similar , but , of course , they screwed it up .
Essentially , everybody is finally realizing that while XML is the first widely accepted data markup format , it 's a pig .
It 's verbose and redundant , which makes it store poorly , transmit slowly , and parse , well , like a pig .
Do n't get me wrong , the original idea for XML was actually fine , but everybody has taken it way over the top and things like SOAP are just an abomination .
Well , one way to help XML while still retaining XML semantics is to make a binary version of it .
While a compression program like gzip can reduce the overall transfer and storage size of an XML document , an XML parser still has to deal with the XML textual format on either end of a transfer .
The textual format forces the decoder to examine each and every byte to determine its significance in the document , even when a decoder does n't understand vast expanses of the XML schema that is being parsed .
And that textual XML format actually expands binary data carried in an XML document by forcing it into BASE64 format which does a 3 - goes - to - 4 encoding .
So , my idea , and that of Fast Infoset , is to notice that most XML documents are extremely redundant with tag and attribute information .
First , you have all those < and > symbols surrounding every tag .
That 's four bytes of redundant info for every opening and closing tag pair .
Then you have the tag name itself , which gets repeated at least twice , once in the opening tag and once in the closing tag .
Then , you have the fact that many XML documents are recursive tree structures where nodes at any given level of the hierarchy share a lot of the same type of info .
For instance , an XML document storing a list of books would use TITLE , AUTHOR , and ISBN tags for each book .
Add in namespace prefixes and attributes and you have a lot of redundancy , even before you start talking about SOAP .
In short , the information density of your average XML document has Claude Shannon spinning in his grave .
Luckily , it 's pretty easy to compress this information right out of an XML document .
You simply create a tag / attribute hash table and assign each unique tag or attribute in the document a unique number .
Rather than writing TITLE everywhere , you would instead use the number 0 ; 1 for AUTHOR ; 2 for ISBN ; and so on .
So , rather than " < AUTHOR > " ( 8 bytes ) , we would simply have 0x0001 or something ( 2 - 4 bytes ) .
By eliminating the end tag and encoding the content inside the AUTHOR tag with a 4 - byte length , we have a net savings of 8 + 9 - 2 - 4 = 11 bytes every time we would otherwise use an AUTHOR tag .
Do the same thing for all the other tags in your document and it adds up pretty quickly .
Finally , by encoding binary data as binary octets , rather than BASE64 , we eliminate the " ASCII tax " imposed by a textual format on binary data .
The interesting thing is that we still fundamentally have an XML document .
This means that you can run this new format through a SAX - like or DOM - like decoder and produce exactly the same data that an XML - based application expects , and the application is none - the - wiser .
Everything is just smaller and faster .
Because the binary format parser does n't have to actually look at the characters that make up all these tags and try to match them with other strings , it can whip through a document at light speed .
So , that was my theory .
I even had a catchy name for it , BCX : Binary Coded XML .
Along comes Fast Infoset .
Great minds think alike .
Obviously , the need is there .
Only they screwed it up .
Rather than just keeping things simple , they decided to encode the whole thing in ASN.1 with packed encoding rules ( ASN.1/ PER ) .
Now , for those of you who do n't know , ASN.1 is about the most complex , worst , ugly data format ever designed .
And it 's no wonder , it was created by an international committee ( ISO ) as part of the Open Systems Interconnect protocols ( OSI ; anybody remember FTAM ? ) .
The various encoding rules used to actually serialize ASN.1 ( and there are several , which is part of the problem ) typically do a lot of bit - twiddling , which slows down encoder / decoders .
It also makes them buggy .
Anybody remember some of the recent buffer overruns attributed to ASN.1 endecs ?
Well , it looks like Fast Infoset is being standardized in ISO ( in fact , jointly with ISO / IEC JTC 1 and ITU - T , which is about as ugly as it gets in the international standards committee world ) , so they probably had to use ASN.1 or people would wonder why they were n't supporting their own standards .
ASN.1 is used by a couple of protocols in common use today , including SNMP , X.509 , and LDAP .
That said , most IETF - originated protocols ( you know , the ones that move all your web , ftp , email , etc. , traffic around ) use either straightforward text encodings , or far more simple binary encodings .
Fast Infoset does manage to get pretty good compression ( 20 % - 80 % reduction , depending on document size and content ) .
Throughput for some documents is 2 - 3 times what standard XML delivers .
Overall , these are good numbers .
But , it could have been even faster .
Frankly , I 'm partial to Sun 's old XDR format , used by ONC - RPC and NFS , which was very fast , if not quite as tightly packed as some other formats .
I was also recently reading about Joe Armstrong 's Universal Binary Format ( UBF ) , created to give Erlang a streamlined wire protocol .
In short , marrying XML and ASN.1/ PER is like tying two stones together and hoping they will float .

Earth is truly an amazing and wonderful place inhabited by more places and creatures still undiscovered .
All across this great planet , new and stunning species and locations are found more and more frequently – giving us rare glimpses into habitats so extreme , few of us will ever get to experience them up close .
Many new marine animal species are found hundreds of feet below the sea every day .
New areas never before realized are stumbled upon all the time breaking records for depth , height , distance , and temperature .
Here are ten of some of the most extreme things our planet has to offer .
10 . Animal Surviving in the Hottest Extreme 470 Degrees C. – Shrimp
At a thermal vent 3 km below the surface in the equatorial Atlantic , Census researchers found shrimp on the edge of fluids billowing from Earth ’s core at this unprecedented marine recording .
This is a temperature that would melt lead easily .
Although the species resemble those around other vents , scientists want to study how , surrounded by near - freezing 2 º C water , their chemistry allows them to withstand heat bursts that approach the boiling point – up to 80 ºC .

9. Farthest Migratory Bird Shearwater – 70,000 km
Tracking tagged sooty shearwaters by satellite , scientists mapped the small bird ’s 70,000 km search for food in a giant figure eight over the Pacific Ocean , from New Zealand via Polynesia to feeding grounds in Japan , Alaska and California and then back !
Making the longest - ever electronically - recorded migration in only 200 days , the bird averaged a surprising 350 km daily .
In some cases , a breeding pair made the entire journey together .
8. The Lowest Point on Dry Land
420 meters ( 1,378 ft. ) below sea level
The Dead Sea is a salt lake between the West Bank and Israel to the west , and Jordan to the east .
Its shores are the lowest point on Earth that are on dry land .
At 330 m deep ( 1,083 feet ) , the Dead Sea is the deepest hypersaline ( saltiest ) lake in the world .
It is also the world ’s second saltiest ‘ body of water ’ , after Lake Asal in Djibouti .
7. Deepest Earth Depression - 2,555 meters ( 8,325 feet )
The lowest point on earth is located in the icy basin of the Bentley Subglacial Trench .
This is not considered dry land but below sea level as it is the world ’s lowest elevation not under seawater .
It is not accessible because it is buried under the thickest ice yet discovered .
6 . The Most Desolate Place on Earth 120 M. below sea level / 145 °F ( 50° C )
The Danakil depression is an area along the Great Rift where the earth ’s crust has stretched and thinned and the land has sunk over time to 371 feet below sea level , one of the lowest points on earth ’s surface .
Here the earth ’s crust is thin enough that new land surface is constantly being created by new lava that oozes upward .
Water also seeps down , to be ejected again as steam .
volcanic cones are common sights , as are deep cracks in the earth .
Hundreds of small earthquakes convulse the area every year .
5. Greatest Vertical Drop 1,250 meters ( 4,100 feet )
Mount Thor is a mountain in Auyuittuq National Park , on Baffin Island , Nunavut , Canada .
The mountain features the Earth ’s greatest purely vertical drop at an angle of 105 degrees .
The location is popular with climbers due to this feature , despite its remoteness .
It is also mentioned in the Led Zeppelin song : No Quarter .
4. Tallest Tree Nest Marbled Murrelet / 150 feet
The Marbled Murrelet is a small seabird from the North Pacific .
Its habit of nesting in trees was not known until a tree - climber found a chick in 1974 about 135 feet up .
The Marbled Murrelet , together with the closely related Long - billed Murrelet and Kittlitz ’s Murrelet have been recently considered endangered .
Their decline and association with forests have made them a flagship species in the forest preservation movement .
3. Highest Rainfall Total in One Minute 3.9 cm. / 1.5 in
Guadeloupe is an archipelago located in the eastern Caribbean Sea at 16°15? N , 61°35? W , with a land area of 1,628 square kilometres ( 629 sq. mi ) .
It is an overseas department of France .
And on November , 26 , 1970 it received the record for the most rainfall in one minute .
2. Earth ’s Most Venomous Animal Taipan Snake
Taipans are the largest , fastest , most venomous snakes on earth ; thoroughbreds of the snake world .
Taipan snake venom contains potent presynaptic neurotoxins ( toxins in venom that cause paralysis or muscle weakness ) .
Also : postsynaptic neurotoxins , which are less potent but more rapid acting than the presynaptic neurotoxins .
This snake ’s venom also contains potent procoagulants ( toxins in venom that interfere with blood clotting , causing consumption of the clotting protein , fibrinogen ; this causes defibrination , with non-clottable blood , putting victims at risk of major bleeding ) .
Taipan snake procoagulants are amongst the most powerful snake venom procoagulants known .

1. Antarctica Coldest , Windiest , Highest Elevated Continent , Largest Desert Over All
Let us talk about world records : Antarctica is the land of extremes .
It is the coldest , windiest and highest elevated continent anywhere on earth .
With an average elevation about 7,544 ft /2,300 meters above sea level it is the highest continent .
Even though it is covered in ice it receives nearly the least amount of rainfall , getting just slightly more than the Sahara Desert , making it the largest desert on earth .
Most people have the misconception that a desert is a hot , dry , sandy , lifeless place , but the true definition of a desert is any geographical location that receives almost no rainfall .
The Navy Times reports in a long article dated Aug 19 that a maritime buff , Dan Twohig , found bird ’s eye view imagery on Microsoft Virtual Earth showing the uncloaked propeller of a US Ohio class submarine in a dry dock .
Dan posted about it to his website in early July , and also linked to the view :
These propellers designs are ( were ? ) supposed to be a secret , and thus kept covered when out of the water .
Navy
Times interviews several people on the topic , and most sound fatalistic , except for a certain Norman Friedman .
“ a highly regarded authority and author on naval and military topics . ”
He blames everyone but the Navy for the mistake , if it is a mistake , and feels we should censor such imagery pre-emptively , just in case the Navy makes another mistake , or else the terrorists have already won :
“ To make it easy for someone to get into a base like that is obscene .
And that is something that can kill people .
In huge numbers , ” Friedman said .
“ Right now there are people out there in places like Waziristan who want us dead .
They do n’t have satellites , but they have wonderful fantasies .
Why the hell make it easier for them ? ”
Because , you know , terrorists could really use a quieter submarine propeller .
Elsewhere , he wonders “ if the Navy has the temerity to go after Microsoft . ”
Curiously , the Navy Times does n’t reproduce the image of the propeller in the article , despite its self - described news value , nor does it link to Dan ’s article , as netiquette would require .
Is n’t that a bit the case of closing the barn door after the horse has bolted ?
And it took my just five minutes of Googling to find the original source , based on information in the article .
Meanwhile , the Russians , Chinese and everyone else with a satellite likely has that same image by now , and at a much higher resolution .
But is this propeller even such a secret ?
I ’d like to offer an alternate reading , based on the assumption that such “ mistakes ” are too big to be made accidentally .
Just as the Chinese probably put their new Jin-class submarine on show for the rest of the world to see , to ensure everyone knows that it exists and can act as a deterrent ( China ’s military has obviously studied Dr. Strangelove ) , that particular propeller on the Ohio class submarine could be a ruse , out of date , or a signal to the rest of the world that the Ohio class is indeed dead silent , and thus a very capable deterrent .
That would be another reason why US intelligence is so sanguine on the matter .
( In fact , a new comment on Dan ’s original post suggests that such propellers are out of date , replaced by ducted pump jet propulsion on all the latest US , French and US models . )
One more thing : I was disappointed by Microsoft ’s meek comment when asked about censorship by the Navy Times :
Asked about their policy on publishing such imagery , Microsoft officials offered a statement claiming that the company is willing to blur such imagery if asked .
That ’s a lot more pliant that Google ’s own robust defence of such imagery .
( CNN ) --
It was only after a crowd of screaming students ran past Darnell Rodgers in a stairway at his Cleveland , Ohio , high school Wednesday afternoon that he realized he had been shot .
" They were screaming , ' Oh my God ! Oh my God , ' " said Rodgers , a senior at SuccessTech Academy near downtown Cleveland .
Rodgers suddenly felt his arm " burning , " he said , and realized he had been shot in the elbow .
Police have started to piece together what happened .
At around 1:15 p.m. ET , 14 - year - old gunman Asa Coon , who was a student at the school , walked the halls firing a gun in each hand , Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said .
When it was all over , five people had been shot , but the only fatality was Coon , who police said killed himself in a classroom .
Police found a . 22 - caliber revolver and .38 - caliber revolver near Coon 's body , along with a box of ammunition and three knives , said McGrath .
Investigators have reason to believe some victims were specifically targeted by Coon , who had been suspended from school Monday .
Watch what happened at the school -- and the warning signs »
" We do not believe this was a random shooting , " McGrath said .
" It may have been the teachers he went to the school looking for .
... I believe they disciplined him in some manner . "
Rodgers was treated and released from the hospital , but others were more seriously injured .
Coon shot 57 - year - old teacher David Kachadourian in the back and shot a 42 - year - old teacher in the chest , officials said .
Edward Eckart , commissioner of EMS Cleveland , said the 42 - year - old underwent surgery at MetroHealth Medical Center and was in stable condition at 8 p.m. Wednesday .
Fifty - seven - year - old Kachadourian was in stable condition , he said .
In addition , a 15 - year - old male with a gunshot wound to his side and a 15 - year - old female with a knee injury were transported to Rainbow Babies and Children 's Hospital , where they were in stable condition Wednesday night , Eckart said .
McGrath said Coon and another student were suspended Monday after they apparently got in a fight outside the school .
Coon had a previous arrest last year for a domestic violence incident , and police had been to his home before for incidents that involved weapons , according to McGrath .
Police searched the gunman 's locker after the shooting and are watching surveillance footage of the school taken at the time of the shooting , he said .
Students said they took cover in closets after the school principal announced a " Code Blue " on the intercom .
Students described the gunman as being " odd . "
Rodgers spoke to reporters after leaving the hospital Wednesday evening .
He called the shooting " very shocking " and said he was " sad " it could happen at a school he thought was safe .

" I never thought it would personally happen at my school . "
District schools will be closed Thursday .
Recreation centers will be open and counselors will be available for city residents .
Friday was already going to be a professional day for faculty and will now be devoted to figuring out how to go about resuming classes on Monday .
Cleveland Municipal School District CEO
Eugene Sanders said the community and everyone with ties to SuccessTech needs " to take a breather and relax a moment and put this in perspective . "
SuccessTech is a nontraditional high school , according to local school officials .
" Since it is a specialty school , " it does n't have " the typical population of a large high school , " said Lisa Matthews of the superintendent 's office .
It is a " school of choice " -- students have to apply to get in , said Ruthie Williams , also of the superintendent 's office .
She said classrooms are on the first and third floors of the four - story building and the rest contains the school district 's administrative offices .
The academy describes itself on its Web site as a " small , nontraditional high school that provides a learning environment in which all student believe in their ability to succeed . "
It adds that the curriculum is " problem - based " and " infused " with technology .
The school was founded in part with a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
No metal detectors were at the school on Wednesday , although the school board has portable detectors that are randomly moved from school to school , McGrath said .
An armed security guard was at the front desk , he added .
