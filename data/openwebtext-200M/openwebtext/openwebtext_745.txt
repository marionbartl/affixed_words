BAGHDAD – The journalist who threw his shoes at U.S. President George W. Bush was handed over to the Iraqi judiciary , an Iraqi official said Tuesday , a move that signals the start of criminal proceedings .
There were conflicting reports about the physical condition of Muntadhar al - Zeidi , who gained folk hero status when he hurled both his shoes at Bush during a news conference Sunday in Baghdad .
His employer , Al - Baghdadia television , reported that al - Zeidi had been " seriously injured " – presumably beaten by guards – and called on the government to allow lawyers and the Iraqi Red Crescent to visit him .
Later , one of his brothers said on Al - Baghdadia that he had spoken by telephone with al - Zeidi and that he told him " thank God , I am in good health . ''
" I felt from his voice that he is good health , " brother Maitham al - Zeidi said .
In Washington , deputy State Department spokesperson Robert Wood said : " Obviously , we condemn any kind of unnecessary force used against the reporter .
I do n't know that that happened but certainly if that did take place , we would condemn that . "
After the Sunday incident , al - Zeidi was initially held by the prime minister 's guards and later turned over to the Iraqi army 's Baghdad command .
The command , in turn , handed him over to the judiciary , the Iraqi official said on condition of anonymity because he was n't supposed to release the information .
The official would not elaborate , but referring the case to the judiciary usually signals the beginning of a lengthy process that could end in a criminal trial .
Cases referred to the judiciary are given to a judge who reviews the evidence and recommends whether to hold a trial or release the defendant .
Another panel then sets a trial date and appoints judges to hear the case .
The process can take months .
Earlier , Interior Ministry spokesperson Maj. Gen. Abdul - Karim Khalaf said al - Zeidi could face charges of insulting a foreign leader and the Iraqi prime minister , who was standing next to Bush when the shoes were thrown .
The offence carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail .
Many Iraqis , however , believe al - Zeidi was a hero for insulting an American president widely blamed for the chaos that has engulfed their country since the U.S. - led invasion of 2003 .
In Mosul , Iraq 's third - largest city , located north of Baghdad , an estimated 1,000 protesters carried banners and chanted slogans demanding al - Zeidi's release .
A couple of hundred more also protested Tuesday in Nasiriyah , a Shiite city southeast of Baghdad , and Fallujah , a Sunni area west of the capital .
In Baghdad , Noureddin al - Hiyali , a lawmaker of the main Sunni bloc in parliament , defended al - Zeidi's actions and said he believed the reporter was likely motivated by the invasion of Iraq , the " dismantling of the Iraqi government , destroying the infrastructure " – all events he blamed on the Bush administration .
" International law approves peoples ' right to resist occupation using all means , and Mr. Muntadhar al - Zeidi endeavoured to resist occupation in his own manner , " al - Hiyali said .
He urged the government to take that into consideration when deciding what to do with al - Zeidi .
The head of the Iraqi Union of Journalists described al - Zeidi's action as " strange and unprofessional " but urged Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki to give him clemency .
" Even if he has committed a mistake , the government and the judiciary are broad - minded and we hope they consider his release because he has a family and he is still young , " Mouyyad al - Lami told AP Television News .
" We hope this case ends before going to court . ''
The head of Jordan 's Bar Association , Saleh Armouti , said Tuesday that scores of lawyers have been signing up to help defend al - Zeidi .
The association is dominated by hard line Muslims and leftists critical of the 2003 U.S. - led invasion .
Wood , the deputy State Department spokesperson , described the incident as " one individual 's views . ''
" There are plenty of Iraqis that you can find who support what President Bush has done , our efforts to try to bring about democracy , a full functioning democracy in the heart of the Middle East , in Iraq , " he said .

The perception of al - Zeidi as a hero reflects Arab animosity toward Bush for the invasion and dissatisfaction with the president 's handling of foreign policy matters in the Middle East .
That hostility has persisted even though violence has dropped by more than 80 per cent in Iraq since earlier this year when car bombings and gunfights throughout the country were rampant .
Nevertheless , Iraqi security forces and U.S. troops continue to be targeted by insurgents .
On Tuesday , three bombings in Baghdad and another in Diyala province killed four people and wounded at least 30 .
Two police and two civilians were killed by a roadside bomb near Baghdad 's Technical University and 13 other people were wounded , police said .
A car bomb near the city 's Babylon Hotel wounded three people , including a security guard .
The bomb went off as a convoy from the ministry of science went by , but the minister was not in the vehicles , police said .
Three police and three civilians were wounded by a roadside bomb directed at a police patrol near central Baghdad 's Andalus Square , police said .
Another roadside bomb against a police patrol near Saadiya in Diyala wounded five police and three other people , Diyala security officials said .
Also in Saadiya , a security official said three gunmen killed the imam of a local Sunni mosque on Monday evening .
The U.S. military said in a written statement that troops killed three suspected insurgents and detained three others in separate operations targeting Al Qaeda networks in northern Iraq .
Also Tuesday , the U.S. military announced it had transferred the last 10 female detainees in its custody in Iraq to the authorities the day before .
A U.S. statement said the women have either been convicted of a security - related offence or are due to stand trial in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq .
The U.S. still holds about 15,500 detainees , down dramatically from the high of about 26,000 in November 2007 .
The U.S. - Iraqi security agreement that goes into effect next month requires the U.S. to hand over detainees wanted by the Iraqis and release the rest .

Rensselaer Researchers Nano - Engineer Solar to ' Near Perfect ' Efficiency
November 15th , 2008 by Susan Kraemer
Nano - engineering students at Rensselaer have created a solar power game - changer : more than 96 % absorption of sunlight from all angles , from sunrise to sunset .
The two biggest efficiency hurdles for solar efficiency have been :
1. Solar cells absorb only part of the light spectrum .
2 . The sun always moves in relation to the panel .
To solve problem number one , researchers nano - invented an anti-reflective coating to make the solar cell capture the full light spectrum .
Currently , solar cells reflect almost 1/3 of the sunlight that hits them .
That reflected light is not harvested , which has reduced solar cell efficiency .
Problem one solved .
To solve problem two , they stopped the sun in its tracks .
Well , no , actually , that would be a roundabout way to solve that problem .
Instead , they designed a nano - coating to ‘ follow ’ the sun ’s movements and absorb every last photon of light , regardless of the suns moving position in the sky .
The problem :
Most surfaces and coatings absorb or transmit light through them from only a specific range of angles .
Your glasses , for instance , absorb - transmit all the light in front of you .
But much less from the periphery .
That ’s why some solar panels are mechanized to slowly move so they always face the moving sun .
But that uses energy , too .
So the energy it takes reduces the efficiency of the panel .
‘ At the beginning of the project , we asked ‘ would it be possible to create a single anti-reflective structure that can work from all angles ? ’ said Shawn - Yu Lin , professor of physics at Rensselaer and a member of the university ’s Future Chips Constellation who led the research project .
‘ Then we attacked the problem from a fundamental perspective , tested and fine - tuned our theory , and created a working device , ’ Lin said .
Rensselaer physics grad student Mei-Ling Kuo played a key role in the investigations .
How their solution works :
Unlike typical antireflective coatings that are engineered to transmit light of only one particular wavelength , this coating stacks seven of these layers , one on top of the other , in such a way that each layer enhances the anti-reflective properties of the layer below it .
These additional layers also help to ‘ bend ’ the flow of sunlight to an angle that augments the coating ’s anti-reflective properties .
This means that each layer transmits sunlight and also helps to capture any light that may have otherwise been reflected off of the layers below it .
The seven layers , each with a height of 50 nanometers to 100 nanometers , are made up of silicon dioxide and titanium dioxide nanorods positioned at an oblique angle .
Each layer looks like ( and functions like ) a dense forest where sunlight is ‘ captured ’ between the trees .
The nanorods were attached to a silicon substrate via chemical vapor disposition .
The silicon surface absorbed 96.21 percent of sunlight , after treating the material with the reflective coating .
Only 3.79 percent of the sunlight was reflected and unharvested .
The entire spectrum of sunlight from UV to visible light to infrared was absorbed , for the first time .
‘ To get maximum efficiency when converting solar power into electricity , you want a solar panel that can absorb nearly every single photon of light , regardless of the sun ’s position in the sky , ’ said Lin .
‘ Our new antireflective coating makes this possible . ’
The bottom line :
This is a game changer .
This nano - engineered coating could be applied to nearly any photovoltaic material for use in solar cells , says Lin .
These two huge gains move solar power forward to being cost - effective for mass production .

ARE Americans practicing Communism ?
Read the 10 Planks of The Communist Manifesto to discover the truth and learn how to know your enemy ...
Karl Marx describes in his communist manifesto , the ten steps necessary to destroy a free enterprise system and replace it with a system of omnipotent government power , so as to effect a communist socialist state .
Those ten steps are known as the Ten Planks of The Communist Manifesto
The following brief presents the original ten planks within the Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx in 1848 , along with the American adopted counterpart for each of the planks .
From comparison it 's clear MOST Americans have by myths , fraud and deception under the color of law by their own politicians in both the Republican and Democratic and parties , been transformed into Communists .
Another thing to remember , Karl Marx in creating the Communist Manifesto designed these planks AS A TEST to determine whether a society has become communist or not .
If they are all in effect and in force , then the people ARE practicing communists .
Communism , by any other name is still communism , and is VERY VERY destructive to the individual and to the society !!
The 10 PLANKS stated in the Communist Manifesto and some of their American counterparts are ...
1. Abolition of private property and the application of all rents of land to public purposes .
Americans do these with actions such as the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ( 1868 ) , and various zoning , school & property taxes .
Also the Bureau of Land Management ( Zoning laws are the first step to government property ownership )
2 . A heavy progressive or graduated income tax .
Americans know this as misapplication of the 16th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution , 1913 , The Social Security Act of 1936 . ; Joint House Resolution 192 of 1933 ; and various State " income " taxes .
We call it " paying your fair share " .
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance .
Americans call it Federal & State estate Tax ( 1916 ) ; or reformed Probate Laws , and limited inheritance via arbitrary inheritance tax statutes .
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels .
Americans call it government seizures , tax liens , Public " law " 99-570 ( 1986 ) ; Executive order 11490 , sections 1205 , 2002 which gives private land to the Department of Urban Development ; the imprisonment of " terrorists " and those who speak out or write against the " government " ( 1997 Crime / Terrorist Bill ) ; or the IRS confiscation of property without due process .
Asset forfeiture laws are used by DEA , IRS , ATF etc ... ) .
5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the state , by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly .
Americans call it the Federal Reserve which is a privately - owned credit / debt system allowed by the Federal Reserve act of 1913 .
All local banks are members of the Fed system , and are regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) another privately - owned corporation .
The Federal Reserve Banks issue Fiat Paper Money and practice economically destructive fractional reserve banking .
6. Centralization of the means of communications and transportation in the hands of the State .
Americans call it the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) and Department of Transportation ( DOT ) mandated through the ICC act of 1887 , the Commissions Act of 1934 , The Interstate Commerce Commission established in 1938 , The Federal Aviation Administration , Federal Communications Commission , and Executive orders 11490 , 10999 , as well as State mandated driver 's licenses and Department of Transportation regulations .
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state , the bringing into cultivation of waste lands , and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan .
Americans call it corporate capacity , The Desert Entry Act and The Department of Agriculture Thus read " controlled or subsidized " rather than " owned "
This is easily seen in these as well as the Department of Commerce and Labor , Department of Interior , the Environmental Protection Agency , Bureau of Land Management , Bureau of Reclamation , Bureau of Mines , National Park Service , and the IRS control of business through corporate regulations .
8. Equal liability of all to labor .
Establishment of industrial armies , especially for agriculture .
Americans call it Minimum Wage and slave labor like dealing with our Most Favored Nation trade partner ; i.e. Communist China .
We see it in practice via the Social Security Administration and The Department of Labor .
The National debt and inflation caused by the communal bank has caused the need for a two " income " family .
Woman in the workplace since the 1920's , the 19th amendment of the U.S. Constitution , the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , assorted Socialist Unions , affirmative action , the Federal Public Works Program and of course Executive order 11000 .
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries , gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country , by a more equitable distribution of population over the country .
Americans call it the Planning Reorganization act of 1949 , zoning ( Title 17 1910 - 1990 ) and Super Corporate Farms , as well as Executive orders 11647 , 11731 ( ten regions ) and Public " law " 89 - 136 .
These provide for forced relocations and forced sterilization programs , like in China .
10 .
Free education for all children in public schools .
Abolition of children 's factory labor in its present form .
Combination of education with industrial production .
Americans are being taxed to support what we call ' public ' schools , but are actually " government force - tax - funded schools " Even private schools are government regulated .
The purpose is to train the young to work for the communal debt system .
We also call it the Department of Education , the NEA and Outcome Based " Education " .
These are used so that all children can be indoctrinated and inculcated with the government propaganda , like " majority rules " , and " pay your fair share " .
WHERE are the words " fair share " in the Constitution , Bill of Rights or the Internal Revenue Code ( Title 26 ) ??
NO WHERE is " fair share " even suggested !!
The philosophical concept of " fair share " comes from the Communist maxim , " From each according to their ability , to each according to their need !
This concept is pure socialism .
... America was made the greatest society by its private initiative WORK ETHIC ...
Teaching ourselves and others how to " fish " to be self sufficient and produce plenty of EXTRA commodities to if so desired could be shared with others who might be " needy " ...
Americans have always voluntarily been the MOST generous and charitable society on the planet .
Do changing words , change the end result ? ...
By using different words , is it all of a sudden OK to ignore or violate the provisions or intent of the Constitution of the united States of America ?????
The people ( politicians ) who believe in the SOCIALISTIC and COMMUNISTIC concepts , especially those who pass more and more laws implementing these slavery ideas , are traitors to their oath of office and to the Constitution of the united States of America ...
KNOW YOUR ENEMY ... Remove the enemy from within and from among us .
VOTE LIBERTARIAN , the only political party in America that still firmly supports and diligently abides by the Constitution of the united States of America .
None are more hopelessly enslaved , as those who falsely believe they are free ....

There are 1.02 b undernourished people in the world
Hunger has increased in 2009 because of high food prices and rising unemployment in the global recession
Enlarge TBS SAG honoree : James Earl Jones is still more comfortable on stage than on film , and he still sees his part in Star Wars as just a sound effect .
The unmistakable voice on the phone sounds congenial enough .
Even more so after James Earl Jones is congratulated on being this year 's recipient of the Screen Actors Guild 's highest honor .
He 'll be presented with a lifetime achievement award on the broadcast Sunday night at 8 ET / PT on TNT and TBS .
Jones , 78 , reflects on over a half - century in showbiz with USA TODAY .
Q : Have you written a speech yet ?
Jones :
Just a thank - you to tell them how I like their work .
When I surf the cable shows and see a certain movie , I often think , " I 'm glad I had a chance to catch that . "
The work moves me .
Q : You have said in the past that you feel most at home on a stage , rather than in movies or on TV .
Is that still true ?
Jones : Absolutely .
I consider myself a novice film actor .
I still have a lot to learn .
On stage , that is how my training started .
That is where I felt most fulfilled so far .
I still want to do more film .
I did n't know how to take it , frankly , when Alan ( Rosenberg , the president of SAG ) called me and told me about the award .
I just laughed .
After my wife said something , I called him back and I told him I was n't dismissing it .
I just did n't know why , except that I am 78 years old .
And that is no reason to receive it .
Q : Your only Oscar nomination was for repeating your stage role of the boxer based on real - life fighter Jack Johnson in the film version of The Great White Hope .
What did that mean to you ?
Jones : I knew George C. Scott would win that year for Patton .
His film was more fulfilled .
Our file was truncated from what we achieved onstage .
They did away with a lot of the poetic elements .
It was too large a life form to work on .
Martin Ritt was a wonderful director , but he was better with smaller - scope social stories , like Norma Rae .
But I am glad we got what we did on tape .
Q : As the voice of Mufasa , Simba 's caring father in the 1994 animated feature The Lion King , your death had almost as much impact as the shooting of Bambi 's mother some 50 years earlier .
Jones : I saw the screening with children in the audience .
When Mufasa died and Simba said , " Wake up , Dad , " you could see children looking around and saying , " Where 's Poppa ? "
They were looking for their own dads .
Q : The role you are most famous for , however , is the sinister voice of Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy .
Initially , you did n't even ask for screen credit because you felt you contributed only a sound effect .
Why ?
Jones : I still feel that way .
I did n't take credit until the episode where they showed his demise .
Not only did I refuse credit , I told everyone it was n't me .
I would say it sounds like the Un - cola guy , Geoffrey Holder .
It was more fun to do it that way .
Q : And you were just as surprised as the rest of us when you read the line , " Luke , I am your father " ?
Jones : I thought he was such a bad guy that he was lying and manipulating the boy .
Q : Have you ever attended a Star Wars convention ?
Jones : I am happy to be a part of the whole cult movement .
But they are scary .
People are fanatics .
I went to a comic - book convention once .
George Lucas wrote me a statement to make as nasty as Dark Vader .
It was a salutation .
But at least I had something to do .
I do n't sign autographs .
Q : Like every actor , you have done some less - than - stellar films , such as being the villain Thulsa Doom in 1982's Conan the Barbarian with Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Jones : I thought that might be the last large film I would ever have the chance to be a part of .
It was wholesome mythology and fun to do .
In fact , my only purpose in the film was to set up the revenge theme by chopping off Conan 's mother 's head .
There were no point to the speeches .
Just a lot of words .
Q : Whose voice do you admire ?
Jones : John Gielgud and Richard Burton .
They are pleasant to listen to .
Very clear .
They also have the best connection between thought and sound .
Q : You were one of the first black actors to play a president on film , in 1972's The Man .
What do you think about our new president ?
Jones :
There 's nothing to it .
It is as it should be .
I do n't even want to say how exciting it is .
It is as it should be , given who he is , his mind and sensibilities .
Not given that he is a black man .
One of his big jobs is dealing with racial issues , especially poverty .
Q : Have you caught up with the movies in contention for awards this season ?
Jones : I 've seen them all .
Benjamin Button , I really liked that .
The director put together a wonderful jigsaw puzzle .
I like both of Kate Winslet 's movies , especially The Reader .
But I had a problem with The Dark Knight .
It was a jumble until the issues of morality showed up at the end .
I 'm not criticizing it .
You just have to get past that style .
Q : What is the biggest change you have seen in your profession since you began ?
Jones :
One thing I noticed is the use of the voice .
There is a lot of whisper acting these days .
Paul Giamatti in John Adams whispered most of his dialogue .
Not to criticize him , but , one , I 'm hard of hearing .
And , two , voice is voice .
Not aspiration .
A whisper is a raspy sound .
A voice is a full sound .
Speech is a very important aspect of being human .
A whisper does n't cut it .

Last week the United States got lucky again and took out several suspected terrorists by Predator drone attacks over Pakistan .
Anti-war critics before Jan. 20 used to decry “ collateral damage ” from such controversial strikes .
But there was a weird silence here about the Obama administration ’s successful first attack — despite the usual complaints from abroad that several civilians perished .
President Barack Obama announced that he wanted to close Guantánamo right away — sort of .
But in the meantime he rightly worried over the immediate consequences .
Instead , in circumspect fashion , he appointed a “ task force ” to prepare for such closure within a year .
We forget that a less politically adept George Bush years ago conceded that he likewise wanted Guantánamo closed at some future date .
But the media then largely ridiculed such pedestrian worries over what to do with unlawful wartime combatants who would either have to be released or tried as criminals in U.S. courts .
Ethics issues
A saintly Obama upon entering the presidency announced to great fanfare that he would once and for all stop revolving - door lobbyists and end shady business as usual in Washington .
But during the transition and the first two weeks of governance , Obama ’s team has already experienced a number of ethical problems of the sort that often plague incoming administrations .
Obama ’s commerce secretary nominee , Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico , has been under federal investigation and withdrew from consideration .
Attorney General - designate Eric Holder , as Bill Clinton ’s deputy attorney general , helped pardon a fugitive on the FBI ’s most wanted list who was a big Clinton campaign donor .
Timothy Geithner , just confirmed as secretary of the Treasury , cannot adequately explain why he did n’t pay thousands of dollars in Social Security and Medicare taxes and took illegal tax deductions .
Obama ’s staff has already waived its new ethics rules for former Raytheon lobbyist William Lynn , who was nominated for deputy defense secretary .
Such embarrassments sometimes happen in politics — but to humans , not gods — and they often create media firestorms .
Throughout the campaign and after the inauguration , Obama also talked grandly of bipartisanship .
That he once had the most partisan record in the U.S. Senate , played tough Chicago - style politics to win elections and toed a strict liberal line in the Illinois legislature caused few in the media to wonder about such promises .
Yet despite aspiring to be an Olympian president , Obama just warned Republicans not to listen to earthy Rush Limbaugh .
In words more like those of George Bush than of Mahatma Gandhi , Obama privately rubbed it in with , “ I won . ”
Despite the near - evangelical sermons , Obama , like most savvy presidents , assumes bipartisanship is the art of persuading — and coercing — the opposition into following his polices .
George Bush likewise called for an end to acrimony while he pushed his agenda .
The only difference is that the media mocked the “ divider ” Bush ’s clumsy talk of bipartisanship but so far is still hypnotized by the “ uniter ” Obama .
Talk vs. action
Why is Obama ’s grand talk already at odds with his actions ?
For one reason , he is unduly empowered by a media that too often roots for him , rather than reports critically about his actions .
Second , in the last two years , Obama and his supporters advanced two general gospels that are coming back to haunt him :
First , that George W. Bush was a terrible president , and that his toxic policies had done irreparable damage to the United States .
Second , that Obama was an entirely novel candidate with fresh hope - and - change ideas that would bring a renaissance to the United States and the world .
Bush ’s Texas twang and occasionally tongue - tied expressions strengthened the first supposition .
Obama ’s youth , charm and multiracial background enhanced the second .
But we are seeing that simplistic polarity was infantile — even if the enthralled media desperately wanted to believe in the mythology .
In truth , Bush , after the left - wing hysteria over the 2003 invasion of Iraq , governed mostly as a traditional conservative rather than a reactionary extremist .
Meanwhile , newcomer candidate Obama predictably embraced old - style and well - known liberal orthodoxy .
The result is that President Obama is quickly discovering that many of those easy Bush - blew - it issues of the campaign really involved only bad and worse choices of governance .
Most solutions now call for realism instead of doctrinaire left - wing bromides and catchy speechmaking .
Obama should decide quickly whether to beam back down to Earth .
If he does n’t , at some point even a sympathetic media wo n’t be able to warn him that his all - too - human actions are beginning to make a mockery of his all - too - holy sermons .

US officials are working on a plan to help rid US banks of their bad debts in order to tackle the devastating global financial crisis .
After a meeting with Congress members late on Thursday , US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said new laws were needed to deal with the " root " of the problem .
It comes after a series of seismic shocks in the world 's financial system .
The news boosted European and Asian shares .
On Thursday , US shares added 3.9 % after the plan was leaked .
In London , an announcement by the UK's City watchdog the Financial Services Authority to temporarily ban short - selling in certain financial companies added to the dramatic change in sentiment .
Short - selling occurs when a trader borrows shares from another to sell them , then buy them back at a lower price thereby profiting from the difference .
Market moves
The UK's FTSE 100 index of largest shares added more than 6 % with banking stocks among the biggest gainers .
Halifax owner HBOS , which was forced into the arms of rival Lloyds TSB after a run on its shares this week , surged more than 30 % .
France 's Cac 40 and Germany 's Dax indexes joined in the rally , up 5.6 % and 3.7 % in morning trade .
Japan 's Nikkei jumped 3.8 % , while the Shanghai Composite recovered from 22 - month lows to close up 9.5 % and Hong Kong 's Hang Seng soared 7.3 % .

More from Today programme US stocks had surged on Thursday because of reports of the rescue plan , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 3.9 % up at 11,019.69 .
Crisis in confidence
The proposed US government rescue plan comes at the end of a week of almost unprecedented turmoil on world financial markets amid a crisis of confidence in banks : US Wall Street giants Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are the latest to have their shares punished by nervous investors amid concerns for their financial health
Central banks around the world have pumped billions of dollars of extra funding into money markets to ease the liquidity crisis
The UK's City watchdog announced a crackdown on short - selling - thought to be a big contributor to the share price falls in UK banks in recent days .
The US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission followed suit on Friday , banning short - selling in the stock of 799 financial companies until 2 October
Stock markets in Russia re-opened on Friday after wild swings in share prices forced trading in its main exchanges to be suspended and resumed several times in the week .
' Best of the US ' Mr Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are expected to spend the weekend hammering out a plan to free the banks of their mortgage - backed assets .
With property prices continuing to plummet and borrowers defaulting on their loans , these investments are seen by the Treasury Secretary as being at the heart of the global financial crisis .
There will be serious long - term damage to the ability of the US to export its way of doing business to the rest of the world .

BBC Business Editor

" We talked about a comprehensive approach that will require legislation to deal with illiquid assets on financial institutions ' balance sheets , " he said .
In an upbeat press conference , the congressional leaders and financial regulators were keen to stress they had agreed to work together for the good of the country .
" I think we saw the best of the United States of America in the Speaker 's office tonight , " Mr Paulson said .
" This country is able to come together and do things quickly when it needs to be done for the good of the American people . "
Mixed reaction Some analysts welcomed the news .
" It 's a relief , it allows for an orderly workout for the impaired assets and it will help the banking sector get back to business , " said Hans Kunnen of Colonial First State Fund Managers in Australia .
But BBC Business Editor Robert Peston said that the taxpayer funded bail - out " represents a massive humiliation for Wall Street " and will severely dent the ability of the US to export its way of doing business to the rest of the world .
But an even bigger risk could be a loss of confidence in the American government 's balance sheet , he said .
" This could ultimately undermine the dollar , push up inflation even more and raise the cost of servicing debt for the US authorities , " our correspondent explained .
Central bank action
There is speculation that one plan being discussed involves legislation that would force lenders to renegotiate mortgages that homeowners are having difficulty paying .
Markets have been jittery amid huge upheavals in the banking sector Another possibility is establishing a government agency that would take on the debt .
Reports said Mr Paulson was looking into setting up something akin to the Resolution Trust Corp ( RTC ) , which was formed after savings and loans banks collapsed in the 1980s .
The RTC took over most of the smaller banks in the US at a cost of $ 400 bn - about $ 1 trillion ( £ 550 bn ) in today 's money - and then tried to sell off their assets .
The cost of such a bailout would probably be higher this time , with bad mortgage debt believed to be around $ 2 trillion .
But Congressman Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said the plan would probably not involve creating a new government agency .
" There is this concern that if you had to wait to set up an entity , it could take too long . "
Six of the world 's top central banks took steps to calm worried stock markets on Thursday , releasing $ 180 bn to lift the amount of credit available .

Academics and writers in Turkey have risked a fierce official backlash by issuing a public apology for the alleged genocide suffered by Armenians at the hands of Ottoman forces during the first world war .
Breaking one of Turkish society 's biggest taboos , the apology comes in an open letter that invites Turks to sign an online petition supporting its sentiments .
It reads : " My conscience does not accept the insensitivity showed to and the denial of the Great Catastrophe that the Ottoman Armenians were subjected to in 1915 .
I reject this injustice and for my share , I empathise with the feelings and pain of my Armenian brothers .
I apologise to them . "
The contents expose its authors - three scholars , Ahmet Insel , Baskin Oran and Cengiz Aktar , and a journalist , Ali Bayramoglu - to the wrath of the Turkish state , which has prosecuted writers , including the Nobel prize - winning novelist Orhan Pamuk , for supporting Armenian genocide claims .
Turkey rejects the assertion of many historians and Armenia 's government that up to 1.5 million Armenians died in a wave of expulsions that amounted to state - sanctioned genocide .
Officials claim the death toll was much lower and that most of the victims died from disease .
They also say many Turks were killed by Armenians , who have long been accused of allying themselves with enemy Russian forces against the Ottoman empire .
The letter has triggered a furious response from ultranationalists , who have labelled it a " betrayal " and an " insult to the Turkish nation " .
However , Aktar , a professor of EU studies at Istanbul 's University of Bahcesehir , said Turks needed to apologise for being unable to discuss the issue because of official policy , which has long repressed open debate on the Armenians ' fate .
" Today many people in Turkey , with all good intentions , think that nothing happened to the Armenians , " he told the newspaper Vatan .
" The official history says that this incident happened through secondary , not very important , and even mutual massacres .
They push the idea that it was an ordinary incident explainable by the conditions of the first world war .
Unfortunately , the facts are very different . "
He added : " This is a voice coming from the individual 's conscience .
Those who want to apologise can apologise , and those who do not should not . "
The letter coincides with a tentative rapprochement between Turkey and Armenia .
In September , the Turkish president , Abdullah Gul , attended a football match between the two countries , at the invitation of his Armenian counterpart , Serge Sarkisian .
But further talks aimed at restoring ties have become bogged down partly because of Armenian reluctance to accept a Turkish demand for a joint commission to investigate the genocide claims .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Fewer foggy , misty and hazy days help explain why Europe ’s temperatures have risen so fast over the past 30 years , a finding that could help predict future climate change , researchers said on Sunday .

Clearer skies due to changing weather patterns and less air pollution have contributed on average to about 5 to 10 percent of the region ’s warmer temperatures during this period , said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh , a researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute .
“ The temperatures in Europe have been going up twice as fast as climate models had predicted in the past decades .
Less fog means more sunshine on the ground and hence higher temperatures , ” Van Oldenborgh , who worked on the study said in a telephone interview .
The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a group of hundreds of scientists , has predicted global temperature increases this century of 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius .
Governments and researchers across the world are exploring ways to try to slow rising temperatures that experts say will bring heat waves , droughts , more powerful storms , species extinctions and higher sea levels .
In Europe , however , temperatures have been outpacing climate models and Van Oldenborgh and colleagues wanted to find out why .
They collected data from 342 weather stations at airports across Europe and measured the levels of fog , mist and haze going back to 1976 .
The number of days with visibility less than 2 kilometers are half of what they were 30 years ago , falling to an average 10 days from 20 days , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Geoscience .
Changes in weather patterns and better air pollution policies play a role in the clearer skies but the researchers do not know how big an impact each contributes on its own , Van Oldenborgh said .
The warming trend due to less fog will ease , however , in the future because when it comes to air pollution governments can only make the skies so clean , he added .
“ Climate is not simple and this is a new factor , ” Van Oldenborgh said .
“ It does n’t explain everything but it explains a lot .
Two more ATMs were blown up in Sydney overnight , taking the tally of attacks to five nights in the past week .
The blasts were the latest in a string of gas attacks on ATMs in New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland and the ACT .
Police say they were called to one of the explosions about 2:00 am ( AEDT ) at a shopping centre at West Pennant Hills , in north - west Sydney .
The ATM at the Coonara Avenue centre remained mostly intact but the stairwell it was housed in was badly damaged .
About half an hour later , police say an ATM and several neighbouring shops were damaged in an explosion near a shopping centre in Evans Road at Telopea .
Debris from the blast was strewn across the road .
Police say cash was taken from the second ATM but not from the first .
They say witnesses have told them several men fled the scene at Telopea in a dark vehicle .
The New South Wales Government is offering a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to a conviction over the robberies , on top of $ 50,000 on offer from the Australian Banking Association .
Anyone with information about the blasts is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In a final push before the House votes on an economic stimulus package , President Obama said Wednesday that the country needs immediate action to solve rampant job loss .
Obama spoke after meeting with a dozen CEOs including Sam Palmisano of IBM and Dave Cote of Honeywell .
" The businesses that are shedding jobs to stay afloat ... and all those who live in fear that theirs will be the next job cut -- they need help now , " Obama said from the White House .
" They are looking to Washington for action -- bold and swift . "
" [ W ] hen it comes to rebuilding our economy , we do n't have a moment to spare , " he said .
Obama and House Democrats etched out plans for an $ 825 billion package in the weeks leading up to the president 's inauguration , and two House committees have amended and modified the provisions for $ 550 billion in spending and $ 275 billion in tax cuts over the last two weeks .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , on Wednesday quoted several times from the president 's inaugural address , saying the stimulus package will help to fulfill Obama 's promise of job creation and economic growth .
" Eight days ago , President Obama delivered his inaugural address , which I believe is a great blueprint for the future , " Pelosi said .
" With swift and bold action today , we are doing just that -- with this vote today , we are taking America in a new direction . "
The House is expected to vote on the bill , which is expected to pass , this evening .
But Republicans , who are outnumbered in the House , have expressed concern about the large amount of spending in the bill , and have criticized the tax cut provisions for not going far enough .
" This Democrat bill wo n't stimulate anything but more government and more debt , " said Rep. Mike Pence , R - Ind. , on Tuesday .
" House Democrats [ will ] use a time of national crisis to fund big government priorities under the guise of stimulating the economy . "
Obama has called for bipartisan cooperation on the bill , and met with House Republican leadership on Tuesday in an attempt to gain support across both aisles .
" I do n't expect 100 % agreement from my Republican colleagues , but I hope that we can put politics aside , " Obama said after the meeting .
" The main message I have is that the statistics every day underscore the urgency of the economic situation , " the president said .
" The American people expect action . "
As a result of the new president 's lobbying efforts , many analysts believe that Obama will get the support he wants for the bill , even if some Republican concerns are n't met .
" The president will get the bill passed the way he wants it , " said Tim Speiss , head of the Wealth Advisory Practice at Eisner LLP .
" He has been making the rounds to woo votes , and I do n't think [ House Minority Leader ] John Boehner , [ R - Ohio ] , is going to get anywhere . "
Next steps for stimulus
On Tuesday , key Senate committees took up the Senate 's separate but similar version of the bill .
Next week , the full Senate will vote on its version .
Should both the Senate and House pass different versions , the two bills would have to be conferenced together .
Then , both chambers would have to vote on the new , conferenced version in the coming weeks .
Speiss believes the final bill will closely mirror the House 's more expensive version , since several provisions that the Senate excluded will likely be put back in after a compromise .
For instance , the Senate may agree to the House 's $ 50 billion taxable bond and Cobra continuation provisions , if the House agrees to include the Senate 's $ 18 billion Social Security funding .
" You may see a horse trade , but [ the final bill is ] going to look more like the House plan , with only fringes of what the Senate modified , " Speiss said .
" But the centerpieces of both plans - especially the Making Work Pay tax credits - are almost identical anyhow . "
Congress has put the legislation on a fast track , as many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree that fast action is needed to help pull the economy out of a deep recession .
Democratic leaders have said they aim to get the bill to Obama 's desk for him to sign before Congress ' Presidents Day recess in mid-February .
Even opponents of many of the Democrats ' proposals have said that a compromise will likely be reached by the mid-February deadline .
" There 's unanimity that our economy needs help , " said House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , on Friday , " And there 's also a desire to move a package that would help rescue our economy , help American families , small businesses , entrepreneurs , and the self - employed . "

Mr. Steele accepted the selection after a prolonged standing ovation from members who were clearly tired after five hours of voting .
“ As a little boy growing up in this town , this is awesome , ” he said .
Mr. Steele also signaled that after an election in which there were signs that the party was shrinking  in terms of parts of the country and groups it was appealing to  he would make a concerted effort to get the party back on track and compete with Democrats .
His speech offered a sharp contrast of tone in a meeting that had been marked by expressions of concern by leaders of the party .
" It ’s time for something completely different and we ’re going to bring it to them , " Mr. Steele said .
" We ’re going to bring this party to every corner , to every boardroom , to every neighborhood , to every community .
And we ’re going to say to friend and foe alike , ‘ we want you to be a part of us , we want you to be with us and for those of you who are going to obstruct , get ready to be knocked over . ’ "
Mr. Steele was one of two African - Americans competing to be the party ’s leader .
The other was Ken Blackwell , the former Ohio secretary of state .
Mr. Blackwell quit the race after the fourth ballot , in which he drew just 15 votes .
He then endorsed Mr. Steele , which had ideological significance : Mr. Blackwell was among the most conservative candidates in the race , and there were recurring concerns among some conservatives about Mr. Steele ’s convictions .
The results also signaled a desire by the party to make a clear break with former President George W. Bush .
The incumbent chairman , Mike Duncan , who had been installed in the job by Mr. Bush , withdrew after the third ballot , in which he got just 41 votes , compared with 52 votes in the first ballot .

ようするに、配布にはほぼ制限がないが、verbatim(一字一句そのまま)のコピーや配布しか認めていないので、当然改変禁止ということになる。改変が禁止されたものは、言うまでもなくフリーソフトウェアではない。ちなみに翻訳はどうなるんだということだが、翻訳も改変の一種なので、実のところアウトである。だから、最近忙しくてサボり気味の私の諸々の日本語訳にしても、一応FSFの許可を得た上で公開している。
もう一つのタイプは 、GFDLがある特定の仕方で適用されている文書群だ。たとえばGCC
4.3.2のマニュアルの著作権表示は、以下のようなものである。

( 強調は筆者 )
長々と引用したが、ようするに問題は、文中で強調した「『GNU General Public License』という章と 『Funding Free Software』という章 はInvariant Sectionだ」と言っているところである。Invariant(不変)
Sectionはその名の通り改変禁止部分であって、改変や削除が認められていない。これまた改変の禁止なので、フリーソフトウェアではないということになる。Invariant Sectionは別に指定しなくても良い、GFDLが提供するオプショナルな機能という位置づけになっているので、GFDLが適用された文書がすべて自動的に非フリーになるということはないが、少なくともInvariant Sectionが指定されたものに関しては、フリーソフトウェアのカテゴリから外れるのは確かだ。
とはいえ、文書のどの部分でも好き にInvariant Sectionに出来るかというとさすがにそんなことはなく、簡単に言えば、本文の内容とあまり関係がない部分に限ってInvariantが主張できるということになっている。たとえばGCCのマニュアルにおいては、『GNU
General Public License』の章にはもちろんGNU
GPLが全文転載されているのだが、『Funding Free Software』の章には、料金を取ってフリーソフトウェアを配布する企業に対して、ユーザからフリーソフトウェアの開発に対して寄付をするよう促しなさい、というようなことが書いてある。GPLにしろ寄付が云々にしろ、コンパイラの使い方の説明というマニュアル本文の内容とは関係ないので、Invariant Sectionが指定できるというわけだ。
そんなわけで、FSFの文書の多くには改変禁止の部分が存在する。よってFSFの文書の多くはフリーソフトウェアではない。大変シンプルな話ですよね。
ただ、ここまで読んですでに何となく違和感のあった方もおられるだろう。それはおそらく、「文書がフリーソフトウェア」云々というのは何かおかしいのではないか、ということではないかと思う。実際その通りで、ここがFSFと、たとえばDebianの意見表明のような外部の見解が分かれるポイントなのだ。言い換えれば、ドキュメントとプログラムは、果たして同じカテゴリに属するものなのだろうか、あるいは、ドキュメントはプログラムの部分集合なのだろうか、という問いである。
少なくとも技術的には、ドキュメントとプログラムは同じものであって、何ら違いはない。結局のところ両者ともバイト列に過ぎないからである。だから、ドキュメントを特別扱いするということには、くれぐれも慎重を期さなければならない。さもなくば、非フリーなプログラムをフリーと呼ばせてしまうような抜け穴をこしらえることにもつながりかねないからだ。
そして、プログラムの配布は自由にしてよいが改変されたくはないというのは、まあそういう人もいるのだろうが、率直に言えば単なるエゴイズムか自信過剰である。あなたやわたしより優れたコードが書ける人は世の中にいくらも存在する(あるいは今後存在しうる)し、それを信じるということがフリーソフトウェア(オープンソース、でもよいが)という開発形態の根幹だからだ。よって、そうしたものがフリーソフトウェアではない、と言うことには、私は何ら躊躇しない。また、マニュアルのような実用的な文書に関しても、第三者による改変を認めないというのはおかしな話である。複数人で開発している場合は言うに及ばず、一人で開発している場合でも、しょせんいつかはソフトウェアが作者の手を離れる時が来る。その後もプログラムの開発が仮に続くとすれば、マニュアルの面倒を見るのもおそらく作者ではない、誰か他の人であるのは言うまでもない。
しかし、原理原則、主義主張、定義や思想信条の類まで誰にでも改変することを認めるかどうかということになると、これはやや話が怪しくなってくる。一時的に原著者にとって不本意な改変をされたとしても、誰かが元に戻してくれるだろうから別に認めても良いというWiki風の楽観的な考え方もあるだろうし、そもそも不本意だろうがなんだろうが変えられても文句は言えまいとする人すらいるかもしれない。しかし、ある種の意志表明というのは、その人の人格の外延であり、そこに関してどうしても変えられたくない、譲れないという一線があるということには、私としても共感できる部分が若干無くも無いのである。もちろんこの種の主張は、一歩間違えば「原曲のイメージが崩れるからアレンジは一切認めない」といった類と同じ愚にもつかない主張に容易に転化してしまうので、注意しなければならないのは言うまでもない。また、そういったものをマニュアル等の一部として含めることの是非も問われなければならないだろう。
ようするに、日本風に言えば著作権と著作者人格権、英語で言えばcopyrightにおけるeconomic rights とmoral rightsの相克がむき出しになるのがこの点なのだ。その意味では、そもそもプログラムを著作物の仲間に入れたのが根本的な間違いだったのだが、今更それを言っても仕方がない。なので、運用のレベルで何とかしなければならないのである。少し前までは、私はGFDLに関してFSFは言行不一致だ、何とかしなければならないと素朴に思っていたのだが、現在は少し迷っているというのが正直なところだ。「フリーな文書」とはどのようなものであるのか、まだまだ今後考えていかなければならないことが多いようである。
Let me repeat .
Your boyfriend does n’t care about what you ate today .
This is important .
He may listen to you summarize the details of your daily gastronomical adventures .
He may exclaim over your decision to go with arugula instead of baby spinach in your tossed salad .
But he does n’t care .
You should accept this and talk about something else .
Trust me .
This is not intended to be misogynistic – its entirely possible that guys do this , and if you ’re out there – you really need to stop too .
This is a simple courtesy …
I think the world would be a better place if everyone just accepted this basic rule :
If someone is giving you a run down on everything they ate today , you can tell them to shut up .
A few years ago , I was dating a girl who suffered from this affliction .
She was great otherwise , but in this small area , it was pretty bad .
Here ’s an example of the kind of conversation we ’d have :
“ This morning , before I got to work , I stopped at the Starbucks and got a Grande latte … but I only drank like half of it , and then I got a bagel and some cream cheese and ate a quarter of it and put it in my bag and saved it for later so I could eat it at my desk , cause sometimes I get hungry before lunch . ”
“ Then , when I got to my building , they had a bowl with some jolly ranchers , so I took a watermelon and ate it in the Elevator . ”
Expectant Pause
At this point I would feel obliged to make conversation , so I would say something like , “ Did you end up eating the bagel ? ”
At which point she would say , “ No , not yet , its still in my bag , I do n’t know if I ’m going to eat it – but I did have three lifesavers as a snack around ten oclock ”
Etc .
( inevitable asphyxiation as my brain attempts to crawl out my ear )
Etc .
I had to put a stop to it .
After the Jump : What Happened …
Now here ’s the odd thing – I finally broke down and told her that I had absolutely no interest in hearing about what she ate that day , and if she spent another minute telling me , I would probably poke my eye out .
You know what ?
She was n’t even offended … she was just surprised !
She had thought I cared , which is why she kept telling me !
When she found how I felt , we were free to talk about other stuff which was much more interesting to the both of us .
I have since found that this is very common .
All over the world you ’ll find guys who are incredibly bored by this topic , but who do n’t complain for fear of reprisal – and girls who talk about it because they figure the guy is interested since he keeps listening .
Eventually , the guy gets kind of annoyed and only half listens , and the girl gets annoyed and feels ignored .
Either that , or one person ’s head explodes .
This really happens .
So … if you do this ( girl or guy – I do n’t mean to be gender specific ) think about asking your partner whether they really want to know this kind of information .
If you have a significant other who does this – do n’t be afraid to politely tell her how much it annoys you .
Life is far too short , and there ’s far too many interesting things to talk about , to waste our time on crap no one wants to hear .

In the early days of the Internet , some scholars once predicted a lessening of racism and race - based discrimination in online interactions thanks to the anonymity and race - neutral nature of the medium .
But according to a new study published by a University of Illinois professor who studies race and the Internet , adolescents are increasingly experiencing both individual and vicarious discrimination online , which in turn triggers stress , depression and anxiety .
Brendesha Tynes , a professor of educational psychology and of African American studies at the U. of I. , believes that with teenagers increasingly tethered to the Internet ( 93 percent of whom have Internet access in some form , at last count ) , more consideration should to be given to race - related online victimization not only as an Internet safety issue , but also as a public health concern for parents .
" There 's been a lot of publicity about cyber - bullying and teenagers protecting themselves from online predators , and justifiably so , " Tynes said .
" But people do n't know much about online racial discrimination and its effects on adolescent emotional well - being . "
Tynes along with co-authors Michael T. Giang , David R. Williams and Geneene N. Thompson published their findings in an article titled " Online Racial Discrimination and Psychological Adjustment Among Adolescents " in the December 2008 issue of the Journal of Adolescent Health .
Tynes said that while there have been several studies that have explored online victimization and its effect on psychological functioning , there have n't been any studies on the effects of race - related online victimization .
" The whole goal of this study was to see if there were associations between race - related victimization and negative psychological adjustment , " she said .
" I wanted to make a distinction between online racial discrimination and offline racial discrimination .
Since people of color experience racial discrimination in both face - to - face settings and online , I wanted to find out whether online racial discrimination impacts adjustment over and above what 's experienced in offline settings .
We 've found evidence to suggest that it does . "
For the study , Tynes created a measure for race - related online victimization .
She discovered that 71 percent of African - American adolescents , along with 71 percent of white and 67 percent of multiracial / other adolescents , experienced vicarious racial discrimination online at least once .
Twenty - nine percent of African - American adolescents , and 20 percent of white and 42 percent of multiracial / other adolescents also reported experiencing individual discrimination directed at them while online , according to the published findings .
Tynes 's research indicated that , regardless of a victim 's racial background , increased exposure to online racial discrimination was significantly related to increased depression ; females were found to experience significantly more depression and anxiety than males .
Victimization occurred in the usual online mediums - instant messaging , discussion forums , online games and social networking sites - and in text messages received by the victim .
Tynes 's findings depart from previous research in the field , which had shown discrimination to disproportionately impact the emotional and physical health primarily of people of color .
The variance in her findings could be attributed to the sample or the measures used in her study , she said , since the discrimination gap between whites and blacks is profoundly different , both online and offline .
" More research is needed to determine the impact of those differences , " Tynes said .
Tynes said that another disturbing finding in her research was discovering online hate groups who actively try to recruit new members by creating child - friendly Web sites .
" There are white power groups who , for example , lure teens and kids by creating Web sites that are advertised as being for kids , " she said , citing the Stormfront " White Pride For Kids ' " ( sic ) Web site .
" That site differs from the main site in that it 's only tinged with negative language , not out - and - out racist language , " she said .
" It 's masked racism that uses a bait - and - switch to entice unsuspecting kids . "
While the Internet can be seen as an open marketplace of ideas , Tynes said it can also function as an echo chamber of false information , noting that some child - focused Web sites produced by hate groups are created as phony information clearinghouses about historical figures such as Martin Luther King and Barack Obama or historical events such as the Holocaust .
The Web sites encourage children to propagate historical canards in their research papers .
The published information found on such sites , however , is typically neither factual nor accurate , Tynes said .
As part of their recruiting efforts , hate - mongers will not only congregate in Web sites and discussion forums related to their own ethnic groups , but they will also lurk in forums created for a specific ethnic group of color and " troll " ( Internet lingo for deliberately posting a taunting , usually invective - laden message for the sole intention of causing chaos ) those message boards , Tynes said .
" I saw many examples of trolls going to sites devoted to a specific ethnic group of color and then posting a negative message filled with racial epithets solely to provoke and inflame members of that community , " she said .
Despite all the dangers that lurk online , Tynes still thinks it 's important for adolescents to spend time on the Internet .
" When you 're not participating in the sites that the kids at your school are participating in , " she said , " you can run the risk of feeling isolated from your peers .
In a lot of ways , the Internet is sort of an informal classroom for teens . "
" For all of its shortcomings , it 's a good bridge to help kids become more sophisticated in their understanding of race , " she said .
Tynes is not a proponent of strict parental monitoring or restricting teens from exploring the Internet .
" It would be impossible to monitor every Web site that 's out there , " she said .
" I am a proponent of more conversations about race , more study of people 's culture , and keeping an open line of communication with our teens about the fact that these things might happen .
That 's why we need more discussion , so that when teens experience race - related victimization online , it can serve as a buffer to help them to feel a sense of racial pride and a positive racial identity . "

For a while there , said Miriam Datskovsky in The Daily Beast , it looked like Scrubs was finished .
After treating the sitcom “ like a leper ” for seven years , NBC last year “ decided it had enough " and aired a midseason , fantasy - based episode billed as the series finale .
But “ thankfully , ” ABC president Steve McPherson resurrected Scrubs , and the first two episodes of its eighth and final season will premiere on that network Tuesday night .
A network change was what Scrubs needed , said Alan Sepinwall in The Star - Ledger .
Toward the end of the show ’s run on NBC , “ the ratio of comedy - to - tragedy tilted out of control . ”
But the first two ABC episodes “ more closely resemble the series in its marvelous early seasons , ” and suggest that star Zach Braff 's “ victory lap will be a memorable one . ”
Do n’t speak too soon , said Verne Gay in Newsday .
One of the episodes is funny .
But the other “ drags ” and is too “ touchy / feely . ”
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence “ has vowed that he wants to take the emo route more often ” this season — which could be a mistake .
How Can Red Hat Be Worth More Than Sun ?
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 21 , 2009
Matt Asay notes a milestone today : Red Hat is just about to surpass Sun Microsystems in market capitalization .
At the moment , Sun 's market capitalization is $ 2.69 billion and Red Hat 's is $ 2.61 .
If the trends in share prices for these two companies continue , Red Hat 's market cap will soar right past Sun's .
Does this make any sense ?
The valuations of many public companies in America make very little sense at the moment , and there is some nonsense in the valuations of both Sun and Red Hat .
Back in November , I questioned the valuations of both of these companies , based on the fact that they sold for approximately the amount of cash they both have .
Since that post , Red Hat 's share price has nearly doubled , while Sun 's has fallen .
The main difference between the performances of the shares came from Red Hat 's continuing success with its model of getting revenues from service and support for free software .
Red
Hat just turned in yet another sterling quarterly financial performance .
And so it goes in this bizarre economy .
Sun 's revenues are over $ 13 billion compared to $ 627 million for Red Hat .
Sun has far more IP , a more vast patent portfolio , more history , products positioned in good categories , and a solid open source strategy .
It does n't have good earnings , though , or positive buzz .
It 's cheap enough to be an easy acquisition target .
And so it goes ...
Communities secretary says politicians need to reconnect with this group , as study shows resentment over impact of migration
Many white working - class people across the country feel their concerns about the impact of immigration are being ignored , according to the communities and local government secretary , Hazel Blears .
Politicians need to start reconnecting with this group of people , Blears said today , as a study of attitudes to immigration was published finding a widespread sense of resentment , unfairness and disempowerment among white working - class communities in England .
" White working - class people living on estates sometimes just do n't feel anyone is listening or speaking up for them , " Blears said .
" Whilst they might not be experiencing the direct impact of migration , their fear of it is acute . "
It was the responsibility of politicians to challenge the myths about immigration spread by the far right , she said .
A report for the Department for Communities and Local Government based on interviews with people living on estates in Birmingham , Milton Keynes , Thetford , Runcorn and Widnes , found that some people believed that the same rules were not applied to everyone equally .
Anecdotal evidence suggested many believed refugees and single mothers were more easily able to find a council house than working - class white people whose families had lived in the area for generations .
People taking part in the focus groups said that when white people complained they were told that the system was fair and their concerns were racist .
Blears said that changes in communities could generate unease and uncertainty and needed explaining , otherwise the myths that currently surrounded the treatment of ethnic minorities " jumping the queue " would become harder to shift .
The report found that some members of the white working class felt " betrayed " and believed politicians had washed their hands of them .
A lack of " open and honest discussion " about the impact of immigration among politicians locally and nationally had created fertile ground for rumours spread by far - right groups about preferential treatment being given to ethnic minorities .
Blears warned that white people 's concerns about the effects of immigration should not simply be branded " racist " , as this would simply alienate them even more .
Citing a " growing sense of unfairness and disempowerment among poor white people " , the Communities and Local Government report found that hostility to immigrants was worst in the most deprived estates , as " people who have the least are more likely to be afraid of things being taken away from them " .
Few of those questioned had frequent contact with people from ethnic minorities and few of them understood the idea of integration , the report said .
Respondents found it difficult to speak openly about their concerns for fear of being branded racist or offending others .
Blears said : " People who care about their communities and have lived there for generations have every right to ask questions about what is happening in their estate , street , neighbourhood .
" We can not allow people to exploit situations but where there are legitimate concerns or questions they should be able to express them without fear of being branded a racist when all they really want are answers or information .
" The job of politicians and leaders is to listen and respond , to have the very debates that people in these estates are having or we risk losing touch with them altogether .
" What the report shows is that there are real complexities around the perceptions held by the white working class and government is keen to look more closely at what can be done to ensure that grievances and misunderstandings are addressed . "
A seminar is to be hosted by DCLG ministers in the coming weeks , bringing together government departments , councils and academics to look at how to " bridge the gap " between the authorities and the white working - class communities they serve .
In the past Blears has faced criticism for some of her remarks on immigration but the minister accused her political opponents of taking her comments out of context .
Speaking later on the BBC's World at One programme , Blears admitted that the national housing shortage was at the heart of the problem .
" People do want to see more housing in this country , " she said .
" That is a key problem that is causing a lot of the underlying tension with people .
" When people have very little they feel insecure then you get myths and rumours peddled by those on the far right and that is what we are trying to prevent . "
Blears repeatedly dodged suggestions that councils should be instructed to give priority housing to local people but said plans to build more than 1 million new homes should ease the problem .
Labour MP Frank Field , co-chairman of the cross-party group on balanced migration , called on the government to address white working - class worries about immigration .
He said : " Hazel Blears says that people on council estates feel ignored .
That is exactly our point .
And not only on council estates – 80 % of the public want to see a substantial reduction in immigration , but the government refuses to address the issue .
" No wonder people feel the government is riding roughshod over their wishes , and not only in the poorest areas , which are bearing the brunt of the present massive level of immigration .
Unless further action is taken soon , immigration will add nearly 10 million to the population of England in the next 20 years .
" If Labour wants to influence the outcome of the next general election , it had better start addressing white working - class concern about immigration , not simply reporting on it . "
Responding to Blears 's statement , Lady Warsi , the Tories ' spokeswoman on community cohesion , said : " What an indictment of New Labour that they have to have an investigation to show that over the last 10 years they have completely lost touch with their so - called roots .
" The danger for the rest of us is that this has now created a ticking time bomb of racial and class prejudice .
" Amongst other things this has also demonstrated the dangers of Labour 's past use of identity politics for electoral purposes .
I do hope they take the right lessons from this and not use it as an excuse to go down the line of a new ' white relations industry ' now to be built on yet another ' special needs identity ' .
" This should be a call to focus on the real core problems of worklessness , debt , welfare dependency , family breakdown and drug and alcohol abuse . "
Open wi-fi is a terrorist tool and has to be shut down , right this second .
That 's the conclusion , at least , of the Mumbai police .
Starting today , the * Times of India * reports , " several police teams , armed with laptops and internet - enabled mobile phones , will randomly visit homes to detect unprotected networks . "
" If a particular place 's wi- fi is not password - protected or secured then the policemen at the spot has the authority to issue notice to the owner of the wi-fi connection
directing him to secure the connection , " deputy commissioner of police Sanjay Mohite tells The Hindu .
Repeat wi-fi offenders may receive " notices under the
Criminal Procedure Code , " another senior officer warns the Times .
Mohite notes that e-mails taking credit for terror attacks in New Delhi and Ahmedabad were sent through open wireless networks .
" Unprotected IP addresses can be misused for cyber crimes , '' he says .
Other Indian cities now require cyber cafes to install surveillance cameras , and to collect identification from all customers .
But plugging up all those perceived security sieves in Mumbai is going to take some work .
A quick Sheriff 's Brigade survey on Sunday showed that 80 percent of wi-fi networks in South Mumbai were left unlocked .
And it 's not like terrorists are all that 802.11 - dependent , of course .
An e-mail also took credit for December 's massacre in Mumbai .
Whether that came from an open wi-fi connection or not is unclear – the mailer used an anonymizer service , to cover his electronic tracks .

2009 : Exactly the Opposite of What You ’ve Been Told
Most Americans have been told by the Bush administration and the talking heads that things will get worse for a couple of months , but then the economy will start to turn around and improve in the second half of 2009 after Bushco and Obamaco ’s bailout and stimulus programs kick in .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In fact , the smart money is saying that the exact opposite will happen .
Specifically , Marc Faber , Robert McHugh , Societe Generale , Mish and others are saying that the stock market is now in a bear market bounce , buoyed by the hope of the general population that Obama will turn things around .
But that at some point after the inauguration , people will realize that Obama ’s plan wo n’t stop the crisis , and that things are going to get worse .
At that point , they say , the market will really tank .
See this .
Mish and Societe Generale think the market could tank very soon – say a couple of days after the inauguration .
Faber and McHugh seem to think the crash will come in the spring .
But they all agree that the exact opposite of what the mainstream talking heads say will occur : things will seem temporarily better , and then the market will crash dramatically .

Every hardware generation in the past consisted of a runaway winner , with a few competitors limping behind .
Were it not for a failed deal to bring a CD drive to the dominant Super Nintendo , Sony might never have gotten into gaming with the PlayStation , and then the PlayStation 2 .
While the first PlayStation brought many innovations to the home gaming business , it was the PlayStation 2 that cemented the company 's place at the head of the pack , and today Sony has announced that the PS2 is the first system to sell over 50 million units in North America .
The importance of DVD , an eBay money maker , and a storm of criticisms
The launch of the PS2 was masterful .
The company had fended off the Dreamcast by promising better graphics , more third - party support , the ability to play your old PSone games , and of course the system was launching with a new whiz - bang technology that would help to justify the high entry price of the system : the DVD drive .
The PS2 was n't just a gaming console , you see , it was a media box .
DVD players were incredibly expensive at the time , so mixing the follow - up to the popular PlayStation system with the promise of a built - in DVD player proved an appetizing combination for consumers ; the system was impossible to find at retail after its October 2000 launch , and prices soared on gray market sites such as eBay .
Sony is upfront with the importance of this decision .
" The inclusion of DVD technology in the console enabled not only enhanced gaming experiences , but also offered DVD playback , bringing the DVD movie experience to millions of homes in North America for the first time , " Sony claims .
" The PS2 quickly became the best - selling DVD player on the market , helping to establish the DVD format as the de facto movie standard . "
The criticisms came quickly .
The system was too expensive .
The " PS9 " marketing message was nonsensical .
The graphics , after all the promises , did n't look much better than the system 's nearest competitor , the Sega Dreamcast .
Software support was lacking .
Sony was more interested in releasing a media player than a gaming console .
The proprietary chip , the Emotion Engine , was hard to code for .
Does any of this sound familiar ?
A new leader was born
Consumers did n't listen , and franchise after franchise helped to keep the PS2 firmly on top .
Think of what the PS2 did , culturally , to gaming .
The system shipped with the Dual Shock , one of the most iconic controllers ever created .
Gran Turismo 3 was one of the most graphically stunning and realistic racing games every created , on console or PC .
Grand Theft Auto 3 took the top - down 2D franchise and brought hyper- violent action along with stinging social satire to gaming .
The Madden series , updated yearly , became an event .
Jocks and the popular kids from school invaded the gaming stores , buying the titles in huge numbers .
Final Fantasy
X built on the success of the PSone Final Fantasy titles , adding even better - looking graphics .
Final Fantasy XI brought true MMO gaming to consoles , even if it required the net adaptor as well as an add - on hard drive .
The first time anyone played a Guitar Hero game was on the PlayStation 2 .
Vice City was less of a game release than a mainstream media event , with all the controversy that brought with it .
The God of War series brought an epic , and surprisingly dark , story to life .
Shadow of the Colossus felt like art , a moving painting .
There were more culturally important gaming moments on the PS2 than perhaps any other system in the past twenty years .
These are just the obvious hits ;
If I dug into the catalog to bring up fan - favorites like Ico , we'd be here all day .
Sony made gaming cool to the mainstream .
If you write about games , and people find this out , you get two questions asked of you in perpetuity : what is your favorite game , and which game console should I buy ?
Everyone is interested in the idea that there is some insight into what the " best " console is , and people tend to be surprised by my answer .
Go into a video game store with $ 200 and get yourself a PlayStation 2 and a huge stack of games .
It 's simply the best possible gaming value at the moment and , according to the Nielson ratings , the PS2 was the most - played console of last year .
What made the PlayStation 2 special may be hurting the limping PS3 .
Consumers may not have been ready for the inclusion of the expensive Blu-ray drive .
Asking developers to come up with their own online plan , leading to differences in features across games , is a hard sell in the days of Xbox Live .
The Cell is another piece of technology that some developers struggle with .
Software support , in the early days , was rough .
Sony quickly ditched backwards compatibility as being too expensive .
Microsoft is poaching once - PS2 specific franchises the same way Sony once did with Nintendo 's hits .
The Wii's success is bringing us back to a world where people " play Nintendo . "
With these milestones however , Sony still has the name and the will power to turn it around .
But looking back we can see just how much gaming owes to the PlayStation brand .
You did good , PS2 , and we still love you .
Thanks for the memories , and I 'm sure you 'll be a big hit again next Christmas .
At a time when every new touchscreen phone looks like yet another rehash of the iPhone , except with a clunkier operating system , the Palm Pre comes as a breath of fresh air .
The device is smart , sexy and interesting .
And its operating system is both visually enticing and appears to be technically sophisticated .
The Pre was clearly the hottest device at the Consumer Electronics
Show this year .
Still , there are important details such as pricing and launch date that have yet to be worked out .
And no one — including us — has yet gotten enough of a hands - on with the phone to be able to make any significant conclusions about its usability , speed , features or other important details .
Even so , there are a lot of reasons to get excited about it based on what we know so far .
Here are six :
1 . It fuses a touchscreen and keyboard in one attractive package .
The iPhone is an excellent touchscreen phone , no doubt .
But for heavy texters and e-mail addicts , the lack of a physical keyboard can be annoying ( even if you type less than the 13 - year old California girl who sent 484 text messages every day last month ) .
The HTC G1 combined a touchscreen and keyboard , but that phone 's poor finish and clunky design only served to establish the iPhone as a superior alternative for the design - conscious .
Now Palm may have actually pulled off a feat to make both touchscreen and the keyboard loyalists happy .
The Pre has a great finish and comes in an attractive black casing that should be enough to satisfy the pickiest .
2 . It improves on the iPhone .
Removable battery .
Copy and paste .
Better camera .
A touchscreen that extends beyond the display to about an inch below the screen .
Awesome web integration .
Universal search .
The Palm Pre has it all , making the iPhone look almost like — dare we say it — a version 1.0 device .
3. Multitasking .
The iPhone 's apps are great and a big part of the phone 's appeal .
But have you ever tried to listen to Pandora while you 're checking Gmail ?
Ca n't do it .
The iPhone 's limitation on running multiple apps is a serious drawback .
The HTC G1 improves on that with the notifications drawer , but it's an insufficient solution because it 's still too hard to see what 's currently running .
The Palm Pre solves that problem .
It treats applications as " cards " and makes it easy to flip through the deck of cards , view them at once and shuffle them .
The apps are live even when minimized , and you do n't lose your place even if you move to a different one or move to a new one .
4. Integrated contacts .
We all have lives that go beyond the phone — or beyond work e-mail .
The Palm Pre pulls together info , photos and current online status data from Facebook , Gmail , and Exchange and seamlessly integrates them into the address book and contacts .
That makes it easier to chat and message with just a single click .
5. Choice of network and flavors .
The Pre will launch on Sprint but is likely to be available on other networks after a few months .
That means a choice of networks for potential users — unlike the iPhone , which is exclusive to AT&T in the United States for five years .
Palm also is reportedly developing a GSM version of the device for Europe and Asia .
6. Everyone loves the underdog .
With the Palm Pilot and the early Treos , Palm was the original favorite of all gadget fanatics .
But in the last few years the company has been struggling to survive as its products bombed .
Remember the Foleo fiasco ?
This gadget was positioned as an e-mail companion device , but it was dead on arrival .
Palm 's biggest hit in the last three years has been a $ 99
pedestrian smartphone called Centro :
It 's been popular with budget - conscious soccer moms but anathema to almost everyone else .
Now Palm finally has a phone that has set bloggers and geeks buzzing .
Android , until now the most - talked - about mobile OS , should be afraid of the Pre , says Laptop magazine .
And even before the Pre has hit the market , competitors are already trying to trash - talk the device .
And here 's an extra something .
The Pre has an optional accessory :
The touchstone , a smooth pebble - like wireless charger that you set your Pre onto and let it suck up the juice without any wires .

The casual observer , viewing modern car crash damage , may believe today 's cars are delicate , poorly - designed machines .
They 're wrong .
These vintage crashes show old - timey cars in lower - speed crashes would disintegrate , along with , potentially , the occupants .

The difference between a modern car and a vintage car is new cars are designed to wrinkle up and bend in specific ways , redirecting the forces of the crash to protect the passengers .
To explain why this is important , let 's take a quick look at the physics .
For starters , there 's Newton 's second law of motion , force = mass x acceleration .
The equation conveys , in our scenario , that as the time it takes for an automobile to come to rest or change direction is increased , the force experienced by the automobile ( and its occupants ) is decreased .
Conversely , if the time to stop is shorter , the force experienced is greater .
Aluminum and plastic " crumple zones " add time to the crash by absorbing energy .
Advertisement
Prior to 1959 , people believed the stronger the structure , the safer the car .
But in actuality , such construction proved deadly to passengers .
Old steel was designed for durability , which is great if you like keeping your car around for generations , not so great if you 're interested in transmitting all of the forces of a crash around the passenger compartment .
So those " crumple zones , " first found in the 1959 Mercedes Heckflosse , allow the front of the vehicle to crush like an accordion , absorbing some of the impact of the collision and even giving off some of that energy in the form of heat and sound .
The front of the vehicle effectively acts as a cushion to slow the time it takes for the vehicle to come to a complete stop , applying less force on passengers .

The redirection of harmful forces during a crash is what allows the occupants of modern cars to survive crashes , even at the much higher speeds modern cars travel at , than vintage vehicles could ever achieve .
So you know , it 's all about the physics and stuff .

It 's widely rumored that Apple ( AAPL ) will be refreshing its Mac mini soon -- perhaps during marketing exec Phil Schiller 's keynote at next month 's Macworld conference .
( They sure need to -- Apple 's desktop Mac sales plummeted last month . )
So is this picture obtained by Macenstein an ad for it ?
We highly doubt it .
There 's a lot of reasons why not in the comments on Macenstein 's post -- Apple leaks are never ( rarely ? ) through ads , Apple does n't use blue LEDs , stupid tag line , etc .
But we think it 's even more obvious this is a fake :
There 's no reason for a desktop computer to have a curved , round top .
And there 's no way we can't see why Steve Jobs would approve an ugly lip like that on a desktop .
( As a reader points out , Apple 's Airport Extreme and Time Capsules have a similar looking lip , so anything 's possible . )

In a previous blog entry , I wrote about how you can now choose how much you want to pay for an all - you - can - eat Magnatune membership .
These memberships let you listen and download everything on Magnatune , without any limits .
From today on , you are no longer required to commit to a 3 month minimum : you can have as short a membership as one month .
Also , since the majority of people pay for memberships using Paypal ( vs credit cards ) , we now support Paypal 's recurring payments feature , so that you can choose to auto - renew , yet retain total control over billing by being able to cancel from within your Paypal account .
I 've been working with Leah Belsky ( from open - source - philosopher - guru Yochai Benkler 's group ) , to phase in each change at Magnatune in a controlled - experiment kind of way , so that both Magnatune ( me ) and the academics ( Benkler 's group ) can get data that is meaningful , quasi- scientific and which hopefully leads to insight .
The final step in this transition happened today .
Memberships to Magnatune are now :
1 ) no commitment : one month at a time , whereas previously the minimum was 3 months
2 ) pay what you want : you fill in the amount you want to pay ( no drop down box ) , though there is a $ 5 / month stream membership minimum , and $ 10 / month download membership minimum .

An Anarchist Perspective on the “ Violence ” of the Oscar Grant Riots by bay area ( a) narchists
Monday Jan 12th , 2009 8:42 PM
The news of the riots that followed the shooting of 22 - year - old Oscar Grant has sensationally occupied the headlines of Bay Area newspapers and television programs over the last week .
These reports have focused almost exclusively on the vandalism of local businesses and cars and have remained chillingly silent on the topic of the police violence that occurred that evening .
The troubling assumption made throughout all of the reportage is that the destruction of storefront facades and car windows somehow equates to the horrific execution of Oscar , and that it justified the police violence against demonstrators that night .
As anarchists who were involved in the demonstrations , we fully reject the notion that the vandalizing of private property could ever be weighed against the violence committed against not only Oscar Grant , but against youth of color every day by police and the prison system .
This way of thinking , that gives property more value than people , is what allows the violence of the police to become dangerously normalized and unquestioned .
At the time of this writing , the police officer that executed Oscar Grant in cold blood still walks the streets without criminal charges , while some of those arrested during the demonstration are locked away in prison awaiting trial and will likely face harsh sentences .
The violent system that so quickly punishes those who demonstrated while simultaneously protecting the murderer of Oscar Grant should be the target of our collective criticism and condemnation , not the angry youth who reacted to the shooting in the streets that night .
While Bay Area journalists have presented themselves as being objective reporters of the aforementioned events , their reports and broadcasts repeatedly reveal their bias in favor of the police when recounting the evening of the demonstrations .
The endless images of smashed windows and burned cars , and the litany of condemnations of " lawlessness " and " destruction " serve to obscure the most violent events of the night , and indeed the only violence perpetrated against human beings : the brutal police beatings of protesters .
One witness described a police officer beating a protester on the head so severely his bike helmet was split in two .
Another described how police made over 70 protesters lie down on their stomachs in positions that eerily echoed Oscar Grant 's pose as he was shot .
A visibly pregnant woman was screaming in pain after being attacked by police .
It is clear to us that the police were protecting private property and not human beings that night .
We are disgusted by this , and we condemn Bay Area journalists for being complicit with police violence by attempting to justify their actions .
A very distorted and troubling view of what constitutes violence in our society is perpetuated by the current coverage .
A car does not scream in agony when it burns , and similarly a storefront facade does not sob when its plate glass window shatters to the sidewalk below .
It is true that the cost of replacing cars and windows may be a burden for the working - class people who were affected , and that is certainly regrettable .
However , there is simply no comparison between those costs and the brutal consequences of police violence .
The youth who were brutalized by police the night of the demonstration will have to live with their injuries and traumas for years to come , and Oscar Grant can not be replaced .
We call on the public to recognize the real violence in our society – the violence of the police , the prisons and the politicians .
As long as police and corrupt politicians protect the cop that killed Oscar , as long as youth of color are continuously attacked and criminalized by the police and court system , as long as property is valued over people - we will not grieve over the property vandalized on Wednesday night .

- Bay Area Anarchists
Jan. 13 , 2009  --
Police in Washington state are searching for a Iraq war veteran accused of kidnapping and torturing two women and raping one of them .
Staff Sgt. Nathan Ryan Smith , 29 , has been charged with kidnapping , rape , arson and tampering with evidence .
Smith 's unit at the Fort Lewis Army base reported him AWOL Jan .
5 . Smith , who served as a calvary scout in Iraq from September 2006 to Octobrt 2007 , has military and wilderness survival skills and is considered extremely dangerous , said Ed Troyer , a Pierce County , Wash . , sheriff 's spokesman .
" He has no ties to the area and it 's a huge state .
He could be anywhere , " Troyer said .
After he allegedly raped one woman , Smith told her , " I have killed several people in Iraq .
I 'm crazy in the head , and if I get caught by police I will come looking for you and kill you , " according to a probable cause statement from Pierce County prosecutors .
Investigators say Smith is suspected in two attacks .
They say a woman , bound and naked , allegedly escaped from Smith 's house Jan. 3 and contacted neighbors , who called police .
In both instances , the alleged victims said their attacker fit Smith 's description and drove the same kind of car that is registered to Smith , according to court documents .
He allegedly grabbed one woman Jan. 1 in a Tacoma parking lot , and choked her until she became unconscious .
The woman woke up , naked and bound with zip ties in a strange house .
When she tried to free herself , she allegedly heard a man say , " If you fight you 'll die . "
The man put a butcher knife to her face and said , " If you cooperate , you 'll go home , " the court documents say .
Iraq War Vet Allegedly Raped Woman
The man , believed to be Smith , then allegedly gagged her , sexually assaulted her and raped her .
He also shocked her with electrified clamps , the woman , identified only as J.M. , told police .
" If you tell anybody , police or anyone , I will kill you and your family .
I can find you .
I will find you , " he allegedly said .
He blindfolded the woman and drove her around for 10 to 15 minutes before releasing her , the documents say .
Police Find Sex Toys , Cattle Prod in Search of War Vet's House
A second woman was kidnapped Jan. 3 by a man with a similar description and driving a similar car to the man involved in the first attack .
The woman in the second attack , identified in court papers as Y.L. , said she met the man at a Tacoma mall and agreed to go home with him .
Once there , the man choked her until she blacked out .
She told police that when she woke up , her hands were bound and the man put a gag in her mouth .
She said she managed to escape and run to a neighbor 's house , where neighbors called police .
When police went inside the home where Y.L. said she had been attacked , they found a smoldering fire and what Troyer called a " sex and torture chamber " in the upstairs bedroom .
A rope and some sex toys were burned .
Police also found a cattle prod , zip ties and what appeared to be dental tools , according to the probable cause statement .
If you played Resistance : Fall of Man , you know that Insomniac continually looked for ways to improve the online experience , even several months after the game ’s release .
We ’re taking the same approach with Resistance 2 , as patch 1.40 will be available for download on Monday , January 26 ( you ’ll automatically receive the download prompt the next time you play the game ) .
The patch addresses several areas , including :
Multiplayer Progression
Some people have seen their competitive and / or cooperative characters reset to level 1 .
For several of those cases , this patch will not only bring back all the XP , stats , and attributes that you ’ve lost , but it will also add to your character profile the XP / stats / attributes that you ’ve earned since those levels were reset .
For example , say you were a level 20 medic and after being reset to level 1 , and you earned 5,000 XP .
Thanks to the patch , you ’ll return a level 20 medic and that 5,000 XP will be added to your profile .
This patch will also correct some medal and trophy issues , including the “ Killing Machine ” trophy ( if you ’ve already accumulated 10,000 kills but have n’t received this trophy , it ’ll pop up as soon as you download the patch ) .
Here are some additional patch 1.40 details :
Trophy / Medal / Ribbons
“ Salute Me ” trophy is not awarded until player reaches level 31 ( Lieutenant )
“ Berserker ” trophy can be collected during non-ranked games
“ Survivor ” medal can be collected in cooperative games
“ Sure Shot ” ribbon is awarded if player has accuracy of exactly 50 %
Clans
Added clan support for viewing members , sending invites , and setting up clan tags
Default clan region is now USA
Match Balancing
Unbalanced ranked games are cancelled in staging before the game is started
Parties are prevented from matchmaking into free - for - all Deathmatch games
Competitive
Loadouts can be disabled in the “ Create Game ” screen in competitive games
Balanced the chance of dropping large ammo pickups in competitive games
Core Control scoreboard displays “ Kills ”
Improved scoreboard formatting
Cooperative
Balanced the amount of XP gained by the Medic class in cooperative games
Stalker movement enabled in cooperative games
Small ammo pickups do n’t give LAARK ammo in cooperative games
Weapons / Gameplay
Splash damage on Pulse Cannon can damage the player firing it
Rossmore reticule better reflects its accuracy
Fire is easier to shake off
Players cannot swap weapons in the middle of a melee attack
Miscellaneous
Localized text updates
Network message optimizations
EULA displays the correct language text for Norwegian , Finnish , Swedish and Danish
Now you may be asking , “ But what about adding the option to save the second player ’s character progress ? ”
Truth be told , it required a certain PS3 firmware that was n’t available at the time of Resistance 2 ’s release .
We now have that firmware and are currently working to implement the feature .
As soon as it ’s ready , we ’ll get it out to you .
If you have any questions regarding the patch , please visit and post in the MyResistance .
net message boards .
The Insomniacs will be there to help answer them .

In the last major economic downturn , Linux established itself as a widely - accepted enterprise operating system , benefiting a lively ecosystem of vendors such as Red Hat and Novell .
The return of tough economic times puts the open source alternative again front and center , this time with focus on databases and higher - level software applications .
I believe we 've entered another era for open - source companies of all stripes .
IT decision makers need to fight the financial crisis and they need a more efficient solution for critical enterprise system and IT needs .
As IT costs grow and the economic crisis puts pressure on global IT budgets , open source becomes irresistibly attractive to developers and IT decision makers who are being asked to do more with a whole lot less .
Meanwhile , proprietary vendors react by increasing license fees by 15 percent to 45 percent , they continue to lock - in their customers , and they take away independence regarding choice and flexibility across the enterprise technology infrastructure .
That 's why open - source solutions are more attractive than ever .
During the last economic downturn in 2001 - 2002 , open - source usage and adoption was on an upward curve .
Red Hat , for example , began winning large customer accounts that are now the backbone of their customer base .
CIOs and CTOs were on the lookout for innovative ways to save costs both from a technology and people perspective , and open source was a great solution .
Just like it is today .
Red Hat began to see the fruits of their labor in late 2002 ; the company grew revenue 14 percent for the year and that growth improved to 38 percent and 58 percent in 2003 and 2004 respectively .
Given the timing of subscription revenues and long sales cycles , it is not hard to conclude that during the 2001 - 2002 economic downturn , large corporations made the decision to switch to open - source technologies .
It also explains why Novell paid $ 200 million for Suse Linux in late 2003 , which at the time , was roughly 20 times its revenues .
Just as in the last downturn , every IT decision maker today is faced with increased license and spiraling support costs for complex proprietary solutions .
But business demands critical new capabilities at lower costs .
Now is the time for IT leaders to make a loud and clear choice : accept the extraordinary expense and " lock - in " of proprietary vendors , or take advantage of open - source 's cost - effectiveness and freedom .
With freedom also comes faster innovation .
My experience at the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) was that we could innovate more rapidly with open source through rapid technical collaboration and by eliminating the long legal and contractual delays of the proprietary software model .
An open - source user who has worked with both Linux and Ingres agrees .
Alan Nidiffer , VP and CIO at C&K Market , a West Coast grocery chain , recently explained why open source offers more innovation and faster development times .
According to Nidiffer , the set release schedules of traditional software companies slow down innovation , whereas open - source improvements come at any time .
He notes that innovative features can even come from software developers outside of his company ; they have fresh ideas on how to continuously improve the applications .
Open source now provides a complete stack of enterprise - grade software backed by excellent support , and rivals the technological strength of traditional proprietary vendor offerings .
Successful implementations for mission - critical workloads continue to dismiss concerns about support , security and reliability .
As more customers share their open source success stories , first - time open source users now have powerful innovators and role models to follow .
For example , I met recently with a customer who processes more than $ 100 billion a day in fund transfers for 160 banks using an open source stack that includes the Ingres database and Red Hat 's JBoss application server .
Meanwhile , customers from diverse industries spanning airlines ( Lufthansa ) and manufacturing ( PPG Industries ) to grocery store chains ( C&K Market ) and government agencies ( National Center for Missing & Exploited Children ) are embracing open - source solutions to manage millions of pieces of information critical to run and maintain their businesses , and even save lives .
These companies trust open source to do the jobs that must get done , and appreciate the accompanying cost savings , innovation and freedom .
These pioneering companies are choosing to forgo proprietary solutions and adopt open source stacks from companies such as Alfresco , JasperSoft and Ingres , from core database systems to emerging open - source stacks that support enterprise content management , document management , transaction processing and business intelligence .
Savings matters .
According to a recent report from Forrester Research , companies can save as much as 25 percent of their database costs by switching to open - source databases and have the potential of an additional 25 percent savings in hardware costs by using open source on commodity servers .
C&K Markets '
Nidiffer says his company has saved nearly 20 percent using the Ingres open - source database .
In the coming months and years , I predict that many companies will experience open source benefits , including greater innovation and much lower costs , while delivering the enterprise performance that companies require .
More than 10,000 of our worldwide customers , in sectors ranging from financial services through manufacturing and distribution to the public sector , prove this equation each day .
It is a new time for open source to show its true value as the alternative choice to companies that will be hit hard by the financial crisis .
Roger Burkhardt is president and CEO of Ingres and serves on the company 's board of directors .
Ingres is a provider of open - source database software , with over 10,000 commercial customers in 56 countries running a variety of business - critical workloads .
Prior to Ingres , Roger was for six years the CTO and executive vice president of the New York Stock Exchange
He and his team were responsible for transformation of the NYSE to a fully electronic model .

US Becomes Largest Wind Power Producer in the World
December 27th , 2008 by Andrew Williams
The United States has overtaken Germany to become the largest producer of wind energy in the world , generating enough capacity to eliminate the burning of 91 million barrels of oil per year .
According to the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) , US wind producers enjoyed another record year of growth in 2008 — the third in a row .
The country now has an installed wind power capacity well in excess of 21,000 megawatts ( MW ) , enough to supply electricity to over 5.5 million American homes .
According to Randall Swisher , AWEA Executive DIrector , “ Wind energy installations are well ahead of the curve for contributing 20 % of the U.S. electric power supply by 2030 as envisioned by the U.S. Department of Energy . ”
Amazingly , this rapid progress was achieved under a governing administration that to many seemed , at best , indifferent to the plight of the renewable energy industry .
If the US wind power industry is capable of becoming a world - leader during such times , it seems quite likely that the picture could improve even further with a more sympathetic leader at the helm .

( CNN ) --
There 's no truth to accusations by bloggers that a Palestinian camera crew staged a video showing the death of the videographer 's brother after an Israeli rocket attack , said the team 's employer .
In the video , camerman Ashraf Mashharawi is seen holding his brother .
" It 's absolute nonsense , " Paul Martin , co-owner of World News and Features , said of accusations leveled by bloggers at videographer Ashraf Mashharawi .
" He 's a man of enormous integrity and would never get involved with any sort of manipulation of images , let alone when the person dying is his own brother , " Martin said .
" I know the whole family .
I know them very well .
... [ Mashharawi ] is upset and angry that anyone would think of him having done anything like this .
...
This is ridiculous .
He 's independent . "
Raafat Hamdouna , administrative director at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City , said Friday that " Mahmoud Khalil Mashharawi , a 12 - year - old , was brought to the hospital , and he was breathing , but he was hit in the head and all over his body by shrapnel .
He died later in the hospital .
He was treated by the Norwegian team .
When he was brought in , he was breathing .
The team did their best to save him .
I am not really sure if they even tried to rush him to the surgery room , because he was badly hurt . "
Do n't Miss Conflict strikes home as cameraman finds brother dead
Mashharawi's video footage originally appeared on British television 's Channel 4 and later on CNN .
It showed futile attempts by doctors to resuscitate Mashharawi's 12 - year - old brother , Mahmoud , after he and his 14 - year - old cousin , Ahmed , had been wounded in what the family said was a rocket attack from a remote - controlled drone Sunday .
Watch doctors try and save the boy »
Ahmed also was taken to the hospital , but he had been fatally struck in the head and chest by shrapnel and had lost a foot , Hamdouna said .
Hamdouna said the hospital records reported Ahmed 's age as 16 , not 14 , as the family said .
At the time of the attack , the family said , the two boys were playing on the rooftop of the family 's three - story house .
The video showed a blood - splattered area where an explosion had taken place and where shrapnel had pierced the roof .
Mashharawi has regularly worked with World News and Features since 2004 , Martin said .
His multimedia company serves television , radio and newspapers .
Martin said accusations that Mashharawi owns a company that hosts Hamas Web sites were falsely based on Mashharawi having worked at a company that created the PS suffix to allow anyone of any political persuasion to create Palestinian Web sites .
The video footage appeared on CNN television networks and on CNN.com for 24 hours before CNN removed the material in the belief that it had no further right to use it .
CNN , standing by the video , has since reposted it .
Some bloggers had cited its removal as evidence that CNN did not stand by its reporting .
Responding to accusations that the resuscitation efforts of Mashharawi's brother appeared inauthentic , Martin said that , based on his years of reporting from Gaza , doctors often go through such efforts even with little hope that a patient can be saved .
In the video of the incident , the boy appears lifeless when brought to into the hospital .
In a brief conversation with CNN , Mashharawi said that doctors tried everything they could to save his brother and that he rejected suggestions that any of his work was inauthentic .
Before bloggers made their accusations , Mashharawi told CNN , " I believed at that moment if I did n't record that nobody will believe what 's happened to my brother .
Because it is unbelievable .
Until now , I can't believe what 's happened . "

For countless generations every spring , pregnant seals have gathered on the placid ice floes off the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland and Labrador and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence east of Quebec to give birth to their babies .
And every spring , thousands of Canadian fishermen descend upon the helpless mothers and their newborn pups , bludgeoning , shooting , clubbing and skinning between 270,000 and 335,000 seals , depending on the quota set by the government .
Most of the dead seals are only weeks old .
The fishermen call this a “ hunt , ” yet the animals cannot hide or escape the armed fishermen , who simply walk up to the seals and kill them .
As Paul Watson described it in his 2002 book Seal Wars , “ The slaughter of the seals is an annual baptism of blood . ”
And it ’s subsidized by the government .
Despite worldwide condemnation , Canada will proceed with its yearly massacre of seals in March .
Last December , the Canadian government quietly passed new regulations regarding the slaughter .
The new rules ban the use of the hakapik ― the spiked club that has come to symbolize the atrocity ― for killing any seal older than one year .
Instead , the seals are supposed to be shot .
The hakapik ban was an effort to placate the European Union , which proposed legislation in July that could prohibit the import of Canadian seal pelts and other products ; a decision is expected in April .
( Because it ’s the European designers who set the fashion trends for the rest of the world , the belief is a ban on seal fur in the EU would doom the Canadian seal slaughter , even if seal products are allowed in Russia and elsewhere . )
Banning the hakapik was also meant to mollify animal activists .
But Humane Society International ’s Rebecca Aldworth , a Canadian who has long campaigned against the commercial “ hunt ” of seals , says removing the spiked club would actually increase the suffering of seals because seals who are shot during the hunt are often only wounded by the first bullet .
Now sealers will have to cut open live , conscious animals , which Rebecca stresses is not only “ an extremely cruel act , ” but a violation of regulations .
I asked some animal protection groups around the world how they intend to campaign against Canada ’s seal slaughter this year , and I ’ll wrap this up with five things you can do to help .
Animal Alliance of Canada ( AAC )
Animal Alliance of Canada is working with the Humane Society of the United States to get restaurants , grocery stores , “ seafood ” companies , chains , hotels , resorts and casinos not to purchase Canadian seafood until the seal hunt ends permanently .
“ Fishermen are the ones who kill baby seals in their off season specifically for fur and leave their bodies to rot on the ice , ” says Karen Levenson , director of AAC ’s Canadian Seafood Boycott campaign .
Karen says that to date , 5,000 restaurants , hotels , casinos , grocery stores and seafood companies have signed on to the campaign .
AAC is also investigating claims made by Canada ’s Department of Fisheries and Oceans ( DFO ) regarding the importance of the seal hunt .
“ During the seal hunt , we will be monitoring the media to ensure their reporting is unbiased and factual , ” says Karen .
“ During previous seal hunts , journalists from Canadian Press who cover the seal hunt and work mostly in Newfoundland have reported very one - sided accounts and have included numerous statements by the DFO that were factually inaccurate . ”
Animal Rights Action Network ( ARAN )
“ In March , as per every year , Animal Rights Action Network will be staging another high - profile demonstration to raise awareness of Canada ’s seal hunt , ” says ARAN ’s founder , John Carmody .
“ We also have plans to release the 2009 slaughter footage from an international campaign group we are working with , plus we intend on doing a photocall [ publicity event ] outside the Canadian Embassy .
Also this year we ’ll be calling on Irish MEPs to ensure that the EU trade ban goes ahead and that the Irish Government shows their support for such a ban also . ”
John believes this is an issue everyone should be involved in .
“ I would suggest getting in contact with your local animal protection group to see what they are up to , or some of the main groups campaigning for an end to the seal slaughter like HSUS , IFAW , Sea Shepherd or Harp Seals . ”
He also recommends sending letters and emails to lawmakers in your country , voicing your opposition to the slaughter .
“ Of course , ” he adds , “ there ’s no better way to highlight the killing than to organize a peaceful protest or photocall with the press — it works every time ! ”
Anti-Fur Society
“ We are working with various groups , including one in Canada , on a campaign to convince EU parliamentary members to ban seal products to all European countries , ” says Rosa Close of the Anti-Fur Society .
“ You may know well just how much Canadian authorities are working to have EU members vote against the ban .
In fact , there is a Canadian delegation in Belgium right now doing all they can to stop the ban , and unfortunately , it seems that the EU is inclined to vote against a ban .
“ The European Parliament must hear from people all over the world so they may make at least some humanitarian requirements from the Canadian government .
But , I am afraid things do n’t look too promising . ”
Campaigns Against The Cruelty To Animals ( CATCA )
“ CATCA has been busy doing high - level lobbying in Europe with the decision makers on this issue , ” says the group ’s president , Ericka Ceballos .
“ This year , we are waiting to see what happens for further action , but we sent several E - Campaigns on January 3rd for everybody to write to Ministers and MEPs crucial on the upcoming decision to be taken about the Resolution on the trade of seal products at the European Parliament and Council . ”
CATCA has listed campaign information here .
Humane Society of the United States ( HSUS )
As part of its Protect Seals campaign , HSUS is encouraging consumers not to buy Canadian seafood until the seal slaughter ends .
In addition to the 5,000 grocery stores and restaurants mentioned above , more than 600,000 individuals have pledged not to buy seafood from Canada since HSUS launched its boycott in 2005 .
The organization hopes the Canadian government will realize the economic impact of a fisheries boycott is too high a price to pay for the seal hunt .
International Fund for Animal Welfare ( IFAW )
“ The International Fund for Animal Welfare has documented hundreds of criminal acts of cruelty in the seal hunt , ” says Corrie Rabbe of IFAW - Canada .
“ Unfortunately , due to lack of enforcement of regulations , most serious acts of animal cruelty ever documented continue to go unpunished .
To date , we have submitted video evidence of more than 660 probable violations of Canada ’s Marine Mammal Regulations — including the skinning of live seals — to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans .
Not a single charge has been laid in response . ”
Corrie says that his year IFAW will continue to lobby European officials to put a ban on all seal products in place .
“ This is where most of our energies will be concentrated , ” she says .
“ We will also be going out to monitor the hunt as we do every year so we can show officials our documentation and inform the public about what really happens .
In addition , we will continue to conduct research and spread public awareness about this important issue . ”
IFAW will continue their lobbying efforts across Canada , and Corrie says that this is where activists can be of great assistance .
“ IFAW believes that is it important that the Canadian government is aware of how strongly people feel about this issue , and for that reason we are asking supporters to let their views be known through writing letters and signing petitions . ”
IFAW also has a site for community involvement .
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA )
Sarah Gawricki , assistant activist liaison , says PETA is still brainstorming what they ’ll be doing to protest this year .
In the meantime , though , Sarah suggests activists join PETA ’s A - Team , which notifies members of upcoming events , demonstrations , breaking news and urgent alerts .
And Sea Shepherd ?
Unfortunately , the group so well known for confronting Canada ’s shameful “ hunt ” will not be engaged in any direct action against the seal slaughter this spring .
“ We intend to give the European Parliament the opportunity to end this atrocity through the implementation of a ban on all seal products , ” reads a statement on Sea Shepherd ’s Web site .
“ Last year the Sea Shepherd ship Farley Mowat was assaulted in international waters and two crewmembers , Captain Alex Cornelissen of the Netherlands and 1st Officer Peter Hammarstedt of Sweden , were charged with approaching closer than a half a mile to a seal being slaughtered .
The witnessing or documentation of a seal kill is considered a crime in Canada under the strange Orwellian name of the Seal Protection Regulations .
“ The Canadian government still holds the Farley Mowat hostage although no charges have been laid against the ship and the two Sea Shepherd officers are scheduled to be tried in a Nova Scotia court in April 2009 . ”
Sea Shepherd is promoting the international boycott of Canadian “ seafood ” products as a means to strip the commercial seal hunt of all economic value and force it , by financial means , to end .
( See # 2 below . )
Yes , You CAN Help !
Here are 5 things you can do to help end the Canadian seal slaughter :
1. Write letters to Canada
Corrie Rabbe of IFAW - Canada recommends people write to both Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans , Gail Shea , to express your disapproval of the annual slaughter :
The Honorable Stephen Harper
Office of the Prime Minister
80 Wellington St .
Ottawa , ON K1A 0A2
Fax : 613-941-6900
Email address : pm@pm.gc.ca
Web site : http://pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp
Fax : ( 613 ) 995-7858
The Honorable Gail Shea
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans
House of Commons
441 - S Centre Block
Ottawa , ON K1A 0A6
Be sure to mention you ’ll be boycotting Canadian products until the annual slaughter is ended for good .
Canadian residents :
Please write to your local MP on this issue .
You can find out who this is from this Web site .

2. Boycott Canadian “ seafood ” and Red Lobster
If you eat fish , please boycott “ seafood ” from Canada and ask your family and friends to do the same .
Boycotting Canadian seafood targets the very people who slaughter the seals , since it is the fishing industry that runs the seal “ hunt ” for off - season fishermen .
You can begin by not patronizing Red Lobster restaurants .
Red Lobster is the number - one seafood restaurant in the U.S. and the world ’s largest purchaser of Canadian seafood .
Red Lobster purchases millions of dollars worth of Canadian seafood each year , including lobster , shrimp , crab , scallops and salmon ― animals caught by fishermen who also club and shoot baby seals or pressure the government for increased seal quotas .
Despite repeated requests from animal protection organizations , Red Lobster refuses to join the boycott of Canadian seafood or take responsibility for their role in enabling the seal massacre to continue .
You can learn more , and contact Red Lobster , through this link .
According to Sea Shepherd , the most optimistic estimated value of the seal hunt is $ 16 million ; exports of seafood to the U.S. are about $ 3.3 billion ; therefore , the seal hunt value is less than 0.48 % of the value of exports to the U.S.
If we can achieve just a 25 % decline in the wholesale price in the U.S. , that ’s $ 825 million , or 51 times the value of the seal hunt .
“ It is individual citizens who have the most power to make this campaign a success and also help us end the seal hunt , ” says AAC ’s Karen Levenson .
“ By using their purchasing power , and by letting the restaurants and grocery stores know when they do so , they can pressure companies to stop purchasing some or all Canadian seafood until the seal hunt ends . ”
3 . Send letters to editors
The Letters page is one of the most highly read sections of newspapers and magazines , so a letter to the editor is one of the best tools animal activists have for making our message heard .
You can send letters on the seal slaughter now , expressing your outrage ; please do not wait until the killing begins this year .
Click here for tips on writing letters .
4. Educate others
Unfortunately , many people believe that Canada banned the killing of seals for their fur years ago .
Talk to family and friends about what is happening ; let them know this is an ongoing issue that you ’re concerned about .
And do n’t forget to post campaign information and undercover videos on MySpace , Facebook and other social - networking sites .
An auto - signature on your email is another great way to spread the word .
You can include a link to one of the many organizations campaigning against the slaughter ( a few are listed below ) , and you can encourage people to join the boycott of Canadian products and speak up for the seals !
You can also forward this post to others or link to it online .
5. Contact animal protection organizations
The killing of seals each spring in Canada is one of the few issues that animal rights , animal welfare and environmental groups all seem to agree must be stopped .
Contact one or more of the following organizations to learn more on this issue , and , if they take contributions , consider making a donation to further their work on behalf of seals .
Animal Alliance of Canada
Animal Aid UK
Animal Rights Action Network
Anti-Fur Society
Atlantic Canadian Anti-Sealing Coalition
Campaigns Against The Cruelty To Animals
Harp Seals
Humane Society of the United States
International Fund for Animal Welfare
PETA
Respect for Animals
Scandinavian Anti-Sealing Coalition
Sea Shepherd Conservation Society
Incidentally , the average Canadian agrees the carnage should stop .
Last April , in a lengthy review of the economic impact caused by subsidizing the slaughter in the face of boycotts and the EU trade ban , Murray Teitel wrote in Canada ’s leading business newspaper , The Financial Post : “ Enough already .
This is a colossal waste of taxpayers ’ money .
And the sealers ?
Sealers should prefer these monies be used to train them for jobs in the 21st - century economy , rather than to preserve them as relics of a hunter / gatherer one . ”
Nearly every Canadian who posted a response online supported an end to the slaughter .
Thank you for helping the seals !
( CNN ) -- Barack Obama had a formidable online presence during his quest for the White House , and he is once again turning to the Internet to communicate with the American public as president - elect .
President - elect Barack Obama has launched a Web site to chronicle his transition .
Within 24 hours of last week 's historic vote , his transition team rolled out change.gov , a Web site that promises to be " your source for the latest news , events and announcements so that you can follow the setting up of the Obama administration . "
The site is still a little thin on content , but there 's a blog , a newsroom and a countdown to the January 20 inauguration .
Visitors can fill out a form to share their stories about what the election meant to them , or they can give their vision of an Obama presidency .
They can even apply for a job .
Watch how the site may help Obama »
The Web site is an extension of Obama 's online strategy during the campaign .
As a candidate , he had four times as many friends as his Republican rival , Sen. John McCain , on MySpace.com .
Obama had almost 3 million supporters on Facebook and put together a massive database of e-mail addresses -- some 10 million .
Obama even announced Sen .
Joe Biden as his choice for vice president in a text message to supporters .
People who follow Obama online have become a community that the president - elect can tap into , said Andrew Raseij , founder of TechPresident.com , a Web site that tracked the online operations of the 2008 presidential campaigns .
" He now has his own special interest .
He has a group of people he can go to and ask them to participate in helping him pass his legislative agenda , " Raseij said .
He also predicted that Obama will use online video and interactivity to revolutionize the way the commander in chief communicates .
" I think the days of just a Saturday morning radio address and an occasional press conference as the way the president speaks to the American public are over , " Raseij said .
" I would n't be surprised if Barack Obama starts doing a weekly YouTube video and also fireside chats for the 21st century by allowing people to filter up questions to him that he might answer . "
iReport.com : Take a guided tour of the Web site with a fellow reader
The president - elect already has said he 'll have a five - day online comment period before signing any nonemergency legislation , so Americans can be part of the process .
He 's also planning to appoint a chief technology officer and has pledged to get true broadband to every community in the country .
Obama 's embrace of the Internet during his presidential campaign came as Americans increasingly turned to online sources to get election news .
iReport.com : Message to Obama praises use of technology
A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found 33 percent got most of their 2008 campaign news from the Internet , compared with 10 percent in 2004 .
The same survey found almost half of Americans ages 18 to 29 turned to the Internet as their major source of election news in 2008 .
Seventeen percent of people in this age group turned to newspapers .
All About Barack Obama
Can it be a year ago that we celebrated Obama ’s victory ?
I danced in Harlem where cars honked like a wild jazz band .
A woman climbed on a hood and screamed .
People flooded the streets of cities around the world as a great love surged through us and swallowed the planet whole .
In the midst of celebration I raised my arms and yelled , “ This is who we really are ! ”
A year later , why do we still have faith in him ?
We hoped Obama would give us a “ Green New Deal . ”
Instead he poured an ocean of public money into Wall Street , tripled the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and let A.I.G. executives reap more than $ 400 million in bonuses as Americans pitched tent cities and turned to food stamps .
If John McCain had won and done any of this we’d be in the streets knocking down police barricades , but we wo n’t protest Obama .
Despite the evidence , we believe he ’ll deliver us .
Is this not the liberal version of faith - based politics ?
The “ we ” here does not mean the left , wary as it is of electoral politics , but the millions of voters who saw in Obama a vehicle for their hope .
The need to hope comes from our history .
We are the result of European colonization and capitalist exploitation .
We were raised to see brown skin as a metaphor of filth , and this inequality created a global reservoir of repressed desire .
Obama ’s historical victory was seen as the conduit through which this immense need for change could speak .
But the narrative - frames around his campaign betrayed us .
A narrative - frame is the story that surrounds another story , and the story that surrounded his 2008 presidential election was that Obama is our liberal messiah .
He was “ The One ” whom the people delivered to power and who in turn will deliver power to the people .
And that ’s why so many are blindly loyal to him .
They are waiting for the Rapture .
Religion has long shaped political culture by providing roles for ambitious politicians .
Obama played the role of the messiah with his soaring rhetoric of national healing and his slogan of divine election “ We are the ones we ’ve been waiting for . ”
It became official Democratic propaganda in January 2008 when Sen .
Ted Kennedy , the Liberal Lion , put a rhetorical halo on the young senator ’s head , “ Every person he meets , every crowd he inspires , and everyone he touches generates new hope that our greatest days as a nation are still ahead . ”
The messianic narrative was so overwhelming that McCain spoofed it in a campaign ad entitled , “ The One . ”
It juxtaposed Obama ’s heavenly rhetoric with clips of actor Charleston Heston as Moses parting the Red Sea .
Obama joked about it at the October 2008 Alfred E. Smith roast , “ I was not born in a manger .
I was born on the planet Krypton and was sent here to save Earth . ”
Against this backdrop , somber moments took on a religious glow .
In February 2009 a black homeless woman named Henrietta Hughes begged Obama for help at a rally .
He leaned over , kissed her on the cheek and told his staff to see to her .
The video clip circulated on the internet like a miracle .
Popular culture also paved the way for Obama .
Images of a black president have usually been a sign of progress .
We see this figure in the 1972 film The Man , and more recently in Deep Impact , Bruce Almighty , Head of State and 2012 .
The Fox TV series 24 had two black presidents , about which lead actor Keifer Sutherland said , “ If you show a population that it is possible to have African - American people in this kind of position of political power then people believe it ’s possible . ”
Ultimately we believed Obama because he is black .
He must have felt how power works , the fear , the suspicious glances , the bubble one is trapped in or the expectation to perform tired roles .
The danger with the messiah narrative is that the audience plays a passive role .
Change comes to us , not from us .
The power of the messiah is in direct relation to the suffering of the people ; hence they have more value as victims than as political agents .
We see this in the healthcare debate when MoveOn.org enlisted R.E.M. for a song .
A melancholy guitar jangles in the video “ We Ca n’t Afford to Wait ” as grim people bloated with chemicals , with tubes in their throats or surgical scars on their chests hold signs with their conditions .
They are victims waiting for political deliverance .
If for liberals Obama is the messiah , for the right he ’s the Antichrist of the New World Order .
The right uses the narrative - frame of “ barbarians at the gate , ” in which the people must defend their homes from nefarious outsiders .
Whether Obama is Hitler , a Muslim Manchurian candidate or the Antichrist , the goal of this narrative is to transform anxiety into racist paranoia that sunders the polity into an absolute “ us ” and “ them , ” and to enlist the audience as defenders of God and civilization .
During last year ’s “ Tea Parties , ” angry whites marched with signs saying , “ Obama ’s Plan : White Slavery . ”
It was a small indicator of the rise in militia group activity and race - based hate crimes .
As long as these two narratives exist , the political field can wobble left but will tilt right because the right offers people who are suffering a meaning to frame their pain .
They say minorities or gays or foreigners or secular culture is the enemy , not the rich who stole their money .
Until liberals join the left and offer both political vision and agency for the people , we will lose .
Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope , “ I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views . ”
We projected our desires on him and he became our mirror .
It is a dynamic analyzed long ago by philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach , who wrote in The Essence of Christianity , “ God is nothing else than man : he is , so to speak , the outward projection of man ’s inward nature . ”
Yet a single saving element should be extracted from faith in Obama .
The glory we felt was not because of him , it was the incandescent reflection of ourselves we saw and loved .
The euphoria of election night was evidence of the world within us .
We are that powerful .
Instead of projecting our best selves outward we can focus on our actual lives .
Weeks ago , I was at a store with a friend .
She stacked her food on the counter and whipped out a food stamp card , paid and quickly put it in her purse .
She stiffly walked ahead feeling how ashamed I was of her .
When we sat down she said , “ I did n’t want you to judge me . ”
I apologized too quickly and then put myself in her place .
How scared she must be of the stigma pouring out of my eyes .
How would I feel if I were ashamed to even buy food ?
I looked at her and apologized again and meant it .
She leaned to me and said , “ It ’s okay . ”
She waited a moment and took out the food stamp card , “ This is who we really are . ”

Buffett : ' There are lots of loose nukes around the world '
By Lou Dobbs
CNN
Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , Warren Buffett RELATED Lou Dobbs Tonight YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated Nuclear Warfare Corporate Governance or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
The legendary Warren Buffett and I sat down last week to talk about his views on the issues and challenges facing the United States and all Americans .
The insight the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway shares , reaches well beyond the world of business and economics , to politics and society itself .
In my opinion , his every word is worth your time .
DOBBS : I would like to begin first with something that may surprise a lot of people about you , and that is your interest in biochemical nuclear terrorism and thwarting what you consider to be the gravest threat to the country , and to the world , in point of fact .
How did you first decide to focus your energy on that ?
BUFFETT : Well , back in 1945 , I delivered a paper that told about Hiroshima .
And I did n't know much about physics , but I learned .
And there 's no question in my mind that the number one problem with mankind is the spread of nuclear knowledge .
And , you know , thousands of years ago we had psychotics and we had religious fanatics and we had megalomaniacs .
But about the most they could do was throw a stone at somebody if they wished evil on them .
Today , since 1945 , the ability to inflict evil , or harm , on other people in huge numbers has grown exponentially .
And right now there 's the knowledge around to use nuclear material .
And we 've got to hope that the wrong people do n't get their hands on it .
DOBBS : And to hope is one thing .
But we have a government , and there are other governments around the world whose responsibility it is to protect all of us .
Is the United States government doing enough , in your judgment , to thwart that threat ?
BUFFETT : Well , it 's doing more , but there are lots of loose nukes around the world .
We 've got multiple governments that have the capability .
We have lots of chemical and biological agents that are ill guarded around the world and it should be at the top of the list for our government .
DOBBS : And , by saying it should be , it is obvious you think it is not .
You have also seen fit to join the Nuclear Threat Initiative and to get into the movie - making business , effectively , with this new movie that 's going to come out , " The Last Best Chance . "
Why did you decide to fund this ?
BUFFETT : Well , Sam Nunn heads the Nuclear Threat Initiative .
You could n't have a better person in the world to be sounding the alarm to governments around the world of just what this threat is .
And I have supported Sam in heading NTI , bringing out this movie , trying to make people be aware .
If they go to LastBestChance.org , they can get a film about it .
It 's the number one problem of our time .
There are people out there that would like to do a lot more than the World Trade Center or the Spanish trains or that sort of thing .
DOBBS : You say people .
They are , specifically , radical Islamists .
We talk about a war on terror , and I , frankly , have gotten crossways with the Bush administration in various capacities because I have criticized the idea we call it a war on terror .
It is really far more than that .
It is a war against a specific group , and a widening group , of radical Islamists .
Is it your sense that this country , in addition to the nuclear biochemical threat , is doing enough -- period -- in terms of homeland security ?
BUFFETT : Well , I do n't think you could do enough .
It 's important to guard what comes into this country , to try to infiltrate at the source , people that may have evil intent toward the country .
And it 's important that no more countries get nuclear weapons .
There are a lot of problems to attack on this .
DOBBS : Absolutely , and one of the things that we hear from people in business , in particular , and others , is that while it 's important to secure our borders and it's important to secure our ports , we certainly do n't want to interfere with commerce .
I have to tell you there is , perhaps , a peevish part of me that says maybe we should interfere we have a trade deficit that is now approaching 6 percent of our gross domestic product , 29 consecutive years of trade deficits .
Is this country consigned to be a debtor nation in perpetuity ?
Is there some reason that we simply cannot emerge from this huge debt , and these deficits , and say we 're going to have balanced trade ?
BUFFETT : Everyone says that what is going on can't go on forever .
We had , you know , $ 618 billion trade deficit last year , and it 's already grown a little bit this year .
The standard line is , it can't go on forever , but no one seems to give an answer of what is going to be done about it .
We exported $ 1.1 trillion last year , and we imported over $ 1.7 trillion .
We are running up obligations to the rest of the word , and they are buying our assets at the rate of almost $ 2 billion a day .
And that will have consequences .
DOBBS : Consequences , and not happy consequences , I think it 's fair to say .
You are , as a businessman , an investor , in point of fact , looking to a declining dollar as an opportunity for the company that you run .
How long a window do you see to invest in what are dim prospects for the American dollar ?
BUFFETT : Well , I do n't know timing .
I mean , this is a terrifically strong country .
We have a lot of assets to trade , and people will take our IOUs .
Right now our net position versus the rest of the world is they own $ 3 trillion more of us than we own of them , and that number grows every day , and at some point economists talk about a soft landing .
Maybe there will be a soft landing , but you know , who knows ?
And right now Berkshire Hathaway has a portion of its assets in foreign exchange contracts .
DOBBS : You also have a portion in cash .
BUFFETT : That 's true .
DOBBS : Forty billion , because you feel right now that not only are prices overvalued in the equities market , even some of your own assets you consider overpriced - $ 40 billion , an immense amount of money .
How concerned are you about this market , this economy ?
I could n't have you here , Warren , without talking about the market .
BUFFETT : I just do n't find things that are undervalued .
We like to get a lot for our money if we 're buying marketable securities .
So , I 'm hoping to put that money out .
We are going to announce an acquisition , costs a little less than $ 1 billion , but I 'd rather have it cost $ 5 or $ 10 billion , and then we 'll get an opportunity to put the money either into marketable securities .
We bought junk bonds three years ago .
We spent $ 7 billion in a short period of time .
We 'd like to buy businesses .
So , I 'm not happy with $ 40 billion , but , one way or another I think we 'll manage to invest it .
DOBBS : The rest of us ... when Warren Buffett holds cash and says he does n't see opportunity , it sets off alarm bells for everyone , as you well know .
You well know that .
The fact is you bought a small percentage of a Chinese oil company , for example .
BUFFETT : Right .
DOBBS : You 're investing -- I think that 's the correct way to put it -- in currencies , not the dollar .
The fact of the matter is , you have described what is happening in this context : tremendous deficits , rising debts as a result of budget deficits , trade deficit , those mounting debts that this country is taking on .
You are talking about something you refer to as the sharecropper society and economy .
What does that mean to you , because the rest of us , those are strong and powerful words for all of us but especially for those of us who are concerned about the middle class in this country , and who want this country to be all it is aspired to be .
BUFFETT : Well , if we keep doing what we 're doing -- and we have shown no signs of slowing down -- the world will own a substantially greater percentage of this country or have our IOUs in the form of government bonds 10 years from now than now , and the cost of servicing the debt or the cost of paying dividends on the ownership will mean that we will send abroad a few percent of our GDP every year just to service debts that arose from the over - consumption that has taken place currently .
So , our sons will pay for the sins of their fathers , to a degree .
Now , we 'll always have a rich country .
This is the best country in the world .
DOBBS : Absolutely .
BUFFETT : But if the rest of the world has $ 10 trillion of our assets instead of $ 3 trillion , we will be shipping some of our product abroad every year merely to service the debt that we 've run up .
DOBBS : And do you see this as an irremediable situation , a direction that cannot be avoided now ?
BUFFETT : It can be addressed .
We 'll be taxable .
DOBBS : Warren , we 're talking about fixes for the fix we 're in .
So much of what we discuss in our broadcast and report on , we hear from the , if you will , political elites , that there is just simply nothing that can be done .
There 's a lack of determinism , it seems to me , in this country .
What would you do to fix , first , the trade deficits that are , as you say , mortgaging the future of our children ?
BUFFETT : Well , I wrote an article 18 months ago in " Fortune " about import certificates .
Just a change in the value of the dollar is probably not going to do much as we 've seen in the last three years .
I mean , the euro 's gone from 85 cents to $ 1.29 , and the dollar 's fallen against many currencies , and the trade deficit keeps ballooning , so I think that we have to address it in some way that brings exports up and imports down and this import certificate idea would address that .
DOBBS : It 's certainly one of the ideas .
Fred Bergsten , one of the most well known free trade economists , has actually started calling for tariffs on China .
I 'm concerned about free trade .
And I think it 's a hollow mantra for failed policies , but I 'm not ready to call for broad tariffs , are you ?
BUFFETT : I would n't call for them on any specific country .
The import certificate approach does not go after any industry , it does not go after any country , but it lets the market adjust in a way that brings our trade closer to balance .
And I think at a higher level of exports than currently exist .
DOBBS : Are you surprised when you focus on the two deficits we just talked about , the trade deficit , and the budget deficit ?
The budget deficit is 3.6 percent of our GDP .
The trade deficit is reaching just almost 6 percent of GDP .
And the president is talking about reforming Social Security .
Does that surprise you ?
BUFFETT : Well , it 's an interesting idea that a deficit of $ 100 billion a year , something , 20 years out , seems to terrify the administration .
But the $ 400 - plus billion dollars deficit currently does nothing but draw yawns .
I mean the idea that this terrible specter room looms over us 20 years out which is a small fraction of the deficit we happily run now seems kind of interesting to me .
DOBBS : In point of fact , the Congressional Budget Office , which is considered to be the bipartisan objective standard of such things , has research that suggests that the deficit in Social Security would be only 0.4 percent of our GDP over 75 years as compared to the other large deficits percentages that associated with trade in the budget deficit .
Do you have , we 're talking about fixing the fixes we 're in , a quick answer for Social Security ?
BUFFETT : I personally would increase the taxable base above the present $ 90,000 .
I pay very little in the way of Social Security taxes because I make a lot more than $ 90,000 .
And the people in my office pay the full tax .
We 're already edging up the retirement age a bit .
And I would means test ... I get a check for $ 1,700 or $ 1,900 or something every month .
I 'm 74 .
And I cash it .
But I 'll eat without it .
DOBBS : You will eat without it .
So will literally more than a million other Americans , as well .
Means testing , the idea of raising taxes , the payroll tax .
In 1983 , Alan Greenspan , the Fed chairman , he had a very simple idea : raise taxes .
That 's what you 're saying here .
BUFFETT : Sure .
But I would n't raise the 12 - point and a fraction payroll tax , I would raise the taxable base to above $ 90,000 .
DOBBS : That 's a progressive idea .
In other words , the rich people would pay more ?
BUFFETT : Yeah .
The rich people are doing so well in this country .
I mean , we never had it so good .
DOBBS : What a radical idea .
BUFFETT : It 's class warfare , my class is winning , but they should n't be .
DOBBS : Exactly .
Your class , as you put it , is winning on estate taxes , which I know you are opposed to .
I do n't know how your son Howard feels about that .
I know you are opposed to it .
At the same week the House passed the estate tax , Congress passed the bankruptcy legislation , which they had the temerity to call bankruptcy reform , Democrats and Republicans passing this legislation , which is onerous to the middle class .
Half of the bankruptcies in this country take place , because people fall ill , serious illnesses result in bankruptcy .
Nearly half of the people involved .
How do you -- you have watched a lot of politics .
What is going on in this country ?
BUFFETT : The rich are winning .
Just take the estate tax , less than 2 percent of all estates pay any tax .
A couple million people die every year , 40,000 or so estates get taxed .
We raise , what , $ 30 billion from the estate tax .
And , you know , I would like to hear the congressman say where they are going to get the $ 30 billion from if they do n't get it from the estate tax .
It 's nice to say , you know , wipe out this tax , but we 're running a huge deficit , so who does the $ 30 billion come from ?
DOBBS : And it is , it 's $ 300 billion in lost tax revenue over the course of the next decade if the estate tax goes through .
You say the rich are winning .
The rich are winning in some cases , because they are cheating .
The corporate corruption scandals , which burst full upon the country at the end of 2001 , Sarbanes - Oxley , new regulations , new efforts to achieve transparency .
Has enough been done ?
Or does more need to be done ?
BUFFETT : I think the climate has been changed on that for the better , Lou .
Mae West said , " I was Snow White but I drifted . "
Well , I think corporate America drifted some .
But I literally think what has happened has changed the culture somewhat , and for the better .
I think that 's probably more important than the laws .
DOBBS : Yet we hear the Business Roundtable , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , whining that it 's so onerous , so difficult to obey the law and to meet these regulations .
What 's your reaction ?
BUFFETT : Well , right now corporate profits as a percentage of GDP in this country are right at the high .
Corporate taxes as a percentage of total taxes raised are very close to the low .
DOBBS : Historically we 're talking about .
BUFFETT : Historically .
So , you know , corporate America is not suffering , I 'll put it that way .
DOBBS : Corporate America is not suffering .
In point of fact , those same organizations that I just mentioned , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable representing some of the largest companies are saying " You tax us , you are taxing our consumers , our customers . "
Do you think corporations in this country should be paying more ?
Taking some of that burden ?
BUFFETT : I think that ... you have seen companies be able to repatriate earnings with a very small tax that were taxed at very low rates abroad .
Corporations are doing better in the total tax picture than the people I 'm going to walk by on the street when I leave here .
DOBBS : And some of the people you are going to meet are going to say , perhaps this evening and otherwise in business circles , are going to say , Warren , what are you talking about , raise our taxes .
BUFFETT : They are still friends of mine , Lou .
DOBBS : You are going to get along .
I know you are going to get along .
BUFFETT : Is there anyone I have forgotten to offend ?
DOBBS : Let 's give you another opportunity .
And I 'm going to bring up General Re and the fact that today the FBI announced that it is entering the investigation into the insurance industry .
General Re obviously under investigation .
A broad number of investigations -- AIG .
BUFFETT : A couple dozen , all told .
DOBBS : Right .
Formally run by Hank Greenberg , until a few weeks ago one of the most respected businessmen in the country .
Do you think this widening investigation is appropriate ?
Do you think it 's necessary ?
And are you concerned about what it will reveal ?
BUFFETT : I think it 's fine to be done .
I mean , we 'll find out what has taken place .
And some things that were actually legal a few years ago will probably be found to be distasteful .
There will be things that are found that were probably illegal .
But there 's nothing wrong with looking in the insurance industry just like the investment banking industry or some of the other things that have been looked at .
DOBBS : As you look over this society you know , I 'm struck by the fact that your board averages right at 70 years .
BUFFETT : I bring up the average , too .
DOBBS : You do .
But have you some colleagues who boost it more than you .
BUFFETT : Right .
DOBBS : Including Charlie Munger .
BUFFETT : Right .
DOBBS : But I was struck by the fact of the age of that board .
And I know a lot of people would want to talk to you about succession and everything else .
That 's not my interest .
My interest is we have 77 million Americans who are retiring .
Do you think there 's a crisis per se in retirement in this country ?
Or do you think that this is a healthy and perhaps important change where people are both living longer and contributing longer ?
And that we should look at this as positive rather than a negative ?
BUFFETT : Well , it is a positive .
But people age in different ways .
I mean , we have three or four managers in the 80s , but we had a few other managers that we had to let go much earlier than that .
So , it 's hard to generalize .
The people we have on our board -- we do n't have anyone on the board that does n't have at least 4 million of stock .
They bought it in the open market , they were n't given it by restricted stock or options .
And they are owner oriented .
They are business savvy .
They are all - star crew .
DOBBS : I want to close with your thoughts about the future here .
You said this is still the richest economy .
Let me ask you straightforward :
Are you optimistic about the prospects for a country that 's been built on a middle class and those who have aspired to it ?
Do you see the same opportunity going forward ?
Are you heartened or concerned ?
BUFFETT : I think it 's a terrific country , Lou .
You never want to go short on America .
The nuclear , chemical and biological threat is real .
And it 's one we should attack .
But this country -- our children and our grandchildren are going to live better than we do in this country .
No question about it in my mind .
DOBBS : And that 's a pretty good mind from which to hear that forecast .
Warren Buffett , thanks for being here .
Appreciate it .
BUFFETT : Thank you , Lou .

We spotted some Asus keyboards last week , but none were nearly as potentially awesome as the official Eee Keyboard .
Featuring wireless HDMI , it 's a " fully functional PC " with full QWERTY and a mini secondary touchscreen .

Asus was vague as to if / when we 'll actually see the Eee Keyboard come to market ( though we 're pretty sure it's a semi- real product ) , but it 's a fantastic concept for a home theater PC if we 've ever seen one .
Through wireless HDMI you could potentially make any television into your monitor ( complete with audio playback ) without having some huge PC taking up space .

Processor ?
RAM ?
Yeah , we have no clue .
But look at all those ports !
Researchers are now finding so many negative links between gaming and your physical and mental health - from self - esteem to dementia , anger issues to bladder control that theyre stopping just shy of outright blaming Halo for erectile dysfunction and Tomb Raider for the sudden surge in autism .
Here are some of the many bizarre ( but possibly bullshit ) ways that modern science thinks video games are screwing you over .
# 5 . Poor Self Esteem
A study by a psychology professor at Kansas State University has found a strong link between body image and video games .
According to his research , Professor Richard Harris says that only 15 minutes of playing video games featuring extreme body types can negatively impact your own body image .
The men in the study were made to play WWE Wrestlemania for their allotted time , while the women were made to play DOA : Beach Volleyball .
Though general decline in positive body image was noted across both sexes , the men more specifically reported much lower satisfaction with their lack of body oil and rage - induced veinage , while the women openly lamented about the lack of bounce customization in their quintuple - J breasts .

- Video games
But its not like all video games will make you weep openly , wishing on every eyelash that you could wake up in the morning magically transformed into a pretty , pretty princess just the games that feature large , handsome , well - muscled men and busty , scantily - clad sex goddesses .
Thats tops like , what ?
98 percent of them ?
Most retro gaming is still probably okay , though - just dont go picking up Pac - Man if youre a short , fat , jaundiced quadriplegic .
But then , if thats the case , youre probably not exactly bursting at the seams with sexual confidence in the first place .

# 4 . Male PMS
A study by scientists at Stockholm University hooked up some teenage boys to heart monitors , and then split them into two groups giving one group a violent video game , the other a non-violent one .
The results they found revealed a much higher heart rate variability in the violent group , which continued well after they stopped playing and even into their sleep that night .
In general , higher HRV can cause a myriad of symptoms , from increased stress to seizures and loss of bladder control .

The esteemed employees of Half - Life developer Valve are well known for soliciting email directly from gamers ; more to the point , they are known for responding .
Shackers often send inquiries to Valve developers , and they get real results -- even when the questions are somewhat unorthodox in nature .
Here are a few actual questions and responses Shackers have sent to and received from Valve .
Flush with enthusiasm after completing Half - Life 2 : Episode Two , Shacker filthysock sent this email off to the Valve crew to share some of his thoughts :
1 . The grenade puzzle : I did it with a blast from the gravity gun !
Looked down and primary fire and the floor bounced me up .
Would love to see more gravity gun bounce puzzles 2 .
The little forest bit was BRILLIANT , it had the perfect feel as you walk in and it got darker and quieter but looking up the HDR made the leaves against the sky look great .
It would be fantastic to have an extended time in a forest , i think even combat would work in there .
The response from Valve 's Chet Faliszek demonstrated the company 's hard - line attitudes :
Thanks for the email .
We do not allow cheaters .
We are matching you against our steam subscriber list and you will be banned for cheating in the grenade puzzle .
Thank you
Justice is served !
Day after day , Shacker Robotic Puppy Eater saw the same enigmatic image ( pictured left ) on the Team Fortress 2 map Gravel Pit .
Baffled by its existence , consistent placement ( " I see it ALL THE TIME , " he posted , " in the exact same spot . " ) , and artistic inconsistency with the rest of TF2's decor , he sent this email to the folks at Valve :
I keep seeing this picture above one of the spawn area exits in gravelpit .
Can you tell me what it is ?
Thanks .
Justin
The astute response from ever - vigilant Valve :
Hi Justin ,
It appears to be a duck .
Matt
Case closed !
( As was later determined , the image is the personal spray of fellow Shacker pyide . )
Shacker and dedicated Team Fortress 2 player Rosewood is known for staying connected to servers reserved for Shacknews readers even after he is no longer playing , occupying a valuable player slot .
Shacker deveus1 was sick of it , and composed the following email :
Hi Gabe , Rosewood went AFK again on the shack 's TF2 server .
He 's been like for the last 6 hours and he just wo n't leave :(
Is there anything you can do ?
He 's a nice guy and all , but we 've gotta make room for some people .
Thanks in advance .
Valve designer Robin Walker made it clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerated :
After some discussion about possible solutions to this problem , we decided that the easiest one was to just permaban Rosewood 's steam account .
Glad to hear you 're enjoying TF2 .
- Robin .
But Valve did n't stop there .
Valve 's Erik Johnson decided it was n't enough just to stop this egregious TF2 idler from playing games -- he must be punished internet - wide .
The following email was sent to Shacknews founder Steve Gibson and cc'ed to deveus1 :
Steve -
Can you ban his Shack account too please ?
Thanks
Problem solved !
Shacker Lionhart32935 had a minor gripe with one of Half - Life 2 : Episode Two 's commentary recordings :
Hi Gabe !
One [ of ] the commentators in episode 2 sounded really bored .
I believe his name was Stevie or Steven , can't quite recall .
Tell him to sound more excited .
He makes games , he should be off the wall to talk about what he worked on .
He sounded like Ben Stein was having more fun than he was .
Valve 's Chet Faliszek wasted no time in righting the wrong , going straight to the source :
Thanks for your email .
Based solely on your feedback we have decided to fire the offending party , Steve Kalning .
Instead of sending him to HR and wasting their time , I have cc'd him on this email and this will act as his official notice .
Clean out your desk Steve .
Thanks Lionhart for helping us make Valve a better place .
It was n't long before a second email response followed :
Pat , after careful study , I realize steve bond could have also been the culprit .
So since we can't really be sure , and really no sense wasting any more time on this .
Mr Bond ?
Please clean out your desk as well .
Concerned that his complaint had already resulted in the loss of two jobs , Lionhart32935 replied :
How about just giving him a hug instead ?
I heard that cheers up many people .
Buy him a drink , even better !
It will make the work environment more exciting for him if he gets unexpected surprises from fellow coworkers .
Faliszek was having none of it :
That is the kind of weak thinking we do n't need aroud here Lionhart .
Hugs never got a 96 on the metacritic score .
Standards upheld !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The government forced Citigroup to cancel its order for a brand new $ 50 million corporate jet .
Now , two Congressmen are hoping that the Obama administration will convince the beleaguered bank to scrap its naming rights deal with the New York Mets .
The Mets are moving into a new baseball park this year and Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) agreed in 2006 to pay $ 400 million over 20 years to have it named Citi Field .
But that deal , like the planned purchase of the jet , has come under scrutiny from Congress now that Citigroup has received $ 45 billion in taxpayer bailout money , as well as a government backstop for more than $ 300 billion in loan losses .
With that in mind , House members Dennis Kucinich , D- OH , and Ted Poe , R - TX , this week urged Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner to intervene .
" Citigroup is now dependent on the support of the federal government for its survival as an institution .
As such , we do not believe Citigroup ought to spend $ 400 million to name a stadium at the same time that they accept over $ 350 billion in taxpayer support and guarantees , " Kucinich and Poe wrote .
Kucinich and Poe make a good point .
It is embarrassing that the new stadium in Queens will bear the name of a company that has twice gone running to the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , and that 's synonymous with the financial collapse .
It 's particularly appalling considering that Citi announced plans to lay off more than 50,000 workers in November and reported a loss of nearly $ 19 billion in 2008 .
But should Geithner demand that Citigroup back out of the deal ?
That 's going too far .
It makes sense for Treasury to try and prevent Citi and other banks from making any more dumb moves going forward .
But it would set a dangerous precedent to have the government step in and mandate that a company break an existing written contract .
And if Citigroup has to renege on its deal , then where does it end ?
Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , the recipient of $ 45 billion bailout money and hundreds of billions more in loan guarantees , reportedly pays $ 7 million a year for Bank of America Stadium , home to football 's Carolina Panthers .
Should Geithner pull the plug on that contract too ?
Several other financial firms that have received or applied for bailout money also have names on stadiums , including Comerica ( CMA ) , M&T Bank ( MTB ) and PNC ( PNC , Fortune 500 ) .
Heck , this Sunday 's Super Bowl will be played at Tampa 's Raymond James Stadium , named for the brokerage firm that has applied for TARP money .
And let 's not forget automaker General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) , the recipient of $ 13.4 billion in government loans .
Its name currently graces the home of hockey 's Vancouver Canucks .
Now do n't get me wrong .
I personally think that most companies that spend millions on naming rights deals are wasting their money .
It 's also telling that besides banks and autos , another notoriously mismanaged industry -- airlines -- has a host of such deals .
Many companies got suckered during the good times into thinking that they have cash to burn and that using it to plaster their name on a stadium is a good idea ... only to find that the expected promotional benefit did nothing to help them .
Internet company CMGI , now known as ModusLink Global Solutions ( MLNK ) , was forced to abandon its naming rights deal for the New England Patriots football stadium after the dot - com bust .
And remember PSINet ?
The Internet service provider signed a 20 - year naming rights deal for the Baltimore Ravens ' football stadium in 1999 ... and went bankrupt two years later .
Enron and Adelphia , two companies that were at the heart of the corporate accounting scandals in the middle of this decade , also once had naming rights deals .
( Enron Field was once the name of the Houston Astros ' baseball park while Adelphia Coliseum was the home of the NFL's Tennessee Titans . )
But none of this means that the government should have any right to force a company to back out of a written agreement it has with another party .
Now should Citi work with the owners of the Mets to try and find another sponsor for the ballpark ?
That is not a bad idea .
It would be a good PR move for both the Mets and the beleaguered bank if the new stadium bears the name of a corporate sponsor that 's not suckling at the government 's TARP teat .
And even though Citi would only be " saving " $ 20 million annually by ending the deal , every bit helps right now .
So if Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit wants to do something to really get in Geithner 's good graces , not to mention win over some angry taxpaying New York Mets fans , then maybe he should have some of his firm 's currently underworked bankers start looking for another firm that can take over the naming rights .
The only TARP that should be associated with America 's pastime is the one the groundskeepers pull over the field during a rain delay .
“ National emergency centers ” on military bases to house American citizens
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , January 27 , 2009
A new bill introduced in Congress authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to set up a network of FEMA camp facilities to be used to house U.S. citizens in the event of a national emergency .
The National Emergency Centers
Act or HR 645 mandates the establishment of “ national emergency centers ” to be located on military installations for the purpose of to providing “ temporary housing , medical , and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster , ” according to the bill .
The legislation also states that the camps will be used to “ provide centralized locations to improve the coordination of preparedness , response , and recovery efforts of government , private , and not - for - profit entities and faith - based organizations ” .
Ominously , the bill also states that the camps can be used to “ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security , ” an open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse .
Many credible forecasters have predicted riots and rebellions in America that will dwarf those already witnessed in countries like Iceland and Greece .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
With active duty military personnel already being stationed inside the U.S. under Northcom , partly for purposes of “ crowd control , ” fears that Americans could be incarcerated in detainment camps are all too real .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
The bill mandates that six separate facilities be established in different Federal Emergency Management Agency Regions ( FEMA ) throughout the country .
The camps will double up as “ command and control ” centers that will also house a “ 24/7 operations watch center ” as well as training facilities for Federal , State , and local first responders .
The bill also contains language that will authorize camps to be established within closed or already operating military bases around the country .
As we have previously highlighted , in early 2006 Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root was awarded a $ 385 million dollar contract by Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency .
The language of the preamble to the agreement veils the program with talk of temporary migrant holding centers , but it is made clear that the camps would also be used “ as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency . ”
As far back as 2002 , FEMA sought bids from major real estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities in the case of a chemical , biological or nuclear attack or a natural disaster .
A much discussed and circulated report , the Pentagon ’s Civilian Inmate Labor Program , was more recently updated and the revision details a “ template for developing agreements ” between the Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations . ”
Alex Jones has attended numerous military urban warfare training drills across the US where role players were used to simulate arresting American citizens and taking them to internment camps .

VIEWPOINT
Jeff Bentley
Centuries of crop diversification are at risk of being lost forever , warns Jeff Bentley .
In this week 's Green Room , he says a growing dependency on just a few modern , high - yielding varieties is leaving the world 's food supplies exposed .
Local , native varieties were safe on the farm , but as farmers turn increasingly to modern , high yielding varieties , the old ones are being abandoned
A potato is not just a potato ; there are thousands of local varieties still grown in their birthplace in the Andes .
Some are long , thin and purple ; others are lemon yellow and floury , or shaped like a bull 's horn .
Most crops have many varieties , a rich heritage that most urban dwellers are no longer aware of .
The cultivated potato comes in six different species and perhaps 3,000 varieties , most found only in the Andes .
That is a lot of genetic information .
Until recently these local , native varieties were safe on the farm , but as farmers turn increasingly to modern , high - yielding varieties , the old ones are being abandoned .
For example , in the 1970s near Lake Titicaca , agronomists collected more than 200 varieties of quinoa , a native Andean grain .
Now , no more than 50 of these are still grown .
Our generation is snuffing out ancient races of crops which fed the Incas , the Mayans , the Sumerians , and the Tang dynasty .
But it 's not entirely too late to save these crop varieties , and their irreplaceable genetic information .
In 1997 , the government agency responsible for Bolivia 's collection of quinoa suddenly collapsed .
The drive for greater efficiency and higher yields carries a genetic cost Many of the 1,800 accessions of this native grain were no longer found in the field , and would have been lost forever without the thoughtfulness of Alejandro Bonifacio , a native Aymara .
With no agency to care for the quinoa collection , Dr Bonifacio simply took it home .
It took him a year to find work elsewhere , but he saved these endangered crop varieties and has spent the past 10 years adding to it and describing it .
If only all crops were so lucky .
The impoverished smallhold farmers who nurture crop diversity need to sell some of their harvest to make a living , but selling can be stressful .
Villagers struggle to understand why the harvest that was so much work now fetches such a low price .
The person who buys the product often gets the blame .
Researchers in Peru and Bolivia found that farmers and other people further up the food chain hardly knew each other .
But when farmers , wholesalers , even chefs and supermarket staff all sat down together they learned about each others ' concerns .
Crossroad for crops
The invisible hand of the market , it seems , can favour the farmers and crop diversity .
For example , heirloom potatoes are being sold to upscale Andean shoppers in smart little net bags .
Because farmers can sell native spuds at a good price , they are planting more of them .
If humanity mourns the loss of wild plants , we should really worry about the extinction of cultivated ones
West Africans domesticated a native species of rice , called Oryza glaberrima , 3,500 years ago .
The grain was relative of the Asian rice Oryza sativa .
Yet 450 years ago , the Asian species reached Africa and all but displaced the native rice , which had a thinner head of grain and thus brought in a smaller harvest .
By the 1990s , native African rice was reduced to a few pockets on scattered farms .
Then in the 1990s , Sierra Leonean plant breeder Monty Jones and colleagues found a way to create a fertile hybrid between African and Asian rice .
Called " Nerica " ( New Rice for Africa ) , it could yield a bumper harvest like its Asian parent , but it was as tough as its African side , resistant to drought , pests and disease .
Scientists have bred many varieties of Nerica and farmers all over West Africa are starting to grow them .
This new rice , descended from an endangered species , is helping Africa to feed itself , yet this opportunity would have been lost if O. glaberrima had gone extinct .
As the Earth gets warmer , we will need to breed other hardy new crop varieties .
Plant breeding is like playing cards : more hands are possible with a full deck .
We 'll only be able to create new varieties in the future if we save the old ones we have now .
Many rare crop varieties are now grown on just a few farms , often by elderly people .
The crops will be lost forever unless young people start to grow them .
If humanity mourns the loss of wild plants , we should really worry about the extinction of cultivated ones .
These plants sustain our lives .

Do people need to pay more attention to the loss of crop diversity ?
Are modern food and farming methods increasing the threats facing the world 's food supply ?
Or is greater efficiency and higher yields the only way to feed a growing population ?
Genetic homogenization leaves us all prone to disasters and in this case like playing poker with worldwide starvation .
Joe brown , Vancouver , Canada Chis C , it 's really pretty simple .
Crop diversity = food security .
It means we have a food supply that is much more resistant to disease , inclement weather , and the whims of multinational chemical companies that just happen to sell seeds , than the one we currently have .
Also , traditional plant breeding is not in any way the same as genetic engineering .
Breeding happens in the field .
Genetic engineering happens in a lab .
anne , urbana , il
In my opinion changing the food culture will partly help solve the problem .
We have evolved to choose the food by its look noy by its nutrition .
Eating for tongue has to be replaced by eating for guts .
Kaphle K , Bharatpur / Chitwan , Nepal The Irish Potato Famine ( 1840 ) in which millions of people starved to death is an example of the perils of relying on just one variety of a crop .
Mike Adams , Dorset , UK
In the grand scheme of things loss of crop biodiversity in itself would have to rank as one of the lesser of human iniquities .
Ask yourself , why do we need such high crop productivity ?
Cranking up livestock production is one of the main reasons , where one third of all crops go to feed livestock .
In addition pastoral land makes up 55 % of all arable land and this area is still steadily increasing at the expense of forests .
The consequence is that there is not much space left for biodiversity and mounting pressure to produce more crops on less land .
Tony , Christchurch , New Zealand Chris C ; " Overblown " , you say !
You can't be really serious with this comment .
GMO companies like Monsanto , ravaging our diversity for profit , are a key reason our crop varieties are disappearing .
And a very serious problem .
Check out the short video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swVjzIVqRUA
In addition , there 's the lack of care for the wonders of God 's complete and varied creation that some people evidence and demonstrate .
Blessings all , Gary In TO
Gary Patton , Toronto , ON CAN I do not agree with Chris C. in that if the assumption is valid , invasive species would be much less a problem .
Species can establish in conditions that are not optimized for them .
In agriculture , what to plant is largely an economic decision rather than a result of natural selection .
Unfortunately , that the economically favourable varieties can establish today , does not guarantee that they can still cope with changed climate tomorrow .
Thus if they fail we had better have some forgotten varieties , originally planted in warmer or colder climate , that can be used to breed new varieties and continue to provide us with food , clothes and all the great things .
Haoyang , Midlands Biodiversity is not an end in itself .
In principle the maintenance of the widest possible genetic pool of food crops is important - but not simply as an ideal .
The reason why , for example , we now rely on about ten basic staples for the majority of our essential food supplies ( e.g. wheat , maize , soya , rice , potatoes , vegetables , fruit , beef , pork , lamb ) is because these have proved reliable and capable of ' improvement ' in terms of their capacity to offer greater yields over time .
The aims of productivity and biodiversity are not mutually exclusive , but please do n't confuse the need to preserve ancient plant varieties with the ability to feed the world .
Robin Limb , Peterborough Chris C has missed the point slightly .
By preserving genetic diversity we are preserving species that may turn out to be more nutritious , better tasting , more resistant to pests or environmental insults that we have n't worried about yet .
The criteria that define " superior " can and do change depending on current needs and market pressures .
If we preserve the diversity , the gene pool is there for us to fall back on when we encounter new problems .
Nicola K , Cambridge , UK Biodiversity is very important for all food crops , by only growing limited numbers of species could lead to uncontrollable pest and diseases taking hold .
In nature biodiversity there is a balance so pest and disease make very little difference .
Also by limiting the choose of food crop species it may affect our health .
jean , birchington Dr. Bentley 's last sentence really says it all - we have a remarkable self - interest in maintaining a broad base of diversity to support our food systems .
Resilient systems are always diverse , decentralized , and multi-functional in nature , and it's absurd to try to base the most fundamental of human needs on a monoculture system for converting oil into food .
The BBC 's last question " Or is greater efficiency and higher yields the only way to feed a growing population ? " is misleading , being clearly written by someone unfamiliar with the fact that smaller , diversified farms following organic practices actually produce more food per acre and per input of energy than massively mechanized monocrop plantations .
The only way that megafarms compete in " efficiency " is on a dollar per calorie basis , and even then only when they 're awash in government subsidy payments and cheap oil .
Of course , this is exactly how Monsanto , Cargill , ADM , and their ilk make such enormous profits , which they then use to promote such ideas as " efficiency " and " higher yields " through patented seeds , genetic engineering , and chemicals .
Chris C from SLC seems unfamiliar with the nature of agricultural plant varieties .
The only reason these varieties exist with such diversity is precisely because of human cultivation of them .
Domesticated plants do not exist in the wild - having been selected and bred for generations to promote specific traits , and they will not survive any length of time without human intervention to plow the fields and combat weeds and pests .
Steve Morgan , Boulder , CO USA
This seems like an overblown issue .
For one , if some of these crop varieties , such as O. glaberrima , are superior for a certain climate , would they not naturally outlast their alternatives in such regions anyway ?
It wo n't be mankind 's cultivation that continues their existence .
Furthermore , mankind has been genetically engineering crop species through artificial selection since agriculture has existed ?
If there is a lack of diversity , it is because mankind has settled on a very productive variety of crop , that makes the others simply not worth cultivating .
I was expecting a far more compelling argument for crop diversity , like natural resistance to certain diseases ( banana blight , etc. ) , not just diversity for diversity sake .
Chris C , Salt Lake City , USA
Yes I agree .
The chemical companies and the intensive farming industry are trying to pull the wool over our eyes .
Their methods are all about their quick profit at any expense including the health of the population and the environment including our flora and forna .
We do n't need ' cheap ' food we need good food .
Alexis Wolfe , Harlech , Cymru
At last , supporting evidence that increased biodiversity is more than just a " nice idea " , now if we can just get buy - in from the supermarkets , we may be able to reverse the trend towards monoculture .
What 's nice is that it demonstrates there 's a market for crop diversity .
I 'm not against supermarkets per se , it 's just that I believe they offer a more restricted choice for the consumer , this could be their opportunity to prove me wrong

While I was waiting to watch Panasonic 's 3DHD demonstration earlier this week , I overheard what was surely the strangest conversation I 'd ever eavesdropped at CES .
Advertisement
You see , while I thought that I 'd arrived at the right spot for the 3DHD demo , I 'd really been waiting in a sort of backstage area , where engineers , CEOs and Titanic producer Jon Landau were gearing up to pitch me and 30 other members of the press about their low power 3D plasmas .
Advertisement
I thought it was strange enough to see Panasonic corporate types posing with Landau 's Oscar that he'd brought out for the occasion , handing off their cellphones to grab proud shots with the statue .
Then a man in a gray suit and glasses walked up to one of the engineers standing to the side .
He had an aura of overconfidence .
" Do you handle demonstrations of the 3DHD display technology , " he asked the Panasonic engineer .
" Yes , " the engineer responded after a moment .
" And you have prototypes in the US ? "
" Yes , why ? " asked the engineer , growing a bit uncomfortable at the man 's forward nature .

The suited man paused for an intentional beat .
" I'm with the CIA , and we 'd like to include your product in a presentation at the White House for the President . "
This was said nonchalantly , in that way people present grand pieces of information in a euphemistic tone meant to draw the listener in .
Advertisement
But it backfired when applied to the Japanese engineer whose English was n't so fluent .
So the engineer 's following " what ? " was n't one of " holy cow , how is this possible ? " but more just an earnest " what are you talking about ? "
" The President of the United States , " the CIA guy repeated , this time using full ceremonial emphasis .
Advertisement
" Uhhh ... " the engineer responded nervously , completely confused now as to what was going on .
" I 'm with the CIA .
We 're giving a presentation in two months to the President on eco technologies that will reduce our nation 's dependence on oil .
You know , oil ? "

" ...OK . "
We 'd like to include your display if you have one available in the States . "
" ...OK . "
" Can I take a look ? " Mr. CIA asked , motioning to the demo room .
" ...OK . "
And with that , another international technological concordance was made .

The era of cheap energy is over and will never return as Britain pays the price of turning into a low - carbon economy , the former chairman of the Environment Agency has warned .
Sir John Harman accuses politicians of failing to be honest with people about the costs of developing and delivering new forms of clean energy .
And he calls for measures to combat fuel poverty , through price controls , subsidies or higher state benefits to prevent the creation of a new class of low - carbon poor .
In a hard - hitting Fabian Society pamphlet to be published this month , Sir John accuses politicians of failing to match their rhetoric on green issues with action , saying they are " badly out of touch with the reality " .
In The Green Crunch , he writes : " It is extremely unlikely that we will ever get back to the retail energy prices of the past 15 years or so .
Yet I do not think that this fact is being squarely presented to the electorate nor would it be an obvious vote - winner to do so .

" We need to acknowledge that there is , in a civilised society , a right to expect affordable access to warmth , light , and the other benefits which energy delivers and that this can only be protected as prices rise by intervention , either in the energy markets or through the welfare system . "
He points to Gordon Brown 's reluctance to bring in the green taxes he promised as Chancellor in 1997 .
But he argues that Labour can learn lessons from Barack Obama 's victory in a " gas- addicted " United States and is the natural party to meet the environmental challenge .
Sir John , a former Labour council leader who chaired the Environment Agency for eight years until last summer , urges politicians to be more honest with people about the threat from climate change , saying that the environment should be regarded as just as important as economic and social issues .
His call comes as green groups fear the environment is falling down the politicians ' list of priorities because of the recession .
( CNN ) --
Two rescued motorists were " absolutely horrified , " after a wall of icy water trapped them and several others in suburban Washington on Tuesday morning .
Motorists climb into a rescue basket lowered by a helicopter .

A woman trapped in a black SUV scrawled her husband 's phone number on a piece of paper and flashed it to rescuers and reporters in the hopes that one of them would contact her husband .
Sarah Lee , a reporter with CNN affiliate WJLA - TV , called to assure the woman 's husband that " several highly skilled swift water rescue personnel " were working to save his wife .
The woman and another passenger in the car were placed in a rescue boat , but were " absolutely horrified , gripping onto the railings in the boat for their safety , " said Lee .
A massive water main break in Cabin John , Maryland , near the communities of Potomac and Bethesda , unleashed the flood during rush - hour Tuesday morning .
The water main , 66 inches in diameter , unleashed the wall of water just before 8 a.m. that , at its height , was four feet high and 60 to 70 feet wide , Montgomery County police said .
" I knew that the cars were unstable just by the amount of water that was rushing by , " said Jim MacKay , a Maryland State Police civilian helicopter pilot who flew to the scene from Andrews Air Force Base .
MacKay , maneuvered his helicopter around tree limbs and power lines to hoist people to safety .
The water 's temperature made the situation even more dire , according to MacKay .
Temperatures in the area dropped to nearly 18 degrees .
" The water had gotten into the car , so these people were at risk of hypothermia , " he said .
" They were soaking wet . "
Emergency crews rescued nine people , including one child , spokesman Pete Piringer of the Montgomery County Fire Department told CNN .
Several others escaped on their own .
Everyone was rescued by about 11 a.m .
Of the five people hurt , none had life - threatening injuries , but several endured harrowing moments of uncertainty .
" Water was going over my car , and I was actually scared that water will draw us away somewhere because it was very strong water , " Maria Stosse told CNN affiliate WJLA .
" All of a sudden just a gush of water came along with boulders and parts of trees , " a woman told reporters .
" I tried to turn to get out of it [ but ] I could n't .
My car just got blocked in . "
Dramatic rescues by firefighters and emergency crews were broadcast nationwide on live television .

A helicopter crew maneuvered a dangling metal basket to the passenger door of one vehicle where a child and one more person climbed in and were whisked to safety .
The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission was working Tuesday afternoon to isolate the break .
A commission source told CNN that the valve at the source of the break was under water .
As a result , workers were trying to turn off the water at a different point in the line .
Once the water is turned off , crews will need another four hours to repressurize the county 's water system , the commission said .

The Japanese tea ceremony is called Chanoyu , Sado or simply Ocha in Japanese .
It is a choreographic ritual of preparing and serving Japanese green tea , called Matcha , together with traditional Japanese sweets to balance with the bitter taste of the tea .
Preparing tea in this ceremony means pouring all one 's attention into the predefined movements .
The whole process is not about drinking tea , but is about aesthetics , preparing a bowl of tea from one 's heart .
The host of the ceremony always considers the guests with every movement and gesture .
Even the placement of the tea utensils is considered from the guests view point ( angle ) , especially the main guests called the Shokyaku .
What is the Japanese Tea Ceremony ?
The Japanese tea ceremony is an artistic pastime unique to Japan that features the serving and drinking of Matcha , a powdered Japanese green tea .
Though Japanese green - tea had been introduced to Japan from China around the 8th century , Matcha powdered green - tea did not reach Japan until the end of the 12th century .
The practice of holding social gatherings to drink Matcha spread among the upper class from about the 14th century .
Gradually one of the main purposes of these gatherings , which took place in a Shoin ( study room ) , became the appreciation of Chinese paintings and crafts in a serene atmosphere .
( See Japanese tea ceremony history )
Having witnessed or taken part in the Japanese Tea Ceremony only once , one will come to understand that in Japan , serving tea is an art and a spiritual discipline .
As an art , The Tea Ceremony is an occasion to appreciate the simplicity of the tea room ’s design , the feel of the Chawan in the hand , the company of friends , and simply a moment of purity .
As a discipline , aesthetic contemplation of flower arranging , ceramics , calligraphy , and the roots of the Tea Ceremony which go all the way back to the twelfth century is required .
The ritual preparation requires the person hosting a tea party to know how to cook a special meal ( Kaiseki ) , how to arrange the flowers which will be placed in the alcove ( Tokonoma ) .
When choosing utensils and other vessels , the host ( Teishu ) has to consider the rank and type to make sure that they will stand out .

Objective of the Japanese Tea Ceremony
The objective of the Japanese tea ceremony is to create a relaxed communication between the host and his guests .
It is based in part on the etiquette of serving tea ( Temae ) , but is also includes the intimate connections with architecture , landscape gardening , unique tea utensils , paintings , flower arrangement , ceramics , calligraphy , Zen Buddhism , and all the other elements that coexist in harmonious relationship with the ceremony .
Its ultimate aim is the attainment of deep spiritual satisfaction through the drinking of tea and through silent contemplation .
On a different level , the Japanese tea ceremony is simply an entertainment where the guests are invited to drink tea in a pleasant and relaxing room .
The bonds of friendship between the host and guests are strengthened during the ceremony when the host himself makes and serves the tea .
Theories on the Japanese Tea Ceremony
The Way of Tea
Outside of Japan , the preparation of powdered Japanese green tea is known as “ The Japanese Tea Ceremony ” .
The Japanese refer to it as “ Chanoyu ” which can be translated literally as “ hot water for tea ” , Chado or Sado translates to " the way of tea " as in devoting one 's time totally to the study and practice of the Japanese tea ceremony .
The western understanding of " a ceremony " is a set of formal acts , often fixed and traditional , performed on important social or religious occasions .
However , rather than fixed , the Japanese Tea Ceremony does have flexibility since every occasion and different season calls for special and unique preparations , choice of utensils , choice of flowers for arrangement , a hanging scroll to describe the kind of tea-meeting and objective of the host .
And rather than religious it could be better explained that the host will do the best he can by studying all related aspects such as calligraphy , flower arrangement , cooking , the wearing of a kimono , ceramics and much more .
Therefore , it would be more appropriate to call it “ The Way of Tea ” since this would refer to a way of life , or a life style in devotion of preparing the best possible bowl of powdered green tea for the guests .
The Way of Tea is a subtly variable way to commune with nature and with friends .
Deeply rooted in Chinese Zen philosophy , it is a way to remove oneself from the mundane affairs of day - to - day living and to achieve , if only for a time , serenity and inner peace .
Tea Philosophy
Wa , Kei , Sei , Jaku - “ harmony , respect , purity , tranquility . ”
“ Wa ” stands for harmony .
As there is harmony in nature , the Teishu will try to bring this quality into the tea room and the garden around the tea house .
The utensils used during the tea ceremony are in harmony with each other , so the theme is the same as well as the colors .
The tea garden should be an extension of the natural flora surrounding it .
“ Kei ” stands for respect .
The guests must respect all things , all matters without involving their status or position in life .
They must crawl trough a small entrance called Nijiriguchi to get into the room .
In the room they will all kneel down and bow to the hanging scroll , they will sit next to each other in Seiza position on the Tatami .
Respect is also shown by carefully handling and observing the tea bowl and other objects during Haiken .
“ Sei ” stands for purity .
Crawling into the tea room , one is to leave behind all thoughts and worries of daily life .
The tea room or Chashitsu is a different world where one can re-vitalize , slow down , and enjoy the presence of friends .
The gesture of purity is enhanced by the ritual cleaning of the Chawan , Natsume , Chashaku , and Kensui lit by the host .
The real grand master of tea does not perform the Japanese tea ceremony from memory but from a pure heart .
“ Jaku ” stands for tranquility .
Only after the first three concepts ( harmony , respect , and purity ) are discovered , experienced and embraced , can people finally embody tranquility .
This was one of the teachings of the Japanese tea ceremony master Sen no Rikyu ( 1522 – 1591 ) .
Wabi -
“ Appreciating the beauty of things that are simple and natural , ” the old meaning is “ the loneliness of living in nature , remote from society . ”
The tea room ’s interior will seem imperfect and rustic .
The wall might be unpainted and visible wooden pillars and beams are untreated , just as it would look like in nature .
Contrary to western houses , the tea house is not a small museum with lots of collectibles , there is only the essential needed for a unique meeting with the Teishu or host .
There is only one hanging scroll in the alcove of the Chashitsu , there is no furniture or maybe a simple Tana to display tea equipment .
The only sound is that of boiling water in the Kama , only the smell of incense from the fire , one flower or branch in the Hana-ire .
Conversation is kept to that of the utensils in the tea room , and other equipment used .
Kokoroire – “ Pouring one ’s heart totally into ( devotion of ) the tea ceremony . ”
The Teishu or host , is someone who devotes his life to the ritual preparation of a bowl of tea .
They live “ the way of tea . ”

New Compact Turbine Could Triple Wind Power Output
December 1st , 2008 by Alex Felsinger
Normally wind turbines lose up to 39.7 percent of potential energy because wind not only flows through the blades , but is also directed away from the turbine .
The new FloDesign Wind Turbine takes cues from jet engine designs in order to minimize this wasted energy .[ social_buttons ]
The company has enshrouded the moving blades with a set of stationary blades that propel the wind towards the rotor .
The idea is not new , but previous designs have needed to constantly be aligned with the direction of the wind .
The FloDesign turbine can automatically align to the wind direction and has been tested to be effective from up to 20 degrees away .
Conventional turbine design requires gigantic , slow - moving blades in order to compensate for the energy lost as the wind is directed around the device .
FloDesign claims their new turbine can generate as much energy as a typical turbine twice its size .
Using these smaller turbines , wind farms could double or triple their efficiency simply by adding more turbines .
The new technology could also finally silence critics of wind farms who say they are a cosmetic blight on landscapes and ocean views .
Check out this video FloDesign has produced to explain the technology in detail , complete with hip soundtrack .

Attention , neurotic Woody Allen types : you really ought to get out more .
That ’s the latest news from researchers exploring whether people with certain personality traits are more likely than others to develop dementia .
Past studies consistently have shown that worriers - who get stressed easily and are prone to anxiety and depression - are more likely to develop dementia later in life .
Now a new report from Sweden suggests that neurotics can shape their destiny to some extent , because lifestyle also plays a role .
The study appeared on Tuesday in the journal Neurology .
Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm followed a group of 506 people ages 78 and older who had no dementia at the beginning of the study .
The subjects completed a personality questionnaire and were interviewed about their lifestyles , and then were monitored for several years , with medical exams at three years and again at six years .
After six years , 144 adults in the group had developed dementia .
The researchers analyzed the accumulated data for possible associations between cognitive function , neuroticism and other characteristics , as well as lifestyle factors .
The Tory leader was speaking at the launch of a new campaign featuring a hard - hitting poster .
It features a photograph of a baby and the slogan : “ Dad ’s nose , mum ’s eyes , Gordon Brown ’s debt – Labour debt crisis : Every child in Britain is born owing £ 17,000 .
They deserve better . ”
The poster - which features the child of two Tory supporters - will be shown at 260 billboard sites across the country .
Mr Cameron said that with national debt set to top £ 1 trillion , interest alone amounted to more than was spent on education .
He said : “ I think it is an extremely powerful , important and responsible message that we are quite right to get across .
“ Labour are getting it wrong .
It ’s easy for politicians to talk about tax rates and borrowing as if there was no tomorrow , but there is a tomorrow and it is going to be paid for by our children .
Alan Kay is one of my computing heroes .
All this stuff we do every day as programmers ?
Kay had a hand in inventing a huge swath of it :
Computer scientist Kay was the leader of the group that invented object - oriented programming , the graphical user interface , 3D computer graphics , and ARPANET , the predecessor of the Internet
So as you might imagine , I was pretty thrilled to see he was dabbling a little in Stack Overflow .
It 's difficult to fathom the participation of a legend like Alan in a site for regular programmers .
Maybe we should add a Turing Award badge .
At least people can't complain that it is unobtainable .
Jeff Moser , an avid Stack Overflow user with a an outstanding blog of his own , had the opportunity to meet Alan recently and ask him about it .
Jeff gave me permission to reprint his field report here .
Since I knew I 'd be seeing Alan Kay at Rebooting Computing , I decided to verify his Stack Overflow usage in person .
According to Alan , he found the original question using an automated search alert just like Atwood had guessed .
We then proceeded to discuss how it 's sad that identity is still hard online .
For example , it 's hard to prove if I 'm telling the truth here .
As for that , the best I can offer is to look at my picture on my blog and compare with this picture from the Summit : ( Alan is on my right )
Alan is a great person to talk to because of his huge experience in the computing field .
He 's currently working at the Viewpoints Research Institute where they 're doing some classic PARC style research of trying to do for software what Moore 's Law did for hardware .
A decent explanation by Alan Kay himself is available here ( wmv ) .
For specifics , you might want to check out the recent PhD thesis of Alessandro Warth , one of Alan 's students .
One of the greatest lessons I 've personally learned from Alan is just how important computing history is in order to understand the context of inventions .
One of Alan 's greatest heroes is J.C.R. Licklider ( a.k.a. " Lick " ) .
Our discussions a few months ago led me to read " The Dream Machine " and write a post about it .
A consequence of studying history well is that you 'll notice that a ton of the really cool and interesting stuff was developed in the ARPA -> PARC days and it 's slowed down since .
I 'd assume that 's why he 's curious about anything post - PARC 's peak days ( e.g. 1980 + ) .
I 'd say that Alan firmly believes that the " Computer Revolution Has n't Happened Yet " ( still ) even though he 's been talking about it for decades .
For example : see his ' 97 talk at OOPSLA .
and this video from last month at the 40 Year Anniversary of Engelbart 's " Mother of all Demos " .
Speculating from discussions , I 'd say that the problem he sees is that computers should help us become better thinkers rather than " distracting / entertaining ourselves to death . "
Alan likes to use the example that our " pop culture " is more concerned with " air guitar " and " Guitar Hero " rather than appreciating genuine beauty and expressiveness of real instruments ( even though it takes a bit longer to master ) .
Check out 1:03:40 of this video from program for the Future .
In effect , we 're selling our potential short .
I think that 's my biggest take away from Alan about computing : computers can do so much more than we 're using them for now ( e.g. provide " a teacher for every learner " ) .
Hope this helps provide some context .
Indeed it does , Jeff .
If you 'd like to get a sense of what Alan is about and the things he 's working on , I recommend this Conversation with Alan Kay from the ACM .
It 's not that people are completely stupid , but if there 's a big idea and you have deadlines and you have expedience and you have competitors , very likely what you 'll do is take a low - pass filter on that idea and implement one part of it and miss what has to be done next .
This happens over and over again .
If you 're using early - binding languages as most people do , rather than late - binding languages , then you really start getting locked in to stuff that you 've already done .
You can't reformulate things that easily .
Let 's say the adoption of programming languages has very often been somewhat accidental , and the emphasis has very often been on how easy it is to implement the programming language rather than on its actual merits and features .
For instance , Basic would never have surfaced because there was always a language better than Basic for that purpose .
That language was Joss , which predated Basic and was beautiful .
But Basic happened to be on a GE timesharing system that was done by Dartmouth , and when GE decided to franchise that , it started spreading Basic around just because it was there , not because it had any intrinsic merits whatsoever .
This happens over and over again .
The languages of Niklaus Wirth have spread wildly and widely because he has been one of the most conscientious documenters of languages and one of the earlier ones to do algorithmic languages using p-codes ( pseudocodes ) -- the same kinds of things that we use .
The idea of using those things has a common origin in the hardware of a machine called the Burroughs B5000 from the early 1960s , which the establishment hated .
Any similarity between the above and PHP is , I 'm sure , completely coincidental .
That sound you 're hearing is just a little bit of history repeating .
To me , the quintessential Alan Kay presentation is Doing with Images Makes Symbols : Communicating With Computers .
As the video illustrates , computers are almost secondary to most of Alan 's work ; that 's the true brilliance of it .
The real goal is teaching and learning .
I 'm reminded of a comment Andrew Stuart , a veteran software development recruiter , once sent me in email :
One subtle but interesting observation that I would make - your article points out that " what software developers do best is learn " - this is close to the mark , though I would rearrange the words slightly to " what the best software developers do is learn . "
Not all software developers learn , but the best ones certainly do .
And this , I think , lies at the heart of everything Alan does -- computing not as an end in itself , but as a vehicle for learning how to learn .
Well I ’ve been hacking around for the past few months trying to get my head around Erlang .
After playing around with Twitterl I decided I should start a new project ( OTP based ) which I have a decent understanding of & have wanted to work on for some time .
A chat system was the first thing that came to mind , I ’ve worked on and built a few in my time and thought Erlang would be a good language to build a chat engine from scratch .
For those not interested in the long description and prefer to dive in source , you can find a copy of the project at github .
Description
A chat system that can be housed over a number of nodes and track clients over varying devices , at the time of the writing the system works over multiple nodes and is able to do the basics ( connect to a group , send message to other clients and connected groups ) .
The main focus of this project is to create a chat system that is highly reliable as well as scaleable .
Other developers will be able to create add - on modules that are able to interact with chatterl and further enhance the functionality of chatterl and the chatterl clients experience .
As mentioned the system is OTP based , of which it uses Sinan to maintain its builds .
Installing Chatterl
At the moment of this writing Chatterl is still in alpha so their is no real release at the moment , to get it running you will need to do the following :
git -clone git://github.com/baphled/chatterl.git
&& cd chatterl && sinan doc && sinan dist && cd _/ build / development / tar && sudo faxien install - release chatterl - 0.1.0.2.tar.gz
The above presumes that you have Sinan configured & installed , if you have n’t refer to erlware .
You will need to change to cookie & name values to something else , doing so should drop you into the erlang shell & ready to run the Chatterl application .
To run a client on a different machine you will need to do the above if ( making sure that the - sname is not the same as any other connected nodes & that the cookie is the same ) if connecting on the same box simply cd to the ebin directory and run the following command :
erl - name bar - setcookie abc
From here you will need to make sure that they nodes can connect via :
net_adm:ping(foo@bar.net ) .
Where foo is the node name & bar .
net is the tld of the node box ( indicated within yout hosts file or dns server ) .
Once you receive the infamous pong response you are ready to roll .
Features
Client login / logout to Chatterl .
List Chatterl groups .
List Chatterl users .
Login / logout of a chatterl group .
Send message to a group and other clients .
Future Features
Centralised Error logging and data storage .
Client customisable routines ( able to poll RSS feeds , twitter , FB and the such like ) .
Better handling of errors .
User registration .
FB Connect .
Chat bots ( AIML based ) .
Web interface / API .
Chat modules handler ( banning , censorship , chatbots ) .
Useage
Starting the server
Chatterl server runs as an OTP application and uses a supervisor to manage it ( in later versions there will be options to spawn multiple servers , allowing for a more fault tolerant chat system ) .
To start up the server you simply need to run the following command :
application : start ( chatterl ) .
Which will initialise the server allowing clients to connect and groups to be created .
Groups can be created on differing nodes as long as the node can communicate with the chatterl_serv .
Starting a group
Chatterl groups can be started on any node that can communicate with the server , this allows the user to create a number of groups on varying nodes , helping with general organisation as well a performance and reliablity .
A group can be initialised by calling the command :
chatterl_serv:create( " room " , " description " ) .
which will spawn a group process which users can connect to .
Connection to chatterl
At the time of this writing chatterl_clients can only spawn a client per node , this will later be changed once the web interface has been fully implemented , possibly to a refactoring the client to a parameterised module .
For the moment node users must follow the basic OTP configurations ( same cookie , valid DNS name , etc ) .
Creating a connection to the server is done by using the following command .
chatter_client:start( UserName ) .
This will initialise a user and connect them to chatterl_serv ( must be done before users can join a group or communicate with other chatterl users ) .
Disconnecting from chatterl
Chatterl clients can simply disconnect from chatterl by issuing the following command :
chatterl_client:stop ( ) .
This will disconnect the user from all the groups they are currently connected to as well as the actual Chatterl server .
Joining a group
This can be done by using the following command :
chatterl_client:join( GroupName ) .
If the group exists the user is able to join the group allowing them to send message to the room .
Dropping from a group
This is as simple as connection , simply supply the following command :
chatterl_client:drop( GroupName ) .
This will send a message to the group , which will handle the termination .
Sending group message
chatterl_client:send_msg( GroupName , Message ) .
GroupName being the name of the group the client is connected to , Message being the message that you want to send to the receiving client .
If the message is sent successfully all users connected to the group will receive the message .
Sending a private message
This allows a Chatterl client to send a private message to another client , by executing the following :
chatterl_client:private_msg(RecipientName , Message ) .
If the message is sent successfully then the sender will receive follow message :
{ok , msg_sent}
in turn sending the message to the receipients node .
US weapons 'n 'rockets company Alliant Techsystems ( ATK ) has won a small military contract related to a planned underwater robot .
The Unmanned Underwater Riverine Craft ( UURC ) will carry out " clandestine surveillance tasks in riverine and shallow water environments " using " bottom locomotion ( crawling ) " mode and " burrowing " abilities .
The ATK contract award for $ 494,254 was announced yesterday , but details on the UURC project can be found in here .
It would seem that America 's enemies had best keep a close eye on their rivers and estuaries , which will soon be literally crawling with partly - submerged lurkerbots :
There is an operational need to carry out clandestine surveillance tasks in riverine and shallow water environments [ within ] denied , sensitive or contested areas .
For these , a UURC is needed with capabilities to : navigate submerged in rivers , inlets , and harbors as well as in coastal and shallow water areas ; provide persistence in these areas and , provide underwater surveillance ( against waterborne traffic , underwater obstacles , bottom and buried objects , specific vessels of interest ) with onboard and deployable sensors under low visibility conditions .
It wo n't be simple to catch the mud-crawling bottom - creeper machines : they will twist and turn , burrow into the muck or perhaps even eject an inky cloud like a startled squid .
The UURC will :
Be capable of autonomous operation and evasion procedures underwater ( maneuver , burrowing , use of obscurants , hibernation mode ) ...
The slithering aquadroids will be able to pop up infrared nightsight periscopes , and will of course include sonar and acoustic sensors .
They will also , seemingly , feature " new methods of sensing including ... touch " and be able to drop off or otherwise deploy " listening devices , tagging devices and other packages " .
Normally such a droid , unable to use conventional engines , would be sharply limited by battery endurance .
But the UURC will also have " the ability to regenerate or harvest power for sustained endurance operation or to be able to enter a ' sleep ' mode for sustained periods " .
One need hardly add that the UURC is being promoted by the famous wingnut - boffins of DARPA , where tomorrow 's world is yesterday 's news and the only place to keep your brain is in a bubbling jar remotely linked to a huge , powerful robot or brainchipped - gorilla body .
The UURC is to be deployable by " subsurface launch " , which could see it setting out to reconnoitre enemy rivers from DARPA 's planned flying submarine : or alternatively from relatively humdrum nuclear - powered Stingray - esque submarine motherships crammed with cruise missiles and elite frogman - commando throatcutters .
Or more likely , of course , as with most DARPA projects it will never come into use .
But the Pentagon brainiacs have so many wacky projects that now and then one is sure to pay off . ®

I suppose the underlying question here is whether George W Bush has been one of the worst US presidents .
Many people have already made up their minds .
For them , the invasion of Iraq was enough to put Mr Bush high on the list .
And that was compounded by his lack of action elsewhere - with global warming and Hurricane Katrina as examples .
Others will want to wait a bit and see what history decides .
History can improve the image of a presidency .
Follow Bush 's downward slide Harry Truman is the great example .
His approval rating dipped even lower than Mr Bush 's ( though Mr Bush has registered a higher disapproval rating - a discrepancy due to a decline in the number of " do n't knows " ) .
The Truman years were full of epic events , from the dropping of the first atomic bomb , to the start of the Cold War , to the actual Korean War , to his dismissal of the popular Gen Douglas MacArthur .
The Chicago Tribune called for Truman to be impeached .
He appeared at times to be overwhelmed and he went down , but history has brought him up again and he is now generally seen as a gutsy president who took the right decisions .
Mr Bush is hoping for a similar vindication .
In the meantime , here are some of the candidates in the race for the bottom , in chronological order .
1 . James Buchanan ( President 1857 - 1861 ) Buchanan failed to head off the Civil War .
His position was weak , arguing on the one hand that the South should not secede and on the other that the North should not use force .
It led to inaction and vacillation .
Maybe he could not have succeeded , but he was not even seen to try .
2 . Andrew Johnson ( President 1865 - 1869 )
In the aftermath of the Civil War , Johnson had a policy of punishing the Confederate leaders but letting off their followers .
However , he is reckoned to have given too many concessions to the South , thereby laying the groundwork for the racial problems the United States subsequently experienced .
He and Bill Clinton are the only two presidents to have been impeached .
In Johnson 's case it was over the power of presidents to dismiss cabinet members .
Both were acquitted .
3 . Warren Harding ( President 1921 - 1923 )
Harding was mired in scandal , because he appointed incompetent and corrupt cronies .
His secretary of the interior , Albert Fall , was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for handing out oil leases on publicly - owned land and went to prison .
Harding said he had less trouble from his political enemies than from his friends .
4 . Herbert Hoover ( President 1929 - 1933 )
Hoover had done magnificent work during World War I , getting food into starving Belgium and later into a defeated Germany and even the Soviet Union .
But his failure to combat the great depression when he became president led to his downfall - and to the interventionist approach of Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
5 . Richard Nixon ( President 1969 - 1974 )
The only president to have resigned the office has to be on the list .
His offence was obstruction of justice , arising from his attempt to cover up the Watergate break - in .
He left office in disgrace .
There is also another way of looking at presidential reputations .
This is to look at specific decisions they have taken .
On this list appear some presidents whose historical place is otherwise strong .
In 2006 , historians gathered by the University of Louisville listed the " top 10 presidential errors " .
They were : 1 . James Buchanan 's failure to stop the Civil War .
2 . Andrew Johnson 's decision to favour Southern whites after the Civil War .
3 . Lyndon Johnson 's escalation of the Vietnam War .
4 . Woodrow Wilson 's inability to get the United States into the League of Nations after the First World War .
5 . Richard Nixon 's role in the Watergate cover -up .
6 . James Madison 's war with Britain in 1812 .
7 . Thomas Jefferson 's embargo on trade with Europe during the Napoleonic Wars .
8 . John Kennedy 's attempt to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.
9 . Ronald Reagan 's sale of arms to Iran in the Iran - Contra scandal .
10 . Bill Clinton 's relationship with Monica Lewinsky .
Will George Bush 's invasion of Iraq get on to a similar list in 20 or 50 years ' time ?
A British historian of American politics , Professor John Philip Davies of de Montfort University , says : " George Bush 's problem is that he has n't had many successes and he has made mistakes .
Iraq and Afghanistan have not come out well and his hopes of becoming another Harry Truman must be in doubt . "
I think time will be a great help to Bush Jr - his handling of Sept 11 was superb , he helped bring the economy back after the attacks
Kathy , Caledonia , MI , USA
How do you rate George W Bush ?
Every failing president looks to Truman , he notes .
Gerald Ford moved a bust of him into the White House .
In Professor Davies ' view , Warren Harding was " one of the worst " .
" He chose genuinely seedy characters for his cabinet and was deeply gullible .
He looked the part , like an emperor whose face should be on coins , but he was dreadful at choosing his team , " he says .
He also notes that Truman is not the only former president whose stock has risen over time .
" Richard Nixon is undergoing something of a rehabilitation in terms of policy - his opening to China , for example , and his decision to end the Vietnam War , " he says .
" Jimmy Carter was seen as weak at the time but has been an excellent former president .
" Eisenhower is now seen by some as less of a ' do - nothing ' president than a ' hidden hand ' , thanks to a favourable biography , which all presidents need .
" History can move a president up or down the table but I think its judgment is not hugely different from that of contemporaries . "

It took the director more than a year to raise the film 's relatively meagre $ 6 million budget ; he shot it last winter in 35 days .
But the result has already won the Golden Lion in Venice .
And it will almost certainly secure Rourke an Oscar nomination ( to go with his Golden Globe nod ) for a soul - baring performance as an ageing fighter on the ropes .
» W hy does your cat wash your hair or face ?
The first thing a kitten experiences , even before it can see , is its mother licking and washing .
Grooming is a demonstration of love and caring .
So , if your cat occasionally washes your hair or licks your face , he is showing you his acceptance and caring of you as a fellow feline .
» W hy does a cat " knead " or " make biscuits " ?
When a kitten is nursing , it typically kneads its paws against its mother , either as a sign of contentment or to encourage the milk flow .
When the cat matures , it kneads to show its contentment and pleasure .
» W hy does a cat go to the visitor who does n't like cats ?
When one cat is threatening another , it stares boldly , sometimes hisses , and frequently moves in toward the other cat .
Usually , the person who does n't like cats avoids looking at it , does n't talk to it , and sits quietly , hoping to be ignored by the cat .
The cat , therefore , sees the person 's behavior as " cat- friendly " and practically inviting .
» W hy does your cat push its head against you ?
This is called " head butts " .
This is a cat 's way of showing affection .
Some cats will turn their head , and push it against a human ( or another cat ) .
» W hy does a cat do a stiff - legged hop / touch against a human ?
That is the cat 's body language of saying , " hey , hi there , how ya doin ' ? "
» W hy does your cat rub up against you ?
Cats have scent glands along the tail , on each side of their head , on their lips , base of their tail , chin , near their sex organs , and between their front paws .
They use these glands to scent mark their territory .
When the cat rubs you , he is marking you with his scent , claiming you as " his . "
Too , he is picking up your scent .
Cats rub up against furniture or doorways for the same reason - to mark the item as " his " .
( Urine spraying is also a territorial marking , by the way . )
» W hy does a cat sometimes wash its fur immediately after being petted ?
There are two theories on this behavior .
One theory proposes that the cat is getting rid of the human smell .
The other is that the cat is furthering the pleasure of his association with you by tasting your scent .
» W hy do some cats suck wool or clothing ?
There are a couple of theories on this :
The cat was weaned too early and the scent of the lanolin reminds the cat of his mother , or
The cat has a lack of fiber in his diet .
» W hy does a cat walk sloooowly , looking straight forward when passing another cat ?
All cats are territorial to an extent - the range of a particular inside cat may extend from a small space in a room to the entire house , depending on their hierarchical ranking in the family .
When a " superior " cat confronts on " inferior " in the hierarchy , it will stare at and / or move in for a face - to - face confrontation .
When a cat wants to show that it does n't want to get into an argument , it will make a wide , slow path around the other cat , usually avoiding even looking at it .
» W hy does a cat use a litterbox ?
In feral cat colonies , subordinate cats cover their waste , while dominant ferals leave it conspicuously uncovered .
Most indoor cats bury their waste , possibly to display subordination to their humans .
Sometimes in multi-cat households , however , the dominant cat will leave waste uncovered to indicate his status .
» W hy does a cat scratch outside the litterbox , instead of inside it ?
The cat has probably had several unpleasant experiences of getting his feet soggy or dirty - make sure the litterbox is cleaned out frequently .
» W hy does a cat purr ?
Usually , a cat purrs because it is content .
A mother cat purrs to let her kittens know she is nearby , and kittens purr in response to their mother 's grooming .
Older kittens purr to entice adults to play .
Some adults will purr to show an aggressor that they are non-threatening .
Take note , however , that some cats will purr when frightened or in pain .
» W hy does a cat sometimes scratch the floor as though he is trying to bury his food dish ?
It may be a holdover of the wild trait of burying food for later .
Or , it may be that he is trying to tell you that the food is not to his liking .
» W hy does a cat attack human 's ankles ?
Kitten play always involves mock battles , with surprise attacks , pounces , and leaps .
The kitty is basically trying to play , as he would with another cat .
Direct him to less painful game play - chasing balls , cords , and so on .
» W hy are some people allergic to cats ' fur ?
It 's not the cat 's fur that causes allergies .
It 's a protein ( FEL D1 ) in the cat 's saliva .
When a cat grooms itself , it deposits this protein on its fur ( and the protein then may be transferred to upholstery and carpets ) .
Some cats have less ( or more ) of this protein .
There is no way to predict which cat in a litter , if any , will be less allergenic , though females seem to be the lesser allergenic .
Bathing a cat to reduce the amount of protein in the cat 's fur has traditionally been recommended , but research may be tending to negate that conclusion .
Instead , wiping down the cat using a damp microfiber cloth to remove visible dander may be more effective .
I 've also been told that a product called Allerpet , rubbed into the cat 's fur , can help reduce the dander .
» W hy does your cat turn his / her back on you after a scolding , or if you 've been gone for a while ?
Typically , a person 's body language when reprimanding a pet includes staring or other overtly " aggressive " behavior .
The cat usually responds in a submissive fashion .
In a sense , it is telling you he has surrendered to you , as a fellow cat , and is discouraging attack .
( By the way , you will get better results from a cat if you enforce his positive behavior instead of reprimanding any negative behavior . )
» W hy does your cat bring you dead or dying creatures ?
There are at least four differing theories on this behavior :
- Your cat is bringing you a present , in appreciation for you feeding it or as a sign of affection .
- Your cat realizes you are a totally incompetent mouser and is trying to educate you .
- The cat is bringing her prey home to where it is safe , where she usually eats .
- The cat is simply trying to make sure you have fresh food .
» W hy does a cat play with its prey ?
Cats are attracted by movement , so if a stalked prey keeps moving , the cat 's desire to attack continues to be stimulated .
If the cat gets very excited over the stalking / killing , he may continue to play with the prey after it is dead .
» W hy do some cats put their toys in their water or food dish ?
Cats look upon their food area as part of their territory , and that particular area of their territory usually does n't change from day to day - so the cats are likely putting their favorite toys away in a " safe " place .
Some cats will consistently put away their toys when they 're through playing with them - you might try putting your cat 's toys in a small basket near one of his favorite spots and see if he will put them away on his own .
» W hy does your cat take a small bite on your arm or cheek and hold on for a few seconds ?
Some cats , when they are very happy and feeling extremely affectionate toward the Big Unfurry Cat , will gently take a piece of human skin between their teeth and hold it for a few seconds .
Think of it as the feline equivalent of kissing .
» W hy do cats roll over on their backs ?
Cats roll over on their backs for a variety of reasons : if your cat flops down in front of you and rolls over on his back for a belly skritch , it 's a sign of his complete trust in you that you wo n't ever hurt him .
Other times , he wants to play .
If the cat is female and in heat , it 's a form of foreplay .
It 's also a part of their social standing .
Domesticated cats do n't display this as much as wild ones do .
Wild cats have a very similar social structure to that of wolves .
» W hy does a cat lick photographs or plastic bags ?
It has been speculated that they are tasting the slight " odor " that emanates from these products .
They may also enjoy the texture of the items on their tongue .
» W hy do some cats go crazy over catnip , but others ignore it ?
The response to catnip is the result of a gene in the cat ; if the cat does n't have the gene , it can not physically react to catnip .
Some cats will react to catnip by rolling around on the floor in delight , others will just quickly eat it up and wander off , while others will ignore it completely .
» W hy does a cat sometimes " sneer " when smelling something ?
When a cat curls back its upper lip and looks like it 's sneering , it has just discovered an interesting , usually intense odor and is smelling it more deeply .
Called " flehming , " it is drawing the odors into an organ ( Jacobson 's organ ) , in the roof of its mouth .
» W hy do cats sometimes scratch at windows ?
It may be that they are verifying that there is actually a barrier between them and whatever they see outside .
» W hy does a cat hate getting wet ?
Actually , many cats enjoy water and at least one breed is known to enjoy fishing and swimming .
But , it has to be on their own terms - being picked up by two human hands and dunked in a sink full of water is not on the cat 's " own terms . "
» W hy do some cats insist on drinking from a dripping faucet ?
Cats - like most other animals - prefer their food and water fresh , and running water is most appealing for that reason .
Too , the motion of water coming out of a faucet is probably appealing to their sense of hearing and sight .
Another likely theory is that c ats ca n’t see where the water level is with still water , and they do n’t like sticking their face in it .
So some cats test the water level with their paw first , and others drink from alternate sources where the level does n’t change , like the drip , the toilet , or the bathtub puddles .
» W hy does a cat hide when it is sick or dying ?
Instinct tells a cat to hide where a predator can't find them .
When a cat is ill , it may think it is being stalked - so it hides .
Too , it wants to avoid any further threat to its well - being .
» W hy does a cat spend so much time grooming ?
Besides the obvious purpose of hygiene and the social aspects , grooming helps cats cope with confrontation or ' embarassment ' ( you may have noticed that if a cat accidentally falls off a chair , the first thing he does is nonchalantly wash himself , as though he intended to get down in the first place . )
» W hy does a cat frequently demand attention when you 're on the telephone ?
The cat , since it can't see the person you are talking to , presumes you are talking to him , and is responding to what he perceives is your conversation with him .
» W hy does a cat scratch the furniture or a scratching post ?
While some people think a cat scratches to sharpen its claws , that is probably inaccurate .
There are typically two reasons for scratching : the cat is marking its territory ( cats have sweat glands between their paw pads , and scratching leaves their scent on the clawed object ) ; or , the cat is " filing down " its nails and removing the outer layer
» W hy does a cat suddenly bite or hiss at a person after it 's been petted for a while ?
If a person persists in touching a sensitive area ( such as the cat 's tail , ears , or belly ) , the cat might give a gentle nip to as a way of staying " stop . "
Too , some cats can tolerate pleasurable stroking only for short periods of time ; again , he may communicate " stop it " with a nip or cuff of his paw .
» W hy do some cats insist on tipping over their water dish , or take food out of the dish and drop it on the floor to eat ?
Most cats do not like to eat or drink out of bowls if the sides touch their whiskers .
Also , if a bowl is too deep , the cat may take the food out for convenience .
A wider , shallower bowl will probably eliminate this behavior .
» W hy does a cat chatter when he sees a bird ?
When a cat kills prey , it bites down quickly several times .
The " chatter " is simulating the cat 's behavior at the time of attack .
Alternatively ( according to a visitor ) : it 's pure and simple frustration .
When a cat is stalking or killing a bird , they 're almost invariably completely silent .
It 's when they are shut off from the prey that they chatter .
Another reason that cats " chatter " when they see a bird is because they are attempting to imitate a bird call to lure in their prey from out of reach places .
» W hy is a cat able to land on its feet from a fall ?
When falling , the cat swivels its body in mid-air , so that it is facing the ground , and lands with its back arched to absorb the shock .
Cats use their tails to right themselves and have very flexible bodies that allow them to swivel in mid-air , but the most important part of cats landing on their feet has to do with their very complex inner-ear that allows the cat 's brain to know exactly what direction is up and what direction is down so that the brain can send the appropriate signals to allow the cat to land on all four feet .
The complex inner-ear also aids them to maintain balance when jumping , landing , and walking on very narrow spaces .
» W hy do cats like crinkly sounds ?
Crinkly sounds are similar to the high - pitched noises of rodents , birds , and crickets , so the crisp , crinkly sound of a crumpled piece of paper or walking into a paper bag stimulates the cat 's " prey response . "
» W hy does a cat swish his tail ?
Cats use their tail to communicate their mood .
» W hy do cats chew on plants ?
It could be that the grass helps the cat get rid of fur swallowed while grooming , or that grass provides fiber or vitamins and minerals not found in meat .
Some plants are poisonous to a cat ; others are okay for nibbling .

All that chocolate might actually help finish the bumper Christmas crossword over the seasonal period .
According to Oxford researchers working with colleagues in Norway , chocolate , wine and tea enhance cognitive performance .
The team from Oxford ’s Department of Physiology , Anatomy and Genetics and Norway examined the relation between cognitive performance and the intake of three common foodstuffs that contain flavonoids ( chocolate , wine , and tea ) in 2,031 older people ( aged between 70 and 74 ) .
Participants filled in information about their habitual food intake and underwent a battery of cognitive tests .
Those who consumed chocolate , wine , or tea had significantly better mean test scores and lower prevalence of poor cognitive performance than those who did not .
The team reported their findings in the Journal of Nutrition .
The role of micronutrients in age - related cognitive decline is being increasingly studied .
Fruits and beverages such as tea , red wine , cocoa , and coffee are major dietary sources of polyphenols , micronutrients found in plant - derived foods .
The largest subclass of dietary polyphenols is flavonoids , and it has been reported in the past that those who consume lots of flavonoids have a lower incidence of dementia .
The latest findings seem to support the theory , although the researchers caution that more research would be needed to prove that it was flavonoids , rather than some other aspect of the foods studied , that made the difference .
The effect was most pronounced for wine .
However , say the researchers , those overdoing it at Christmas should note that while moderate alcohol consumption is associated with better cognitive function and reduced risk of Alzheimer ’s disease and dementia , heavy alcohol intake could be one of many causes of dementia – as well as a host of other health problems .
Internet Video .
Its the salvation for content creators everywhere .
Its the end to dependence on the big bad meanies , the cable and satellite companies .
Right ?
Hell no .
The concept that “ over the top ” video creates a valid business alternative for content creators is as misguided an internet business myth as there is .
For grins , lets say you want to start a business for which you want to stream , live or on demand , any video .
Any quality .
You want the ability to reach merely 10 k simultaneous viewers .
Not a big number .
In fact , its a tiny number .
Its certainly not competitive with any form of traditional TV , but its a starting point .
So to stream 10 k simultaneous streams , what are your choices ?
Can you just do it from a PC in your dorm room ?
From your house on your cable or DSL line ?
No .
You will need an outside vendor in order to offer a mere 10 k simultaneous streams .
Which leads to the question of who can provide a service as simple as 10 k streams ?
Who can do it with any level of reliability ?
The natural response of course would be to say to use Youtube , right ?
Except that their terms of service prohibit commercial applications .
You can pimp your content and do ad shares , but you cant have control of your content and its presentation .
Its branded Youtube .
Its controlled by Youtube .
So what are your options ?
You have a single option .
You have to use a Content Delivery Network ( CDN ) .
CDNs specialize in delivering content that needs to scale to large numbers , and 10 k simultaneous users , particularly if its sustained for any period of time , like a cable network would be , is considered a large number .
When Youtube did their big live event , they used a 3rd party CDN .
Any large scale event streamed to thousands or hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users is going to require hiring and paying a CDN like Akamai , Limelight or one of just a few others that can offer scaled streaming .
There in lies the rub .
There are only a few CDNs that can offer any level of scale for delivering video to an audience that is large by internet standards , but very small by cable or satellite standards .
There is not a single CDN that can deliver 2 or more video streams concurrently to more than 1 mm simultaneous viewers .
Not one .
Anywhere .
There are probably 3 , maybe 4 , that on a perfect day might be able to deliver a single video stream to 500 k simultaneous viewers .
On the flip side , there are at least 8 large cable and satellite video distributors that can deliver 100 or more video streams , concurrently , to a million or more simultaneous viewers .
The Great Internet Video Lie is that the internet opens distribution to compete with the evil gate keepers , cable and satellite .
In reality , if you have a desire to deliver a large number of streams , and you want to compete with another internet video provider to offer a large number of streams , you are not in a very good position .
You are at the mercy of 3 or 4 CDNs , the ultimate internet video gatekeepers
Let me put this another way .
Lets say you have your “ Worlds Greatest Concert ” that you are sure can draw 500 k simultaneous streams ( on demand or live ) .
Also planning to stream a large event , lets say the first broadcast of Dark Knight 2 , which the producers will stream live at the same time , and oh my goodness , the remaining Beatles decide to have their final reunion with a single live concert at the exact same time .
3 Mega events , each with an expected draw of 500 k simultaneous users .
Who has the greatest opportunity and the most leverage ?
Thats easy .
Its the CDNs .
You have so few choices of vendors that the CDNs can charge whatever they want to handle the event .
And thats for one single event .
You dont want to know about costs for 24×7 streaming for viewership levels of even small cable networks .
The internet is not an open video platform .
Video distribution of any scale places you at the mercy of just a very few CDNs .
You literally have to compete for timeslots for very large events .
If you want an interesting excercise , call up a CDN and ask them how much it would cost to support an audience that is never smaller than 10 k simultaneous viewers for a 1 mbs stream , 24 hours a day , for 365 consecutive days .
Then call up one of the satellite providers and ask how much they would charge you to deliver to 100 pct of their customers , and then call up a cable company and ask the same question .
Total up the cable and satellite numbers and compare them to the internet costs .
You may be surprised to see which is cheaper .
If you have dreams of competing with traditional TV network viewing numbers using the internet , dream on .
You cant afford it .
You have been sucker punched by the Great Internet Lie .
When people come to a creative company they do n’t look for the latest editions of Photoshop or Illustrator .
In spite of what schools may tell you , there is a surplus of talented software wizards .
People pay creatives to think for them .
We solve their problems by knowing how to implement ideas .
We iterate potential directions until they find the one they can proudly stand behind .
We exist to mediate bad decisions .
In effect – we ’re their outsourced brain .
If creating were as easy as using software proficiently , everyone who knew Word would have created novels in their spare time .
Those who knew Excel would have balanced their budgets with aplomb , and skilled Outlook users could send Html emails to their family without batting an eye .
And so more important than learning the tools , a young designer must accept that their first job is rooted in psychology :
How do you lead a team through a series of open - ended decisions ?
We ’ve found that the greatest obstacle to decision - making is fear .
It crops up in emails , or in conference calls , veiled through feedback , or tucked away in a hurried voicemail .
Giving up control even for a moment is hard .
It takes trust and respect and asks you to forget the potential failures that could lie ahead .
Most people invite fear in for dinner .
And once inside your heart , fear does n’t leave easily .
It makes itself home and infects choices and undermines your ability to act .
How can a project possibly move forward when filled with so much doubt ?
“ I ’m afraid for my job . ” “ I ’m afraid my board wo n’t like this . ”
“ I ’m afraid the president will hate that . ”
“ I ’m afraid customers will dislike it . ” “ I ’m afraid we went too far . ” “ I ’m afraid we did n’t go far enough . ”
We ’ve worked with hundreds of start - ups .
Every single start - up that had a problem deciding on a design for a logo or business card has failed .
Not one , not five , every single one .
And the reason is that small decisions are reflections of larger decisions .
If you are filled with fear and doubt when it comes to pointing at a brand you admire , you ’ll see this same fault amplified 100x when the important business decisions arrive .
After all , the color of your logo wo n’t matter if you do n’t satisfy your clients in time .
So a note to the young designers :
When looking for good clients , find the fearless .
They do n’t have time to mull over doubt .
You ’ll see them by the trail of success they ’ve left behind and the strength to trust over worry .
And a note to entrepreneurs :
Your job is to stare fear in the face and keep moving forward .

I 've been getting calls over the past few days from journalists who want to know why I 've started writing porn .
One of them caught me in bed and mentioned this fact in his article , giving the impression that I spend most of my time between the sheets , inventing sexual fantasy .
Nice work if you can get it , I have to say , but writing about sex is notoriously difficult and I 'm not giving up the day job yet .
I 've been to the Bad Sex awards too many times , doubling over with laughter at choice passages from the shortlisted authors .
Extended metaphors quickly begin to droop , while sex acts involving dogs or fruit are generally a bad idea .
I have , however , written an erotic short story for a new collection by women writers called " In Bed With ... " and attempts are being made to uncover my pseudonym .
Am I Sunset Proudfoot or Pom Pom Paradise ?
Storm Henley or Marmalade Bates ?
We 've all made up our own noms de porn , as our co-editor Kathy Lette calls them , using the names of our first pet and first street .
I had to employ a bit of artistic licence as my first dog ran away one Christmas , blighting the entire holiday , and I did n't want to revisit childish heartache .
( He was a boy , anyway , and I could n't really see myself as Rinty Crescent . )
The project has been put together in the utmost secrecy so I genuinely do n't know which story was written by Fay Weldon , Louise Doughty or Joanne Harris .

What most people want to know , it seems , is why a feminist would even consider writing porn .
But my novels contain sex scenes , and the tradition of feminists writing erotically goes back to Erica Jong and Anaïs Nin .
It 's true that Andrea Dworkin argued passionately against pornography , but it 's not as if there has ever been a united voice on the subject in the women 's movement .
I recently looked at Playboy and thought it was rather pathetic , stuck in a world of Seventies male fantasies , and in any case it 's been marginalised by the much more explicit porn available on the internet .
There is now a vast commercial sex industry , stretching from South - east Asia via Europe to the US , which encompasses violent porn , paedophile images , prostitution and trafficking ; women rescued from traffickers report being forced to take part in sex videos against their will .
The problem is n't sex , but the fact that the industry that 's grown up around it is sadistic , humiliating and exploitative .
And the vast bulk of its consumers are men .
Feminists have always been angry about this , not because we 're opposed to porn per se but because of the way women 's pleasure has been systematically excluded from the public arena .
More than a quarter of a century ago , Shere Hite set out to find out what women really felt about sex , and her reports encouraged millions of women to get in touch with their bodies and discover what turns them on .
Fiction is another way of doing that and feminist novelists have almost a duty to carry on the work , using a language that does n't mimic the stilted vocabulary of men 's magazines .
Writing about sex does n't have to be arch , obscene or depressingly humourless , and that 's why I 'm proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Minxy Malone and Tutty Monmouth – whoever they may be .
The Inaugural Balls went on all night and it looks like Good Morning America 's Diane Sawyer enjoyed the open bars .
Thanks , ABC , for not pulling her off the air despite all this slurred nonsense .
Thanks to hero intern Bette Bentley for compiling this wonderful video of America 's Drunkest Former Nixon Staffer Journalist mumbling things about children and boots .
CORRECTION , JESUS : Diane Sawyer did not attend a single ball !
She was up all night reporting .
So they just had her on GMA after a full 24 hours of being on television despite the fact that no news actually happened yesterday , or this morning .
It was a sick Jackass - style stunt of some kind we think ?

More Trader Tracks Predictions For 2009 - Series # 3 By Roger Wiegand
Jan 21 2009 4:02 PM www.webeatthestreet.com
Our new president was inaugurated and we wish him well for the sake of our nation and others throughout the world .
We do not want to be cynical but must be realistic .
We think this year will be the worst one of this longer recession - depression cycle and our new leader , we suspect is going to take a merciless pounding from a heap of troubles domestically first and foreign later .
Thankfully , the spending of TARP # 2 and whatever billions - trillions are added for emphasis , should give us the Obama Market Bounce lasting perhaps 90 days or so .
While this economics plan has no chance in our view , the herd psychology of markets should give us a nice relief rally almost across the board .
The dollar is flat to down on the intermediate cycle and bonds are the same .
We forecast the balance of our favorites to rally along with shares in both the mainstream and precious metals .
However , with spring flowers in April we are expecting a quintuple smash of :
Wave one of commercial real estate foreclosures and loan failures .
Some of the biggest of the big buildings will be foreclosed and those planned but not built will never see daylight .
Meanwhile , vacancies skyrocket while budgets are busted with dropping rents .
One analyst estimated the New York City Financial district buildings will see 66 % occupancies with breakeven budgets being much higher .
You will see some major shopping malls shut down .
The second wave of residential foreclosures and loan failures arrives dragging down all real estate values both commercial and residential .
They will sink like a rock in over - built states and within those regions previously hit the worst .
This is related to the next mortgage failure cycle .
Some of those formerly upscale , McMansion subdivisions will turn into ghost towns .
Wave one of auto loan failures containing billions in bank , credit union and auto finance company loans will smash credit markets .
The reaction will be stunning and probably stop most vehicle lending temporarily for weeks paralyzing automakers and those lenders still doing car and truck loans .
Wave one of several future waves of credit card failures estimated at $ 40 billion by bank credit analysts will be an April smash .
Normally card failures are in the 1 - 2 % range annually .
This larger event opens doors for a historic new number of non-payers and delinquents .
This cycle is mostly job loss related but most of it is due to overspending by cardholders .
Wave one of the CDS Credit Default Swaps will hit markets like a Tsunami .
These failures will be so overpowering , those in charge will be stunned and flabbergasted by the numbers .
The figures are so large we cannot even imagine the amounts .
One analyst said it was estimated between $ 500 and $ 750 Trillion dollars !
There is no margin or deposit money on these trades .
Most See A Crisis Of Liquidity .
We See A Crisis Of Insolvency .
Here is the difference :
For those in a crisis of liquidity they have a temporary shortage of liquid cash but do have a positive balance sheet with a viable longer term business plan .
Insolvency is something entirely different .
Those personally or corporately insolvent have BOTH a shortage of cash but worst of all do not have a reasonable and viable plan to grow themselves out of trouble .
No matter how many billions are tossed to those insolvents , they will crash anyway while taking billions in TARP and replacement cash down the tubes with them .
An excellent example is the American auto industry .
Even with enough cash to get by for say three years , the overwhelming debts and their wacko budgets eliminate any hope of recovery .
The automakers are insolvent .
When compared with their European and Asian competition , the Big Three continue to operate on the old paradigm with overly generous benefits , wages and perks .
Further , the work ethic in America is not the same as with most other auto manufacturers .
There are exceptions of course but the money deck is stacked against the Big Three even having any chance .
In addition to out of kilter budgets , the Big Three has an extremely heavy load of legacy costs related to retirees .
The Asian companies do not have this burden for the most part .
The Big Three are paying big bucks for many more retired workers related to pensions and health care .
A comparison might be the U.S. Social Security system .
We already have too many retired folks collecting benefits compared to those working and making contributions .
This relationship is going the wrong way very quickly .
Real worker contributions are NOT keeping - up with payment demands and further , those worker contributions are deposited to the U.S. Treasury General Fund where they are open to abusive spending for other things .
Those contributions should be in a segregated fund and not commingled .
We suggest that when the younger workers catch on they will rebel against this idea thinking they are tired of feeding the oldsters and not keeping enough set aside for them selves .
Other Events Dragging Down World Economies
World trade is in a state of collapse as seen in tumbling Asian manufacturing and export numbers along with ships parked to the extent global docks are nearly silent .
Historically when this happens , nations turn inward to save themselves .
Asia will stop buying and investing in our crappy paper meaning the U.S. is no longer financed .
Further , trade wars and protectionism will appear to protect internal and domestic economies .
Nasty tariffs are born and international trade anger rises .
Mutual cooperation so necessary to move all the global goods goes very bad .
Unemployment is rising swiftly throughout the world .
In the U.S. we see 500,000 jobs per month going down the drain .
Those are the losses reported .
We would strongly suggest the actual monthly loss is near 1,000,000 per month .
If this is true , America will shed 12 mm jobs this year as our new administration proudly announces they will create 2 - 4 mm new ones .
They will be going backwards at the rate of nearly - 80 % , which is astounding .
Worse yet , any new ones will be make - work government jobs creating a further drain on the treasury .
We see next to nothing for new private employment .
Obviously with all the joblessness , bills are not paid relative to autos , housing , miscellaneous loans , education , health care , travel , taxes , entertainment , etc .
Lost jobs create a cascade of failures across the entire spending - investment spectrum .
Further , when fear sets in as in today ’s situation , those still working stop spending .
Spending losses encourage a Catch - 22 and the whole cycle - episode feeds on itself in a downward spiral .
While we remain in a primary deflation mode world - wide , we think inflation followed by hyperinflation is very real and possible in later 2009 .
The Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury are just about at the end of their rope .
They are out of rate cut running - room and those moves are mostly ineffectual now anyway .
All they have left is a phony game of printing dollars and bonds while moving them around in a circle within our country .
Foreign USA paper buyers take less and less at new auctions .
We know they are dumping dollars and other papers assets at a furious pace paying bills and investing in honest - to - goodness hard goods with real value .
Watch out for big time inflation in the second half of 2009 .
As we write this on January 20th , England ’s Pound Sterling is taking a historic dive as their central bank has been printing recklessly to fund illiquid - insolvent disasters .
One analyst expects the Pound to fail and this monetary crisis to go into a Trustee Receivership with the IMF and Euroland authorities in charge .
We ’ve been saying for months the monster U.S. bond short just ahead will be the mother of all bubbles .
Others agree and we see more and more discussion relative to this topic .
Timing is difficult but more than one analyst suggests using the ETF ’s for trading this longer term event .
One top analyst from Canada suggests this current economic cycle might resemble the 1873 -1896 depression in the U.S. Maybe , but with think its more like 1929 - 1939 as today is 1938 - 1939 with stronger negatives .
After 1939 only war got the global system on track again .
Expect a repeat .
Remember Sir Alan delayed the 2000 event with low interest and free housing money .
He has only delayed the inevitable disaster giving it a bunch more nasty power .
The overshoot on the downside is already crazy and we have long , long way to go headed down to the lower than low finish line .
Towns , Cities , States And Municipalities Losing Tax Income Pensioners are a dominant investor group in municipal bonds for retirement income .
Real estate taxes are the primary driver of cash - in for these groups .
With tax values sinking and taxpayers defaulting , your local township , village , county or city is not receiving enough income to pay bond interest .
We think there is a distinct possibility California goes bankrupt !!
We see a series of rolling defaults .
Look at California .
The announced they will be mailing income tax refunds late as they are broke .
Further , some creditors are either getting or , about to get payments from the State of California in IOU’s .
This state is $ 40 Billion short on their budget and realistically have no way to escape .
Their lender of last resort will be Uncle Sam .
This means other states that behave themselves and pay their bills will have their residents tapped to cover California messes .
In Michigan , the Cities of Highland Park and Flint went broke and Lansing ( our capitol ) and Detroit are next .
We cannot imagine what life will be like in Wayne and Oakland counties in Southeastern , Michigan when our Big Three disappear in bankruptcy .
Hundreds of thousands of high pay jobs will vanish - suppliers and associated employment constitute thousands more lost forever .
It has been said that whenever a nation ’s debts exceed GDP by over + 6 % , there is no recovery .
The U.S. crossed that threshold last year and is headed for +10 % on debts over GDP .
There is no turning back and the recovery could be a decade or more away .
We are going broke nationally for certain .
Being Poor Is A Hardship .
Being Poor In The Middle Of Social Violence Is Untenable .
The U.S. has resources to provide enough food and shelter for the poor , and newly jobless with little strain .
They wo n’t do it because the government is always a reactor not an initiator in solving problems .
This means there is a social upheaval ahead worse than ten Katrina’s .
The sad part is it could be avoided if the authorities would just get busy and get the aid out and delivered .
They wo n’t because they are too stupid and disorganized .
Watch the fallout from this mess !!
Families , singles , children , and pensioners are going hungry for lack of adequate nourishment many times trading food money for utilities or rent ; not being able to afford all necessities .
Here we sit with millions of vacate homes and more coming yet we lack adequate housing for the poor .
The food banks are overrun with demands while millions of others throw food in the garbage .
The food situation is one of transport and distribution rather than a lack .
Governments are not even close to being prepared for the crushing demands of the cold and hungry we see in 2009 - 2012 .
Then , to make it all worse , when the US weather warms - up and gets hotter this summer , heat drives out the jobless and they go hunting on the streets .
They will be on the prowl for free food , food to steal and committing crimes for other necessary goods they cannot afford .
The terrible , old Los Angeles and Detroit riots and those of other larger urban areas will re-set new records for fires , destruction and mayhem .
People read of the billions stolen by crooked bankers and their sleazy associates and anger is swiftly rising .
We have no idea how crazy wild this can get but in our view meeting violence with more violence is not the answer .
For those with limited resources it ’s simply better to just get out of the way .
For those with money and an obviously good lifestyle in the city , we expect you will be a daily robbery target .
Better think about it .
Back in the 1930 ’s depression , our population simply suffered in silence .
While I suppose there was some crime , it was modest compared to what we see on the 2009 horizon .
In this spoiled generation of me first - you last , there will be no time for suffering in silence .
When an unemployed father needs milk for crying babies , he will get a weapon and go get the milk and food .
We get second - hand reports of huge gangs in South Central L.A. , and Chicago on both the north and south sides and others .
California gangs are reported to outnumber the police 3 to 1 and worst of all they have automatic and heavy weapons .
This is not going to be pretty .
Even in the rural parts of the country , there are steady reports of thieves stealing farm equipment , robbing houses and taking fuel .
Unattended property is a target .
We think living in a small quiet town with good neighbors , being non-descript and blending in will provide a better life .
If you ca n’t move , better make provision for a spot to land if your neighborhood goes bad overnight .
Another ugly part of depression life is a clash of cultures and religions .
The have nots will turn on the haves perceiving them to be part of the reason the poor are poor .
Obviously this is ridiculous but that is an easy perception to embrace .
Look for new nastiness among those cultures most prone to argue and pick - on each other and targets generally having a good life style with plenty of money .
A new mindset is necessary to curtail higher , former lifestyles .
I have friends who spend like they did ten years ago but do not have ten years ’ ago resources .
Inflation is insidious .
It grinds away on your income with no raises or increases being few and far between .
It grinds away with taxes , as cost increases constantly slide higher at a gradual but relentless pace .
It takes away little pleasures like eating out more often or taking nice vacations .
It tightens the belts of kids in high school who want more expensive stuff while school systems offer less and charge more .
It bites on us with repairs and on things that break too often and cost too much .
Once tiny , annual fees like a dog license or , auto registration keep going higher and higher .
If most people took a real hard look at income and spending I think they would make tighter budgets , curtail old pleasures and get rough with letting a nickel go out the door .
Most keep on keeping on , doing the same old stuff relative to spending and wonder why they are broke .
Americans probably have the worst savings record in the world .
They always spend far beyond their means , for the most part ; living from check - to - check .
I see it in Michigan in upscale neighborhoods where thirty somethings living in McMansions have a husband - wife income of $ 250 - $ 300,000 , being basically broke .
They have multiple leased cars and trucks , a house payment that would choke a horse and plenty of extras including private clubs , special training , fancy vacations , private schools , and overdone holidays .
Watch how this comes to a screeching halt !
The chickens ( vultures ) are coming home to roost .
Bye - Bye $ 150,000 per year auto engineer ’s salaries , and here comes rising taxes as our esteemed governor takes more and spends more even in these distressed times .
She thinks your earned money is her money .
She never had a real job or met a payroll in her life .
Let them eat cake she says ; all is well .
Watch where that goes .
Taxpayer revolts are born of situations like this one .
I ’ve got some bad news for her .
The tax income is skidding , big painful state lay - offs are just ahead and when schools begin to close , homeowners send in house keys to the bank and leave our state .
There is going to be lots of jingle mail sent to the bankers this spring .
Mark my words it ’s going to be beyond ugly .
Maybe Michigan will revert to the forest emulating Detroit where wildlife abounds and not the kind you think either .
The USA War Machine Will Shrink .
We Ca n’t Pay For It And Most Americans Are Tired Of Feeding Defense Companies To Manufacture Stuff That ’s Blown - Up And Wrecked .
Global economic calamities redistribute national power .
The survivors have independent energy sources or , they steal it from others .
The Middle Eastern struggles with Israel and the Arabs will continue we think until it heaven forbid goes nuclear .
NATO is going weaker in Europe as Putin closes in for the kill .
South America has several newly - bent left - leaning commie countries courtesy of Hugo Chavez .
His antics in his country and with neighbors , and Cuba and Mexico tell us this dude is on a rampage to spread big trouble right at the door - step of America in Mexico .
We sincerely hope our new president is a tough guy with the bad guys .
They will lend no quarter and are simply lying back in the weeds to take control by force .
We suggest if the truth be known , Mexico is far out on the stability ledge as we speak .
Our border guards and even the U.S. ’s Border States ’ National Guard are no match for those criminals in Northern and Central Mexico .
New reports tell us they caused more deaths in Mexico last year than were counted in Iraq .
This is very serious , indeed .
New Currencies , Bretton Woods
And T - Bonds Our New
York global trading and investment banks will require constant infusions of new cash to stay afloat .
The TARP funding and still more to come is tossing cash into a bottomless pit .
One of the world ’s bigger banks is going to fail this year and it will be a disaster .
Next , one of the larger insurance companies will go bankrupt and create another shock to the core of our system and that of the world .
This insurance company crash will be matched by a monster blue chip American company failing and shocking Wall Street .
The U.S. Bond bubble is the mother of all bubbles and has tragic consequences for the entire world .
These markets are 70 times larger than the shares markets and form the lifeblood of capital for global finance .
When this one breaks , the reverberations slam the world ’s financial systems to the bone .
The old Bretton Woods system of having our USA dollar as the backbone of the world ’s currency system could break down .
The Asians and those in the Middle East are already forming new currency and trade platforms based upon brand new trading ideas .
The U.S. Dollar is headed to .4600 on our forecasts ; roughly a - 50 % haircut .
We are all entering a brand new world .
The old world is a goner and those who cannot change will wither and fail .
Get with a new program and be busy moving in the right direction .
The time is now and the time is short .
We think after May , 2009 , several chances to implant new trades , investment ideas , personal events and other things will be too late .
Imposition of government capital controls can impede moving your business , cash , funds , and retirement in or , out of the U.S.
It might be very expensive and difficult ; or impossible .
Survivors and Those Who Win Buy Gold And Silver
We think the secret to getting through this is to hunker down , eliminate debts , keep a low profile , trade in gold and silver shares during this first quarter along with futures , and then adjust in April when stocks sell off .
Gold topped out near $ 850 years ago right where our price is today .
We forecast 80 % of the gold upside is still ahead in these markets .
Silver is behind gold for now but will catch - up .
They never trade like twins most of the time .
We think the worst silver could do is $ 50 ; but expect much higher prices .
We look forward with anticipation to some great fun in these markets .
If you are not in a position now , hurry - up and get it done .
The door is open for all the shares ’ markets including our precious metals .

Web surfers leery of having internet speeds slowed by their service providers can now confirm their suspicions with a little help from Google Inc .
The California - based company announced Wednesday the release of Measurement Lab ( M - Lab ) , which allows users to measure connection speeds and test whether certain programs are being blocked .
The open platform is still in its infancy , Google says .
But it is providing 36 servers to researchers in 12 locations in Europe in the United States , with the hope that they can come up with new applications to improve internet transparency .
At this point , there are only a few applications that users can use on the M - Lab site , including Glasnost , a tool that can tell users if their BitTorrent programs are being throttled .
The network diagnostic tool , meanwhile , can measure the speed of a user 's internet connection .
Develops other tools
An application that allows users to monitor if they are being obstructed online is n't new , but Google says M - lab stands for more than just a throttle test — it provides the infrastructure for developing other tools to measure connectivity .
" M- Lab is intended to be a truly community - based effort , and we welcome the support of other companies , institutions , researchers , and users that want to provide servers , tools , or other resources that can help the platform flourish , " Google vice - president Vint Cerf and principal engineer Stephen Stuart said on a Google blog .
Google has come out repeatedly in favour of net neutrality , the principle that the internet should be kept open and free from interference or restrictions from service providers .
It argued last year that Bell Canada is breaking Canadian telecommunications law by slowing certain internet traffic and urged action from the Canada Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission .
The CRTC has since said the Bell has not broken any laws and will be allowed to continue throttling .
M - Lab has been in the works for a year .
Google has collaborated with a variety of academics , as well as the PlanetLab consortium and the New America Foundation on M - Lab .
A Turkish court sentenced five members of the same family to life imprisonment for the " honour killing " of Naile Erdas , 16 , who got pregnant as a result of rape , activists said Monday .
In its verdict , a court in the eastern city of Van sentenced the murder victim 's brother to life in jail for the 2006 murder to cleanse the family honour , the Van Women 's Association said .
The girl 's father , mother and two uncles were also given life sentences for instigating the murder , while a third uncle was jailed for 16 years and eight months for failing to report the murder in one of the heaviest sentences handed down in Turkey for such a killing .
How Sex Offender Laws Circumvent the Constitution :
Civil / Regulatory versus Criminal / Punitive
A fact guide from Derek W. Logue - © Nov. 26 , 2007
Sex Offender laws have faced constitutional challenges since the day of their inception , yet have withstood the
perpetual onslaught primarily on a simple premise : sex offender laws are “ civil ” or “ regulatory ” in nature , not “ criminal ” or
“ punitive . ”
This argument is integral to the survival of sex offender legislation .
Criminal laws are bound by various
safeguards allotted to us by the US Constitution ; civil laws are free from these safeguards .
Legislators successfully
circumvented the Constitution by declaring sex offender laws “ civil . ”
This notion must be attacked in order to have any
hope of repealing such blatantly unconstitutional laws .
Is this argument really that important ?
Without a doubt , this argument is the backbone of sex offender legislation .
In my own case , McNeil v. Logue , Case #
A050486 ( Ct of Common Pleas , Hamilton Co , OH 2006 ) , I made the claim sex offender residency restrictions violated
both the 8th Amendment ( cruel and unusual punishment ) and the 14th Amendment ( Due Process , right to peacefully
reside within a state ) .
The judge ruled , “ This argument fails because the restriction is of a civil nature and does not
constitute a punishment …
Chapter 2950 ( Ohio ‘s sex offender code ) is absolutely devoid of any language indicating an
intent to punish …
Protecting the public and preventing crimes are the types of purposes [ the US Supreme Court has ]
found regulatory and not punitive . ”
While the judge admitted the law “ does impose a certain restraint on residency and
may serve a deterrent effect , ” he would not admit it served the traditional means of punishment .
“ Because this court has
determined the law is non-punitive , there can be no 8th Amendment violation . ”
This argument reflects other famous
court decisions : Doe v. Miller , 405 F. 3d 700 ( 8th Cir. 2005 ) , the ruling reversing the first successful challenge to
residency restrictions ; Smith v. Doe , 538 US 84 ( 2002 ) , upholding Alaska ’s sex offender registry ; and Kansas v.
Hendricks , 521 US 346 ( 1997 ) , which upheld civil commitment for sex offenders .
In fact , virtually every counterargument
begins with the regulatory nature of these laws .
Are these laws punitive ?
If you have experienced these laws firsthand , then you ’re shouting “ yes ” emphatically .
Proving this in a court of law ,
however , is quite the challenge .
As noted in McNeil v. Logue , even when the court admits sex offender laws serve a
punitive purpose , the court favors the regulatory argument .
This is why I believe this argument must be emphasized in
every challenge to sex offender laws .
The following cases lay the groundwork to the argument residency restrictions are
indeed punitive :
Argument # 1 : SO laws are punitive by the nature of the laws ’ effects
Though the residency restrictions are regarded as civil sanctions , even a civil penalty is considered a punishment
if the sanction cannot be fairly said to serve a remedial purpose , but instead as a deterrent or retribution , [ US v .
Gartner , 93 F. 3d 633 , cert. denied 519 US 1047 ] , or when it is overwhelmingly disproportionate to the damages
caused to the government [ US v. Walker , 940 F. 2d 442 ] .
Demery v. Arpaio , 378 F. 3d 1020 , cert . denied 125 S. Ct. 2961 , 162 L. Ed. 2d 887 : claim that certain sanctions
served purposes of deterrence and public scrutiny does not justify sanctions which do not serve a legitimate
governmental purpose or causes harm to the targets of the sanctions .
E.B. v. Verniero , 119 F. 3d , rehearing denied 127 F.3d 298 , cert .
denied , 522 US 1110 : even when punishment
is neither the actual or objective purpose of the law , civil sanctions may constitute punishment if the effects or
“ sting ” are harsh enough to be considered a punishment , and must be evaluated in light of importance of any
legitimate governmental interest served .
Argument # 2 : SO Laws serve as historical means of punishment
In Artway v. Attorney General of the State of New Jersey , 81 F. 3d 1235 , rehearing denied 83 F. 3d 594 : even if
some remedial purpose can fully explain a legislative measure , if historical analysis shows a sanction has been
traditionally regarded as punishment , and if text or history does not demonstrate that the measure is not punitive ,
it must be considered a punishment .
Argument # 3 : SO Laws counter their own claim the sole purpose is public safety
The residency restriction law is an act of banishment comparable only by deportation of illegal aliens .
Trop v.
Dulles , 356 US 86 ( 1958 ) : an order of banishment ( or “ divestiture ” ) was executed against a native born citizen
who did not voluntarily relinquish or abandon his citizenship or become involved in any way with any foreign
nation .
“ Divestiture of a natural born citizen was held to be unconstitutionally forbidden as a penalty ‘ more cruel
and more primitive , inasmuch as it entailed statelessness ’ or ‘ the total destruction of the individual ’s status in
organized society . ”
( CRS / LII Ann .
Const. 8th Amdt , . www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt 8_user . html ) .
In Rutherford v. Blankenship , 468 F. supp .
1357 , 1360 ( W.D. Va. 1979 ) , the Court stated , “ To permit one state to
dump its convict[ed ] criminals into another is not in the interests of safety and welfare ; therefore , the punishment
by banishment to another state is prohibited by public policy . ”
Romer v. Evans , 517 US 620 ( 1996 ) : “ If the constitutional conception of ‘ equal protection of the laws ’ means
anything , it must at the very least mean that a bare … desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot
constitute a legitimate governmental interest … ”
Argument # 4 : “ Risk alone ” does not justify “ regulatory action . ”
The mere knowledge of a person ’s past behavior does not justify a belief the person will automatically re- offend
( Tot v. US , 319 US 463 . )
The courts also established in order to prove conspiracy , there must be some concrete action related to specific
acts [ US v. Cintolo , 818 F. 2d. 980 , 1003 ( 1987 ) ] .
The Courts have also struck down punishment based on a degraded status alone , like a drug addict [ Robinson v .
California , 270 US 660 ( 1962 ) ] .
Argument # 5 : Laws must be limited only to those acts directly related to sex crimes
While the state may claim a compelling interest in deterring convicted sex offenders from re- offending , there are
certain fundamental rights that are being infringed upon , and thus “ more than a compelling interest is needed to
survive constitutional scrutiny .
The statute must be narrowly tailored to meet the compelling interest . ”
[ Reno v .
Flores ( 1993 ) , 507 US 292 , 301-302 ] .
State v. Burnett ( 2001 ) 93 Ohio St. 3d 219 , a law barring convicted drug offenders from entering Cincinnati’s
“ Over - The - Rhine ” district failed constitutional analysis because it went beyond restricting those interests
associated with illegal drug activity and restricted a substantial amount of innocent conduct , like living in an
apartment , or visiting human services .
The law restricted and / or punished behavior not even linked to criminal
activity ; merely the act of being in the restricted area was enough to get you arrested .
Also , the restriction
restricted drug offenders from obtaining the assistance or support networks necessary for rehabilitation which was
otherwise severely diminished by the restrictions .
Later upheld in Johnson et al. v. City of Cincinnati , 2002 FED
App. 0332P ( 6th Cir. ) , cert .
denied , US Supreme Court case no .
02-1452 .
Furman v. Georgia , 408 US 238 ( 1972 ) : “ The Court will consider whether a punishment is ( a ) too extreme or
barbaric ; ( b ) arbitrarily imposed ; ( c ) excessive , disproportionate , or inconsistent with contemporary norms ; or ( d )
unnecessary to achieve a penal purpose that could be served by a less severe punishment . ” ( John Q. La Fond .
“ Preventing Sexual Violence : How Society Should Cope With Sex Offenders . ” American Psychological Association ,
2005 , p. 180 ) .
Argument # 6 : SO Laws counter other fundamental rights and governmental interests
On the flip side , there are a number of ‘ legitimate governmental interests ” largely neglected by our government .
The Courts have firmly established that “ rehabilitation of criminals is of paramount interest . ”
[ Abbott v. City of
Beverly Hills , ( Cal. Supreme Court , Feb. 26 , 1960 ) ]
In the Abbott case , it was determined that registration of ex -
felons is both in conflict with public policy and at variance with “ moral and ethical concepts of decency and human
dignity . ”
In US v. Guest , 383 US 745 ( 1966 ) , the Court addresses certain rights as basic and fundamental ; “ The reason , it
has been suggested , is that a right so elementary was conceived from the beginning to be a necessary
concomitant of the stronger Union the Constitution created . ”
See also Edwards v. California , 314 US 160 ; Kent v.
Dulles , 357 US 116 , 125-6 ; and Apthecker v. Secretary of State , 378 US 500 , 517 .
Successful challenges to the laws
Though some of the cases presented thus far are specific to the residency restriction issue , the argument itself applies
to sex offender laws in general .
For example ,
In the aforementioned Doe v. Miller case , dissenting Judge Mallory finds
the laws violate Ex Post Facto , punitive as historical banishment , serves traditional aims of punishment , imposes an
affirmative disability or restraint , and excessive in meeting its goals .
While Mallory was the minority in this case , there
have been a few successful challenges to various sex offender laws .
In each argument , the issue of punitive versus
regulatory was addressed in some form or fashion .

Registration / “ Megan ’s Law ”
In State of Hawaii v. Eto Bani ( Nov. 21 , 2001 ) , the Court struck down the state ’s registration law because it allowed
authorities to notify the public about sex offenders without notifying the offenders or given the chance to argue
they pose no threat ( Bill Myers , “ Hawaii Supreme Court . ” www.actwin. com/eatonohio/gay/schawaii. html ) .
The
registry in Hawaii was not fully abolished , but offenders were given the chance to argue their dangerousness .
In
2003 , the state Attorney General began a campaign to reverse the State Supreme Court ’s ruling and deny the
right to a hearing at all ( Honolulu Star - Bulletin editorial , “ Allow Sex Offenders to shed scarlet letter . “
Dec. 22nd ,
2003 ) .
In the birthplace of Megan ’s law , New Jersey , saw more than its share of challenges , including another ruling
against the law in the Federal District Court of Camden in 2001 .
Again , not a total victory , but in this ruling , the
amount of information given in the registry .
Connecticut also shut down its registry on a court order ( Laura
Mansnerus , “ Megan ’s Law Requirement Struck Down By US Judge , New York Times , Dec. 8th , 2001 ) .

Points to consider
All legal challenges to sex offender laws must begin with arguing the punitive nature of the laws : all SO laws
impose substantial penalties on all offenders , serve traditional means and goals of punishment , goes beyond
regulating direct criminal actions , and justifies punishment on the basis of perceived risk alone .
Rehabilitation of offenders is also a paramount governmental interest ; while legislators argue SO laws are issues
of public safety and welfare , there is virtually no evidence to support their notion these laws work as intended ,
which is integral to any claim of legitimate interest .
There are a myriad of studies available on each SO law to
supplement such arguments .
Sex offender laws “ shock the conscience , ” a term meaning a law is so onerous it literally shocks human logic and
reason .
Emphasize the uniqueness of the SO Laws -- many of the laws are exclusive to sex offenders .
Convincing the judge the disputed law is indeed punitive opens the case to the constitutional safeguards people
have taken for granted .
( CNN ) -- Australian commandos have killed a Taliban chief blamed for numerous attacks on coalition troops in southern Afghanistan , including one that killed an Australian soldier last week , the country 's defense ministry announced .
Australian soldiers of NATO - led International Security Assistance Force patrol in Uruzgan province in 2007 .
The death of Mullah Abdul Rasheed " is a significant achievement for the Special Operations Task Group , " Australian Lt. Gen.
Mark Evans said in a statement over the weekend announcing the attack .
Australia 's military called Rasheed a " senior commander " in the Taliban , the Islamic fundamentalist militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan .
Among the attacks he was blamed for was a January 4 rocket attack that killed Australian Pvt. Gregory Sher , who was buried Sunday in Melbourne .
The NATO - led International Security Assistance Force said Rasheed helped bring jihadist volunteers into Afghanistan and planned roadside bombings that killed several coalition troops .
He was killed in a combination ground raid and airstrike in Afghanistan 's Oruzgan province on Wednesday , the allied command in Kabul announced .
" Together with ISAF Forces and the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan , we have significantly disrupted insurgent operations in Oruzgan province , " Evans said .
A U.S. - led invasion toppled the Taliban after its allies in the al Qaeda terrorist network attacked New York and Washington in 2001 , killing nearly 3,000 people .
But coalition forces have been battling a Taliban resurgence in southern Afghanistan in recent years , with more than 150 U.S. and allied troops killed in the past six months .

Wal - Mart 's GOP outreach director to be charged with wire fraud in Abramoff scandal John Byrne
Published : Monday November 24 , 2008
Print This Email This Wal - Mart 's former Republican outreach director will be charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud , the next to fall in a long list of current and former lobbyists linked to the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , according to court documents filed last week .
Abramoff , formerly a powerful Republican lobbyist for the Miami - based Greenberg Traurig lawfirm , is now serving a jail sentence for bribing public officials .
James Hirni will be charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud , according to papers filed by the Justice Department in U.S. District Court cited by Roll Call Sunday .
Hirni was an executive director for Wal - Mart 's Republican outreach effort .
Hirni is accused of providing a former Republican congressional aide Trevor Blackann with a trip to the World Series in 2003 , including airfare , tickets , a souvenir jersey and other entertainment .
The total value of the gifts was more than $ 1,000 ; Blackann is a former aide to Missouri Republican Sen. Kit Bond and GOP Rep. Roy Blunt .
In exchange , " Blackann agreed to provide favorable official action to , and to use their influence on behalf of , defendant Hirni , " two other individuals and an unnamed equipment rental company , according to court documents .
The company was United Rentals .
" They wanted action on an amendment to a federal highway reauthorization bill that would have encouraged state public works agencies to rent , rather than buy , construction equipment , " wrote TPM's Zachary Roth Friday .
" That would clearly have benefited United Rentals . "
The former Greenberg Traurig lobbyist once said that those who opposed Wal - Mart 's labor practices were opposed to capitalism .
" It 's the No. 1 company in the world and is doing nothing else than running a business and helping folks buy quality products at lower prices , " Hirni said in 2005 .
" All that gets you in Washington is attacked by everybody else .
Wal - Mart has been under constant attack for the past two years , by the unions , its competitors , by those that oppose capitalism . "
Hirni spokesman 's told Roll Call he 's cooperating with the Justice Department .
" He regrets one single instance as a first - time lobbyist over five years ago when a mistake in judgment by agreeing to a client 's request led to an unfortunate chain of events on one evening , " spokesman Scott Sobel said .
" Jim has acknowledged his role and the involvement of those responsible for that incident . "
Sobel said Hirni is a former Abramoff lobbying " associate " but was not employed by Abramoff at the time of the incident .
Hirni told his alma mater 's magazine in 2007 that he felt sorry for Abramoff .
" It 's sad to see what has happened to Jack and to his family , " Hirni remarked .
" It underscores the point I made previously about appearances and ethics .
You have to be straightforward in how you do business .
You always want to make sure you follow the rules that are in place , and you make sure you do things on the most ethical , up - and - up level .
I hate to see what 's happened to him ; it has been an ugly three years .
This town is still going through the reverberations of what has gone on .
It 's a valuable lesson . "

The United Nations has now called for a ceasefire in the Israeli war on Gaza , which is probably a sign that it will wind down not so long from now .
Despite assurances given by outgoing US Secretary of State Condi Rice to her colleagues that the US would sign off on the resolution , in the end the US simply abstained .
She appears to have been ordered into this humiliating about - face by W. when she made the mistake of phoning him before the vote .
The lack of unanimity may weaken the force of the measure , but it nevertheless is a signal that Israel ’s freedom of movement is now going to be increasingly constrained .
Since the Bush administration is diplomatically challenged , the primary work on the resolution was done by Egypt and Britain , among others .
It was little noticed that China dared break with Washington on the need for a ceasefire even before Thursday ’s vote .
Chinese special envoy for the Middle East Sun Bi Gan said , according to Xinhuanet ,
‘ “ The Gaza conflict proves again that military means are not the way out for resolving Palestinian - Israeli disputes .
Military force could only bring more hostility and enmity , without giving either side absolute safety , ” he said .
Sun said international society and relevant parties , when endeavoring to ease the tense situation , should also consider carrying out feasible actions to accelerate the Palestinian - Israeli peace talks , to establish an independent Palestinian state at an early date , and to realize peaceful coexistence . ‘
So China ’s explicit position is the early announcement of a Palestinian state , and immediate talks to that end .
At the moment , China is the Dennis Kucinich of Middle Eastern diplomacy .
But as it rises as a great power , and given that it is the second largest petroleum importer in the world after the US–and so increasingly close to Saudi Arabia , Sudan and Iran , it may be come a player over time .
China is usually so taciturn in these matters that I was surprised to see Sun Bi Gan speak out forcefully and before he had the cover of a UN Security Council resolution .
Less surprising is that France and Russia had begun calling for a ceasefire .
Both have long been assertive in foreign policy , unlike the Chinese .
Israel ’s immediate reaction to the ceasefire call was to intensify its bombardment of Gaza .
The Israeli leadership thinks of itself as in a race against time to destroy as much of Hamas and its infrastructure as possible before they are forced to implement a ceasefire .
The US was earlier helping prolong the campaign , but even the tepid abstention at the UN , which allowed the ceasefire call to go through , shows an increasing impatience of Washington with Israel ’s tactics .
I do n’t know of any analyst of counter - insurgency techniques who thinks Israel ’s blunt instruments are suited to effectively removing Hamas in anything but the short term .
Aside from the argument from inefficacy , there are troubling ethical issues in the way Israel has proceeded .
The best explanation for why Israel is on weak ground in its current operation appeared as a letter to the editor at the New York Times .
Columnist Nicholas Kristoff had written that “ Israel ’s right to do something does n’t mean it has the right to do anything . ”
A Marine who had recently gotten out the the service and had served in Iraq vehemently agreed with this sentiment :
‘ I am dismayed by the rhetoric from US politicians and pundits to the effect that “ if the US were under rocket attack from Mexico or Canada , we would respond like the Israelis ” .
This a gross insult to US servicemen ; I can assure you that we would NOT respond like the Israelis …
Israel has indeed taken a small number of casualties from Hamas rocket fire ( about 20 killed since 2001 ) , but we have taken thousands of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan , including many civilian personnel .
Hundreds of American casualties have occurred due to indirect fire , often from mortars .
This is particularly true in or near the Green Zone in Baghdad .
This fire often originates from densely populated urban areas .
Americans do not , I repeat DO NOT , respond to that fire indiscriminately .
When I say “ indiscriminately ” , I mean that even if we can precisely identify the source of the fire ( which can be very difficult ) , we do not respond if we know we will cause civilian casualties .
We always evaluate the threat to civilians before responding , and in an urban area the threat to civilians is extremely high .
If US servicemen violate those rules of engagement and harm civilians , I assure you we do our best to investigate — and mete out punishment if warranted .
There are differing opinions on the conflict in Iraq , but I am proud of the conduct of our servicemen there .
With that in mind , I find the conduct of the Israeli army in Gaza to be brutal and dishonorable , and it is insulting that they and others claim that the US military would behave in the same way .
I know the Israelis are operating under difficult circumstances , but their claim that they follow similar rules of engagement rings hollow ; I see little evidence for this claim given the huge number of civilian casualties they have caused from indirect fire . ‘
I think the writer has a point , though he is probably exaggerating the difference between the US military in Iraq and the Israeli military in Gaza .
But it is true that in November 2004 before the Marines went into Fallujah after fundamentalist guerrillas , they allowed and even encouraged civilians to leave the city ; of 200,000 or so , fewer than 10 percent chose to stay .
In contrast , Israel has the Gazans bottled up and would never consider allowing the civilians to come in Israel to stay in tent cities while Gaza was being bombarded .
Israel thus insisted that the civilian population remain in the line of fire , in a way that the Marines did not do with regard to Fallujah .
Indeed , letting so many people depart was contradictory to the war aim of killing or capturing as many guerrillas as possible , since the smart ones put on civvies and slipped out with the women and children .
That was a price the Marine commanders were willing to pay to reduce civilian casualties .
Likewise , in August of 2004 when the US military waa battling the Mahdi Army in Najaf , it stopped firing when Grand Ayatollah Sistani sent tens of thousands of civilians walking into the city center .
If a Palestinian cleric convinced tens of thousands of civilians to stream into Gaza City and they were in the way of the Israeli war aims , they would likely just be mown down .
Note that I am not alleging , and neither is the letter writer , that Israeli troops are deliberately killing civilians .
I am alleging that Israeli troops do n’t care very much if they happen to kill civilians while getting at what they think of as Hamas targets .
They are not doing due diligence to avoid civilian deaths and casualties .
The difference between Israeli military action in Gaza and most US operations in Iraq is not a matter of national character or some other essentialist attribute .
It is the difference between imperial occupation for specific purposes and settler colonialism .
The Israelis are both an army and a settler movement .
The US never considered flooding Iraq with colonists from Alabama and Mississippi .
When threatened by an indigenous population trying to expel it , settler colonialism is vicious .
It is after all facing an existential threat .
The US can withdraw from Iraq with no dire consequences to the US .
In 1954 - 1962 , the French killed at least half a million , and maybe as much as 800,000 Algerians , out of a population of 11 million .
That is between nearly 5 percent and nearly 10 percent !
The French military had been enlisted to fight for the interests of the colonists , who were in danger of losing everything .
( In the end they did lose almost everything , being forced to return to Europe , or choosing to do so rather than face the prospect of living under independent Algerian rule ) .
The brutality with which the British put down the Mau - Mau revolt in Kenya in the 1950s is another example of massive human rights violations on behalf of a settler population .
This latest sanguinary episode is a further manifestation of Israel ’s insecure brand of settler colonialism , in which the lives of the indigenous population are viewed as worthless before the interests of the colonists .
The Israelis have not killed on the French scale , but I would argue that they kill , and disregard civilian life , for much the same reasons as the French did in Algeria .
Settler colonialism is unstable in the contemporary world because of the facilities subject populations have for mobilization and resistance .
Conflict between colonizer and colonized has only ended in one of three ways :
1 ) The expulsion of the colonists , as in Algeria ; 2 ) the integration of the colonists into a nation that includes the indigenous population , as happened in South Africa ; or 3 ) the expulsion of the indigenous population , as with the Trail of Tears in the nineteenth - century United States .
Bob Simon told Charlie Rose that the ‘ two - state solution ’ in Israel - Palestine is dead , which is likely correct .
He suggested that the most likely outcome is Apartheid .
However , I would argue that Apartheid is a phase and its itself an unstable situation , and that only one of the above three outcomes is actually permanent .
Given that the Arabs are becoming more technologically sophisticated and wealthier over time , and given their demographic advantage , I do not expect a trasnferist or trail of tears policy to be implemented or succeed .
In the long term , over several decades , I think either there will be a gradual outflow of Israeli emigrants that leaves Jews a plurality in Israel .
Or there will eventually be a single state .
The other possibilities , of either a century - long Apartheid or another expulsion of Palestinians a la 1948 seem to me less likely .
The Gaza operation is intended to extend the life of an incipient Apartheid .
But that is sort of like giving a heart transplant to a man diagnosed with terminal cancer .

Watch the jQuery Ajax spy screencast ( Alternative flash version )
QuickTime version is approximately 45 Mb , flash version is streaming .
View the demo used in the screencast ( view the source for the Ajax response )
Breaking down the problem
My key priority for me , when I ’m writing code that will make Ajax hits , is that where possible , I ’m throttling the number of hits .
By this I mean , I ’m only performing Ajax requests when I absolutely have to .
To achieve this , I ’ll show you in the code where I have created a hidden store of the Ajax response that I use to populate the spy at the preset interval .
This gives the impression of real - time data .
It ’s almost real - time , and since we ’re not working with finance systems or data that absolutely has to be real - time , it ’s acceptable .
The way this is achieve is that we create a hidden store , in our case a ul element , and collecting the Ajax results in the ul .
At the same time , the spy is requesting the latest ( i.e. the top ) li element in our store .
When the store gets down to the last item , it refills itself .
It might sound a bit fiddly , but it ’s a very straight forward change to the previous spy .
Here ’s a visualisation of , roughly , what ’s going on :
HTML
As per the original spy , we simply prepare a contain ( prefill for those without JS ) of latest products :
< ul class= " spy " > < li > <!-- contents of list item --> </li > </ul >
Server Side
I ’ve created a dummy server spy which you can view the source for .
It ’s nothing special , and for the demo , does n’t use a database .
It creates an array of data , randomises it and then loops through 5 of the results returning HTML .
In a production environment , I would expect this to make use of the database , and grab perhaps slightly more items to show in the spy .
j Query ( changes )
Since our starting point is the simple spy , I wanted to show where you need to make adjustments to ajaxify the script .
You may want to download the original simple spy .
Creating the Store
The first job is create the ‘ caching ’ store that will hold the Ajax results , and will refill itself when it ’s almost empty .
With in the plugin code ( but before return this .each ( ) ) we create a new function .
It needs to achieve the following tasks :
Return the lastest / top item from the store .
Remove that top item from the store .
If we ’re returning the last item from the store , refill via an Ajax hit
function getSpyItem ( $ source ) { // find all the li direct descendants in the store ( $ source is a ul ) var $items = $ source.find ( '> li ' ) ; // if we only have 1 left , we need to do an ajax hit to get more if ( $items.length == 1 ) { // do an hit to get some more // see playschool : ajax load for a screencast on .load $ source.load ( 'ajax-spy-helper.php ' ) ; } else if ( $items.length == 0 ) { // if there are none left , then return false and handle it properly .
return false ; } // grab the first item , and remove it from the $ source return $ items.filter ( ': first ' ) .remove ( ) ; }
Changing the Spy Function
Originally the spy cached a copy of all the li elements and looped round them .
We had a bit of logic to handle tracking whether we reached the end or not .
With the Ajax version we do n’t need any of this code – since our store should be infinite ( since we ’re getting it live from the server ) .
Where we had this code :
var $ insert = $ ( items[currentItem ] ) .css ({ // ...
Which reads the items array , we ’ll change this to use the getSpyItem function :
var $ item = getSpyItem ( $ source ) ; // $ source is declared early ( see below ) if ( $item != false ) { // i.e. there 's a result to work with var $ insert = $ item.css ( { // ... }
We will also remove the currentItem logic within the spy function ( and remove the declarations too – i.e. var currentItem since we do n’t need it anymore ) .
Initialising the Spy
Now that our code is nearly ready , we need to make sure we initialise properly .
The tasks we have left are :
Create the store , and save it in the $ source variable ( as used above )
Only show li according to the limit , and move the remainder in to the $ source ul element .
Within the this.each ( ) initialisation block , we ’ll create our store , at the same time we hide it and append it to the DOM :
var $ source = $ ( ' < ul />') . hide ( ) .appendTo( ' body ' ) ;
Then change :
$ list.find ( '> li' ) . filter ( ': gt ( ' + ( limit - 1 ) + ' ) ') .remove ( ) ;
To the following , so that the ‘ left over ’ elements are in the store , ready to be grabbed in getSpyItem :
$ list.find ( '> li' ) . filter ( ': gt ( ' + ( limit - 1 ) + ' ) ') . appendTo( $source ) ;
And that ’s it !
And Finally …
We can add a mouse over to pause the spy .
It ’s very simple .
In the spy function , we wrap the logic that grabs new items with :
if ( running ) { // rest of spy code
However , make sure the setTimeout recursive call is outside this if statement so that it keeps checking .
Then we bind two custom events to the spy in the initialisation phase of the plugin :
$ list. bind ( ' stop ' , function ( ) { running = false ; } ) . bind ( ' start ' , function ( ) { running = true ; } ) ;
And finally , when we attach our plugin , we can trigger the stop and start events when the mouse enters and leaves ( note I ’m using enter / leave rather than in / out ) :
$ ( 'ul.spy ' ) .simpleSpy ( ) . bind ( ' mouseenter ' , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . trigger ( ' stop ' ) ; } ).bind(' mouseleave ' , function ( ) { $ ( this ) . trigger ( ' start ' ) ; } ) ;

A leader of Michigan State University ’s ( MSU ’s ) student government faces suspension for " spam " after she carefully selected and e-mailed about 8 percent of the school ’s faculty members encouraging them to express their views about changes to the freshman orientation and academic calendars .
With the blessing of one of MSU ’s formal committees , MSU junior Kara Spencer notified 391 faculty members about pending changes to the university calendar .
On September 4 , 2008 , the central administration had notified the faculty that next year ’s Academic Calendar and Fall Welcome ( freshman orientation ) each would be shortened by two days , and MSU ’s central administration was giving the campus only until September 30 to comment .
Given the short time frame offered for discussion and the fact that the changes were highly controversial , members of the Associated Students of Michigan State University ( ASMSU ) and the University Committee on Student Affairs ( UCSA ) had held an emergency meeting on September 11 to tackle the issue .
The UCSA includes students , several faculty members , and several MSU administrators .
Following the meeting , this group engaged in a cooperative e-mail discussion about the content and recipients of a coordinated response .
On September 14 , Spencer notified the group that she would be sending her version of the group ’s response as " an informational email " in her own name .
She noted that she had " compiled a database of all faculty on campus " for this purpose .
None of the faculty members or administrators involved in the discussion complained about this plan .
According to Spencer , on or about September 15 , she then carefully selected about 391 faculty members out of MSU ’s approximately 5,000 faculty , and she e-mailed the 391 faculty members her version of the letter that the group of students , faculty , and administrators had written .
The letter stated concerns about the short amount of time given to the MSU community to consider the changes , " which will greatly affect both faculty and students alike , " and called for " an inclusive dialogue among members of the University community " prior to adoption of the changes .
The letter added : " Given the immediacy of the situation , we request that any faculty wishing to be heard on this issue contact their Faculty Council representative or the Provost ’s office . "
Shortly thereafter , Professor Katherine Gross complained about receiving this e-mail to Information Technology administrator John Gorentz .
Gorentz forwarded the complaint to MSU Network Administrator Randall J. Hall .
On September 16 , Hall sent Spencer an e-mail summoning her to a mandatory meeting " for investigation " of her e-mail .
The next day , Hall alleged that Spencer had violated three MSU policies by sending what he called unauthorized " SPAM . "
Hall even suggested that all unsolicited e-mails , as well as junk mail , billboards , and posters , are " considered a disruption of the activities of the person receiving the email . "
Spencer ’s ordeal has continued for over two months .
After she requested a hearing before the MSU Student - Faculty Judiciary , FIRE wrote MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon , calling on her to end the unconstitutional investigation of Spencer .
MSU chose to proceed with the hearing , however , on December 2 .
The Judiciary ’s verdict is expected early next week .
Threatening a senior member of the student government with suspension for sending noncommercial , relevant e-mails to faculty members is outrageous .
As the Supreme Court held in Garrison v. Louisiana , " speech concerning public affairs … is the essence of self - government " and " debate on public issues should be uninhibited , robust , and wide - open . "
MSU is teaching students that they challenge the administration ’s plans at their peril .
It is not too late for President Simon to step in and declare that when it comes to freedom of expression , there is simply nothing to investigate .
President Simon can be reached at 517-355-6560 or presmail@msu.edu .

2008 – what a year !
As we get ready to draw the curtains on one of the most unsettling economic years in history , we the writers of the Inspired Economist are still wondering … was this year one that has left our battered economy begging for inspiration ?
Or have the sustainable events of 2008 spearheaded the initiation of what we believe is truly an Inspired Economy ?
2008 was about the $ 700 billion bailout .
Foreclosures .
The plummeting stock market .
As the year came to a close , the nation ’s economic turmoil battled with the presidential election .
But it was also a time when new businesses were born into what appears to be an unprecedented sustainability boom .
When energy , economy and environment have taken on a new and inter-dependent definition .
As we position our economy to take off on this inspiring eve of the Obama generation , let ’s reflect on the change that has come into play this year … …
The First Quarter
The first quarter of the year saw the idea of social entrepreneuring take flight beyond the borders of America .
Cover of Jeffery Sach ’s book Common Wealth
It was also the time when the Center for Resource Solutions launched the Environmental Tracking Network of North America – North America ’s first network organization for renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions tracking systems and registries .
Check out John - Paul ’s posts :
The Second Quarter
Recognizing difficult times ahead for the U.S. consumer , Capital One developed the MoneyWi$e program to provide consumers with variety of free , multilingual financial education materials to guide them in making smart financial choices .

Visionary business leaders informed the world that the ability to absorb and manage change is widening the gap between winners and losers in the global economy .
CEOs reported a surprising level of optimism about change as an opportunity to build new competitive advantage .
Fortuitous words for the Obama campaign …
The Third Quarter
The third quarter saw the economic tidal wave actually garnering destructive energy starting with Freddie , Fannie In Trouble .
In no time , the word on the street was that “ America Has a Spending Problem . ”
The Economic Meltdown
Chris and Reenita put together a wonderful series of posts about the Wall Street debacle and how it brought down the house of cards that was once considered a prosperous economy :
Amiel brought to light a social economic model known as the ‘ Base of the Pyramid , ’ an analogy to describe the world ’s population in terms of tiers of the world economic pyramid .
The Base of the Pyramid
At the apex lie middle and upper class members of developed nations , and at the base , the four billion poorest people , with an annual per capita of less than $ 1500 .
For those of you who have not read his series , they make for a wonderful read :
The topic of renewable energy also began to heat up in the third quarter .
As America drew closer to the U.S. Presidential elections , Sarah showed us how other nations got in on the act :
The Fourth Quarter
In the fourth and final quarter of the year , the walls of the so - called steady state economy began tumbling down redefining capitalism as we knew it .
‘ Bailout ‘ proved to the catchphrase .
First for Wall Street …
Wall Street Bull
And then as Orion and Fred showed us , for the auto industry too …
The fourth quarter painted a dismal economic scenario in more ways than one .
Starbucks coffee came under the radar for greenwashing .
Holiday spending looked worse than it had in years and even charity took on a negative meaning as it funded terrorist attacks on Mumbai , in perhaps the hugest defiance to capitalism since 9/11 .
Green Collar Economy
But amidst the gloom , we could see the shining promise of a new green economy :
Barack Obama ’s election to presidency only deepened stamp on the change that had already begun .
Wind Energy
Maryanne , Ramsay and Leah ’s posts showed us how the new President - elect is providing the inspiration that America is looking for to get back onto its feet :
CalCars PHEV Prius
Jeff and Orion ’s posts demonstrate how this change is happening not just in America , but all over the world … .
So amidst a scenario of doom and gloom , there is definite promise of a new and green tomorrow .
Melamine Testing
Thank you Amiel , Mike , Brenda and Lisa for shedding light on the various sustainable economic tools , ideas and events that will make our world a safer , healthier and more efficient place … .

The new Inspired Economy promises to be a place where all of us can aspire to be more like Superman with our own unique effort to save the planet .
Talk about a year of inspiration !
Happy Holidays to all of our readers .
Thank you for inspiring us to build the premier blog on the Economics of Sustainability .
May the new year give us all the chance to collectively take the action that beckons a truly Inspired Economy in 2009 !

Today America Celebrates Ben Franklin ’s 304th Birthday
By George Rohrbacher , NORML Board of Directors , medical marijuana patient
Of all of America ’s Founding Fathers , only Benjamin Franklin was a signer of all three of our country ’s essential documents , The Declaration of Independence , the Treaty that ended the Revolutionary War and the United States Constitution .
Benjamin Franklin was also the only Founding Father who actively campaigned against the institution of slavery .
As a scientist , Benjamin Franklin , the man who learned to control lightning , was as revered and world - famous in his day , as Einstein was in his .
Franklin , among many other things , gave us the conceptual framework we still use every time we think about things electrical .
He was the first to describe electricity as having positive and negative charges .
Ben Franklin ’s fingerprints are everywhere one looks in 21st Century .
Ben Franklin has often been called “ the first American ” , because , in so many ways , he embodied the brash new nation he helped create .
His talents as an inventor and scientist are legendary .
Consider a few of the useful creations that Ben left us : bifocal glasses , the wood stove and the lightning rod .
They were all inventions he chose not to patent because he saw they were so potentially useful to the general public .
They were among his many gifts to humanity .
As the statesman , Ben Franklin was as essential to creating our new nation , as was George Washington , the soldier .
Franklin ’s unique combination of charm , celebrity and brilliance brought France in on our side of the Revolutionary War with the troops , navy and money necessary for us to win .
As a proud citizen of a free society , Ben ’s genius also flourished with his social inventions like the volunteer fire department , the lending library , the community hospital and , what has become , the University of Pennsylvania .
As a writer , his prime work is The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin , a bestseller , never out of print since it was written , nearly 250 years ago .
It is the true story of a runaway printer ’s apprentice who , at the age of 17 , stole himself from his older brother to whom he was indentured until he was 21 years old .
Franklin ’s Autobiography is the original blueprint to the ‘ American Dream ’ of how to become a self - made man .
Horatio Alger and Dale Carnegie , are simply Ben ’s 19th and 20th Century adherents and proselytizers .
Today in the 21st Century , self - help books cover whole walls in bookshops .
Franklin was the author the world ’s very first best - selling book in the self - help genre .
I made a few comments at NORML ’s National Conference at the 2008 conference about why I believe that NORML is a legitimate offspring of Ben Franklin ’s social genius .
On my flight home , I looked out the airplane window and I saw Ben waving back at me .
I was seated aft of the wings , watching the flaps extend to slow the aircraft for landing .
I noticed from each of the tailing edges of the wing ’s struts , there was a little antenna - looking thing , about as long as a ballpoint pen .
I wondered , were those things some version of Ben Franklin ’s lightning rod ?
The flight attendants could n’t tell me , but I collared a pilot and asked him .
“ You bet , ” he answered , “ those are kind of negative lightning rods .
As the air rushes over the wings , these little rods help drain off any charges the airplane builds up flying .
With those little rods dissipating the plane ’s electrical charge , they make aircraft far less likely to be hit by lightning . ”
Yes , kindly old Benjamin Franklin had been looking back at me from the tailing edge of that wing strut , after all .
Ben Franklin was born in Boston , Massachusetts in Jan 17 , 1706 , in an age dark with superstition and just fourteen short years after the Salem witch trials had been held .
Not only were witches seen as real , witches were so greatly feared they were seen as needing execution by pressing , drowning , burning and hanging , or all of the above .
Natural phenomena were so poorly understood that the Devil often got the blame for their occurrence .
For example , if lightning struck your house or barn , it was seen as a sign that you deserved it .
People might stand back let your lightning - struck building burn , as God intended , and work to save only “ innocent ” buildings around it .
Franklin ’s revelation , and kite - in - the - thunderstorm proof , was that the lightning in the clouds was the very same stuff as the static electricity created by brushing your hair or rubbing your socks on the carpet , just present in vastly larger quantities .
It was also Franklin ’s brilliant and revolutionary deduction that one could safely discharge lightning striking a building by channeling the charge down a wire to a rod buried three feet into the ground , still a foundation of today ’s international fire protection codes .
By explaining and controlling one of nature ’s most fearsome phenomenons , Ben Franklin ’s elegant gift to humanity of the knowledge of what lightning really was , swept away before it countless generations of hocus pocus , superstition and ignorance on the subject .
After arriving as a runaway youth in Philadelphia with nothing more than two loaves of bread under his arms while eating a third , and through the full employment of his wits and ambition , by the age of 35 , Ben Franklin was a rich man .
He was a great success as a businessman , both printer and publisher .
Along the way , Ben Franklin also invented franchising as a way to speed the creation of his wealth .
By hiring and training the very best and brightest employees he could find , and then sending them off to other colonies with the capital sufficient to set up Franklin - style print shops there , they created a sizable income stream that was sent back home to Philadelphia .
Ben was soon financially set up for his new life as one of the great scientists and statesmen of modern history .
By the age of 42 Ben retired from business for good .
The invention of science has always been regarded as one of mankind ’s greatest achievements ;
Ben Franklin soon became one of the history of science ’s great practitioners .
At the age of 47 , Ben was awarded the Copley Medal , his era ’s equivalent of a Nobel Prize in Physics .
In 1787 , Josiah Wedgewood produced 20,000 of these medals in porcelan and sent one of them to Ben Franklin , who said he was tormented by doubts while looking at it .
But of all the gifts Ben Franklin left the modern world , one of the most precious and productive , and something he is rarely credited with as its inventor , is the service club , the voluntary association of free people who come together and , by joint action , make their communities better … you know — the Kiwanis Club , Rotary , NORML !
Ben Franklin , as a young printer , started such a club , the prototype of all future service clubs and nonprofits .
It was called , Junto .
They met every Friday night in a room above a tavern .
It is during these club meetings where the first lending library came to life , the University of Pennsylvania , the volunteer fire department and the community hospital got their legs under them .
Junto was the place where good ideas became community action ; this is Ben Franklin ’s brilliant organizational legacy that led directly to NORML .
Well , just how well are we modern day folks at NORML caring for Ben ’s precious intellectual legacy ?
First , the Great Experimenter would probably ask , “ How is the experiment going ? ” NORML ’s website could connect him with 17,000 peer - reviewed scientific studies in the burgeoning field of Cannabinoid / endocannabinoid research and to 2,500 cataloged articles from the general press on the subject of marijuana .
As a writer , publisher and businessman , Ben Franklin would revel in the world - wide web and its potential .
NORML ’s website and blog are visited by up to 40,000 people every day , about 4 million unique visitors per year .
Our website is stocked with over 10,000 pages of closely vetted information on the subject of marijuana , and from our online lending library of information , each day , every single day , the public downloads and prints off , in their own homes and offices , between 1.25 - to - 1.5 million pages from NORML ’s website !
That makes it about 10 - million pages per week , or 500 million pages per year — all printed off by the end - user without requiring a single postage stamp for delivery !!!
( A penny saved is still a penny earned — just as Poor Richard taught us so many years ago . )
I think old Ben would be very proud of NORML for this wonderfully frugal , but revolutionary and growing success in the world of information dissemination .
The scientific method and proper intellectual rigor applied to the problems at hand were extremely important to Ben Franklin , all throughout his long life ; these are organizational values that have been instilled since the beginning of NORML by our Board of Directors .
In addition to our well - known legal tradition and the support of the over 550 attorneys of NORML ’s Legal Committee ; NORML ’s scientific tradition forms the second , interlocking intellectual backbone of our organization .
In the nearly 40 years of NORML ’s existence , many luminaries in the area of science and science education have served / or are serving on the NORML ’s Board of Directors .
Here is just a small sampling from the long distinguished list of men and women of science who have helped make NORML what it is today : Dr. Benjamin Spock , M.D. , the ground - breaking and best - selling pediatrician ; Dr. Andrew Weil , M.D. , world - recognized pioneer in alternative medicine ; Dr. Kary Mullis , PhD. , Nobel Laureate Chemistry 1992 , for work upon which is based all DNA replication and cataloguing work that has been done since ; Dr. Louis Lasagna , M.D. , the first scientist to prove experimentally that the placebo effect was real ; Dr. Lester Grinspoon , M.D. , Professor of Psychiatry Emeritus , Harvard Medical School ; Dr. John P. Morgan , M.D. , Professor of Pharmacology and a noted Pharmaco - ethnomusicologist ; and Ann Druyan , President of Cosmos Studios , and co-writer and co-producer with her late husband , Carl Sagan , of the beloved Emmy and Peabody Award winning Cosmos Series for PBS .
NORML Board Members , all .
Yes , indeed , I think Ben Franklin would be very proud to have spawned NORML , just as we are , proud to be Ben ’s offspring .
HAPPY 304th BIRTHDAY , BEN !
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING !
LET FREEDOM RING !

And now a quick word from our sponsors !
SHOP OUR VIBES :
Mr Rowlands had packed away his favourite things in the chest when the Second World War broke out and kept them in there but never told anyone of the wonderful array of 1920s and 30s games , wooden toys and animals .
" It is not realistic to believe that the U.S. Congress will seriously consider any broad - based debate on the legalization of narcotics , " Cook added .
" That position is not consistent with the community standards both locally and nationally . "
[ El Paso Times ]
Total chaos has erupted in El Paso , TX following a city council resolution calling for an open dialogue about drug legalization .
The mayor promptly vetoed it , and lots of angry people are talking about how we should n’t talk about this .
To understand how little it takes to drive drug war supporters completely insane , watch El Paso City Rep.
Beto O’Rourke ’s impressively reasonable argument for a dialogue on our drug policy .
All he ’s saying is that we should talk about drug policy options and try to address ongoing problems .
And to that , the mayor replied … VETO !
Here is the totality of El Paso Mayor John Cook ’s argument for not talking about drug legalization :
If this sounds familiar , it ’s because enemies of the drug war debate have been insisting for years that there ’s nothing to talk about .
It ’s weird too because if they ’re so sure Congress will never do it , then there ’s really no good reason to obstruct the conversation .
What are they afraid of ?
Of course , the downside of claiming a monopoly on reality and refusing to debate is that you look like an idiot .
And that ’s exactly what appears to be happening here , as the mayor ’s allies are refusing to back his veto and the council is pushing for an override .
So all we have to do is win the debate over whether or not to have a debate , and we can finally get around to debating .
I can't wait .
Abbas and a few other early adopters of blog technology worked simultaneously as political advocates and crusading journalists .
In 2006 , Abbas posted cellphone - video footage of a police officer sodomizing a screaming minibus driver with an iron rod , which ultimately led to the officer ’s conviction .
Another prominent blogger and friend of Abbas ’s , a woman in her early 30s named Nora Younis , posted stories about sexual harassment of women who participated in street demonstrations , which helped spur Egypt ’s mainstream media to cover the issue .
( Younis worked briefly for The New York Times as a stringer . )
Political blogs became essential reading for opposition parties ; in 2005 , Al Dustur , a weekly paper opposed to the regime , started a blog page , which reprinted important posts for readers without Internet access .
During the 2005 election campaign , Esraa Rashid started volunteering at the headquarters of El Ghad , a liberal democratic party that was founded in 2004 by Ayman Nour , a wealthy lawyer and member of Parliament .
Nour came in second in the election , behind Mubarak , with 7 percent of the vote ; he is currently in jail for forgery charges that his supporters insist are bogus .
Rashid told me that she loved working at the Ghad office , but she and some of her friends in the youth wing grew impatient with the party bureaucracy .
Like most political parties in Egypt , El Ghad has a strict hierarchy , and before deciding to stage an event , the leaders would carefully weigh a number of factors , including internal office politics and their current standing with the Mubarak regime .
Members of the youth wing , Rashid told me , did n’t have much say in that process , or much interest in the endless deliberations .
So she and some friends turned to Facebook as a quicker , easier way to plan their own events and protests .
Rashid ’s first foray into using Facebook for organizing was to coordinate a small demonstration around the opening of a movie about corruption and torture called “ Heya Fawda ” or “ This Is Chaos . ”
Rashid invited all her friends on Facebook to the event ; they invited more friends ; and in the end , about 100 people showed up .
To Rashid , the event was a huge success ; exhilarated , she and friends from El Ghad planned a few more events the same way .
THEN LAST MARCH , Rashid got a text message on her phone from Maher , the 28 - year - old engineer and activist , suggesting that young Egyptians should do something to support the workers in Mahalla al - Kobra , an industrial town , who were planning to strike on April 6 .
For more than a year , workers around Egypt had been striking , periodically , to protest high rates of inflation and unemployment , but they never coordinated their protests .
Rashid and Maher met when they were both part of the Ghad youth wing , but Maher had left the party to devote himself more fully to the youth movement of Kefaya .
Unlike Rashid , he had been active in street protests and had been arrested .
Rashid loved the idea of doing something to support the workers , and she called Maher immediately .
She suggested they create an open group on Facebook to brainstorm ideas .
On March 23 , Rashid set up the April 6 Strike group on Facebook with herself and Maher as administrators .
Rashid expected this protest would develop more or less like her movie outing .
But almost as soon as she set up the group , there were 16 members ; when she refreshed the page a few minutes later , there were more than 60 .
The next day , more than 1,000 .
Rashid watched with fear and excitement as thousands of people , then tens of thousands , started joining and posting to the group .
Eventually , the number reached 76,000 .
As the group ’s administrators , she and Maher could approve messages as they were posted , and it was their responsibility to delete spam or inappropriate posts ; the two took turns monitoring the site day and night .
The group never developed a unified plan of action for April 6 .
Rashid initially proposed that people stay home and not buy anything in solidarity with the workers — unless they were n’t afraid of protesting , in which case they should take to the streets .
One girl suggested that everyone who protested on the street should give flowers to the security forces to disarm them , an idea Rashid supported .
Maher started sending so many messages to the group that Facebook canceled his account ; the site ’s automated filters presumed him to be a spammer .
That left Rashid as the group ’s sole administrator .
As the April 6 group grew , its call for a strike was endorsed by a variety of groups — political parties , labor groups , the Muslim Brotherhood , student organizations , the Kefaya movement .
On the streets , supporters handed out leaflets and sprayed graffiti to make non-Internet users aware of the action .
Members who identified themselves as government security agents joined the April 6 group , too , posting comments under the insignia of the Egyptian police , and as April 6 approached , the government issued a strong warning against participation in the strike .
Rashid told me that she was scared to go out on the street that day .
She would have stayed home , she said , but she felt she owed it to all the people she ’d been communicating with to come out .
She posted her plans on Facebook ; on the day of the strike , she said , she ’d meet people at the Kentucky Fried Chicken in Tahrir Square downtown .
She told people what she ’d be wearing and gave out her cellphone number .

On April 6 in Mahalla , thousands of workers rioted , tearing down a Mubarak billboard .
There were many arrests and at least three deaths .
When Rashid headed out toward Tahrir Square , she was shocked to see police and military vehicles blocking off streets ; soldiers and police officers , it seemed , were everywhere .
As Rashid approached the Kentucky Fried Chicken , she found it was surrounded by police .
She called some friends and told them to meet her at a nearby cafe to decide what to do next .
Police swept in and arrested Rashid at the cafe ; they took her to jail , where she stayed for more than two weeks .
The monetary regime has changed and , as a result , many people are misinterpreting the recent increase in the monetary base .
Paul Krugman , for example , posts the picture at right .
His interpretation is that the tremendous increase in the base shows that the Fed is trying to expand the money supply like crazy but nothing is happening , i.e. a massive liquidity trap .
( Krugman is not alone in this interpretation , see e.g. this post by Bob Higgs ) .
Thus , Krugman concludes , Friedman was wrong both about monetary history and monetary theory .
Krugman ’s interpretation , however , neglects the fact that the monetary regime changed when the Fed began to pay interest on reserves .
Previously , holding reserves was costly to banks so they held as few as possible .
Since Oct 9 , 2008 , however , the Fed has paid interest on reserves so there is no longer an opportunity cost to holding reserves .
The jump in reserves occurred primarily at this time and is entirely under the Fed ’s control .
The jump in reserves does not represent a massive attempt to increase the broader money supply .
Here ’s a bit more background .
When no interest was paid on reserves banks tried to hold as few as possible .
But during the day the banks needed reserves – of which there were only $ 40 billion or so – to fund trillions of dollars worth of intraday payments .
As
a result , there was typically a daily shortage of reserves which the Fed made up for by extending hundreds of billions of dollars worth of daylight credit .
Thus , in essence , the banks used to inhale credit during the day – puffing up like a bullfrog – only to exhale at night .
( But note that our stats on the monetary base only measured the bullfrog at night . )
Today , the banks are no longer in bullfrog mode .
The Fed is paying interest on reserves and they are paying at a rate which is high enough so that the banks have plenty of reserves on hand during the day and they keep those reserves at night .
Thus , all that has really happened – as far as the monetary base statistic is concerned – is that we have replaced daylight credit with excess reserves held around the clock .
The change does not represent a massive injection of liquidity and the increase in reserves should not be interpreted as evidence of a liquidity trap .
Addendum : ( For the truly wonkish . )
If you want more , see my earlier post on excess reserves , posts by Jim Hamilton , and David Altig , and especially two very useful Fed articles , Keister , Martin , and McAndrews ( n.b. the last section ) and Ennis and Weinberg .

Introduction
Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) , started out in the seventies as NBC ’s Saturday Night , which was their first attempt at an American sketch comedy and variety television series .
The airing started in 1975 and has been on the show ever since , making this one of the longest - running programs on television .
SNL is an NBC fixture and a landmark in the history of American television .
The core concept behind SNL was to be an edgy comedy series with live interviews for factual information and was aimed at the 18 to 34 - year - old age group .
Due to the nature of the series , it constantly attracts new viewers that enter the demographic age group , while retaining its older viewers as loyal fans to the series .
As such , SNL has a constantly growing fan group .
This is a live show and is filmed in front of a studio audience .
The show has a format that starts with an opening sketch and closes with the phrase “ Live from New York ; it ’s Saturday Night ! ” .
The show ’s creators are Dick Ebersol and Lorne Michaels .
Michaels still works as a writer for SNL .
While this is a “ show ” some of the guests do outrageous and on occasions , self - planned actions , such as when Sinead O’Connor tore up the picture of the Pope .
This is also a reason why the show retains its fans , since they know that a lot of the content is not rehearsed , and there is a lot of improvisation on behalf of the presenter .
History
SNL was a product of an evolving change in the Carson show , which ran from 1965 to 175 .
Johnny Carson would run reruns of The Tonight Show on weekends , and he asked for them to be pulled from the weekends and aired on weekdays , which would free up some personal time .
This led Herbert Schlosser , the NBC President in 1974 to request from Dick Ebersol , the NBC VP for late - night programming to come up with a Weekend show .
It was suggested by Barry Diller , a Paramount Pictures executive that Schlosser and Ebersol content Lorne Michaels , which the did .
Michaels and Ebersol then sat down and originated the SNL concept , which was to become a sketch , political satire , and music show .
To kick of SNL in 1975 , Michaels cast into the first line up the first of many actors that SNL would lead into legend status .
This first line up included Dan Aykroyd , John Belushi , Chevy Chase , Jane Curtin , Garrett Morris , Laraine Newman , Michael O’Donoghue , Gilda Radner , and George Coe .
( Note that the first three went on to become famous Hollywood comedy actors )
The original show aired under the name NBC ’s Saturday Night , this was due to the fact that rival network ABC had the SNL title with Howard Cosell .
In 1976 , NBC bought the rights to the name , and this became its official title on March 26 , 1977 .
The first line was critical for the success of the show , and these talented actors and presents created a cult following that propelled SNL into the limelight .
Due to the then extremism of the team in delivering their sketches and satire , many viewers write in with irate requests to terminate the show .
It was Michaels that showed the NBC executive that baby boomers were the future of the shows fan block and not generation x .
As such , rather then bow to the more conservative viewers , the executive continued to air the show .
NBC was not without its egotistical managers that could ruin a career based on nothing but personal perception with total disregard for the ratings or success .
Such was the case with Herminio Traviesas .
Traveisas was both a censor and the vice president of the network ’s Standards and Practices department .
He was irate with Laraine Newman using the term “ pissed off ” on live TV and was going to make it a delayed airing show , but Newman personally apologized to Travaisas , and that wavered the crisis .
In November 1977 Chevy Chase left the show for a few months and was replaced by the then - unknown and young comic actor Bill Murray .
In 1979 , Ackroyd and Belushi left the show , and in 1980 , Michaels was exhausted from writing and asked for a year ’s rest to pursue other career opportunities .
Michales leaving caused an internal rupture with a lot of political backstabbing and wheel dealing , which ended up with mots of the cast and writers leaving with him .
Michael went to Paramount Pictures .
Jean Doumanian was given the new lead writing role for SNL by her friend Barbara Galagher , who was an NBC VP .
Rising Stars in Years of Turmoil
SNL was already known to be a successful springboard for aspiring careers , and it was attracting many amateurs and professional actor ’s attention .
Doumanian was in an impossible situation , she was a successful woman in a chauvinistic environment , and one where the chauvinism was magnified by ego and perceptions of self - importance .
To top all off this off was a massive 65 % reduction in budget , reducing the budget per episode from 1 million to 350 thousand dollars each .
Doumanian was given three months to cast new talent , while surrounded by a current hiatus of actors and crew that resented her presence .
She also managed to cast actors that did not link with either the material or the crew , including Charles Rocket and Ann Risley .
Rocket sealed Doumanian ’s fate when he stated , during one of the live episodes , the word “ fuck . ”
Doumanian was relieved after only 10 months of duty .
The executives wanted to seal SNL ’s fate , but Brandon Tartikoff , the network chief decided that the concept of the show was more important than the cost of the show .
As such , Tartikoff asked Ebersol to take over control , and Ebersol , not being foreign to the intricacies of the politics behind the TV , turned to Michaels to get his approval .
This action gave Ebersol the silence and support of the cast and crew when he started the new season .
Ebersol cast Eddie Murphy , which leads to a successful start , although the material of the show was considered to be a little pale when compared to the original Michaels ’s era .
In 1984 , Murphy left SNL to advance his already budding film career , and this was when Ebersol decided to change the casting concept from hiring unknown aspiring actors to established names .
Ebersol decided to take on Billy Crystal and Martin Short , both of whom had successful careers and brought their personal materials to the show .
This initial season is considered by some to be a golden season in the SNL history , and it was one of the funniest that totally disassociated from the Michaels era .
At roughly the same time , and due to unsuccessful attempts at gaining a foothold into movies and other TV series , Michaels returned to SNL in 1985 and continued with Ebersol ’s concept by casting Robert Downy Jr. , and Joan Cusack , but this time the dream team did n’t provide the results , and the writers also struggled to provide quality material .
Tartikoff was going to cancel the show in the Spring of 1986 but was persuaded by Bernie Brillstein , the producer , to retain a leaner show of 13 episodes instead of 22 .
Due to this , Michaels fired most of the cast and decided to go for unknown aspiring actors as they had done in the past .
This new cast included Phil Hartman and Dana Carvey .
The show ran successfully with this team until 1994 , and the Hartman - Carvey era is considered to be one of the best .
However , in 1994 both stars left the show , and NBC executives started to interfere with the show because they wanted to raise ratings .
This interference came in the form of Don Ohlmeyer , then the NBC West Coast President , who wanted to replace Chris Farley and Adam Sandler because he did n’t “ get them , ” he also criticized the costly nature of a live show .
Ohlmeyer ’s attack cause Michaels to reconsider his position and even though Mike Myers had also left the show in 1995 , he was not persuaded to leave of a lucrative CBS offer .
Michaels was dedicated and loyal to NBC SNL , and he quickly recovered the shows prestige when he cast Jimmy Fallon , Will Ferrell , and Tina Fey .
This did not stop Ohlmeyer from continuing his idiotic attack on Michaels , and this resurfaced in 1997 when he fired SNL writer Jim Downey and the SNL cast actor Norm Macdonald .
The 2018 43rd series cast includes :
Repertory players
Beck Bennett
Aidy Bryant
Michael Che
Pete Davidson
Leslie Jones
Colin Jost
Kate McKinnon
Kyle Mooney
Cecily Strong
Kenan Thompson ( Longest tenured cast actor in SNL history )
Featured players

SNL Curse
Yes , as with many acting venues , the cast is highly superstitious , and SNL does not diverge from this phenomenon .
The SNL curse is based on the fact that since the show started way back in 1975 , nine cast members have died before the age of 60 .
Rather than make a comment about this , I will respect the casts beliefs and the dead ’s honor and just list the names of these nine unfortunate actors :
SNL Cast
The original and founding cast that set of SNL in 1975 included Laraine Newman , John Belushi , Jane Curtin , Gilda Radner , Dan Aykroyd , Garrett Morris , and Chevy Chase .
This team was dubbed the “ The Not Ready for Prime - Time Players ” by one of the original writers , Herb Sargent .
Radner was the second person hired after Michael ’s , and Chevy Chase ( who comes from a very rich family ) only signed a one - year contract , he maintained this desire , so he had the freedom to leave the show whenever a season ended .
Michaels ’s new Newman , and brought him aboard due to this personal acquaintance , and Morris was originally brought in as a writer , but there was a heated relationship between him and another writer , so Michaels had him cast in an acting role instead .
John Belushi , who actually hated TV , only came on because Radner and two writers , Anne Beatts and Michael O’Donoghue persuaded him to join .
Michaels was actually against Belushi ’s inclusion , considering him to be problematic , but the three together with Ebersol persuaded him otherwise .
Bill Murray joined after Chevy Chase left , he was actually one of Michaels ’s first pick ’s but due to budget constraints had to pass him by .
Chase returned in 1978 , but as faced by a resentful team ( did I mention that actors are fickle and egotistical and actually hate anyone else ’s success ? ) .
It was Murray and Belushi that are considered to be the main detractors in this issue , where Murray even came to blows with Chase .
This led Chase to leave the show for good to continue pursuing a successful film career .
Michale became slightly paranoid of his talented cast , and denied Ackroyd the right to go and star in the 1978 film Animal House ( as D - Day ) which is where we find Belushi ’s rise to fame as “ Bluto , ” and Daniel Simpson took on the role of D - Day .
Michaels also refused SNL musician Paul Shaffer to play in the Belushi - Ackroyd hit The Blues Brothers in 1980 .
After this Michaels lost his hold on the cast , where Radner moved onto a successful solo Broadway show , and Murray took on a starring role in Meatballs , a 1979 comedy hit .
It was at this time that Michaels left SNL and Doumanian entered to cast the new season .
As mentioned above , Doumanian faced a very tough time , but she did manage to cast some great actors , and these included Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo , who survived the Ebersol restructuring and firing stage .
It was due to Ebersol ’s decision to keep Murphey , as well as push him forward rather than keep him in the background , which is where he was most of the time in the Doumanian era , gave Murphy the kickstart he needed and also gave Ebersol credit for a perfect season .
Due to Murphy ’s success his movie career also took off , and he starred in many successful films including 48 Hrs. and Trading Place .
In 1984 , Murphy left SNL to pursue his acting career in movies full time .
Between 1983 to 1984 Ebersol recast most of the actors and replaced them with successful comedians including Martin Short and Billy Crystal , their income was also larger ( at the time ) for each season , Crystal was paid $ 25,000 per episode , and Short received $ 20,000 per episode .
When Michaels returned to the show , he cast Robert Downey Jr. , Jon Lovitz , and Dennis Miller , but these three did not bring in a successful rating .
This led Michaels to make his famous 180 degrees turn back to unknown actors in 1986 .
Michaels retained Lovitz , Miller , and Nora Dunn , and added to them , Dana Carvey , Phil Hartman , and Jan Hooks .
This was the early 90 ’s dream team , and he added to this list Mike Myers , Adam Sandler , and Chris Farley .
This engorged cast was partially created due to Michaels ’s paranoia at people leaving for other career opportunities , as such , there was less prime time for each member , and this had a detrimental effect , leading to more actors leaving to find more personal prime time in the film .
The first to go was Carvey and Hartman , followed by Myers and then Sandler and Farley were fired .
This “ wildfire ” of change brought in a new cast , including the popular Will Ferrell , Tina Fey , and Jimmy Fallon .
SNL retained a rather quiet existence until 2013 when it had another major overhaul after Bill Hader , Jason Sudeikis , and Fred Armisen left the show .
Among the 140 cast that flowed through the halls of SNL are many well - known and famous comedians , and actors including Chris Rock , Rachel Dratch , Amy Poehler , Andy Samberg , David Spade , Will Forte , Tracy Morgan , Julia Louis - Dreyfus , Kristen Wiig , Chris Parnell , Maya Rudolph and a plethora of successful talent .
Until 2017 , Darrell Hammond retained the title of a longest cast member , but this was replaced this year ( 2018 ) by Kenan Thompson who now stands with 15 seasons on SNL .
In 2014 , Sasheer Zamata was added to the cast mid-season due to the fan ’s criticism of the show ’s lack of casting an African - American woman .
Cast Prerogatives
What attracts many to SNL beyond the obvious fact that it is a coveted springboard for talent , is that the actors and supporting cast are allowed to be themselves , and show off their talents as they wish .
This is basically a very “ improv ” environment , and it is obvious to see how successful this method is when looking at the long list of famous people that started out their careers or participated in SNL for extended periods of time .
Update Hosts
The weekend update host is a coveted title , and rightly so , many of the actors that continued to successful careers performed in this role , and this includes Chase , Curtin , Murray , Miller , Macdonald , Fey , Fallon , and Poehler .
In this year ’s season , Seth Meyers is the solo host ; he was until now partnered with Cecily Strong .
The Two Tiers
The system is split between established members of the cast as repertory players and the less experienced and fresher faces that are cast as featured players .
A featured player will , if successful , be elevated to the role of repertory player .
Cast Contracts
Initially , the cast was provided with five to six - year contracts , however , in the 1999 - 2000 season , this was changed to a two - year contract .
The new contract basically stated that NBC could offer actors in any sitcom , but an actor only has two strikes , which means that the actor cannot refuse the third NBC offer .
This new contract basically reduced the contract to a potential six - year term where NBC can decide where to put the person .
This drew a lot of criticism since it meant that SNL was only a 2 - year contract , and the overall contract was not 12 years with 6 in SNL and 6 in another sitcom .
The contract also includes a clause that allows actors the right to star in three SNL films , which is a company owned by NBC , Paramount Pictures , and Michaels .
These contracts were the product of NBC ’s experience with actors leaving SNL only to peruse lucrative careers for competing studios .
Cast Income
When SNL started in 1975 , it paid its cast $ 750 per episode .
This rose sharply to $ 2,000 in season two and doubled to 4,000 per episode in season 4 .
In the late 90 ’s the cast income varied between members between $ 5,000 to $ 5,500 per episode , and this increased to $ 6,000 in the second year .
A cast member that worked for five years would earn $ 12,500 per episode .
If an actor wrote a sketch that reached airtime , it would give their writer a $ 1,500 bonus .
In 2001 , Will Ferrell earned $ 350,000 per season , which made him the highest - paid performer in SNL history .
Writers
There is one original writer that started out from the very beginning and continues to date that that is the legendary Lorne Michaels .
During 2018 , the co-writers include Michael Che , Colin Jost , Bryan Tucker , and Kent Sublette .
Colin Jost has been a writer for SNL 13 years now , and stared in 2005 , while Che started in 2013 .
Seth Meyers was a co-head writer between 2005 and 2008 and then became a single head writer until 2012 .
In 2014 he left SNL .
From 2011 the Weekend Update segment employs a dedicated team of writers headed by Alex Baze , who is also the producer .
It is not uncommon for writers to be performers too .
For instance , Jim Downey was a head writer between 1985 and 1994 , and Conan O’Brien is another SNL writer graduate that went on to become famous in his own accord .
Adam McKay and Will Ferrel joined forces to set up a successful online venture with the website “ Funny or Die , ” and Tina Fey started as an SNL writer only to become an SNL performer as well as moving on to perform in films , but her key success was creating and starring in the TV sitcom 30 Rock .
Announcers
Don Pardo is perhaps the longest - serving announcer on TV , I am not sure , but he indefinitely an icon and legend in the world of SNL .
Pardo started as the SNL announcer from its inception in 1975 and continued to announce until his death at the age of 96 in 2014 .
During this long career , Pardo would travel to New York City to work live , which was no mean feat since he lived in Arizona .
Pardo announced continuously , with only one break in the seventh season between 1981 to 1982 when Michaels left the show .
During this time Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan maintained the role .
Pardo did announce his resignation a few times , staring in 2004 , but continued to work until his death in 2014 .
From 20098 till 2014 , due to health issues , Pardo would record some of the shows from his home in Arizona , and in some instances was replaced by Darrell Hammond .
Today , the announcer is Darrell Hammond .
Hosts and musical guests
SNL not just about political satire and news , but is actually all about the guests .
Usually , each episode revolves around a single host that is chosen or their current popularity and ability to be entertaining .
The host of the show will work together with the anchor to provide the opening monologue and will perform in all sketches with the cast .
The host also ends the show with a closing statement .
The first host for SNL in 1975 was George Carlin , and in the third episode was replaced by Candice Bergen .
Hosts come from many professional backgrounds including actors Christopher Walken , Buck Henry , and John Goodman .
There were musicians that included Dolly Parton , and even political activists such as Ralph Nader .
Hosts were not limited to one appearance , and over time some individuals came back to host the show more than five times , which gave them the coveted SNL five - timer club status .
Among some of the famous five - timers are the original fifth timer , Tom Hanks .
The actor Alec Baldwin is the record holder for the most times hosting and reached the esteemed number of seventeen times since 1990 .
Baldwin actually took this title from comedian Steve Martin who had reached 15 times since his first appearance in 1976 .
Musical hosts also hold a coveted role in SNL and returning musical hosts include Dave Grohl who has appeared on 11 episodes .
Musical hosts have to perform live , Michaels does not allow lip - syncing on SNL , Musical hosts will also perform in sketches and in some occasions will also serve as a host .
This rule has only one exception , and that is when the score involves an intense dance routine that would impact on the performer ’s performance .
The lip - syncing rule came into effect immediately , but in 1975 ABBA performed an appearance with lip- syncing , and the 2004 performance by singer Ashlee Simpson drew a lot of controversies .
As such , solo performances are strictly regulated for live performance , and today there are more solo acts than group acts .
In fact , since 2011 the show has opened and closed with a solo host and a solo musician .
The SNL Band
While discussing musicians , it ’s time to mention the SNL band .
This is the “ Live Band ” as it ’s known in the cast and is the house band for SNL .
The first musical director was Academy Award - winning composer Howard Shore who led the band for 5 years from 1975 to 1980 .
Shore also appeared in a number of sketches including the famous Howard Shore and His All - Nurse Band , and the Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol which featured the coast guard chorus in the background .
The SNL live band has featured many musicians in its lineup , and these include :
Paul Shaffer ( 1975 –1980 )
Lou Marini ( 1975 –1983 )
David Sanborn ( 1975 )
Michael Brecker ( early 1980s )
Ray Chew ( 1980 –1983 )
Alan Rubin ( 1975 –1983 )
Georg Wadenius ( 1979 –1985 )
Steve Ferrone ( 1985 )
Tom Malone was the music director between 1981 to 1985 , followed by a ten - year director , G. E. Smith who led the band between 1985 to 1995 .
From 2017 , the band has three leaders ; these are Lenny Pickett from Tower of Power , Leon Pendarvis ; keyboardist , and Eli Brueggemann who does n’t appear on the live shows .
The basic lineup of the band has always included :
3 saxophones ; alto , tenor , and baritone .
1 trombone
1 trumpet ,
1 Piano
1 Hammond Organ
1 Guitar
1 Bass
1 Percussionist
The percussionist was not a permanent feature until 1995 when Valerie Naranjo ’s joined the band .
The role of the band is to support instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks ; as well as musical “ spurts ” with some skits and host punch lines .
SNL Affiliates that do n’t have advertising during interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic .
At the end of every show , the band plays Shore ’s “ Closing Theme ( Waltz in A ) ”
SNL Around the World
Due to the global success of SNL , where many individuals from all around the world tune into watching SNL , the format of the show became a must - have for many countries that sought out , and where the political climate allowed for such a series .
The German SNL was called RTL Samstag Nacht .
It only aired for five years between 1993 and 1998 on RTL Television .
The episodes were hosted by German celebrities and some American celebrities that actually never appeared on SNL in the USA , such as Mel Brooks and Michael Winslow .
The American hosts had a limited time screen due to the language barrier ( not the wall ) .
In Israel Eretz Nehederet ( Wonderful Country ) has been on the air since 2003 .
This is a political satire show more than a musical entertainment one , and it is designed to poke fun at the government including the MK ’s and ministers .
There are numerous musical scores in the show to maintain the comedy / entertainment ratio .
South Korea has an SNL version running since 2013 , and it is now on its fourth season , the show has 20 episodes per season .
SNL the US version is aired in a number of other countries in the Middle East and Asia .
Progressive Jewish Groups See Test in Crisis
Created : December 30 , 2008 08:42 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Dec. 30 , 2008 -- A Palestinian stands on the wreckage of a mosque damaged by Israeli airstrike , at the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza Strip . ( Zuma )
As the Israeli bombardment of Gaza enters its fourth day , there is no shortage of tests .
The wisdom of Israeli strategy is being tested .
The resilience of the Palestinian people is being tested .
The ability of the U.S. and the international community to impose a ceasefire is being tested .
And the might of the new progressive American Jewish infrastructure that emerged in 2008 — unapologetically pro-peace and pro-Israel — is undergoing its own test as well :
How to effectively argue that an Israeli war is counterproductive to Israel ’s long - term security while the bombs are falling .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
“ Absolutely , ” said Jeremy Ben - Ami , executive director of J Street , a new liberal Jewish lobby group .
“ This is a real testing moment for those of us who honestly believe you can be supportive of Israel but questioning of steps its government takes . ”
M.J. Rosenberg , director of policy analysis for the Israel Policy Forum , another progressive Jewish organization , was similarly blunt .
“ It ’s put - up - or - shut - up time , ” he said .
“ For a two - state solution , for the U.S. to be an honest broker — if all of us just sit back and say , ‘ Israel had no choice [ to bomb Gaza ] , then we ’re just a bunch of phonies .
But I do n’t see that happening . ”
As is typical during moments of crisis in the Middle East , the bombing of Gaza quickly led to statements of unambiguous support for Israel from leading American politicians , including from Democrats and progressives .
“ House Majority Leady Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) said , “ Israel is acting in clear self - defense in response to heinous rocket attacks from Hamas - controlled Gaza . ”
Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) , the progressive chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , at least acknowledged the 364 Palestinians killed in Gaza over four days , but only to say , “ The loss of innocent life is a terrible tragedy , and the blame for that tragedy lies with Hamas . ”
The Gaza crisis is the first Israeli - Palestinian emergency since J Street launched in April .
As a self - identified force to shift the American debate on Israel and Palestine to the left , it has not previously had to make its arguments while Israel has been at war .
Usually , when Israel finds itself at war , “ our side gets cowed into silence , ” Ben - Ami , a former domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton , told the Washington Independent in April .
So Gaza is the first test for whether that silence can be broken , and the expected pro-bombing statements made by U.S. politicians and media commentators demonstrates its uphill struggle .
On Sunday afternoon , J Street emailed supporters and asked them to endorse a statement : “ I support immediate and strong U.S. - led diplomatic efforts to urgently reinstate a meaningful ceasefire that ends all military operations , stops the rockets aimed at Israel and lifts the blockade of Gaza .
This is in the best interests of Israel , the Palestinian people and the United States . ”
The appeal was accompanied by an anguished email written by online director Isaac Luria .
“ At this moment of extreme crisis , J Street wants to demonstrate that , among those who care about Israel and its security , there is a constituency for sanity and moderation , ” Luria wrote .
“ There are many who recognize elements of truth on both sides of this gaping divide and who know that closing it requires strong American engagement and leadership . ”
By 5 p.m. Monday , the organization said it had collected 11,870 signatures .
Ben Ami said he would present the petition to the Obama transition team , with which the organization is in talks about appointments to Middle - East policy positions .
For its part , the transition has been circumspect , declining to step on the Bush administration ’s efforts before Obama takes office .
“ President - elect Obama is closely monitoring global events , including the situation in Gaza , but there is one president at a time , ” said Brooke Anderson , the transition ’s chief national - security spokeswoman .
Further steps , Ben Ami said , depend on whether the Israeli campaign winds down or escalates .
But he said that the organization ’s leadership would “ do whole range of media ” appearances in order to demonstrate that “ this organization with strong roots in the pro-Israel community is willing to say , ‘ Let ’s discuss the best way going forward and not blindly go down a path we think is counterproductive . ’ ”
Others discussed next steps already .
Rosenberg anticipated forming a coalition with organizations like J Street and Americans for Peace Now , another progressive Jewish lobby group , as well as progressive Arab - American organizations like the American Task Force on Palestine — which has also called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza — to coordinate messaging and lobbying .
While coordinated efforts have not yet coalesced , some in the progressive Jewish community think that the “ message is getting out there , ” as Ori Nir , spokesman for Americans For Peace Now , put it .
“ It ’s getting reported by Jewish and general media , getting it out to our base , ” Nir said .
“ We sent out yesterday our statement and today an action alert calling on activists to send letters to President Bush urging what the press statement urged , and to President - elect Obama . ”
In the statement , Americans For Peace Now ’s president , Debra DeLee said , “ While we hold – as we always have – that Israel has the right and the obligation to protect its citizens from attack and threats , we know that military power alone will not provide real , long term remedy for the threat that the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip poses to Israel .
Israel needs stability on its border with Gaza .
Such stability can only be achieved through a political process , ” a sentiment echoed by organizations like J Street and the Israel Policy Forum .
Hussein Ibish , a senior fellow with the American Task Force on Palestine , urged progressive Jewish organizations to “ be very clear with their Israeli friends that there is n’t going to be a military solution [ to the conflict ] , just as we are with our Palestinian and Arab friends . ”
But he cautioned that a moment of hostility might not actually be such a proving ground for the new liberal Jewish lobbying apparatus .
“ Peace groups on both sides are more fully tested when the spotlight is not on the process , counterintuitively , ” Ibish said .
“ That ’s when the hard work — building the basis of a negotiated agreement comes in .
That ’s the only way this ends , and you ca n’t bring that out in any meaningful when the bombs are flying . ”

IRVING , Texas --
The Cowboys have released Adam " Pacman " Jones , and a team source told ESPN's Ed Werder that the move was made after the team learned of new allegations against the troubled cornerback from his time with the Titans .
Jones ' release came after " Outside the Lines " reporter John Barr contacted the NFL , the Cowboys and Jones ' attorneys about a piece scheduled to air Sunday in which three Atlanta - area men allege that Jones arranged for someone to shoot at them two months after the football player was suspended by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell in 2007 .
The June 2007 shooting occurred outside a suburban Atlanta strip club .
One of the shooting victims told " Outside the Lines " that he had a dispute with Jones inside the strip club and that not long after he and the two others left the club , a hail of bullets struck their car .
The NFL knew about that incident , but charges were never brought against anyone because the victims did not see the shooter .
" Outside the Lines " obtained information that police , investigating a separate Atlanta - area case , had been told by an informant that Jones ordered the June 2007 shooting following his dispute with one of the men .
Police have said that while the case remains open , they are not actively investigating .
Jones denied the report and told the Dallas Morning News :
" It will be a lawsuit in a week against ESPN .
That 's stupid .
It 's so stupid I have no more comments . "
The Cowboys traded for Jones before the season even though he had been suspended in 2007 because of a series of off - field incidents .
Jones , expected to give the Cowboys a boost on defense and special teams , had no interceptions and averaged just 4.6 yards per punt return .
" Surprised ?
Yeah , I was surprised , " Jones said of the release , according to the Dallas Morning News .
" All I can do is keep working hard , keep my nose clean and hope for the best . "
Jones missed six games this season for violating the league 's player conduct policy after an Oct. 7 scuffle with a team bodyguard at a Dallas hotel .
He missed a seventh game with an injury .
The 25 - year - old Jones spent part of his time away from football taking part in an alcohol rehabilitation program .
" He was surprised , and I think he was obviously somewhat hurt , " Worrick Robinson , Jones ' agent , said of the decision .
" At the same time , he understands the business behind what is happening here . "
Robinson said he did not think Jones ' suspension was a factor in the Cowboys ' decision to release the cornerback .
" We do n't have any reason to believe at this point that that off - the - field incident had anything to do with the team 's decision today , " Robinson said .
" I know there was certainly a lot of bad that came out of that situation , but there was some good that came out of that situation as well . "
Jones ' attorney added he expects the cornerback will be back with some team in 2009 .
" He is young .
He has a lot of ability and he is eager to get back on the field , " Robinson said .
Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple declined to comment on the team 's decision and said owner Jerry Jones was unavailable .
Coach Wade Phillips and linebacker Greg Ellis , who is the team 's representative to the players ' union , did not immediately return messages left by The Associated Press .
NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would not comment on the ESPN report or the Cowboys ' release of Jones .
" We do not comment on player transactions by our teams .
And we have no other comment to offer on this matter , " Aiello said Thursday .
The Cowboys traded for Jones despite the cornerback 's suspension for the 2007 season after multiple off - field incidents while with the Titans .
He was given another chance and cleared to play in 2008 by commissioner Roger Goodell .
When Jones was traded to Dallas in April , Tennessee received a fourth - round draft pick .
The Titans were also supposed to get a sixth - rounder next year , but because Jones was suspended again , Dallas will instead receive a fifth - round pick in 2009 .
Before coming to Dallas , Jones was arrested six times and involved in 12 instances requiring police intervention after Tennessee drafted him in the first round in 2005 .
According to the Dallas Morning News , Jones said he plans to remain in the area and workout at friend Deion Sanders ' Prime U camp next week .
" If I beat myself up , who will take care of me ? "
Jones said , according to the report .
" Football means a lot to me , but it 's not everything .
It 's not like I 'm taking it pretty good .
I love me some me . "
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

GAZA ( Reuters ) - “ Abu Salah died , his wife died .
Abu Tawfiq died , his son died , his wife also died .
Mohammed Ibrahim died , and his mother died .
Ishaq died and Nasar died .
The wife of Nael Samouni died .
Many people died .
“ There were maybe more than 25 people killed , ” said Ahmed Ibrahim Samouni , a 13 - year - old Palestinian boy who was wounded in the leg and chest but survived the alleged Israeli shelling of a house in north Gaza on Monday , Jan 5 .
A report by the U.N. Office for the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said at least 30 people were killed in the incident .
Most were members of Samouni ’s family .
OCHA deputy chief Allegre Pacheco quoted witnesses in the Zeitun district as saying Israeli troops had ordered about 100 civilians to get into the house and stay there , out of their way .
But the following day the house was hit by Israeli shells .
“ There are no bomb shelters in Gaza , ” she said .
An Israeli army spokesman on Friday denied the allegation .
“ The IDF ( Israel Defence Forces ) did not mass people into any specific building , ” Jacob Dallal told Reuters .
“ Furthermore , we checked with regard to IDF fire on the 5th .
The IDF did not target any building in or near Zeitun on the 5th . ”
Lying in hospital in Gaza , the Palestinian boy told how his family were ordered into a house that was hit a day later .
“ We were asleep when the tanks and the planes struck , we all slept in one room , ” Samouni said in a weak voice .
“ One shell hit our house .
Thank God we were not hit .
“ We ran out of the house and saw 15 men ... they landed from helicopters on rooftops of buildings . ”
Soldiers beat residents and forced them all into one house , he said .
DASH FOR WATER
But the house that they supposed would provide shelter from the battle was hit the next day , and Samouni ’s mother was among those killed .
Samouni kept Yacoub , 11 , and two younger brothers alive and tried to help injured adults lying among the dead .
“ There was no water , no bread , nothing to eat , ” he said .
“ I got up on my own .
I had my wound tied and I got up to get them water from outside , trying to hide from tanks and planes .
I went to our neighbours and called on them until I almost fainted .
I brought a gallon of water . ”
Yacoub said he went to “ check on my mom and found her dead , and my brothers next to her .
My older brother Mohamad was also dead , and the youngest one , he was in my mother ’s lap . ”
Local Red Crescent rescue workers and a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) reached the house on Wednesday after being denied access by the Israeli military for what the Red Cross called an “ unacceptable ” period .
A Palestinian medic said the team had called out for survivors and heard the voices of children .
“ We broke down the door and entered and they were four injured children on the ground , and between them there were 16 martyrs ( dead ) , ” Khaled Abu Zayed said .
DONKEY CARTS
The children were starving and too weak to stand on their own , the Geneva - based ICRC said .
“ One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up .
In all there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses , ” it said .
Earth redoubts built by Israeli bulldozers blocked streets so the ambulances could not get close .
“ The wounded had to be brought out on donkey carts , ” the U.N. ’s Pacheco told Reuters .
The ICRC accused Israel of delaying ambulance access to the area and demanded it grant safe access for Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances to return to evacuate more wounded .
Jessica Montel , head of the Israel human rights organisation B’TSelem , said she was still awaiting an IDF account of the alleged incident .
“ We do n’t have an explanation from the IDF about their behaviour in Zeitun , neither why the Samouni compound was shelled in the first place nor why ambulances were not able to reach the wounded , ” she said .
In a written response to the ICRC , the Israeli army said it works in coordination with international aid bodies “ so that civilians can be provided with assistance ” and that it “ in no way intentionally targets civilians . ”
Using inexpensive and easy to get parts , build a 7 colour , including of course white , hand held laser .
The following parts will be enough to build a “ bare ” 7 selectable colour laser , it is up to you to make the housing of your choice .
This could easily be built into a project box but I wanted a hand held pointer .

Additional parts used in this build
3 off Lathe turned adaptors
If you have a lathe no problem if not … you need to improvise , modified pop rivets can
be adapted to suit .
1 off Rkcstr drive ( for the blu ray )

1 off DDL LM317 drive ( for the red )
rog8811.com/laserdriver
3 off RCR123A rechargeable batteries
http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.11386
Switch gear .
1 off 6 position 2 pole rotary switch
1 off DPDT switch ( spring on - centre off - spring on )
This is just one way of doing it , you could use 3 off push buttons
Modding the PS3 sled
You will need to remove all of the optics EXCEPT the 2 splitter cubes a nd the 90 degree turning mirror ( remove all the bits marked in red )
The three holes circled in red below need to be drilled out to 5.0 mm dia .
Saw the beam splitter section off , cut along the green line .
Cut out the turning mirror holder marked in purple .
It is best to put the small cover plate back on over the beam splitters to keep them clean ( not shown ) .
Mods to Aixiz modules
The modules need to be the type with the removable chrome bezel on the lens nut !
To keep the optics straight the module needs to be attached to the cut down sled using the bezel , brass adaptors need to be made that are 5 mm at one end and the size of the hole in the bezel the other with a larger diameter in between .
Once the adaptors are made the front face of the bezel needs to be sanded to remove the chrome plating so that the parts can be soldered together , see drawing below .
When you assemble the modules the bezel needs to be screwed tight up to the front half of the module ( metal to metal , no plastic lens nut showing ) at exactly the focus point , this is quite easy for the blue , it is just a case of getting the lens the right distance into the bezel .
The red will need a thin washer to take up the gap , I used a ring of solder squashed to the right thickness in a vice to get it right .
The best green module for the job is the type sold by “ standstone11 ” ( Susie ) it has a large internal thread at the front , the main part of the adaptor is made from the back part of a DX green module which , amazingly , has the same thread !
Another small brass sleeve needs to be machined up to fit as shown .
Again the adaptor needs to be screwed tightly to the green module to keep things in line , this is easy for the green as the focus is already set .
First trial assembly
Once the modules are complete and drivers have been set up you can push everything together to get an idea of how close the optics are .
The blu ray and the red modules will need to be rotated to get the best output as they are both polarised by the splitter blocks , you may need to tweak the modules to get the beams to coincide ,
The green is not polarised which is useful as , like nearly every green I have ever had , the beam does not emerge straight , so you will need to rotate it to get the best match with the other beams .
The modules will need to be assembled to the sled with araldite ( or similar ) whilst clamped in the correct position , spend time getting this right as once it is glued up there is little chance of adjusting it .
You should now have an assembly capable of 7 different colours !
Making a pointer
To make this into a reasonably sized hand held I needed to turn the output through 90 degrees for this I used the turning mirror from the PS3 sled .
It needs to be stuck onto the optical block like this
Preparing the optical block
You will note that I did this before sticking the modules in place .
To get a flat surface to mount the prism block you will need to cut , drill and bend the stainless cover that came off the back of the sled .
This was carefully glued in place with Araldite .
The prism was then glued in place , I wired up the LD ’s temporarily to make sure that I was gluing this on straight , it is held in place with Araldite .
Once it had dried I used some more Araldite to fillet the edges to ensure a strong mounting .
Powering it up
You may have concerns about powering this up as the modules have different polarities :- Green positive case
Red negative case
Blu ray either polarity I suggest to keep things simple that you supply the green from one set of batteries ( 3.6 v ) and the red / blu ray from another set ( 7.2v ) .
If you go this route do not connect any part of either supply to the case of the finished laser and it will work fine .
Wiring diagram
Battery holder
I decided to use 2 supplies so built a battery holder for 2off RCR123A and 1off CR123A , it is made from a piece of plastic tube cut down the middle .
Spacers were cut from plastic scrap
Contacts were odd bits of brass sheet
1 spring came from the green module
The other was just knocking around
The whole lot was assembled with superglue and Araldite .
This will work together to give you this ....

Alright Mr. ( or Ms. )
Politico , is n't it enough that I have to pay you to sit mindlessly fouling up the air around your seat at the office ?
Are you not satisfied enough soaking me with the bill to keep your lights on and Nine Lives in little Fluffy 's bowl ?
I pay a big chunk out of my salary as an underpaid health care worker , just to pony up for your kid 's college tuition .
I am fleeced to near starvation levels so you 'd think that was enough .
Not a chance , you 're a public official and by default it is assumed ( at least among really stupid people ) that you just have to know everything .
You had the smarts to be able to con enough people to vote for you so obviously you must know your stuff .
The roots of the Einstein family tree must be getting their water straight from your backyard garden hose .
You sir or madam , must be literally oozing genius , the problem is both that my wallet and my liberty take a pounding when it all drips on me .
Your grand idea to “ reform ” health care , bailout any fool that is equally lousy in business as you were , not fix the roads , or make a mockery of freedom and justice proves to anyone that knows better , you have no real business savvy .
Just where 's your fantastic achievement in the real world outside your cushy little job that steals from my labor ?
Here 's my take on it … you can't compete in the private sector .
You lack the honesty to actually tell your constituents that you do n't have the goods and never did .
There 's no individual liability against you personally for failure to meet the needs of those you claim to serve .
Your “ company ” you run now is government , and you set it up where you literally can't possibly “ go out of business ” , no matter how badly you and your ilk foul up the works .
If you could solve the so - called “ health care crisis ” , you 'd have already provided an even slightly successful model and opened your own insurance company just to show us all how it is done .
You could do so in any other endeavor if you knew how , yet you simply do n't , do you brainiac ?
You got into politics in the first place because you were unable to successfully make a go of it among us working stiffs .
That you were unable to hide your severe lack of business acumen from a man of ordinary intellect such as me , simply proves that you 're not so smart as you think .
Do the decent thing and close up your lousy government shop for good , we both know it does n't work .
Then go get a real job , you bum .
With Liberty ,
Dan Steward
“ The first part reproduces the conventional ‘ grand narrative ’ of the Cultural Revolution as a time of unrelieved suffering and betrayal , ” he told me .
“ I actually find the second part more interesting , because the author is no longer in control of his narrative .
But , you know , we are old friends , and we have n’t really discussed this book . ”
As he said this , Wang put an arm around Yu .
We were at a restaurant in West Beijing that serves the cuisine of Zhejiang , Yu ’s native province .
I had traveled to it in a taxi with Yu and noticed a strain of writerly competitiveness in his terse responses to my questions about contemporary Chinese novelists : he read mostly Mo Yan , Wang Anyi and Su Tong .
No , he did n’t much read young Chinese writers or the Chinese Nobel Laureate Gao Xingjian , who lives in a suburb of Paris .
Ma Jian , the author of the blackly satirical novel “ Beijing Coma , ” who lives in self - imposed exile in London , is barely known in China .
He was more interested in foreign authors ; he had recently read Ian McEwan ’s novel “ On Chesil Beach ” and also introduced a collection of the British novelist ’s stories in Chinese translation .
Yu spoke warmly , though , of Wang , whom he first met in Beijing in the 1980s and who is one of the very few people he sees frequently .
At the restaurant they sat together , presenting a study in contrasts :
Wang , unfailingly thoughtful , and Yu , as jaunty as ever .
Yet they radiated an easy mutual regard , built upon the shared experience of the tumultuous late 1980s in Beijing and amusement at how significantly things had changed in their own lives since they were provincial students during the Cultural Revolution .
Wang seemed to cherish the mischievous — what he called the “ jokemaking ” — side of Yu .
They had just returned from a trip to Nepal , where they went whitewater rafting together .
Yu chortled as he recalled his attempts to hold on to his boat amid the swirling waters .
“ It ’s very dangerous , ” he said , “ very dangerous . ”
But he grew visibly aggrieved when I asked him if he followed the Olympic Games in Beijing .
The organizers promised to sell tickets online on a first - come - first - served basis , and he tried to buy them as soon as they were made available .
But he was n’t able to get the best seats for the basketball matches and then found empty rows in the stadium whose neatness hinted at early block sales to party bigwigs .
“ Typical Communist Party corruption , ” Yu bellowed , and for once I was glad for the loud Muzak playing in the restaurant .
He fell silent after this , chain - smoking in his quiet but tense manner , as Wang spoke of the Western financial crisis and its implications for China ’s export - oriented economy .
The stock market was in a steep decline ; factories on the coast were closing .
The discussion seemed to bore Yu .
When I remarked that President Hu Jintao ’s then - imminent visit with President Bush was very likely an exercise in futility , he said , “ These politicians are mostly a waste of time . ”
He perked up only when I asked him what he thought of Zhang Yimou ’s contribution to the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics .
He said he felt sympathetic to Zhang , who is often accused of selling out to Communist authorities as well as to commercial interests .
“ He would have reached the end of his career very quickly had he persisted in making films like ‘ To Live . ’
He had to live with the realities of Chinese society .
And it is different for filmmakers .
I can always publish in Taiwan if I am restricted in China .
In China , too , the political atmosphere has gone back and forth from closed to open , and I have been lucky in hitting the troughs . ”
Later in the taxi home , sitting next to the driver , Yu spoke of a threat to artistic expression in China newer than state control .
“ I am really worried about the new nationalism , ” he said .
“ Anything slightly critical of China appears in foreign media , and the nationalists are swarming online , attacking it .
I tell these angry youth that The New York Times does n’t criticize China as much as it criticizes America .
Basically they are ignorant .
They think the American media is always praising American presidents .
The problem is that the younger generation has n’t lived through poverty , collectivism ; it is lacking in restraint , its references are very few , the experience is so limited . ”
We were moving down Beijing ’s stately avenues , past the quasi-imperial grandeur of its postmodern architecture .
Yu seemed eager to return to his sparsely furnished study and the room with the Internet .
Earlier that day at his home he spoke of how his son , who has known only post - Mao China , would nevertheless witness extraordinary transformations in his own lifetime since the capitalist economy was bound to collapse .
Yu barely looked out of his window as he said : “ These young nationalists have no sense of ambivalence , no idea of life ’s ambiguities .
But when times are hard , their attitude will change , become more mature , and because capitalism in this form cannot go on in China , it has to end , those hard times will come soon . ”

SAN FRANCISCO – Apple Inc.'s eye - catching logo - an apple with a bite taken from it - has come in many colors in the past .
Now , the iconic computer company is trying to prove its commitment to the color green .
In recent advertising , the Cupertino , Calif. , company presents itself as an environmental leader .
Apple 's
Web site bills its new line of MacBook computers as " the world 's greenest family of notebooks . "
It now makes iPods and iPhones free of polyvinyl chlorides and brominated flame retardant , and it's in the final stages of making all of its products without bromine and chlorine .
Both chemicals have been criticized for creating toxic byproducts .
Competitors and environmentalists , however , say Apple 's green efforts have less to do with cleaning up its products and manufacturing and more to do with marketing .
In a recent blog posting , a senior executive at Round Rock , Texas - based Dell Inc. said he was " surprised " by Apple 's claims of environmental - friendliness .
Environmental groups , like Greenpeace , point to surveys ranking Apple below other computer makers , such as Dell and Hewlett - Packard Co. in green practices .
" Apple is ... guilty of using ' green ' as a marketing ploy , rather than making green a core part of their business practices , " said Stephen Stokes , vice president of business and climate change at AMR Research Inc .
Determining Apple's " green - ness " is difficult because much of the information reported to authorities , like the Environmental Protection Agency , is provided voluntarily .
Both Apple and its detractors have ample data to make their cases .
However , Apple 's recent decision to highlight its environmental efforts leaves the company 's eco-track record open to scrutiny and criticism at a time when green issues are coming to the fore .
President Barack Obama speaks to reporters during his visit to the Capitol in Washington January 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration is not likely to impose tougher restrictions on executive pay on most firms receiving aid under the government ’s $ 700 billion financial rescue program , the Washington Post reported on Saturday .
Citing a source familiar with the administration ’s deliberations , the Post said officials are concerned that harsh limits could discourage some firms from asking for aid .
President Barack Obama and some members of Congress have strongly criticized recent bonuses given out to executives at Wall Street companies that received government assistance .
The issue of executive compensation is part of Obama ’s plan to rescue financial markets .
While some details need to be hammered out , the strategy is likely to be laid out publicly in about a week , the paper said .
While relatively healthy firms are unlikely to face stiff restrictions on executive compensation , companies that need more dramatic government assistance would face more punitive terms under the plan , it said .
Under the original rescue program approved by Congress in October , executives at financial firms faced federal limits on their multimillion - dollar pay packages .
But those restrictions are unlikely to significantly reduce executive pay , analysts say .
Less ice could spell bad news for a great many species Emperor penguins , whose long treks across Antarctic ice to mate have been immortalised by Hollywood , are heading towards extinction , scientists say .
Based on predictions of sea ice extent from climate change models , the penguins are likely to see their numbers plummet by 95 % by 2100 .
That level of decline could wreak havoc on the delicate Antarctic food chain .
The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Emperor penguins , the largest species , are unique in that they are the only penguins that breed during the harsh Antarctic winters .
Colonies gather far inland after long treks across sea ice , where the females lay just one egg that is tended by the male .
That means that the ice plays a major role in their overall breeding success .
What is more , the extent of sea ice cover influences the abundance of krill and the fish species that eat them - both food sources for the penguins .
Hal Caswell of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and his colleagues used projections of sea ice coverage from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's ( IPCC ) last report .
In addition , they used a " population dynamics " model describing the mating patterns and breeding success of emperor penguins .
The model has been honed using 43 years ' worth of observations of an emperor colony in Antarctica 's Terre Adelie .
Slow learners
While there are a number of models and scenarios in the IPCC report , the team used only 10 of them - those that fit with existing satellite data on sea ice .
They then ran 1,000 simulations of penguin population growth or decline under each of those 10 climate scenarios .
They are to Antarctica what the polar bear is to the Arctic
Joel Cohen , Rockefeller University
The results suggest that by the year 2100 , emperor penguins in the region are likely to experience a reduction in their numbers by 95 % or more .
The likelihood of this occurring , according to the researchers , is at least a one - in - three chance and possibly more than eight out of 10 .
Though the penguins could avert disaster by shifting their breeding patterns with the climate , the study 's lead author Stephanie Jenouvrier said that was unlikely .
" Unlike some other Antarctic bird species that have altered their life cycles , penguins do n't catch on so quickly , " she said .
" They are long - lived organisms , so they adapt slowly .
This is a problem because the climate is changing very fast . "
' Conservative approach ' Several prior studies have shown that climate change can affect the reproduction and geographic distribution of species , but this is the first that makes predictions about the ultimate fate of a species as a whole .
" I do n't see any reason not to take these predictions very seriously , " said Dan Reuman , a population biologist at Imperial College London .
Particularly warm seasons cause Antarctic ice to break up early " The study is based on a wide range of climate forecasts , it takes a conservative approach , it 's based on a large amount of data on penguin demography , and the model accurately forecasts the data that already exist . "
Dr Reuman suggests that more of this kind of work should be done to understand the species - by - species effects of climate change , and thereby the influence on whole communities .
It is an idea echoed by Joel Cohen , head of the Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University .
" The emperor penguin is an important species in its own right , but the whole communities in which it 's embedded are also of importance , " he told BBC News .
The penguins also serve as a species that particularly draws attention to the crisis in their region , he added .
" They are to Antarctica what the polar bear is to the Arctic .
" This study takes our knowledge , puts it together , gives us some insights , arouses concern and suggests that we ought to be understanding this situation a lot better . "

From Bloomberg :
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz said Obama ’s plan is “ not enough ” because it puts too much into tax cuts rather than higher spending .
“ Clearly more is going to be needed , ” Stiglitz , a professor at Columbia University in New York who advised Obama during the campaign , told reporters at a conference in Paris today .
“ With a lot of the money going to tax cuts , they wo n’t have the effect some would hope . ”
Congressional Skeptics
A top congressional Democrat also questioned the potential impact of the tax reductions Obama outlined , which would return $ 500 to individuals and $ 1,000 to families through changes in withholding .
“ I ’m very skeptical that ’s going to make much difference , ” Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad of North Dakota told reporters in Washington .
“ For the average family , it ’s going to add $ 20 a week — I mean how much lift is that going to give ? ”
Military force - feeding 10 percent of Guantanamo detainees John Byrne
Published : Thursday January 8 , 2009

Ten percent of captives at the US Guantanamo Bay prison -- many of whom have never been charged of a crime -- are having their heads velcroed to chairs and forced to take in nutritional supplements by a tube forcibly inserted through their noses by US guards .
Twenty - five captives who 've starved themselves for weeks are being fed through tubes in their noses , the US military admitted Thursday .
Thirty detainees are currently on a hunger strike .
A lawyer for 17 Yemeni men told a Miami Herald reporter Thursday that the hunger strike was partly in response to the US decision to release Osama Bin Laden 's driver Salim Hamdan in November .
Hamdan was charged with supporting terrorism and was held just shy of his 66 - month sentence ; many of those on the hunger strike have never been charged with a crime .
'' They 've actually gone ballistic at the fact that Hamdan , who was convicted of supporting terrorism , was released and they , who have been charged with nothing , continue to languish there , '' Washington lawyer David Remes told Herald reporter Carol Rosenberg .
The Pentagon considers hunger strikers as detainees who 've refused nine meals in a row .
Detainees are force fed after fasting for 21 days or weight less than 85 percent of their weight upon arrival at the camp .
" The forced - feeding regime has guards and medical staff strap a captive into a chair , Velcro his head to a metal restraint , then tether a tube into the man 's stomach through his nose to pump in liquid nourishment twice a day , " Rosenberg writes .
" A military commission this summer convicted Hamdan , 40 , of supporting terror for working as bin Laden 's $ 200 - a- month driver in Afghanistan until his capture in November 2001 , " she added .

What are the metaphysical implications of quantum physics ?
One way of approaching this question is to consider the impact of the theory on our understanding of objects as individuals with well defined identity conditions .
According to the ‘ Received View ’ , which was elaborated as the quantum revolution was taking place , quantum theory implies that the fundamental particles of physics cannot be regarded as individual objects in this sense .
Such a view has motivated the development of non-standard formal systems which are appropriate for representing non-individual objects .
However , it has also been argued that quantum physics is in fact compatible with a metaphysics of individual objects , but that such objects are indistinguishable in a sense which leads to the violation of Leibniz ’s famous Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles .
This last claim has also been contested opening up a further way of understanding the individuality of quantum entities .
As a result , we are faced with a form of underdetermination of the relevant metaphysics by the physics , in which we have , on the one hand , quantum objects - as - individuals and , on the other , quantum objects - as - non - individuals .
It has been argued that this underdetermination of such fundamental metaphysical ‘ packages ’ has important implications for the realism - antirealism debate .
It is typically held that chairs , trees , rocks , people and many of the so - called ‘ everyday ’ objects we encounter can be regarded as individuals .
The issue , then , is how this individuality is to be understood , or what constitutes the ‘ principle ’ of individuality .
This is an issue which has a very long history in philosophy .
A number of approaches to it can be broadly delineated .
We might begin by noting that a tree and rock , say , can be distinguished in terms of their different properties .
We might then go further and insist that this also forms the basis for ascribing individuality to them .
Even two apparently very similar objects , such as two coins of the same denomination or so - called identical twins , will display some differences in their properties – a scratch here , a scar there , and so on .
On this account such differences are sufficient to both distinguish and individuate the objects .
This undergirds the so - called ‘ bundle ’ view of objects , according to which an object is nothing but a bundle of properties .
In order to guarantee individuation , no two objects can then be absolutely indistinguishable , or indiscernible , in the sense of possessing exactly the same set of properties .
This last claim has been expressed as the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles and it ensures the individuality of the objects that fall under its scope ; we shall return to it below .
However , this approach has been criticised on the grounds ( among others ) that we can surely conceive of two absolutely indistinguishable objects : thinking of Star Trek , we could imagine a replicator device which precisely reproduces an object , such as a coin or even a person , giving two such objects exactly the same set of properties .
Not quite , one might respond , since these two objects do not and indeed cannot exist at the same place at the same time ; that is , they do not possess the same spatio - temporal properties .
In terms of these properties , then , the objects can still be distinguished and hence regarded as different individuals .
Clearly , then , this approach to the issue of individuality must be underpinned by the assumption that individual objects are impenetrable .
A more thorough - going criticism of this property based approach to individuality insists that it conflates epistemological issues concerning how we distinguish objects , with ontological issues concerning the metaphysical basis of individuality .
Thus , it is argued , to talk of distinguishability requires at least two objects but we can imagine a universe in which there exists only one .
In such a situation , it is claimed , it would be inappropriate to say that the object is distinguishable but not that it is an individual .
Although we do not actually find ourselves in such situations , of course , still , it is insisted , distinguishability and individuality should be kept conceptually distinct .
If this line of argument is accepted , then the principle of individuality must be sought in something over and above the properties of an object .
One candidate is the notion of substance , in which properties are taken to inhere in some way .
Locke famously described substance as a ‘ something , we know not what ’ , since to describe it we would have to talk of its properties , but bare substance , by its very nature , has no properties itself .
Alternatively , the individuality of an object has been expressed in terms of its ‘ haecceity ’ or ‘ primitive thisness ’ ( Adams 1979 ) .
As the name suggests , this is taken to be the primitive basis of individuality , which cannot be analysed further .
However , it has also been identified with the notion of self - identity , understood as a relational property ( Adams ibid . ) and expressed more formally as ‘ a=a ’ .
Each individual is understood to be identical to itself .
This may seem like a form of the property - based approach we started with , but self - identity is a rather peculiar kind of property .
As we ’ll see , denying that quantum objects are self - identical may be one way of capturing the idea that they are non-individuals .
This is just a sketch of some of the various positions that have been adopted .
There has been considerable debate over which of them applies to the everyday objects mentioned above .
But at least it is generally agreed that such objects should be regarded as individuals to begin with .
What about the fundamental objects posited by current physical theories , such as electrons , protons , neutrons etc . ?
Can these be regarded as individuals ?
One response is that they cannot , since they behave very differently in aggregates from ‘ classical ’ individuals .
The argument for the above conclusion – that the fundamental objects of physics cannot be regarded as individuals – can be summed up as follows :
First of all , both ‘ classical ’ and ‘ quantal ’ objects of the same kind ( e.g. electrons ) can be regarded as indistinguishable in the sense of possessing the same intrinsic properties , such as rest mass , charge , spin etc .
Consider now the distribution of two such indistinguishable particles over two boxes , or two states in general :
(1)
(2)
(3)
( 1) ( 2 ) (3 ) Figure
In classical physics , ( 3 ) is given a weight of twice that of ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) , corresponding to the two ways the former can be achieved by permuting the particles .
This gives us four combinations or complexions in total and hence we can conclude that the probability of finding one particle in each state , for example , is 1 / 2 .
( Note that it is assumed that none of the four combinations is regarded as privileged in any way , so each is just as likely to occur . )
This is an example of the well - known ‘ Maxwell - Boltzmann ’ statistics to which , it is claimed , thermodynamics was reduced at the turn of the twentieth century .
In quantum statistical mechanics , however , we have two ‘ standard ’ forms : one for which there are three possible arrangements in the above situation ( both particles in one box , both particles in the other , and one in each box ) , giving ‘ Bose - Einstein ’ statistics ; and one for which there is only one arrangement ( one particle in each box ) , giving ‘ Fermi - Dirac ’ statistics ( which underpins the Pauli Exclusion Principle and all that entails ) .
Setting aside the differences between these two kinds of quantum statistics , the important point for the present discussion is that in the quantum case , a permutation of the particles is not regarded as giving rise to a new arrangement .
This result lies at the very heart of quantum physics ; putting things slightly more formally , it is expressed by the so - called ‘ Indistinguishability Postulate ’ :
If a particle permutation P is applied to any state function for an assembly of particles , then there is no way of distinguishing the resulting permuted state function from the original unpermuted one by means of any observation at any time .
( The state function of quantum mechanics determines the probability of measurement results .
Hence what the Indistinguishability Postulate expresses is that a particle permutation does not lead to any difference in the probabilities for measurement outcomes . )
The argument then continues as follows : that a permutation of the particles is counted as giving a different arrangement in classical statistical mechanics implies that , although they are indistinguishable , such particles can be regarded as individuals ( indeed , Boltzmann himself made this explicit in the first axiom of his ‘ Lectures on Mechanics ’ , couched in terms of the impenetrability assumption noted above ) .
Since this individuality resides in something over and above the intrinsic properties of the particles in terms of which they can be regarded as indistinguishable , it has been called ‘ Transcendental Individuality ’ by Post ( 1963 ) .
This notion can be cashed out in various well - known ways , as indicated in the Introduction above : in terms of some kind of underlying Lockean substance , for example , or in terms of primitive thisness .
More generally , one might approach it in modal fashion , through the doctrine of haecceitism : this asserts that two possible worlds may describe some individual in qualitatively the same way ( that is , as possessing the same set of properties ) , yet represent that individual differently by ascribing a different haecceity or thisness in each world , or more generally , by ascribing some non-qualitative aspect to the individual ( Lewis 1986 ; Huggett 1999a ) .
Conversely , it is argued , if such permutations are not counted in quantum statistics , it follows that quantum objects cannot be regarded as individuals in any of these senses ( Post 1963 ) .
In other words , they are very different from most everyday objects in that they are ‘ non- individuals ’ , in some sense .
This radical metaphysical conclusion can be traced back to the reflections of Born and Heisenberg themselves and was further elaborated in the very earliest discussions of the foundations of quantum physics .
As Weyl put it in his classic text on group theory and quantum mechanics :
… the possibility that one of the identical twins Mike and Ike is in the quantum state E1 and the other in the quantum state E2 does not include two differentiable cases which are permuted on permuting Mike and Ike ; it is impossible for either of these individuals to retain his identity so that one of them will always be able to say ‘ I ’m Mike ’ and the other ‘ I ’m Ike . ’
Even in principle one cannot demand an alibi of an electron !
( Weyl 1931 )
Recalling the discussion sketched in the Introduction , if we were to create a twin using some kind of Star trek replicator , say , then in the classical domain such a twin could insist that ‘ I ’m here and she ’s there ’ or , more generally , ‘ I ’m in this state and she ’s in that one ’ and ‘ swapping us over makes a difference ’ .
In the classical domain each ( indistinguishable ) twin has a metaphysical ‘ alibi ’ grounded in their individuality .
Weyl ’s point is that in quantum mechanics , they do not .
This conclusion – that quantal objects are not individuals – is not the whole story , however .
First of all , the contrast between classical and quantum physics with regard to individuality and non-individuality is not as straightforward as it might seem .
As already indicated , the above account involving permutations of particles in boxes appears to fit nicely with an understanding of individuality in terms of Lockean substance or primitive thisness .
However , one can give an alternative field - theoretic account in which particles are represented as dichotomic ‘ Yes / No ’ fields : with such a field , the field amplitude is simply ‘ Yes ’ at location x if the ‘ particle ’ is present at x and ‘ No ’ if it is not ( Redhead 1983 ) .
On this account , individuality is conferred via spatio- temporal location together with the assumption of impenetrability mentioned in the Introduction .
Thus the above account of particle individuality in terms of either Lockean substance or primitive thisness is not necessary for classical statistical mechanics .
The particles - and - boxes picture above corresponds to the physicists ’ multidimensional ‘ phase space ’ , which describes which individuals have which properties , whereas the field - theoretic representation corresponds to ‘ distribution space ’ , which simply describes which properties are instantiated in what numbers .
Huggett has pointed out that the former supports haecceitism , whereas the latter does not and , furthermore , that the empirical evidence provides no basis for choosing between these two spaces ( Huggett 1999a ) .
Thus the claim that classical statistical mechanics is wedded to haecceitism also becomes suspect .
Secondly , the above argument from permutations can be considered from a radically different perspective .
In the classical case the situations with one particle in each box are given a weight of ‘ 2 ’ in the counting of possible arrangements .
In the case of quantum statistics this situation is given a weight of ‘ 1 ’ .
With this weighting , there are two possible statistics , as we noted : Bose - Einstein , corresponding to a symmetric state function for the assembly of particles and Fermi - Dirac , corresponding to an anti-symmetric state function .
Given the Indistinguishability Postulate , it can be shown that symmetric state functions will always remain symmetric and anti-symmetric always anti-symmetric .
Thus , if the initial condition is imposed that the state of the system is either symmetric or anti-symmetric , then only one of the two possibilities – Bose - Einstein or Fermi - Dirac – is ever available to the system , and this explains why the weighting assigned to ‘ one particle in each state ’ is half the classical value .
This gives us an alternative way of understanding the difference between classical and quantum statistics , not in terms of the lack of individuality of the objects , but rather in terms of which states are accessible to them ( French 1989 ) .
In other words , the implication of the different ‘ counting ’ in quantum statistics can be understood as not that the objects are non-individuals in some sense , but that there are different sets of states available to them , compared to the classical case .
On this view , the objects can still be regarded as individuals , with the issue remaining as to how that individuality is to be cashed out .
Both of these perspectives raise interesting and distinct metaphysical issues ( for a useful introduction see Castellani 1998 b ) .
Let us consider , first , the objects - as - individuals ‘ package ’ .
How is the relevant notion of individuality to be articulated ?
One option would be to take one of the traditional lines and ground it some form of primitive thisness or Lockean substance .
However , this kind of metaphysics is anathema to many of a naturalistic persuasion , not least because it lies beyond the physical pale , as it were .
Alternatively , one might take individuality to be primitive but then assuage any naturalistic tendencies by tying it to the idea of ‘ countability ’ – in the sense that we can always count how many quantum objects are in a given state – and take the latter to be both physically significant and capable of being ‘ read off ’ from the theory ( Dorato and Morganti 2013 ) .
Nevertheless , it may be felt that naturalism is better satisfied by eschewing such primitivist moves and taking the individuality of the objects to be reducible to their discernibility and ground the latter in their properties , as presented by the theory ( a feeling that may be further supported by doubts as to the physical plausibility of possible worlds containing only one object , as mentioned above ) .
Of course , for this to work , we need some assurance that no two objects are indiscernible ( or indistinguishable ) in the relevant sense .
Traditionally this assurance has been provided by Leibniz ’s famous Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles , so let us consider the status of this Principle in the context of modern physics .
Now , of course , both quantum and classical objects of the same kind – such as electrons , say – are indistinguishable in the sense that they possess all intrinsic properties – charge , spin , rest mass etc. – in common .
However , quantum objects are indistinguishable in a much stronger sense in that it is not just that two or more electrons possess the same intrinsic properties but that – on the standard understanding – no measurement whatsoever could in principle determine which one is which .
If the non-intrinsic , state - dependent properties are identified with all the monadic or relational properties which can be expressed in terms of physical magnitudes standardly associated with self - adjoint operators that can be defined for the objects , then it can be shown that two bosons or two fermions in a joint symmetric or anti-symmetric state respectively have the same monadic properties and the same relational properties one to another ( French and Redhead 1988 ; see also Butterfield 1993 ) .
This has immediate implications for the Principle of the Identity of Indiscernibles which , expressed crudely , insists that two things which are indiscernible , must be , in fact , identical .
Setting aside the historical issue of Leibniz ’s own attitude towards his Principle ( see , for example , Rodriguez - Pereyra 2014 ) , supporters of it have tended to retreat from the claim that it is necessary and have adopted the alternative view that it is at least contingently true ( in the face of apparent counter - examples such as possible worlds containing just two indistinguishable spheres ) .
There is the further issue as to how the Principle should be characterised and , in particular , there is the question of what properties are to be included within the scope of those relevant to judgments of indiscernibility .
Excluding the property of self - identity ( which , again , we ’ll come back to below ) , three forms of the Principle can be broadly distinguished according to the properties involved : the weakest form , PII ( 1 ) , states that it is not possible for two individuals to possess all properties and relations in common ; the next strongest , PII ( 2 ) , excludes spatio - temporal properties from this description ; and the strongest form , PII ( 3 ) , includes only monadic , non-relational properties .
Thus , for example , PII ( 3 ) is the claim that no two individuals can possess all the same monadic properties ( a strong claim indeed , although it is one way of understanding Leibniz ’s own view ) .
In fact , PII ( 2 ) and PII ( 3 ) are clearly violated in classical physics , where distinct particles of the same kind are typically regarded as indistinguishable in the sense of possessing all intrinsic properties in common and such properties are regarded as non-relational in general and non-spatio - temporal in particular .
( Of course , Leibniz himself would not have been perturbed by this result , since he took the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles to ultimately apply only to ‘ monads ’ , which were the fundamental entities of his ontology .
Physical objects such as particles were regarded by him as merely ‘ well founded phenomena ’ . )
However , PII ( 1 ) is not violated classically , since classical statistical mechanics typically assumes that such particles are impenetrable , in precisely the sense that their spatio - temporal trajectories cannot overlap .
Hence they can be individuated via their spatio- temporal properties , as indicated above .
The situation appears to be very different in quantum mechanics , however .
If the particles are taken to possess both their intrinsic and state - dependent properties in common , as suggested above , then there is a sense in which even the weakest form of the Principle , PII ( 1 ) , fails ( Cortes 1976 ; Teller 1983 ; French and Redhead 1988 ; for an alternative view , see van Fraassen 1985 and 1991 ) .
On this understanding , the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles is actually false .
Hence it cannot be used to effectively guarantee individuation via the state - dependent properties by analogy with the classical case .
If one wishes to maintain that quantum particles are individuals , then their individuality will have to be taken as conferred by Lockean substance , primitive thisness or , in general , some form of non-qualitative haecceistic difference .
However , this conclusion has been challenged .
First of all , it has been questioned whether quantum particles can be said to possess the relevant state - dependent properties in the sense that would be damaging to PII ( Massimi 2001 ; see also Mittelstaedt and Castellani 2000 ) .
However , this argument only applies to monadic , state - dependent properties and so the above conclusion still holds for PII ( 2 ) and PII ( 3 ) .
In effect , what has been shown is that those versions of PII which allow relations to individuate are not the weakest forms of the Principle , but the only forms which are applicable .
This shift to relations as individuating elements has led to the development of a form of PII , based on Quine ’s suggestions about discernibility , which allows objects to be ‘ weakly ’ discernible in relational terms ( Saunders 2003 a and 2006 ; for a useful overview see Bigaj 2015a ) .
Consider for example , two fermions in a spherically - symmetric singlet state .
The fermions are not only indistinguishable in the above sense but also possess exactly the same set of spatio- temporal properties and relations .
However , each enters into the symmetric but irreflexive relation of ‘ having opposite direction of each component of spin to …’ on the basis of which they can be said to be ‘ weakly discernible ’ ( for general discussions of different kinds of discernibility see Caulton and Butterfield 2012a ; Bigaj 2014 ; Ketland 2011 ; Ladyman , Linnebo and Pettigrew 2012 ) .
If we extend PII to incorporate such relations , the Principle can , it seems , be made compatible with quantum physics and the individuality of the fermions can be grounded in these irreflexive relations , without having to appeal to anything like primitive thisness .
This result has also been extended to bosons ( Muller and Saunders 2008 ; Muller and Seevinck 2009 ) , although some of the details are contentious , in particular with regard to the interpretation of some of the mathematical features that are appealed to in this account ( see Bigaj 2015 a and 2015 b ; Caulton 2013 ; Huggett and Norton 2014 ; Norton 2015 ) .
In addition to such technical issues , there is the further philosophical concern that the appeal to irreflexive relations in order to ground the individuality of the objects which bear such relations involves a circularity : in order to appeal to such relations , one has had to already individuate the particles which are so related and the numerical diversity of the particles has been presupposed by the relation which hence cannot account for it ( see French and Krause 2006 ; Hawley 2006 and 2009 ) .
One response to this worry would be to question the underlying assumption that relata must have the relevant ontological priority over relations and adopt some form of structuralist view of objects according to which the relata are eliminable in terms of relations ( perhaps ‘ emerging ’ , in some sense as ‘ intersections ’ of them ) or , more mildly perhaps , argue that neither are accorded priority but come as a ‘ package ’ as it were ( for further discussion see French 2014 ) .
It has been suggested , for example , that this whole discussion of weak discernibility reveals a category of entity that has received little attention so far , namely that of ‘ relationals ’ : objects that can be discerned by means of relations only ( Muller 2011 , 2015 ) .
I shall return to the structuralist perspective below ( but for an alternative , ‘ coherentist ’ account , see Calosi and Morganti 2018 ) .
More generally , however , it has been argued that this whole debate is orthogonal to that over the status of PII since what weak discernibility grounds is merely numerical distinctness , rather than the robust sense of discernibility that PII was originally concerned with ( Ladyman and Bigaj 2010 ) .
The latter involves some sense of difference over and above numerical distinctness but weakly discernible relations such as ‘ having opposite direction of each component of spin to …’ do not provide this .
Hence , it is claimed , PII remains violated by quantum mechanics ( although see Friebe 2014 where the principle is defended in the context of a specific understanding of quantum entanglement ) .
The above considerations are typically presented within the ‘ orthodox ’ interpretation of quantum mechanics but there are a further set of responses which step outside of this .
Thus van Fraassen , for example ( van Fraassen 1985 and 1991 ) has advocated a form of ‘ modal ’ interpretation , in the context of which ( standard ) PII can be retained .
At the core of this approach lies a distinction between two kinds of state : the ‘ value ’ state , which is specified by stating which observables have values and what they are ; and the ‘ dynamic ’ state , which is specified by stating how the system will develop both if isolated and if acted upon in some definite fashion .
The evolution of the latter is deterministic , in accordance with Schroedinger ’s equation , but the value state changes unpredictably , within the limits set by the dynamic state ( for criticism see some of the papers in Dieks and Vermaas 1998 ) .
Because the actual values of observables do not increase predictive power if added to the relevant dynamic state description , they are deemed to be ‘ empirically superfluous ’ .
In the case of fermions , at least , distinct value states can be assigned to each particle and PII saved .
However concerns have been raised over the objectivity of such value state attributions ( Massimi op .
cit. , p. 318 , fn. 11 ) and one might regard the associated ‘ empirically superfluous ’ properties as merely conceptual .
This bears again on the important issue of what kinds of properties may be admitted to lie within the scope of the Principle .
Clearly some would appear to be beyond the pale : saving PII by regarding the particle labels themselves as intrinsic properties is surely unacceptable .
Furthermore , bosons must be treated differently , since they can have the same dynamic and value states .
In this case , van Fraassen suggests that each boson is individuated by its history , where this is again to be understood as ‘ empirically superfluous ’ .
Of course , it might seem odd that an approach which originally sought to avoid the grounding of the individuality of objects in something like Lockean substance should find itself having to include empirically superfluous factors within the scope of PII .
Another ‘ unorthodox ’ approach incorporates the Bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics and in particular it has been suggested that it might form the basis of an alternative conception of particle individuality in terms of their spatio - temporal trajectories .
As is well known , attributing distinguishing spatio- temporal trajectories to quantum objects faces acute difficulties under the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics .
On the Bohm interpretation , however , they are allowed ; indeed , the only observable admitted is that of position .
What this interpretation gives us is a dual ontology of point particles plus `pilot ’ wave , where the role of the latter is to determine the instantaneous velocities of the former through the so - called ‘ guidance equations ’ .
These ‘ complete ’ the standard formulation of quantum mechanics so that , in addition to the quantum state , whose development is determined by the Schrödinger equation , there is also a set of single - particle trajectories , each of which is determined by the guidance equation , plus the initial positions of the particles ( for a review see Cushing et al. 1996 ) .
Such an interpretation appears to provide a natural home for the metaphysical package which takes quantum objects to be individuals ( see , for example , Brown et al. 1999 ) and , indeed , a form of PII ( 1 ) can now be defended against the above conclusion .
Nevertheless , things are not quite as straightforward as they might seem : it has been argued that intrinsic properties cannot be considered as possessed solely by the objects but in some sense must be assigned to the pilot wave as well ( Brown et al.1994 ) .
Thus , again , there is an ontological cost involved in retaining this view of objects as individuals .
What if one were to consider the evolution of the system concerned in the multi-dimensional ‘ configuration space ’ in terms of which the wave function must be described ?
Here the implications of considering particle permutations are encoded in the topology of such a space by identifying points corresponding to such a permutation and thereby constructing what is known as the ‘ reduced configuration space ’ formed by the action of the permutation group on the full configuration space .
As in the case of ‘ ordinary ’ space - time , some form of ‘ impenetrability assumption ’ must be adopted to ensure that – in the case of those particles that are not bosons at least – no two particles occupy the same point of this reduced space .
Here Bohmian mechanics offers some advantage : it turns out that the guidance equations ensure the non-coincidence of the relevant particle trajectories ( Brown et al. 1999 ) .
In effect ‘ impenetrability ’ is built into the dynamics and thus the configuration space approach and de Broglie - Bohm interpretation fit nicely together .
Returning to the core point , one can maintain that quantum objects are individuals , even granted the implications of quantum statistics .
And one can either take that individuality to be ungrounded and ‘ primitive ’ or ground it in some form of primitive thisness or , more plausibly for many , in the associated properties via an updated and extended form of PII ( criticisms and concerns notwithstanding ) .
However , there is also the alternative , articulated during the throes of the quantum revolution itself , as noted above , which is to take quantum objects to be non-individuals in some sense .
Of course , if this alternative metaphysical ‘ package ’ is adopted then Leibniz ’s Principle simply does not apply .
But now the obvious question arises : what sense can we make of this notion of ‘ non- individuality ’ ?
Let us recall Weyl ’s statement that one ca n’t ask alibis of electrons .
Dalla Chiara and Toraldo di Francia refer to quantum physics as ‘ the land of anonymity ’ , in the sense that , on this view , the objects cannot be uniquely labelled ( 1993 and 1995 ) .
They ask , then , how can we talk about what happens in such a land ?
Their suggestion is that quantum objects can be regarded as ‘ intensional - like entities ’ , where the intensions are represented by conjunctions of intrinsic properties .
The extension of the natural kind , ‘ electron ’ , say , is then given by the collection of indistinguishable elements , or a ‘ quaset ’ .
The theory of such quasets then gives the possibility of a semantics for quantum objects without alibis ( ibid . ) .
Alternatively , but relatedly , non-individuality can be understood in terms of the denial of self - identity .
This suggestion can be found most prominently in the philosophical reflections of Born , Schrödinger , Hesse and Post ( Born 1943 ; Schrödinger 1952 ; Hesse 1963 ; Post 1963 ) .
It is immediately and clearly problematic , however : how can we have objects that are not identical to themselves ?
Such self - identity seems bound up with the very notion of objecthood in the sense that it is an essential part of what it is to be that object ( thus it has been suggested that non-individuality might be better understood in terms of the loss of patio - temporal trajectories in quantum physics ; see Arenhart , Bueno and Krause 2019 ) .
This intuition is summed up in the Quinean slogan , ‘ no entity without identity ’ ( Quine 1969 ) , with all its attendant consequences regarding reference etc .
However , Barcan Marcus has offered an alternative perspective , insisting on ‘ No identity without entity . ’ ( Marcus 1993 ) and arguing that although ‘… all terms may “ refer ” to objects … not all objects are things , where a thing is at least that about which it is appropriate to assert the identity relation . ’ ( ibid. , p. 25 ) Object - reference then becomes a wider notion than thing - reference .
Within such a framework , we can then begin to get a formal grip on the notion of objects which are not self - identical through so - called ‘ Schrödinger logics ’ , introduced by da Costa ( da Costa and Krause 1994 )
These are many - sorted logics in which the expression x = y is not a well - formed formula in general ; it is where x and y are one sort of term , but not for the other sort corresponding to quantum objects .
A semantics for such logics can be given in terms of ‘ quasi- sets ’ ( da Costa and Krause 1997 ) .
The motivation behind such developments is the idea that collections of quantum objects cannot be considered as sets in the usual Cantorian sense of ‘… collections into a whole of definite , distinct objects of our intuition or of our thought . ’
( Cantor 1955 , p. 85 ) .
Quasi - set theory incorporates two kinds of basic posits or ‘ Urelemente ’ : m-atoms , whose intended interpretation are the quantal objects and M- atoms , which stand for the ‘ everyday ’ objects , and which fall within the remit of classical set theory with Ur-elements .
Quasi-sets are then the collections obtained by applying the usual Zermelo - Fraenkel framework plus Ur-element ZFU - like axioms to a basic domain composed of m-atoms , M-atoms and aggregates of them ( Krause 1992 ; for a comparison of qua -set theory with quasi - set theory , see Dalla Chiara , Giuntini and Krause 1998 ) .
These developments supply the beginnings of a categorial framework for quantum ‘ non- individuality ’ which , it is claimed , helps to articulate this notion and , bluntly , make it philosophically respectable ( extensive details are given in French and Krause 2006 ; see also Arenhart 2012 ; Domenach and Holik 2007 ; Domenach , Holik and Krause , 2008 ; Krause 2010 ) .
Crucially , within this formal framework , a sense of countability is retained in that collections of quantum entities possess a ( kind of ) cardinality but not an ordinality , so we can , in effect , say how many objects there are , even though we cannot place them in numerical order .
Critical discussions of both these formal details and of the basis for attributing ‘ non- individuality ’ to quantum objects can be found in Bueno et. al. 2011 and Sant’ Anna 2019 .
Much of this criticism has proceeded on the basis of insisting that we do not need to adopt such an apparently radical approach .
Thus advocates of ‘ weak discernibility ’ , discussed above , have argued that this notion yields an appropriately naturalist sense of individuality , suitable for quantum physics , whereas Dorato and Morganti ( 2013 ) insist , as already noted , that one can retain countability , and individuality , as primitive notions and that this is to be preferred over any shift to non-individuality ( for a response to the latter and defence of the above formal framework , see Arenhart and Krause 2014 ) .
Jantzen on the other hand , has argued that identity and cardinality are tied together as a ‘ matter of meaning ’ rather than metaphysics and that , consequently , talk of entities without identity is either meaningless or , in fact , talk about something else altogether ( Jantzen 2019 ) .
Likewise Bueno has insisted that identity is too fundamental to be given up so readily and suggests that we can infer the non-individuality of quantum particles directly from their indistinguishability with identity itself understood as a ‘ useful idealization ’ that simplifies our conceptual framework and allows us to predict the behaviour of the relevant objects – in this case quantal entities ( Bueno 2014 ; for responses see Arenhart 2017a and Krause and Arenhart 2019 ) .
Both the framework of quasi - set theory and the underlying metaphysics have been extended into the foundations of Quantum Field Theory , where it has been argued , one has non-individual ‘ quanta ’ ( Teller 1995 ) .
A form of quasi - set theory may provide one way of formally capturing this notion ( French and Krause 2006 ; for concerns about such a move see Sant’ Anna 2019 ) .
It has also been suggested that this offers a way of understanding the sense in which quantum objects may be regarded as vague ( French and Krause 2003 ) , although it has been questioned whether vagueness is the appropriate notion here ( Darby 2010 ) and also whether quasi - set theory offers the most perspicuous way of capturing this sense ( Smith 2008 ) .
Finally , for those who are leery of quasi-sets and their attendant formal apparatus , there is also the option of returning to Weyl ’s original insight , which underpins the quote above , and appropriating his idea of an ‘ aggregate ’ .
If this is interpreted non -set - theoretically as an equivalence relation , where the relevant elements are understood as simply objects that have certain properties in common , one can continue to maintain that such objects do not have well - defined identity conditions ( Bueno 2019 ) .
Indeed , there may be a variety of such frameworks , both formal and metaphysical , in terms of which non-individuality may be understood ( Arenhart 2017 b ) .
We now appear to have an interesting situation .
Quantum mechanics is compatible with two distinct metaphysical ‘ packages ’ , one in which the objects are regarded as individuals and one in which they are not .
Thus , we have a form of ‘ underdetermination ’ of the metaphysics by the physics ( see van Fraassen 1985 and 1991 ; French 1989 ; Huggett 1997 ) .
This has implications for the broader issue of realism within the philosophy of science .
If asked to spell out her beliefs , the realist will point to currently accepted fundamental physics , such as quantum mechanics , and insist that the world is , at least approximately , however the physics says it is .
Of course , there are the well - known problems of ontological change ( giving rise to the so - called Pessimistic Meta - Induction ) and Underdetermination of Theories by the Empirical data .
However , this underdetermination of metaphysical packages seems to pose an even more fundamental problem , as the physics involved is well entrenched and the difference in the metaphysics seemingly as wide as it could be .
These packages support dramatically different world - views : one in which quantum objects , such as electrons , quarks and so forth , are individuals and one in which they are not .
The realist must then face the question : which package corresponds to the world ?
One option would be to refuse to answer and insist that all the realist is required to do is to state how the world is , according to our best theories ; that is , to articulate her realism in terms of electrons , quarks etc. and what physics tells us about them and no more , metaphysically speaking .
This might be called a ‘ shallow ’ form of realism ( Magnus 2012 ) and it raises the obvious worry that the content of such shallow realism amounts to no more than a recitation of the relevant physical content of our best theories , with no consideration of whether that content is concerned with objects or not , and whether the former are individuals or not .
At the other extreme , one might be tempted to give up realism altogether and adopt an anti-realist stance .
Thus the constructive empiricist , taking realism to be metaphysically informed , and hence ‘ deep ’ rather than ‘ shallow ’ , draws as the lesson from this underdetermination , ‘ so much for metaphysics ’ and realism along with it .
Since on this view , all that theories can tell us is how the world could be , the different metaphysical packages of objects - as - individuals and as non-individuals simply amount to different ways of spelling that out ( van Fraassen 1991 ) .
In between these extremes are various options for handling the underdetermination , corresponding to different levels of ‘ deep ’ realism .
Thus one might try to argue that the underdetermination can be ‘ broken ’ in some way .
One might , for example , appeal to some metaphysical factor or other in support of one package over the other , or shift to meta - metaphysical considerations in order to argue , for example , that individuality based on weak discernibility has certain advantages over rival accounts and also over non-individuality , with its attendant non-standard formal underpinning .
However Arenhart argues that weak discernibility generates further metaphysical underdetermination and hence cannot support a fully naturalistic understanding of quantum mechanics as some of its advocates have claimed ( Arenhart 2017 b ) .
Alternatively , of course , one could argue the other way and insist that the non-individuality package avoids having to choose between different metaphysical accounts of individuality , at least , and that the formal shift to quasi - set theory is not as dramatic as might be thought .
Ultimately , however , its not at all clear what weight should be given to the various factors involved or even if a coherent weighting scheme can be applied in the first place .
Instead one might appeal to broadly methodological factors to break the underdetermination .
Thus it has been argued that the package of objects - as - non - individuals meshes better with quantum field theory ( QFT ) where , it is claimed , talk of individuals is avoided from the word go ( Post 1963 ; Redhead and Teller 1991 and 1992 ; Teller 1995 ) .
The central argument for this claim focuses on the core understanding that objects may indeed be regarded as individuals in quantum physics but as such are subject to restrictions on the sets of states they may occupy .
The states that are inaccessible to the particles of a particular kind , such as electrons say , can be taken as corresponding to just so much ‘ surplus structure ’ .
In particular , if the view of particles as individuals is adopted , then it is entirely mysterious as to why a particular sub -set of these inaccessible , surplus states , namely those that are non-symmetric , are not actually realised .
Applying the general methodological principle that a theory which does not contain such surplus structure is to be preferred over one that does , Redhead and Teller conclude that we have grounds for preferring the non-individuals package and the mystery of the inaccessible states simply does not arise ( Redhead and Teller 1991 and 1992 ) .
This line of argument has been criticised by Huggett on the grounds that the apparent mystery is a mere fabrication : the inaccessible non-symmetric states can be ruled out as simply not physically possible ( Huggett 1995 ) .
The surplus structure , then , is a consequence of the representation chosen and has no further metaphysical significance .
However , it has been insisted that a theory should also tell us why a particular state of affairs is not possible .
So , consider the possible state of affairs in which a cold cup of tea spontaneously starts to boil .
Statistical mechanics can explain why we never observe such a possibility , whereas the quantum - objects - as - individuals view cannot explain why we never observe non-symmetric states and hence it is deficient in this regard ( Teller 1998 ) .
Unfortunately , the analogy is problematic .
Statistical mechanics does not say that the above situation never occurs but only that the probability of its occurrence is extremely low .
The question then reduces to that of ‘ why is this probability so low ? ’
The answer to that is typically given in terms of the very low number of states corresponding to the tea boiling compared to the vast number of states for which it remains cold .
Why , then , this disparity in the number of accessible states ?
Or , equivalently , why do we find ourselves in situations in which entropy increases ?
One answer takes us back to the initial conditions of the Big Bang .
A similar line can then be taken in the case of quantum statistics .
Why do we never observe non-symmetric states ?
Because that is the way the universe is and we should not expect quantum mechanics alone to have to explain why certain initial conditions obtain and not others .
Here we recall that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian ensures that if a particle is in a state of a particular symmetry ( corresponding to Bose - Einstein statistics , say , or Fermi - Dirac ) to begin with , it will remain in states of that symmetry .
Hence , if non-symmetric states do not feature in the initial conditions which held at the beginning of the universe , they will remain forever inaccessible to the particles .
The issue then turns on different views of the significance of the above ‘ surplus structure ’ ( see Belousek 2000 . )
Furthermore , even if we accept the methodological principle of ‘ the less surplus structure the better ’ , it is not clear that QFT understood in terms of non-individual ‘ quanta ’ offers any significant advantage in this respect ( although see da Costa and Holik 2015 for an account in these terms of states with undefined particle number , characteristic of QFT ) .
Indeed , it has been argued that the formalism of QFT is also compatible with the alternative package of objects as individuals .
Van Fraassen has pressed this claim ( 1991 ) , drawing on de Muynck ’s construction of state spaces for QFT which involve labelled particles ( 1975 ) .
Butterfield , however , has argued that the existence of states that are superpositions of particle number , within QFT , undermines the equivalence ( 1993 ) .
Nevertheless , Huggett insists , in this case the undermining is empirical , rather than methodological ( Huggett 1995 ) .
When the number is constant , it is the states for arbitrary numbers of particles which are so much surplus structure and now , if the methodological argument is applied , it is the individuals package which is to be preferred .
It is also worth noting , perhaps , that some of this ‘ surplus ’ structure corresponds to so - called ‘ paraparticle ’ statistics , or forms of quantum statistics that are neither bosonic nor fermionic .
These were acknowledged as possible by Dirac as early as the 1930s but were only fully developed theoretically from the late 1950s .
For a brief period in the mid-1960s it was thought that quarks might be paraparticles , before the same statistical behaviour came to be described in terms of the new intrinsic property of ‘ colour ’ leading to the development of quantum chromodynamics , which effectively pushed paraparticle theory into the theoretical twilight ( for a summary of the history see French and Krause 2006 , Ch. 3 ; for a discussion of paraparticles in the context of issues relating to particle indistinguishability , see Caulton and Butterfield 2012 b ) .
This suggests that paraparticle statistics can always be re-described in conventional terms – a suggestion that has been taken up by Baker et .
al. in the context of algebraic QFT , thereby eliminating this form of surplus structure at least ( Baker , Halvorson and Swanson 2015 ) .
There remains considerable scope for further exploration of all these issues and concerns in the context of quantum field theory ( see also Auyang 1995 ) and a collection of relevant historical and philosophical reflections can be found in Cao ( 1999 ) .
A further approach to this underdetermination is to reject both packages and seek a third way .
Thus Morganti has argued that both of the above metaphysical packages assume that everything qualitative about an object must be encoded in terms of a property that it possesses ( Morganti 2009 ) .
Dropping this assumption allows us to consider quantum statistics as describing ‘ inherent ’ properties of the assembly as a whole .
The ( anti -) symmetry of the relevant states is then accounted for in terms of the disposition of the system to give rise to certain correlated outcomes upon measurement .
This is presented as an extension of Teller ’s ‘ relational holism ’ ( Teller 1989 ) , and relatedly , the notion of ‘ inherence ’ involves the denial of the supervenience of the properties of the whole on those of the parts .
However , as just indicated , it comes with a cost : that of admitting holistic dispositional properties and the metaphysics of these in the quantum context requires further development , as does the sense in which such inherent properties ‘ emerge ’ when systems interact .
Earlier and along similar metaphysical lines , Lavine suggested that quantum objects can be regarded as the smallest possible amounts of ‘ stuff ’ and , crucially , that a multi- particle state represents a further amount of stuff such that it does not contain proper parts ( 1991 ; see also Jantzen 2019 ) .
Such a view , he claims , avoids the metaphysically problematic aspects of both the individuals and non-individuals packages .
Of course , there are then the issues of the metaphysics and logic of ‘ stuff ’ , but it can be argued that these are familiar and not peculiar to quantum mechanics .
One such issue concerns the nature of ‘ stuff ’ : is it our familiar primitive substance ?
Substance as a fundamental metaphysical primitive faces well - known difficulties and it has been suggested that it should be dropped in favour of some form of ‘ bundle theory ’ , as mentioned at the very beginning of this article .
If the individual objects are understood to be bundles of ‘ tropes ’ , where a trope is an individual instance of a property or a relation , and if this notion is broadened to include individuals whose existence depends on that of others which are not a part of them then , it is claimed , this notion may be flexible enough to accommodate quantum physics ( Simons 1998 ; see also Morganti 2013 ) .
Another issue concerns the manner in which ‘ stuff ’ combines : how do we go from the amounts of stuff represented by two independent photons , to the amount represented by a joint two - photon state ?
The analogies Lavine gives are well known : drops of water , money in the bank , bumps on a rope ( Teller 1983 ; Hesse 1963 ) .
Of course , these may also be appropriated by the non-individual objects view but , more significantly , they are suggestive of a field - theoretic approach in which the ‘ stuff ’ in question is the quantum field .
Here we return to issues concerning the metaphysics of quantum field theory and it is worth pointing out that underdetermination may arise here too .
In classical physics we are faced with a choice between the view of the field as a kind of global substance or stuff and an alternative conception in terms of field quantities assigned to and hence as properties of , the points of space - time .
In the case of quantum field theory , the field quantities are not well - defined at such points ( because of difficulties in defining exact locational states in quantum field theory ) but are instead regarded as ‘ smeared ’ over space - time regions ( see Teller 1999 ) .
The underdetermination remains , of course : between an understanding of the given quantum field in terms of some kind of global substance and the alternative conception in terms of the properties of space - time regions .
Taking the first option obviously requires a metaphysically articulated form of substantivalism applicable to quantum field theory .
Many commentators have preferred the second option , but now , of course , attention must be paid to the metaphysical status of the space - time regions over which the field properties are taken to be instantiated .
Typically , these will be taken to be composed of points of space - time and conceiving of a field in terms of a set of properties meshes comfortably with the approach that takes space - time to be a kind of substance or ‘ stuff ’ itself .
But this too faces well known difficulties in the context of modern physics ( see , for example , Earman 1989 ) .
In particular , space - time substantivalism has been argued to have extremely unpalatable consequences ( Earman and Norton 1987 ) .
Unfortunately , such a properties - based account of fields is difficult to reconcile with the alternative view of space - time as merely a system of relations ( such as contiguity ) between physical bodies : if the field quantities are properties of space - time regions and the latter are understood , ultimately , to be reducible to relations between physical objects , where the latter are conceived of in field - theoretic terms , then a circularity arises ( see Rovelli 1999 ) .
One way forward would be to draw on alternative accounts of the nature of spacetime .
Thus Stachel has suggested that we drop the sharp , metaphysical distinction between things and relations between things and adopt a broadly ‘ structuralist ’ view of spacetime ( Stachel 1999 ; see the essays in Rickles , French & Saatsi 2006 ) .
Suitably extended , such a ‘ structuralist ’ approach might offer a way around the above incompatibility by regarding both space - time and the quantum field in structural terms , rather than in terms of substances , properties or relations ( see Auyang 1995 ; Cao 2003 ; French and Ladyman 2003 ; Kantorovich 2003 ; Lyre 2004 ; Saunders 2003 b ) .
This takes us to a further possible response to the above metaphysical underdetermination which urges realism to retreat from a metaphysics of objects and develop an ontology of structure compatible with the physics ( Ladyman 1998 and 2014 ) .
An early attempt to do this in the quantum context can be seen in the work of Cassirer who noted the implications of the new physics for the standard notion of individual objects and concluded that quantum objects were describable only as ‘ “ points of intersection ” of certain relations ’ ( 1937 , p. 180 ) Setting aside the neo-Kantian elements in Cassirer ’s structuralism , this view of quantum entities has been developed in the context of a form of ‘ ontic ’ structural realism ( Ladyman and Ross 2007 ) .
Drawing on the views of both Weyl and Wigner , quantum objects are here understood as ontologically constituted , group theoretically , in terms of sets of invariants , such as rest mass , charge , spin , and so on ( Castellani 1998a ) .
From this perspective , both the individuality and non-individuality packages get off on the wrong feet , as it were , by assuming that the way the world is , according to physics , is a world of objects , which can either be regarded as individuals , whether primitively or via weak discernibility , or as non-individuals , whether formally represented through quasi - set theory or not .
How , then , should we regard the ‘ Indistinguishability Postulate ’ with which we began this discussion of identity and individuality in the quantum context ?
Both the above packages rest upon a certain understanding of particle permutations , as encapsulated in that Postulate , namely that these are to be conceived in terms of swapping the particles between states , or boxes in our illustrative sketch .
However , we can also think of the ‘ Indistinguishability Postulate ’ as expressing a fundamental symmetry constraint on quantum mechanics , to the effect that the relevant states should be invariant under particle permutations .
An alternative way of regarding this ‘ permutation invariance ’ that aligns with a widely accepted view of symmetry principles in general is that it expresses a certain representational redundancy in the formalism .
Thus , referring to our sketch above , the permuted arrangement of one particle in each box , which is counted in classical statistical mechanics but not in the quantum form , can be considered as ‘ representationally redundant ’ in this sense .
This casts ‘ permutation invariance ’ as one of a number of such symmetry principles that have acquired a fundamental role in modern physics ( Huggett 1999 b ; French and Rickles 2003 ) .
Not surprisingly perhaps , such a re-casting may also have metaphysical implications in that when applied to certain systems obeying Fermi - Dirac statistics – that is , systems of ‘ material ’ particles – the composition of such systems ( in the sense that they may be regarded as composed or made up of sub- systems considered as ‘ parts ’ ) violates standard mereological principles ( Caulton 2015 ; for some possible responses see Bigaj 2016 ) .
More generally it has been argued that ‘ permutation invariance ’ is incompatible with a particle ontology understood even in a metaphysically minimal sense ( Jantzen 2011 ) .
Given the fundamental significance of the former , it has been suggested that the latter must then be jettisoned .
A possible alternative is to adopt a form of space - time substantivalism and take property - bearing regions of space - time to provide the appropriate ontological basis ( Jantzen 2011 ) .
However that runs into the sorts of problems touched on above .
More radically , perhaps , dropping the above ‘ object - oriented ’ assumption would undercut the metaphysical underdetermination entirely and open up space for an alternative ontology in terms of which quantum entities are conceived of as nothing more than features of ‘ the structure of the world ’ ( see French and Ladyman 2003 ) .
This can then be articulated in terms of the relevant laws and symmetries with the properties of such putative entities understood as the determinate aspects of this structure ( see French 2014 ; for further consideration of such an ontology in the context of ‘ structural realism ’ , see Ladyman 2014 ) .
The Vaticanissued a document Tuesday restatingits belief that the Catholic Church is the only true church of Jesus Christ .
The 16 - page document was prepared by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , a doctrinal watchdog that Pope Benedict used to head .
Formulated as five questions and answers , the document is titled " Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church . "
It says although Orthodox churches are true churches , they are defective because they do not recognize the primacy of the Pope .
" It follows that these separated churches and communities , though we believe they suffer from defects , are deprived neither of significance nor importance in the mystery of salvation , " it said .
The document adds that Protestant denominations — called Christian Communities born out of the Reformation — are not true churches , but ecclesial communities .
" These ecclesial communities which , specifically because of the absence of the sacramental priesthood … cannot , according to Catholic doctrine , be called ' churches ' in the proper sense , " it said .
The document is similar to one written in 2000 by the Pope — who was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger at the time — that sparked an angry reaction from Protestant groups .
" I suspect there will be some reactions that are rather passionate , " said Raphaela Schmid , director of the Becket Institute , a group that advocates religious freedom .
" I hope they will not be angry because we all try to understand about each other . "
The document is issued by Benedict 's successor in doctrinal matters , Cardinal William Levada , and endorsed by the Pope , said Reuters .
The decree comes days after liberal Catholic and Jewish groups spoke out against the Pope 's move to authorize the wider use of a traditional Latin mass .
The Tridentine mass includes a prayer for the conversion of Jews .
Its use was restricted following the Second Vatican Councilfrom 1962 to 1965 .
Pope Benedict issued a decree last week authorizing its broader use in an effort to reconcile with followers of an ultratraditional excommunicated bishop .
The Jewish Anti-Defamation League in New York called it a " body blow to Catholic - Jewish relations . "
Islamic cleric Salah Sultan appeared on Egypt ’s Al - Nas TV last week and delivered a warning of death and destruction for America .
Not only did he attack the U.S. for its military support of Israel in its fight against the Hamas terrorist organization , but he vowed retaliation such that more Americans would be killed than those Palestinians ( and , presumably , Hamas terrorists ) killed in the present conflict in Gaza , emphasizing that this would take place “ soon ” :
America , which gave [ Israel ] everything it needed in these battles , will suffer economic stagnation , ruin , destruction , and crime , which will surpass what is happening in Gaza .
One of these days , the U.S. will suffer more deaths than all those killed in this third Gaza holocaust .
This will happen soon .
He also invoked a notorious Islamic hadith on the inevitable annihilation of the Jews by Muslims :
The stone , which is thrown at the Jews , hates these Jews , these Zionists , because Allah foretold , via His Prophet Muhammad , that Judgment Day will not come before the Jew and the Muslim fight .
The Jew will hide behind stones and trees , and the stone and the tree will speak , saying : “ Oh Muslim , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him . ”
The only exception will be the Gharqad tree .
This harangue would be nothing new on television in the Islamic world ; in fact , it is commonplace .
What is unique about Sultan ’s threats against America is that he holds U.S. permanent residency status and , according to one federal law enforcement official , travels regularly on a U.S. passport .
And as I have reported elsewhere , Sultan is pursuing U.S. citizenship ( the status of his application is unknown due to federal privacy laws ) .
Thus , Salah Sultan has lived quite comfortably for more than a decade under the protections of the very country he now threatens with death and destruction .
It should be noted that Salah Sultan is not some obscure figure in the American Islamic world .
He serves as a member of the Fiqh Council of North America .
Touted as the top Islamic governing body in the U.S. , the Fiqh Council is an arm of the Islamic Society of North America .
Sultan founded and served as president of the Islamic American University in Southfield , Michigan ; he was the national director of tarbiyah ( Islamic instruction ) for the Muslim American Society ; and he continues to operate the American Council for Islamic Research , based in my hometown of Hilliard , Ohio .
Sultan ’s Al - Nas TV appearance last week was recorded and translated by the indispensable Middle East Media Research Institute ( MEMRI ) .
Curiously , as soon as MEMRI published the video clips of Sultan ’s harangue , references to Sultan ’s membership with the Fiqh Council were scrubbed from its website .
His name has been removed from its list of council members , even though he appeared there as recently as early last week .
However , Sultan is still listed as a member on the Fiqh Council ’s brochure posted online ( no doubt that will be remedied as soon as they are informed of this report ) .
This is not the first time that Sultan has been the subject of a MEMRI report for his statements made and activities conducted outside of the U.S.
In July 2007 , MEMRI reported on a conference held in Doha , Qatar , in honor of Hamas spiritual leader Yusuf Al - Qaradawi , who has been banned from the U.S. since 1999 for his active support of Islamic terrorism .
One of the conference ’s keynote speakers was Hamas head Khaled Mash’al , a “ specially designated global terrorist ” by the U.S. government who praised the terror cleric for his fatwa endorsing Hamas suicide bombings against Israeli civilians .
Sitting beside Mash’al and Qaradawi on the speaker ’s dais was none other than Salah Sultan , who gave two separate addresses during the conference honoring his mentor , Qaradawi .
This appearance by Sultan with two terrorist leaders directly violates the much - ballyhooed 2005 anti-terrorism fatwa issued by the Fiqh Council and signed by Sultan himself prohibiting such contact .
Sultan also spoke at a July 2006 pro-Hamas rally in Istanbul held by the extremist Saadet Party , which also featured an address by Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh — again , a glaring violation of the Fiqh Council ’s terrorism fatwa .
But with several former Fiqh Council members in prison on terrorism - related charges ( former council trustee Abdurahman Alamoudi , currently serving a 23 - year prison sentence ) , deported for concealing their terrorism ties ( Fawaz Damra ) , fingered in illegal terrorist fundraising ( current member Muhammad Al - Hanooti ) , and named as unindicted co-conspirators in terrorism trials ( former chairman Taha Jaber Al - Awani ) , it should be apparent that the group is not rigorous in the fatwa ’s enforcement .
The Investigative Project has published a dossier on the extensive roster of Fiqh Council members tied to the international Islamic terrorist network .
May 2006 saw Salah Sultan ’s first starring role in a MEMRI report when he was recorded on Al - Risala TV saying the U.S. government was behind the 9/11 terror attacks , which he claimed were then used to declare war on Muslims worldwide , and also praising Osama bin Laden mentor and “ specially designated global terrorist ” Abd - al - Magid Al - Zindani ( see the MEMRI video clip and transcript of Sultan ’s Al - Risala interview ) .
These comments were made just two weeks after the Columbus Dispatch published a lengthy defense of Sultan as a moderate and the Central Ohio Islamic school that he was religious director of at the time .
Sultan ’s Middle East media appearances also caught the eye of the Los Angeles Times in July 2007 .
The paper cited him by name in an article by Borzou Daragahi on a group of Islamic clerics who “ share the outlook of al - Qaeda ” and who were “ glorifying holy war ” on Bahraini TV .
Sultan was a regular guest on a program hosted by Muslim Brotherhood cleric Wagdi Ghoneim , who was expelled from the U.S. in December 2004 and banned from reentering for his ties to Islamic terrorism .
As noted by Bahraini blogger and journalist Mahmoud Al - Yousif , their television program was shut down by the Bahraini government after extensive criticism by members of parliament and the media .
Considering Salah Sultan ’s lengthy résumé of Islamic extremism and regular association with designated terrorist leaders — much of it captured on video — you might think that the Department of Homeland Security would take some action with respect to his permanent residency status ( despite owning a home in Ohio , he spends most of his time in Bahrain , disqualifying him for permanent residency ) , if not ban him completely from the country .
You would be wrong , however .
In fact , Sultan spent most of December touring mosques in Central Ohio before jetting off to Egypt last weekend for his Al - Nas interview .
But now that Salah Sultan is publicly inciting violence against the U.S. and predicting the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of our citizens through foreign media outlets , on what basis can Homeland Security officials continue to ignore this very real and extensively documented terror threat , his connections to leading U.S. Islamic groups notwithstanding ?
That remains to be seen .
Appearing to cave to Hollywood demands , Apple has quietly added a restrictive copyright protection mechanism to its new MacBooks that is preventing customers from watching movies on external displays .
Apple has secretly included a copy protection scheme called High - bandwidth Digital Content Protection ( HDCP ) in the external display ports on the latest models of it MacBooks , released in the middle of October .
Apple has not disclosed the new anti-copying mechanism , and now increasing numbers of customers are discovering that they cannot play movies bought from the iTunes online store on many external monitors , TVs or projectors .
" I tried all the movies that I have purchased from the iTunes Store with the same result , " said " Maxyourmacs , " who
complained about the issue on Apple 's support forums .
" None of them will play on anything but the MacBook 's small 13 - inch screen .
This is crazy unacceptable . "
Released by Intel in 2001 , HDCP is designed to prevent digital pirates from outputting movies to copying devices , such as digital video recorders .
In industry parlance , the technology plugs the " analog hole " – the security hole created by analog devices like TVs and monitors .
By definition , the technology also prevents movies from playing on non-compliant devices like older computer monitors or flat - screen TVs , which many Apple customers are just now discovering .
Even TVs a couple of years old may not be HDCP compliant .
The issue is complicated by obsessive secrecy surrounding the technology .
HDCP has been added to many models of Blu - Ray players and other entertainment devices , and several laptops from a range of PC manufacturers .
However , it is unclear how many devices are HDCP - compliant : Manufacturers do n't explicitly label which products are and are n't .
Even industry analysts do n't know how widely the technology has been adopted .
Intel declined to comment , and Apple did not respond to several requests for comment .
However , the surging popularity of Apple 's laptops and its iTunes online store is bringing the issue to the fore .
The copyright mechanism is posing problems for some customers , who are complaining in Apple 's support forum that they had no idea their viewing devices were not compliant with the HDCP standard , forcing them to watch movies purchased from the iTunes Store on their small laptop screens .
" You really should n't be expected to know whether your video devices are compliant , " said James McQuivey , a technology and media analyst at Forrester Research .
" It 's not your job .
To require that burden on them is an unfair thing to do . "
Apple 's new MacBooks ( including the MacBook Pro and
MacBook Air ) are the first
Macs to include HDCP .
McQuivey said Apple is clearly giving in to pressure from its studio partners .
McQuivey said studios are reluctant to deal with iTunes since its movie - purchasing model involves downloading content straight to a hard drive , where it is vulnerable to copying .
Movies are easily copied and shared with friends on DVDs or thumbdrives ( as long as the sharer also provides their password ) .
Movies from services like Vudu and
Netflix , on the other hand , which stream movies over the internet , are much more difficult to copy and easier to police , he said .
McQuivey noted that iTunes ' movie offerings ( about 1,500 movies ) pale in comparison to Vudu ( 5,000 movies ) and Netflix ( 15,000 movies ) because studios are distrustful of customers downloading movies to their hard drives .
Michael Cai , director of digital media at Parks Associates , a digital market research firm , said the headaches caused by HDCP is largely a result of poor communication between manufacturers .
" The industry has n't done a very good job in coordinating with each other to make sure their devices are compatible with each other so you wo n't feel this issue , " Cai said .
" And they have n't done a very good job in terms of educating consumers with these issues . "
Cai , himself , experienced the pains of HDCP .
He recently tried to plug his Blu-ray equipped Sony VAIO laptop into his Sharp high - definition TV , and the image would n't show up .
McQuivey added that the HDCP restriction might be counterproductive for both
Apple and movie studios :
It could encourage MacBook owners to resort to illegal means of downloading , such as BitTorrent .
In the Apple support forums , this already seems to be the case .
" Apple will be out of luck , because we will , as of today , buy no more movies from the iTunes
Store , " writes a new MacBook Pro customer , who said he could n't play * * an iTunes - purchased copy of Terminator 2 on his TV .
" If this starts hitting the TV shows and the music videos , too , then we 'll stop buying them from the iTunes Store as well . "
Intel declined to comment .
Apple did not respond to several requests for comment .
( Fortune ) --
Sure , you read the papers , so you know the ax is falling left and right these days : Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) is slashing 7,000 jobs , Caterpillar ( CAT , Fortune 500 ) is laying off 20,000 workers , Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) is cutting as many as 5,000 positions , and Pfizer is letting go 10 % of its staff of 81,900 .
Still , you did n't expect it to happen to you .
But if you 've just left your boss 's office with the dire news that your position is being eliminated , what do you do ?
" First , do n't take it personally , " says Richard Bayer , Ph.D. , chief operating officer of the Five O'Clock Club , a nationwide network of career coaches and outplacement counselors .
" For most people , getting laid off is an emotional moment .
You may be hurt , you might feel panic - these are totally normal reactions . "
There are at least two good reasons to stay as calm as possible , though , at least outwardly .
One is logical , and could save you needless heartache : " In a recession , especially a really deep recession like this one , there can be many different reasons why you 're being let go - banks are n't lending , consumers are n't shopping , revenues are drying up - and none of them has anything to do with you , " Bayer says .
The second reason is practical : You 'll probably need to meet with your boss at least one more time ( most likely with a human resources person in the room ) , to tie up loose ends and go over the details of your departure , and you want to go in there with your wits about you .
Before that meeting , take a close look at the employee manual -- or your union agreement or employment contract if you 're covered by one -- so you know the company 's severance policy .
Sometimes -- especially if your situation is unique in some way -- you may be able to negotiate a better deal .
" Your mantra in this discussion should be , ' We 're both fair people - you 're a fair - minded person , and I just want what 's fair , ' " says Bayer .
For instance , let 's say your company 's rule of thumb is two weeks ' pay for each year of service .
" That 's a commonly used formula left over from when people tended to stay with the same employer for many years , " Bayer notes .
" But suppose you are a 50 - year - old manager making $ 100,000 a year who was wooed away from a competitor and had to move across the country to take this job , and let 's say that was just two or three years ago .
Is four or six weeks ' severance pay really fair ? "
In such a case , even the most hardnosed boss is likely to agree you should get more .
Sometimes , cash is n't even the main issue .
" You may , for example , have a child who is undergoing expensive medical treatments , " Bayer says .
" In that case , you might want to negotiate to stay on the company 's health care plan for a longer period of time . "
By law , companies must offer you COBRA coverage , meaning that you can buy health insurance at group rates .
But COBRA covers you for only 18 months .
" Health insurance is so much cheaper for the company than it is for you , " says Bayer .
" If your circumstances are unusual , and again with an appeal to your employer 's sense of fairness , why not bargain for an extension ? "
Regardless of your particular circumstances , do n't sign any severance agreement until you 've had a chance to read it carefully and give it calm consideration .
Keep in mind these four more often - overlooked areas where it may be possible to negotiate :
1. Vacation pay .
If you work for a company that allows you to accrue vacation time from one year to the next , do n't forget to calculate the dollar value of all the fun you did n't have - last year as well as this year .
" Many HR manuals even specify in black and white that you can trade unused vacation days for pay , so they may be expecting you to ask about it , " says Bayer .
" You 're unlikely to get much of an argument . "
2. Bridging to retirement .
If you 're anywhere near retirement age , check out your company 's policy on pension eligibility .
Let 's suppose it's " 55 and 10 " ( age 55 , minimum 10 years of service ) .
If you 're vested and , say , age 53 , you can ask to be bridged - that is , to start taking your pension now .
This is somewhat less common than it used to be , and many companies do n't allow it at all , but it can't hurt to ask .
You never know .
3. Stock options .
Usually , you have 90 days after your last day of employment at the company to exercise any stock options you have , or lose them forever .
If you push , though , many companies will extend that period to as much as a year - particularly given what has probably happened to your company 's stock price lately .
4. Noncompete agreements .
This is a tricky area .
If you 're asked to sign something saying you wo n't go work for a competitor - and beware , it 's often buried in an obscure paragraph of some other document , such as a waiver of the right to sue the company after you 're gone - call a lawyer .
Courts , especially in California , tend to take a dim view of noncompetes , and you ( or your attorney ) can probably get it removed from your severance agreement .
And speaking of lawyers , the question often comes up : Would it be smart to bring an attorney into severance negotiations ?
The short answer : Usually , no .
Unless you see clear signs of some violation of public policy -- if , for example , you notice that everyone being laid off just happens to be female , a minority , over 40 , or some combination of these -- then hauling a lawyer into discussions with your boss is likely to set an adversarial tone that will work against you in the end .
( Let 's get real : Your employer can afford more legal help than you can and if you hire an attorney to nitpick your deal , they will bury you in paper . )
Even so , it 's worth noting that a federal law called the Older Workers ' Benefit Protection
Act , in effect since 1990 , requires that employers laying off more than two people disclose the ages of those who were selected for termination and those who were not .
Age discrimination is never easy to prove , but this law can help .
Readers , if you 've been laid off , what kind of severance did you get ?
Did you feel it was fair ?
Did you try to negotiate the terms ?
What did you want , and did you get it ?
Any suggestions for others who want to pursue a better deal in a layoff ?

What really is behind the numbers reported on the number of civilian casualties in the Gaza Strip ?
Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported Thursday that a doctor working in Gaza 's Shifa Hospital claimed that Hamas has intentionally inflated the number of casualties resulting from Israel 's Operation Cast Lead
" The number of deceased stands at no more than 500 to 600 .
Most of them are youths between the ages of 17 to 23 who were recruited to the ranks of Hamas , who sent them to the slaughter , " according to the newspaper article .
Solidarity Israeli school erects mourning tent for Gaza Meirav Shlomo Students of Jaffa high school hold ceremony displaying images of death from Gaza fighting School erects mourning tent for Gaza
The doctor wished to remain unidentified , out of fear for his life .
A senior Palestinian Health Ministry official later denied the claims , and the Israel Defense Forces ' estimate on the number of casualties in Gaza has also remained unchanged .
Despite the claims , the IDF stood behind its estimate that between 1,100 to 1,200 people were killed in the Strip during the fighting , more than two - thirds of them Hamas members .
The army initially believed that the number of civilian casualties was higher , as many Hamas men walked outside their houses dressed in civilian clothes , leaving their weapons at home .
Dr. Moaiya Hassanain , who is in change of the emergency department at the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza , denied the figures presented by the Italian paper .
Hassanain told
Ynet that the Palestinian figures were issued cautiously , without any political considerations , and that several casualties may not have been reported as their bodies are still under the rubble or have not been handed over to the rescue forces and authorized medical officials .
' Mostly armed teenagers '
A Tal al - Hawa resident told the newspaper 's reporter , " Armed Hamas men sought out a good position for provoking the Israelis .
There were mostly teenagers , aged 16 or 17 , and armed .
They could n't do a thing against a tank or a jet .
They knew they are much weaker , but they fired at our houses so that they could blame Israel for war crimes . "
The reporter for the Italian newspaper also quoted reporters in the Strip who told of Hamas ' exaggerated figures , " We have already said to Hamas commanders – why do you insist on inflating the number of victims ? "
These same reporters mentioned that the truth that will come out is likely to be similar to what occurred in Operation Defensive Shield in Jenin .
" Then , there was first talk of 1,500 deaths .
But then it turned out that there were only 54 , 45 of which were armed men , " the Palestinian reporters told the Italian newspaper .
These new figures must be treated with caution especially in light of the fact that various official sources in the Gaza Strip , including United Nations and Red Cross officials , have reported that more than 1,300 people were killed and some 5,000 wounded during the three weeks of fighting in the coastal strip .
Palestinian sources claim that three - quarters of the dead were unarmed civilians .
Hamas , while boasting on having Israeli soldiers by the dozens , a number that has proven to be exaggerated , claimed that no more than 48 of its members were killed during the Israeli offensive .
According to IDF figures , Hamas lost hundreds of fighters from its ranks .
The UN 's humanitarian chief began a tour of the Gaza Strip on Thursday to examine the extent of the devastation left behind by the Israeli offensive .
John Holmes said the number of casualties is " extremely shocking . "
He also urged Israel to conduct a thorough investigation into shelling attacks that damaged UN buildings in Gaza .
Holmes said he was thinking about immediate humanitarian needs and longer - term reconstruction .
He said the biggest concerns are providing clean water , sanitation , electricity
and shelter .
Holmes added that Gaza 's border crossings would have to be opened to allow reconstruction materials into the area .

The computer was taken from an unlocked office at a Swansea hospital
An NHS trust serving people across south Wales has been criticised after a laptop with details of about 5,000 patients were stolen .
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University NHS
Trust was found to have breached data protection laws .
The computer , which had patient medical records on it which were not encrypted , was stolen from an unlocked office .
The trust has now signed an agreement to encrypt all data in future and improve security .
The health trust serves patients in Swansea , Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend .
The laptop was stolen by an " opportunistic thief " from an unlocked management office at Singleton Hospital in Swansea last April .
Appropriate safeguards
It is understood the computer was taken outside normal working hours .
In a separate case , a trust in the north of England , Tees , Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust was also criticised by the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) for losing a data stick containing patient information .
Mick Gorrill , Assistant Information Commissioner at the ICO , said : " Both these cases highlight the importance of implementing the appropriate safeguards to ensure sensitive personal details about patients are processed securely .
" Even though one case involved the theft of a laptop , the data controller ( Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University NHS Trust ) is responsible for ensuring any personal data is adequately protected .
" The Data Protection Act clearly states that organisations must take appropriate measures to ensure that personal information is kept secure .
Password protected
" Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University NHS Trust and Tees , Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation
Trust recognise the seriousness of these data losses and have agreed to take immediate remedial action , " Mr Gorrill added .
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg NHS
Trust issued a statement saying : " The theft took place outside of normal office hours , at a time when the offices would normally be unoccupied and the rooms locked .
" The laptop contained patient identifiable information , but this information was password protected .
In addition , documents stored on the hard drive were also password protected . "
The trust said it had taken a number of measures to improve security and encryption .

We 've searched through countless forum posts , angry criticisms , and pleas for assistance to come up with the best methods for getting that unlock to stick .
Before we give you the tips , you 'll want to hit up The Yellowsn0w Report to check out the general status of the iPhone 3G unlocks and your carrier of choice .
If a lot of people are striking out with your carrier , you might be out of luck .
But if there 's confusion -- or better yet , a large number of successful unlocks -- then you 'll want to turn to one of the two following methods for getting the 0.9.4 beta unlock ( as of this article 's writing ) to stick on your iPhone .
These come courtesy of Lostfaith over at the Modmyi forums , who did a painstaking job of tracking down these seemingly arcane techniques :
----------------------------------------
Method # 1 ( from Youtube 's reda92 )
1. Install Yellowsn0w thru Cydia , keep your Third - Party Sim in the iPhone
2. Reset Network Settings . 99 % of your success rate will depend on this .
( LF : you can find this in settings - general and to the bottom you 'll see a " reset " menu in which you can find this )
3. Reboot your iPhone
4 . Wait a little over a min .
5 . Remove your SIM card and re-insert it back in
6 . Wait 30 sec .
7. Turn on Airplane mode and wait 10 sec .
( This is important as well )
8. Turn of Airplane mode , you should see " searching . "
Start smiling , as the T - Mobile carrier will start appearing .
9 . Make a call !
Method # 2 ( from to Deli_gt at hackint0sh ) :
1. Recover your iPhone to the 2.2 firmware .
2. Quickpwn it with Installer and Cydia installed
3 . When phone is ready , connect to your Wifi .
Got to Cydia .
When it opens , ignore the update for Cydia and install Mobileterminal and , after that , Sbsettings .
4 . Turn off data roaming and 3G in Sbsettings !
5. Install Yellowsn0w from Installer .
6 . Slide your finger from the top - left to right on the screen to get Sbsettings open
7 . Press the power button in Sbsettings and from the popup restart button .
8 . When the iPhone resets , wait for 20 - 30 seconds and open up Mobileterminal
9 . Go to terminal and type :
yellowsn0w -c
yellowsn0w -q
airplane mode on
airplane mode off
If you get " open : Resource busy " just repeat the command where you got it from .
If the command " yellowsn0w - q " keeps loading for more than 20sec and your terminal looks similar to pics from Flickr : deli_gt 's Photostream then move to next step .
10 . Go to Settings .
Turn Airplane Mode on .
Wait 10 secs and it should start searching for the network .
It should find the network and everything should be ok .
If not , and the iPhone still shows the four dots for the signal , repeat steps 8 and 9 but first exit mobile terminal totally by holding down the home button until it closes .
If that does n't work either try the following :
Open up the Terminal and type :
yellowsn0w -c
yellowsn0w -r
yellowsn0w -q
airplane mode on
airplane mode off
----------------------------------------
If neither of these tricks work , again , you should definitely hit up the Yellowsn0w report and see how other people have gotten their iPhones to unlock on the various carriers .
It beats searching through pages and pages of forum posts , trust us !
Others feel religion and sports should not mix .
" Why must he rub it in my face ? " they ask .
If anyone is ashamed of me and my words , the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels .
Then Jesus came to them and said , " All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me .
Therefore go and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you .
And surely I am with you always , to the very end of the age . "

A higher intake of folate reduces the risk of stroke in male smokers by 20 percent , according to a new study conducted by researchers from the National Cancer Institute , the National Institutes of Health , the Karolinska Institutet and the Finnish National Public Health Institute , and published in the " Although these observational data do not prove a causal relation , they indicate that high consumption of folate - rich foods ( e.g. , whole grains , green leafy vegetables , oranges and legumes ) may play a role in the prevention of stroke , " the researchers said .
Researchers examined data on 26,556 male Finnish smokers between the ages of 50 and 69 , comparing the occurrence of stroke with the consumption of several B vitamins as determined by food frequency questionnaires .
During a 13.6 - year study period , 3,281 of the participants experienced strokes .
The researchers found no relationship between the consumption of B6 or B12 and stroke risk .
Men who consumed the most folate , however , had a 20 percent lower risk of stroke than the men who consumed the least .
The highest level of folate consumption in the study was 410 micrograms per day , while the lowest was 262 micrograms per day .
The researchers hypothesized that folate might decrease the risk of stroke by lowering blood levels of the chemical homocysteine , which has been shown to damage blood vessels and induce clotting .
The best way for smokers to reduce their risk of strokes is to quit smoking , but the new study suggests that supplementing foods with folic acid might reduce the risk even to those who will not quit .
In the United States , many foods are already supplemented with folic acid , namely to reduce neural tube defects in infants .
Folic acid deficiency can lead to birth defects before many women even know they are pregnant .
The new research might give a boost to efforts to implement similar supplementation in Europe .
Schools can expel students that seem gay , appeals court rules John Byrne
Published : Wednesday January 28 , 2009
Print This Email This Lawyers agreed Christian high school case would apply to California private schools A California appeals court ruled Monday that a Christian high school can expel students perceived to be lesbians , upholding a 2008 lower court ruling that there were " no triable " elements to the case .
The 4th District Court of Appeal in Riverside on Monday upheld California Lutheran High School 's right as a private , religious organization to exclude students based on sexual orientation .
The ruling was released late Tuesday .
The two 16 - year - old girls sued the school for expelling them on the basis of a " bond of intimacy " " characteristic of a lesbian relationship , " under a California discrimination law .
" It is almost like it could roll back 20 to 30 years of progress we have made in this area , " Kirk Hanson , the girls ' attorney , told the LA Times .
" Basically , this decision gives private schools the license to discriminate . "
While the court called its own decision " narrow , " lawyers on both sides of the case said it would likely shield protect private schools -- beyond simply the Christian school in the lawsuit -- from anti-discrimination suits .

James Frey “ is moving on from his drugs and booze - soaked memoirs to write the third book of the Bible , ” said Alison Flood in the Guardian , in which his version of Jesus will perform gay marriages and live with a prostitute .
The author recently told TheRumpus . net that he wanted to imagine Jesus as alive and walking the streets of New York City today — this should go over well with devout Christians .
Frey goes out of his way to be provocative , said Gawker .
And seeing as he has yet to land a deal for this book , he is “ no doubt looking to stir up controversy . ”
But he better be careful :
He already alienated Oprah ’s audience , “ which is most of America , ” when he admitted to fabricating parts of A Million Little Pieces .
And once he has angered Christians , “ which is the rest of America ” — there may be “ nobody left to buy his books ! ”
Good , said Ericka Anderson in The Confabulum , because “ Jesus is sacred to most Americans . ”
And to people who “ consider Christianity a central part of life — including the truth and validity of the Bible ” — the ideas that Frey is proposing are stomach turning and borderline blasphemous .
Imagining Jesus “ living with a prostitute ” and “ supporting abortion ” ?
It does n’t get much more offensive than that .
What can you get for 100 quid these days ?
A train ticket to Edinburgh , maybe .
A complete DVD box set of The Wire .
A couple of cashmere sweaters from Gap .
A slap - up dinner at The Ivy – for one .
Or a brand new computer .
Specifically , the £ 99 miniature " ONEt " laptop made by Bromsgrove - based computing firm Elonex , which will soon be sold in your local high street , alongside the cashmere sweaters at Next .
At seven inches , its screen is smaller than a copy of Glamour magazine .
It comes in pink .
And it is the cheapest example of 2009 's surefire consumer technology hit , the netbook : tiny , energy - efficient and practical mini-laptops .
At last week 's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , the world 's biggest technology trade fair , new netbook models were unveiled not only by Elonex , but by Sony ( £ 849 ) , by Hewlett - Packard ( £ 330 ) , and by Asus ( £ 130 ) , the Taiwanese company that popularised the netbook with its Eee PC , first sold in 2007 .
Microsoft , too , acknowledged the netbook 's rise by confirming that its new operating system , Windows 7 , will be available in a specially developed netbook edition .

Even mobile phone operators are getting in on the act , conscious of the growing demand for constant internet access .
Vodafone , for example , has teamed up with Dell to offer the computer manufacturer 's Inspiron Mini 9 netbook for free , with a monthly mobile broadband contract – the sort of subsidy previously reserved for mobile phone handsets .
At that price , computers could soon be not only as affordable a mobile phone , but as disposable , too .
Netbook sales have already overtaken those of 2008 's top gadget , the iPhone .
During last year 's third quarter , Apple shifted 4.7 million iPhones , compared to the 5.6 million netbooks sold in the same three - month period .
And the netbook market is expected to grow by 80 per cent in 2009 , with IT research firm Gartner predicting that , by 2012 , annual netbook sales will top 50 million .
The laptop comparison website Notebookreview.com monitors the most popular models in the sector by regularly counting the most - viewed products on its pages .
Four of the present top 10 are netbooks .
" They 're so portable , " says Luke Peters , deputy editor of T3 , the technology and gadgets magazine .
" In a business environment , people are buying them for their size .
And on a mainstream , consumer level , people are buying them because they 're cheap . "
Not all netbooks are inexpensive ; Sony 's new eight - inch Vaio P will set you back £ 849 when it goes on sale next month .
Still , the average netbook retails at around £ 300 .
The latest ONEt model will be available in February for £ 99 direct from Elonex , and even buying it on impulse in Next will cost you just £ 199 .
They appeal to businesspeople , bored of trying to type grammatically correct emails on a tiny Blackberry keyboard ; to tech aficionados increasing their arsenal of personal computing gadgets ; to students and their parents looking for a decent first laptop ; to anyone who wants to Facebook on the move , and likes a laptop that fits in their bag .
What do most of us use our computers for , after all ?
Surfing the internet , writing documents , storing a few digital photos .
If we can have all this for a couple of hundred pounds , why would we spend more ?
" You can do almost anything on a netbook as long as it's not graphics - rich gaming , or serious photo and video editing , " says Peters .
" A netbook 's power now is akin to a decent laptop from six or seven years ago . "
Netbooks typically weigh under 1.5 kg , with screens of nine inches or less .
Many contain Intel 's low - powered Atom processor and run on the Windows XP operating system ( slightly dated , but less troublesome than the subsequent Windows Vista ) .
They 're equipped for the " cloud " computing age : a netbook 's storage space may be limited ( The Elonex has just 2 Gb of hard - drive space , little more than a mobile phone ) , but it can be networked remotely with your home computer 's hard disk – giving you instant access to all your files – and often comes complete with free online storage space .
Thanks to a lack of mechanical moving parts such as CD drives , and the lower power requirements of their processors , they also have a disproportionately long battery life – perfect for long journeys .
In a recession , these are the sort of practical , low - cost specifications that most people will want from their new laptop .
Previously , we may have bought gadgets for style as much as substance ; in 2009 we 'll more likely be looking for convenience and affordability .
According to a survey conducted in November by Forrester research , one in five consumers who plan to buy a new computer this year will , given the economic climate , spend less than they did on their last PC .
In spite of its obvious qualities , the netbook 's rise has come about more by accident than design .
When Asus first released the Eee PC ( named after the " three Es – easy to learn , easy to work , easy to play " ) for $ 245 in October 2007 , Peters visited its creators in Taiwan .
" They told me they just wanted to make a concept product that fell between the internet - ready mobile phone and the laptop , " he says .
" They really did n't predict that consumers worldwide would say , ' Hold on a minute , here 's a laptop for 200 quid , that has the internet and Word , and that I can carry around with me .
That 's exactly what I 'm looking for ; why would I spend a grand on something with a load of multimedia aspects that I just do n't need ? ' "
Cheap computing has been made possible by a manufacturing boom , driven not only by the PC market but by demand for ever more sophisticated mobile phones and MP3 players .
Economies of scale have reduced the cost of processors , of LCD screens , of memory .
Courtesy of the price war between the gadget factories of the Far East , it 's now entirely feasible to turn a profit on a £ 99 laptop .
Inevitably , the netbook has now spawned so - called ' net - tops ' : low - cost desktop computers like Asus 's £ 214 Eee Box .
But not all those who stand to profit from the netbook 's popularity are entirely happy about it .
Intel developed the low - power Atom chip for netbooks , thinking that they would become popular only among those who could n't afford proper laptops , or who felt a need to have a second one .
Once it became clear that many people were buying them instead of regular laptops , the company began to pressure PC manufacturers to keep netbooks at 10 inches or smaller so as not to compete directly with the rest of its mobile PC market .
Conventional laptops generally contain Intel 's more powerful – and , crucially , more profitable – Dual Core processor .
The news that both Samsung and Dell are planning to unveil 12 - inch netbooks – the same size as a standard small laptop – has only made Intel more nervous .
Dell 's Inspiron Mini 12 will run on an Atom chip , but the Samsung will use the cheaper Nano chip , which is made by Intel 's rival Via .
Meanwhile , fellow chip manufacturer Freescale will drive costs down still further with its new i.MX515 processor , designed specifically for sub -$ 200 netbooks .
Processor producers are n't the only ones concerned about the netbook 's cannibalisation of the laptop market .
Launching Hewlett - Packard's $ 499 HP Mini 2140 netbook in Vegas last week , company spokesman Mike Hockey was at pains to emphasise that the device was a " companion " for a larger PC , not a replacement .
The more people buy HP netbooks instead of laptops , the smaller his company 's profit margins will become .
In May 2008 , it emerged that Microsoft was offering PC manufacturers steep discounts on the Windows XP operating system so as to prevent them turning instead to the low - cost , open - source OS , Linux , for their netbooks .
In return , Microsoft wanted assurances that the netbook 's screens would remain limited to less than 10.2 inches and their hard drives to a maximum of 80 GB , to prevent them eating into the company 's traditional laptop market .
As the netbook manufacturers learnt that they could call the shots , however , these restrictions were eased ( to 14.1 inches and 160GB ) , and the forthcoming Windows 7 OS will require far less computing power to run than its predecessors have done – a sure sign that Microsoft is feeling threatened by the mass adoption of the undemanding Linux system .
If open source platforms such as Linux grow in mainstream popularity thanks to the netbook , it will also provide an opening for Microsoft 's rival software giant , Google , whose open source Android operating system is based on Linux .
Android was initially devised as a platform for mobile devices such as the new Googlephone , but its basic , user - friendly interface is also appropriate for a netbook .
To prove as much , a pair of developers from the technology site Venturebeat installed Android on an Asus Eee PC for a New Year 's Day blog , and suggested that an Android netbook could be widely available by 2010 .
" We would normally think to market netbooks alongside mobile PCs , " says Ranjit Atwal , Gartner 's principal research analyst .
" But they 're now being positioned closer to mobile phones ...
The difference between mobile phones and PCs is that there 's a lot more innovation in mobile phones – you always see varying phone formats , different sizes , different usages .
There 's not a single operating system controlling the mobile phone market , whereas the mobile PC market is still based on the Microsoft interface .
" Microsoft has benefited from consumer inertia .
We 're all used to Windows .
But for the different usages of a netbook compared to a PC , a different type of interface , such as Linux , might be more user - friendly , and might generate innovation around how we interact with our PCs .
As we move away from the mass usage of PCs into a much more specialised , segmented computing market , we 've got to re-examine the value of , say , Microsoft , compared to the sort of practical , useable interface we expect on our phones . "
One computing behemoth that has n't yet deigned to enter the netbook race is Apple , whose products have always been at the top end of the consumer technology market .
" We do n't know how to make a $ 500 computer that 's not a piece of junk , and our DNA will not let us ship that , " said Apple 's CEO , Steve Jobs , in October .
The iPhone and its non-phone counterpart , the iPod Touch , arguably offer the same mobile internet capabilities as a netbook , and for a similar price .
But that has n't stopped the rumour mill generating stories of seven - and nine - inch iPod Touches , supposedly being developed to compete in the netbook market .
" I 've always compared the PC market to the car market , " says Atwal .
" Over the past 15 years or more , the car market has segmented based on what sort of car people might need for their personal usage – be it a two - seater sports car , or a seven - seater people carrier .
It 's the same with the PC market .
Over time , it 's going to segment , based on varying preferences , needs and usages .
" So we are now seeing a proliferation of different devices , and at the end of the day it willbecome harder and harder to differentiate between high - end mobile phones , low - end laptops and netbooks . "

Office software
OpenOffice : OpenOffice has become the automatic choice for those who enjoy railing against Microsoft .
Its interface does n't have quite the finesse of Word , Excel or Powerpoint , but it operates in a pretty indistinguishable fashion , and no one looking at your documents or spreadsheets would know you 'd been using a freebie .
Some prefer it to Microsoft .
It 's less interfering ; for instance , it does n't decide to tab up or number paragraphs for you as you type .

Have n’t they already ?
President Obama warned Republicans on Capitol Hill today that they need to quit listening to radio king Rush Limbaugh if they want to get along with Democrats and the new administration .
“ You ca n’t just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done , ” he told top GOP leaders , whom he had invited to the White House to discuss his nearly $ 1 trillion stimulus package .
One White House official confirmed the comment but said he was simply trying to make a larger point about bipartisan efforts .
Smart points in response from Tom Maguire , especially number three .
If , contra his campaign rhetoric , The One really does plan on bringing back Fairness , he just made his task of selling it to the public as a nonpartisan measure not aimed squarely at conservative talk radio a lot harder .
Exit question :
What ’s his game here ?
Obama ’s a shrewd guy ; he must have known a comment like that would leak and that Limbaugh would have a field day with it .
Maybe he ’s trying to buy himself cover with the left by antagonizing Rush into a blood feud ?
Progressives will be less likely to grumble about his tack to the center if their archenemy is on the air every day accusing him of being the Marxist antichrist .
Or , doubly Machiavellian , maybe he ’s trying to bolster Rush ’s influence so that he ’ll drag the GOP back to the right , leaving the center to Obama and the Dems .
Maybe ?
All theories welcome !
The more sinister , the better .
Update : Limbaugh fires back , via Byron York :
To make the argument about me instead of his plan makes sense from his perspective .
Obama ’s plan would buy votes for the Democrat Party , in the same way FDR ’s New Deal established majority power for 50 years of Democrat rule , and it would also simultaneously seriously damage any hope of future tax cuts .
It would allow a majority of American voters to guarantee no taxes for themselves going forward .
It would burden the private sector and put the public sector in permanent and firm control of the economy .
Put simply , I believe his stimulus is aimed at re-establishing “ eternal ” power for the Democrat Party rather than stimulating the economy because anyone with a brain knows this is NOT how you stimulate the economy .
If I can be made to serve as a distraction , then there is that much less time debating the merits of this TRILLION dollar debacle .

The new chief of staff to health reform czar Tom Daschle was a lobbyist through late last year and will have to recuse himself from issues he worked to influence , an administration aide said Thursday .
Daschle chief of staff was lobbyist
The new chief of staff to health reform czar Tom Daschle was a lobbyist through late last year and will have to recuse himself from issues he worked to influence , an administration aide said Thursday .
Daschle adviser Mark B. Childress is the second lobbyist to land in the top ranks of the Health and Human Services Department and joins at least 12 others who have found jobs in the administration — despite the president ’s repeated pledges during the campaign to stamp out their influence in Washington .

As a partner at the law firm Foley Hoag , Childress represented the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and PanFlu , which sought assistance on mobile health technology issues .
He will need to avoid making decisions that affect his former clients or the broader areas they represented , but Childress will not require a waiver because he did not lobby the health and human services department , the aide said .
“ With broad experience in Congress and in the White House , Mark has the expertise to tackle the challenges facing our health care system , ” Obama spokesman Reid Cherlin said in a statement .
“ He will fully comply with the ethics pledge , including recusing himself from matters and specific issues he worked on while employed at Foley Hoag . ”
On his second day in office , Obama issued an executive order forbidding executive branch employees from working in an agency , or on a program , for which they have lobbied in the last two years .
Childress , however , will join a growing list of employees who will be prohibited from dealing with matters on which they lobbied within the two - year window .
Obama aides have stressed that former lobbyists make up a “ tiny ” fraction of the 8,000 employees who will be hired by the administration — and the president should get credit for trying to enact stricter rules than his predecessors .
“ The ethical standards implemented by President Obama have been applauded by experts across the spectrum as the most rigorous in history , ” Cherlin said .
Childress spent five years in Daschle ’s Senate office , working as his chief counsel and policy director until the senator lost reelection in 2005 .
In announcing its hire of Childress in January 2007 , Foley Hoag described him as someone who “ worked at the highest levels of the Executive Branch and Congress . ”
Childress also worked as senior counsel in the Clinton administration and general counsel on the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee .
Given his experience at the White House and on Capitol Hill , Childress is considered well - positioned to help usher one of Obama ’s chief domestic priorities — overhauling the nation ’s health care system — through Congress .
“ The president has not only made health reform a priority for his administration , he has followed up on that commitment by choosing top - caliber people like Tom Daschle and Bill Corr to lead HHS , ” Childress wrote in an introductory e-mail this week to the department staff .
“ While we wait for their confirmations , we look forward to working with you to promote the president 's priorities and perform our mission . ”
Corr , who is Obama ’s pick to be deputy secretary of health and human services , was an anti-tobacco lobbyist , and will have to recuse himself from tobacco - related issues to comply with the ethics rules .

Last summer , we met ' Helvetica ' director Gary Hustwit at a NYC book reading and were thrilled to hear about his newest project , ' Objectified ' , a documentary about industrial design due this spring .
As Gary explained : " It ’s a look at the creativity at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech gadgets .
It ’s about the people who re-examine , re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis . "
Among his subjects : Jonathan Ive , the British - born designer who 's the SVP of Industrial Design at Apple ( AAPL ) and one of the brains behind the iMac , the iPod , and the iPhone .

Jeff Atwood ’s latest post on Coding Horror provides great insight into the history and mindset of one of the Computer Science greats , Alan Kay .
It ’s a good read for any computer professional looking to delve further into the advances that Kay worked on .
Unfortunately , Jeff has a pretty strong distaste of PHP , and blindly jumps on a perceived opportunity to back up his case .
He cites an ACM Queue article where Kay discusses why software development does not happen faster .
Here ’s the important section that Atwood quoted .
Bolding is Atwood ’s emphasis :
Let 's say the adoption of programming languages has very often been somewhat accidental , and the emphasis has very often been on how easy it is to implement the programming language rather than on its actual merits and features .
For instance , Basic would never have surfaced because there was always a language better than Basic for that purpose .
That language was Joss , which predated Basic and was beautiful .
But Basic happened to be on a GE timesharing system that was done by Dartmouth , and when GE decided to franchise that , ** it started spreading Basic around just because it was there , not because it had any intrinsic merits whatsoever .**
He follows his citation with this comment :
Any similarity between the above and PHP is , I 'm sure , completely coincidental .
That sound you 're hearing is just a little bit of history repeating .
His link here goes to an earlier post where he lambastes PHP for , well , existing really .
I took issue with the post at the time , finding several glaring holes in his logic and generally disagreeing with the premise ( obviously ) .
I replied in the comments ( look for my name ) , and expounded further in a rebuttal post on my own site .
I did n’t let him get away with unfounded arguments then , and I ’m not going to now .
In the ACM Queue article , Alan Kay discusses the evolution of programming languages .
He and his colleagues expected the next big leap in programming language structure to occur somewhere around 1984 , with the introduction of a new generation of programmers .
It never happened — to Kay ’s satisfaction , anyway — and he believes that commercial software development doomed this advancement , and has stagnated the evolution of programming theory .
This leads to Jeff ’s quote and PHP quip .
Two problems here .
First , Kay was discussing evolutionary leaps , not the quality of the current crop .
Kay does n’t know how language theory will evolve , he ’s waiting for someone to come along with the next bright idea ( otherwise he would have done it , duh ) .
Labeling any current language as subpar simply because someone theorizes “ we can do better ” is complete non-sequitor .
I believe Kay knows this and his words in the article back it up .
To put it another way , using Atwood ’s logic , would n’t VB.NET would fall into the same category of failure ?
Kay may not be worshiping at the altar of PHP , but I do n’t see him anywhere near Microsoft ’s temple either .
Second , PHP is successful because of its merits , not in spite of their lacking .
Jeff needs to read the Wikipedia article on PHP .
The very first paragraph on the page reads :
PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page .
It began in 1994 as a set of Common Gateway Interface binaries written in the C programming language by the Danish / Greenlandic programmer Rasmus Lerdorf .
Lerdorf initially created these Personal Home Page Tools to replace a small set of Perl scripts he had been using to maintain his personal homepage .
The tools were used to perform tasks such as displaying his résumé and recording how much traffic his page was receiving .
He combined these binaries with his Form Interpreter to create PHP / FI , which had more functionality .
PHP / FI included a larger implementation for the C programming language and could communicate with databases , enabling the building of simple , dynamic web applications .
Lerdorf released PHP publicly on June 8 , 1995 to accelerate bug location and improve the code .
This release was named PHP version 2 and already had the basic functionality that PHP has today .
This included Perl - like variables , form handling , and the ability to embed HTML .
The syntax was similar to Perl but was more limited , simpler , and less consistent .
PHP is 100 % grass - roots success , starting out as one guy ’s collection of useful tools for building websites .
I refuse to believe that , in this age of abundant choice , all these programmers picked up PHP because it was “ easy . ”
The numbers are just too big , features and power must enter into the equation at some point .
Nonetheless , Atwood ’s application of Kay ’s quote would lead you to believe that PHP exists because Zend Technologies pushed the language financially , just as GE backed BASIC .
The truth is exactly the opposite : Zend Technologies exists because of PHP ’s overwhelming success .
Coming from a hard core VB.NET programmer , I find the insinuation here a little insulting ; Zend Technologies is hardly MS Borg .
When it comes to having a discussion about programming philosophy , I would n’t even put myself in the room with Kay .
I do n’t know enough on programming language evolution to even join the discussion .
Atwood , on the other hand , gets too close to the fire and gets burned .
He erroneously applies Kay ’s argument to his own beliefs which , when scrutinized , deflate much like the previous one .
This is the second time now Jeff has taken a unfounded shot at PHP .
The complete lack of substance behind his claims make him look like nothing more than your average “ my language is better than yours ” fan boy .
I could ignore it , but his audience is large enough to effect real influence .
So like anyone else in a position of power , he must be called on the outlandish claims .
I read your blog all the time , Jeff , I know you can do better than this .
Ty Inc. -- the company that brought us Beanie Babies -- is on to the next big thing .
Namely , exploiting the two first daughters , Sasha and Malia Obama .
The worst part is that the toy outfit refuses to cop to the fact that they plan to profit from the names and likenesses of the Obama girls .
The new 12 - inch - tall dolls are named " Sweet Sasha " and " Marvelous Malia , " and according to the Associated Press :
The Oak Brook - based company chose the names because " they are beautiful names , " not because of any resemblance to Malia and Sasha Obama , said spokeswoman Tania Lundeen .
" There 's nothing on the dolls that refers to the Obama girls , " Lundeen said .
" It would not be fair to say they are exact replications of these girls .
They are not . "
Right .
And that Garfield ' I do n't do perky " Beanie Baby just happened to look like a fat , sullen cartoon cat but was in no way meant to be that Garfield .
President Obama 's camp has said that it is " inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes . "
The Ty Girlz are already selling for $ 29.99 for two on sites like www.barrysbeaniescatalog.com.
And they are already selling on ebay.com , natch .

What do you think ?
Should the company be allowed to rip off the Obama girls ' images for profit ?
And will Sasha and Malia be able to stay normal ?

I ’m not sure who is stronger : Barack Obama or Darth Vader ?
All I know is that the new President Barack Obama will probably be able to kick just as much ass if he had a lightsaber and was a Jedi…oh wait , he already is in the new Action Hero outfits .
The new Barack Obama Action figures provide new looks at the newly appointed President of the United States .
After his inauguration , I believe he probably has more support , and if you do n’t think so…check out his new weapons .
n the first one , Barack Obama is sporting a lightsaber in a duel with Darth Vader , which definitely gets the new President some Geek support from loyal Star Wars fans .
The next is the Obama Ninja outfit , which makes you wonder if he will slice up terrorists or hopefully taxes .
In the last ones , Barack Obama is armed with some hot weapons that makes me wonder if they are even street legal …actually , I ’ll take his word for it .

They 're ambitious , those Brits — the Guardian newspaper has been publishing a listing of 1000 books you must read , and now it includes every must - read science fiction novel .
Let the canon - shredding commence !
Advertisement
Says the Guardian , in its intro :
It is sometimes assumed that science fiction , fantasy and horror must mean spaceships , elves and vampires - and indeed , you 'll find Iain M Banks , Tolkien and Bram Stoker on our list of mind - expanding reads .
Yet these three genres have a tradition as venerable as the novel itself .
Fiction works through metamorphosis : in every era authors explore the concerns of their times by mapping them on to invented worlds , whether they be political dystopias , fabulous kingdoms or supernatural dimensions .
Advertisement
It 's definitely an interesting list — probably different from what most American newspapers or critics would have chosen .
There 's a lot of literary stuff , some of which everyone recognizes as science fiction ( like Margaret Atwood and Michael Chabon ) and some of which nobody does ( Henry James , Herman Hesse ) .
Oddly , both Iain M. Banks and his literary twin , Iain Banks , make the list .
It 's probably weighted a bit too much towards earlier works , but it contains a surprising number of ninteenth century titles , enough to be provocative .
There 's some stuff in there which is more properly fantasy , like Harry Potter and The Sword In The Stone .
Oh , and they misspelled Samuel Delany 's name .
Oops .
Mostly , though , it 's a pretty great list — it does what a list of must - read books should do , which is make you rethink the shape of the genre .
Not just by debating which books they left out and which they should n't have included , but also by making you think about how far back the genre stretches , and how much it 's changed in recent years .
The recent authors on the list include rising stars like Alastair Reynolds and China Mieville , as well as some literary stars like Nicola Barker .
You can sort of see an arc , from 19th century fabulism through 20th century pulpiness , back to a kind of fabulism in the 21st century .
Or maybe I 'm just projecting a bit .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Easily as interesting as the main list are some of the side articles , like Michael Moorcock 's list of the best dystopias ( which contains few surprises but is still an interesting bit of analysis . )
And Roz Kaveny 's list of radical novels .
Susanna Clarke names her favorite world - building series .
And there 's the best of J.G. Ballard , an author who belongs on any must - read list .

WE like our failed presidents to be Shakespearean , or at least large enough to inspire Oscar - worthy performances from magnificent tragedians like Frank Langella .
So here , too , George W. Bush has let us down .
Even the banality of evil is too grandiose a concept for 43 .
He is not a memorable villain so much as a sometimes affable second banana whom Josh Brolin and Will Ferrell can nail without breaking a sweat .
He ’s the reckless Yalie Tom Buchanan , not Gatsby .
He is smaller than life .
The last NBC News / Wall Street Journal poll on Bush ’s presidency found that 79 percent of Americans will not miss him after he leaves the White House .
He is being forgotten already , even if he ’s not yet gone .
You start to pity him until you remember how vast the wreckage is .
It stretches from the Middle East to Wall Street to Main Street and even into the heavens , which have been a safe haven for toxins under his passive stewardship .
The discrepancy between the grandeur of the failure and the stature of the man is a puzzlement .
We are still trying to compute it .
The one indisputable talent of his White House was its ability to create and sell propaganda both to the public and the press .
Now that bag of tricks is empty as well .
Bush ’s first and last photo - ops in Iraq could serve as bookends to his entire tenure .
On Thanksgiving weekend 2003 , even as the Iraqi insurgency was spiraling , his secret trip to the war zone was a P.R. slam - dunk .
The photo of the beaming commander in chief bearing a supersized decorative turkey for the troops was designed to make every front page and newscast in the country , and it did .
Five years later , in what was intended as a farewell victory lap to show off Iraq ’s improved post - surge security , Bush was reduced to ducking shoes .
He tried to spin the ruckus as another victory for his administration ’s program of democracy promotion .
“ That ’s what people do in a free society , ” he said .
He had made the same claim three years ago after the Palestinian elections , championed by his “ freedom agenda ” ( and almost $ 500 million of American aid ) , led to a landslide victory for Hamas .
“ There is something healthy about a system that does that , ” Bush observed at the time , as he congratulated Palestinian voters for rejecting “ the old guard . ”
Only a few days left to Double your gift
Several friends of mine , all of them environmentalists , have told me they picked up Small Wonder , Barbara Kingsolver ’s most recent collection of essays , but speedily put it down because the book just did n’t pull them in .
At first , I had the same reaction .
And then I realized : small wonder .
This book was n’t written for environmentalists .
Yet because of Kingsolver ’s fame and her ability to talk about complex issues in a compelling way , Small Wonder may be more successful at communicating an environmental message to a lay audience than any other book published in recent years .
As a best - selling novelist whose Poisonwood Bible was selected for Oprah ’s Book Club , Kingsolver has access to a broad , mainstream audience .
In the past few weeks , at least five acquaintances have asked , “ Have you read the new book by the woman who wrote The Poisonwood Bible ? ”
These are busy people who would n’t cross the street for just any old essay on how the wasteful use of the world ’s resources by the United States contributed to the events of Sept.
11 ( “ Saying Grace , ” “ Flying , ” and “ And Our Flag was Still There ” ) , the scientific reasons to be cautious about genetic engineering ( “ A Fist in the Eye of God ” ) , or the importance of biodiversity ( “ Seeing Scarlet ” ) .
But they were eager for a word — any word — from an incredible storyteller with a gift for prose so warm and solid it feels like a rounded river rock in your hand .
Given that many people , myself included , will read anything Kingsolver cares to write , we environmentalists should consider ourselves lucky that she cares to write about living well and justly on the earth .
Throughout Small Wonders , Kingsolver uses her gift for storytelling and for strong , playful language to record the details of everyday life , while drawing out the connections and implications for the world at large — and particularly the post - Sept. 11 world .
In “ Lily ’s Chickens , ” for example , she tells the delightful story of her daughter ’s relationship with a rooster : “ My daughter is in love .
She ’s only five years old , but this is real .
Her beau is shorter than she , by a wide margin , and she could n’t care less .
He has dark eyes , a loud voice , and a tendency to crow .
He also has five girlfriends , but Lily does n’t care about that either . ”
The chickens are part of Kingsolver ’s effort to grow most of her own food , an effort that she takes to heart without taking it too seriously : “ I ’m trying to learn about this complicated web as I go , and I ’m in no position to judge anyone else ’s personal habits , believe me .
…
Our quest is only to be thoughtful and simplify our needs , step by step . ”
Yet she does n’t hesitate to use her gift for language to highlight injustice where she sees it .
In talking about the energy and resource requirements needed to produce a pound of beef , she asks , “ How can all this cost less than a dollar , and who is supposed to pay for the rest of it ?
If I were a cow , right there is where I ’d go mad . ”
Kingsolver shares what she loves about growing her own food — the poetic names of the heirloom vegetables , the satisfying ache in her muscles after a long day of gardening — while relating the practice of doing so to the events of Sept. 11 and to concern for the world in general : “ There has never been a more important time to think about where our food comes from .
We could make for ourselves a safer nation , overnight , simply by giving more support to our local food economies and learning ways of eating and living around a table that reflects the calendar . ”
Because of Kingsolver ’s fame and her ability to treat weighty issues with a light touch , Small Wonder will reach people environmentalists have n’t yet figured out how to connect with .
The other week , an acquaintance told me , “ I loved the essays about 9/11 .
I wish there had been more of those .
But I was also really interested in the essays about her daughter ’s chickens .
It made me start thinking about where my own food comes from . ”
Thanks to Kingsolver , the two of us had a conversation about local food options in Iowa , our homestate , and I passed on some information about how to join a local community supported agriculture project .
True , this book was n’t written for me .
But I was drawn into it and appreciated it , nonetheless , for what it taught me about how to do my job better .
As environmentalists , we should all tell stories to tell the truth .
We should n’t take ourselves too seriously .
We should say more about what we love than about what we hate .
And we should learn , like Kingsolver , to take heart from small wonders .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The Great Depression is in full swing .
Gangster Al Capone is sentenced to 11 years behind bars for tax evasion .
Dick Tracy debuts in the comics .
The George Washington Bridge opens .
The old subway cars have concrete floors , overhead fans and open windows .
The year is 1931 .
And New Yorkers are stepping onto the brand new R - 1 model subway car , built by the American Car & Foundry factory in Berwick , Pennsylvania .
Fast - forward 77 years .
New Yorkers and tourists are once again boarding these 84,000 - pound , 60 - foot - long behemoths constructed of riveted steel , with some featuring wicker seats , dangling emergency brake cords , incandescent light bulbs , big exposed overhead fans , and open windows .
" I really thought I was getting on the wrong train until the conductor told me it's going to 23rd [ Street ] , exactly where I 'm going , '' said Joseph Salmond , who had never seen a subway car quite this old .
" It was like , what 's that movie , ' Back to the Future ' ? "
Watch the ride back in time »
A legendary workhorse of the transit system until the model was put out to pasture in 1977 , the R - 1 is temporarily back in action as part of New York City Transit 's holiday " Nostalgia Train ' ' on Sundays in December .
The R - 1 and other rehabilitated subway cars from the 1930s to the 1970s are making the rounds from Manhattan 's Lower East Side to the borough of Queens along the " V " line .
Passengers love to ride on this special occasion , even though the ride is bumpier and noisier than they have grown accustomed to on today 's gleaming stainless steel subways .
Do n't Miss Nostalgia Train schedule
Would New Yorkers want to ride these trains on a daily basis ?
" Absolutely not , '' says Chuck Falkowitz , who remembers the R - 1 from his childhood in the 1950s .
He prefers today 's cleaner seats , improved lighting , heating and air conditioning .
" But it is fun to ride them , '' Falkowitz says .
" Once a year 's more than enough ' '
Bill Wall , a New York City Transit service supervisor working aboard the R - 1 on a recent Sunday , said the train has a special effect on riders and subway employees alike .
" You come on a New York City subway , people are there , they read their papers , they 're going about their business , " he said .
" On this train , you see people smiling and talking to one another and saying , ' Oh , God , this is a great thing , ' '' said Wall , proudly calling it " transportainment . "
Built like a battleship with steel body and concrete floors , the R - 1 was simple and reliable .
State of the art in its day , each car cost just under $ 40,000 , according to Wall .
Today 's subway cars run the city about $ 1.5 million apiece .
In the 1930s , the R - 1's ceiling fans were a major improvement over relying solely on the motion of the train and open windows to move air around .
But as time went on , people thought , '' Overhead fans that close to people 's heads -- that may not be such a great idea , '' Wall said .
In the 1940s , the system began switching to enclosed fans .
Later , cooling and heating systems became the norm , which is why today 's subway cars have lower ceilings .
The R - 1s were also the first trains in New York to have four sets of doors on the sides for rapid loading and unloading , a big boost to New York City subways ' ability to accommodate the growing post - World War I population .
With the R - 1 in mind , Billy Strayhorn composed his 1939 classic tune , " Take the A Train . "
Given its historical legacy , what 's an R - 1 worth now ?
" It 's what you make it to be in terms of worth , " Wall said .
" Some people look at it and say it 's an old train worth whatever the scrap value is .
Some people will look at it and say it 's an heirloom . "
" You really can't even put a price on something like this , " he says .
To put things into perspective :
In the 1970s the R - 1s were being sold to scrap dealers for less than $ 1,000 each .
If you think you 'll get one for that price today , someone in Brooklyn has a bridge to sell you .

Sea level rise fueled by global warming threatens the barrier islands and coastal wetlands of the Middle Atlantic States , a federal report warned on Friday .
The report , issued by the Environmental Protection Agency , the United States Geological Survey and other agencies , is one of a series examining the potential effects of a rising sea level on the nation ’s coasts .
The rise in sea level is accelerating , the report said , because warmer water occupies more space and because of runoff from melting inland glaciers and ice sheets .
The Middle Atlantic States are particularly vulnerable because the rates of rise are “ moderately high ” there , the region is subject to storms , it is densely populated and much of its infrastructure is in low - lying areas .
The report , which is available at climatescience.gov , says that in the 20th century , rates of erosion in the region varied from 2.4 millimeters to 4.4 millimeters a year , or about a foot over 100 years .
In the future , the report said , “ it is virtually certain ” that coastal headlands , spits and barrier islands will erode faster than they have in the past .

Adam Hamilton at Zeal is predicting Big Inflation Coming .
The growing legions of deflationists see an unstoppable depression - like deflationary spiral approaching like a freight train .
They cite some convincing data .
The stock markets have been cut in half in just a year .
In the past 6 months , some key commodities prices fell farther and faster than they did in the entire Great Depression .
House prices are down by double digits across the nation , with no bottom in sight .
And credit is a lot harder to come by today than in any other time in modern memory .
My Comment
In light of these universal falling prices , how could we not be entering a sustained deflationary period ?
The case may seem airtight , but I ’d like to offer a contrarian view in this essay .
Believe it or not , despite 2008 ’s price collapse there is plenty of overlooked evidence suggesting big inflation is coming .
You wo n’t hear much about this on CNBC , but it could have a big impact on your investments in the years ahead .
My Comment
Inflation and deflation are purely monetary phenomena .
Inflation is not just a rise in prices , lots of things can drive prices higher .
Inflation is the very specific case of a rise in general price levels driven by an increasing money supply .
My Comment
Acknowledging that debt - financed house prices are a special case that may indeed be deflationary ( contraction of credit ) , I am focusing on stocks and commodities in this essay .
From October 2007 to November 2008 , the flagship S&P 500 stock index plunged 51.9 % .
About 4/7ths of these losses snowballed in just 9 weeks during the stock panic .
From July 2008 to December 2008 , the flagship Continuous Commodity Index plummeted 46.7 % .
Almost half of this mushroomed during the stock panic .
Deflationists argue these price drops are proof of deflation , and most people today believe this .
But they are only deflationary if they were driven by a contraction in the money supply .
Stocks and commodities are generally cash markets .
Credit such as stock margin can be used , but it is trivial relative to the market sizes .
And real commodities purchased for industrial uses are paid for in cash or near - cash ( short - term trade loans ) , not multi - decade loans like houses .
So the money supply during 2008 ’s slides is the key .
My comment
proof
should
If available money to spend indeed contracted , then the deflationists are right about seeing deflation in 2008 .
But if the money supply fell by less than stocks and commodities plunged , was flat , or even grew , then deflationists are wrong .
When prices fall simply because demand declines ( too much fear to buy anything immediately ) , this is merely supply and demand .
If money did n’t drive it , then it is n’t deflation .
Base Money % Change From A Year Ago
Hamilton 's definition shows there was massive inflation during the great depression , starting in 1931 !
Take a look at the two blurry images below .
Can you see an object hidden in each one ?
.
Before I give the answers , here ’s another question :
Do you feel a certain lack of control over events right now ?
These questions are not unrelated , according to a report in the new issue of Science by Jennifer Whitson and Adam Galinsky .
The researchers found that when people were primed to feel out of control , they were more likely to see patterns where none exist .
They would spot an object in each of the images above , even though only the image on the right contains one ( the outline of Saturn and its rings ) .
If you thought you saw something in the image on the left , do n’t be too hard on yourself — your feeling may be perfectly understandable given the chaos on Wall Street .
The researchers say that their experiments , which also tested people ’s tendency to detect conspiracies and see superstitious lessons in stories , help explain why conspiracy theories and superstitions flourish when people are feeling out of control .
Previous researchers have reported , for instance , that first - year business - school students are more prone to imagine conspiracies than are second - year students , and that deep - sea fishermen have more elaborate rituals and superstitions than ones who fish in more predictable conditions near shore .
I asked the Dr. Whitson , a professor at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin , if Wall Street traders might be behaving these days like those deep - sea fishermen .
“ They may be more likely pull their lucky shirt from their closet to wear into work or avoid stepping on any cracks while walking to work , ” Dr. Whitson replied .
“ And individual investors may be looking more to astrology to determine when to buy and sell or even seeing more nefarious patterns in the actions of their family or coworkers . ”
She noted that previous research has shown an increase in superstitious belief during times of economic uncertainty .
In the experiments by Dr. Whitson and Dr. Galinsky , people were were more likely to see nonexistent patterns after they ’d been assigned frustrating tasks with nonsensical rewards and punishments , or after they ’d been asked to recall situations in which they ’d felt out of control .
Dr. Galinsky , a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University , noted some historical examples of this tendency , like the reactions of Londoners during the bombing of their city in World War II .
“ Even though later statistical analysis clearly demonstrated that the bombs fell randomly across the city , people were certain that parts of the city had been targeted and other parts spared , ” he told me .
“ People in those areas of the city seemingly spared came under suspicion as Nazi sympathizers , and their livelihoods and physical safety were threatened .
And in those areas seemingly targeted by the bombs , people moved out , attempting to escape systematic bombing that was in fact not systematic . ”
The researchers noted that the delusion of order might be useful in some circumstances , if only because it eases depression and gives people confidence .
Dr. Whitson told me :
Feeling in control might be one of the central animating forces for psychological and physical well - being .
Not only are people who feel in control less likely to see things that are n’t there and end up chasing ghosts , as our research shows , but there are also a wide variety of health and societal benefits .
When people are given information about a medical procedure – and thus feel less uncertain – they recover more quickly .
Dr. Whitson pointed to an earlier study in which some people at a nursing home were given plants to care for themselves , and a control group received plants that were cared for by the staff .
After six months , the people who took care of their own plants were judged by themselves and by the staff to be better off emotionally and physically than the control group .
And in the course of 18 months even their mortality rate was lower .
So should we all be tending plants until the financial crisis eases ?
Or have you found some other techniques for feeling in control ?
And , however you did on the test with the images , can you recall any instances when you saw any kind of pattern that was n’t really there ?

Fired ' Troopergate ' figure gives investigators more e-mails RAW STORY
Published : Monday September 29 , 2008
Print This Email This
The former public safety commissioner at the center of an ongoing investigation into whether Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power by firing her has handed over e-mails he says prove he was not insubordinate , according to a local news report .
KTUU television says Walter Monegan has given investigators e-mails that show he was a responsible steward of his department 's budget and did not defy his bosses , undercutting arguments released by John McCain 's presidential campaign , which has all but taken over operations in running - mate Palin 's state office .
The campaign claims Monegan made unauthorized trips to Washington and asked for earmarks without approval of the governor .
Monegan admits he sent a letter asking for $ 1.8 million for an anti-gang initiative in Mountain View , but said he never made unauthorized trips to Washington .
He said the lack of communication between departments was n't on his behalf .
" There 's not a lot of input or requests ... or inclusion of anybody from DPS in this , " Monegan said in a phone interview .
" So I would submit that if there 's a communication breakdown , given that my trip was approved by the chief of staff and yet still discussed by the rest of the staff , that it might be realistically a breakdown in communications within the governor 's office more than anybody else . "
Monegan says Palin sought his dismissal after he refused to fire state trooper Mike Wooten , the governor 's former brother - in - law who she claimed was threatening her sister and father .
He says Palin and her husband , Todd , both pressured him to fire Wooten , although the couple dispute that claim .
Alaska 's state Personnel Board and legislature are investigating Palin 's conduct , but the governor is cooperating only with the personnel board .
Monegan previously described the e-mails released by the McCain - Palin campaign as portraying just " a little bit of gossip " primarily between two of the governor 's aides .
His e-mails , he said , would give investigators a much fuller picture of the circumstances that preceded his dismissal .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Despite a bleak economic environment featuring wide - ranging layoffs and rising unemployment , the nation 's premier law enforcement agency is touting " one of the largest hiring blitzes in our 100 - year history . "
The FBI is about to embark on its biggest hiring spree since immediately after the September 11 , 2001 .
The FBI posted openings for 850 special agents and more than 2,100 professional support personnel .
Officials say it 's the largest FBI job posting since immediately after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
The FBI 's unexpectedly large number of job openings results more from attrition and a wave of retirements than from growing government appropriations , Bureau officials told CNN .
The FBI routinely advertises openings for individuals with critical skills in computer science and language fluency .
But John Raucci , assistant director of the FBI 's Human Resources Division , says current needs are much more wide - ranging .
" We 're also looking for professionals in a wide variety of fields who have a deep desire to help protect our nation from terrorists , spies and others who wish us harm , " Raucci said .
The lengthy list of openings includes positions in finance and accounting , security , intelligence analysis , training and education , nursing and counseling , physical surveillance , electrical engineering , physical and social sciences , and auto mechanics .
Procedures for applying and a full listing of available positions are posted on the Web site fbijobs.gov .
" This is a great time to apply for a great job in the FBI , " said the bureau 's chief spokesman , Richard Kolko .
Officials note at least a few jobs are currently available in every one of the FBI 's 56 field offices across the nation .
The FBI lists openings throughout the year , but seldom has anything close to the current number of available positions .
The present job postings expire on January 16 , but a new , possibly smaller set of openings will be posted shortly thereafter , the agency said .

HARARE , Zimbabwe  Cholera swept through the five youngest children in the Chigudu family with cruel and bewildering haste .
On a recent Saturday , the children had chased one another through streets that flow with raw sewage , and chattered happily as they bedded down for the night .
The diarrhea and vomiting began around midnight .
Relatives frantically prepared solutions of water , sugar and salt for the youngsters , aged 20 months to 12 years , to drink .
But by morning , they were limp and hollow - eyed .
The disease was draining their bodies of fluid .
“ Then they started to die , ” said their brother Lovegot , 18 .
“ Prisca was first , second Sammy , then Shantel , Clopas and Aisha , the littlest one , last . ”
A ferocious cholera epidemic , spread by water contaminated with human excrement , has stricken more than 16,000 people across Zimbabwe since August and killed more than 780 .
President Robert G. Mugabe said Thursday that the epidemic had ended , but health experts are warning that the number of cases could surpass 60,000 , and that half the country ’s population of 12 million is at risk .

In a separate blog posting , I highlighted BusinessWeek magazine ’s 10 worst predictions of the year .
This caused me to ponder about who might have made the best prediction of the year in Canada .
Former Liberal and Conservative MP Garth Turner probably deserves this honour for his book Greater Good : The Troubled History of Real Estate ( Key Porter Books , $ 21.95 ) , which was released last March , less than a month after the Vancouver housing market peaked .
Turner , who is also a broadcaster and financial columnist , forecast a big correction in housing markets across the country .
That 's exactly what happened .
“ Few people in Boston , where home values doubled between 1997 and 2007 , would have then expected , without warning , the worst market decline since 1958 , ” Turner wrote .
“ I trust nobody in Vancouver , Kelowna , Saskatoon or Toronto expects that either . ”

" So for this hit , all you have to do is download the application ( 1.99 ) and then leave a 5 star review for the app in iTunes or the App Store , " said the posting , which has now been taken down , but is preservedhere by a screenshot taken by " Techtistic , " a reader of The Unofficial Apple Weblog .
It 's no surprise to see developers taking aim at the App Store , which has been a gold mine for coders thanks to the enormous population of iPhone users downloading applications .
In September , independent developer Steve Demeter announced earning $ 250,000 in just two months with his iPhone game Trism .
Many other programmers are reporting similar success .
Glowing reviews can make or break an app in the App Store – a fact Apple recently acknowledged when it changed the rules regarding reviews .
In the past , anyone could review an app without even downloading it .
Apple saw that was unfairly hurting – or favoring – some developers , so the company revised the policy , requiring customers to download an app in order to rate it .
In the screenshot , the Mechanical Turk listing offers $ 4 , asking " workers "
to download the $ 2 app and leave it a five - star review , earning $ 2 in profit .
The listing asks participants to identify themselves in the App Store by sticking five periods (.....) somewhere in the review .
Currently , out of the 22 reviews for the app , there are six including five dots .
Casual Game Network developed the app , and its CEO Adam Majewski , whose name is listed as the " Requestor " in the screenshot , neither denied nor confirmed the marketing method .
" I can't speak to the marketing efforts being done , " Majewski told Wired.com .
" There 's numerous being done by people in my organization , and I do n't know the day - to - day aspects ... so I ca n't speak to that specific approach [ on Mechanical Turk ] . "
We 're definitely going to keep looking into cases like this .

Last night , the Colorado skies played host to a dazzling fireball event .
The meteor blasted through the atmosphere , detonated and outshone the Moon by 100 times .
It is therefore expected that there were many eyewitnesses , and the Cloudbait Observatory ( 5 km north of the town of Guffey , CO ) is appealing to people to report their accounts of the fireball .
Fortunately , the observatory managed to capture an all - sky camera video of the early morning explosion .
The Colorado fireball comes shortly after a similar event over Canada on November 20th , where over two dozen meteorite fragments have been recovered from agricultural land .
We wait in anticipation to see if this huge Colorado fireball produced any similar fragments , but eyewitness accounts will be critical to aid such a search …
In the early hours of this morning , a large explosion dominated the Colorado skies .
It was yet another large meteor ploughing through the atmosphere , ending its journey in an energetic detonation .
Fortunately this event did n’t suffer from the same affliction the Sudan 2008 TC3 meteoroid impact back on October 7th ( i.e. lack of observers ) , and put on a show much like last month ’s Saskatchewan fireball ( and the October Ontario meteor ) .
All in all , North America is having a great meteor season with no lack of observers , eye witnesses and all - sky cameras .
Discussing last night ’s Colorado fireball , astronomer Chris Peterson describes the event : “ In seven years of operation , this is the brightest fireball I ’ve ever recorded .
I estimate the terminal explosion at magnitude - 18 , more than 100 times brighter than a full Moon . ”
Peterson was using video recorded by Cloudbait Observatory ’s all - sky camera , dedicated to meteor spotting , when the surprise magnitude - 18 burst lit up the skies .
Although the all - sky camera caught the fireball in the act , more information is needed about its location and altitude .
There is every possibility that this fireball produced fragments that landed on the surface ( much like last month ’s Canadian fireball ) .
For meteorite hunters to find these pieces , eye - witnesses need to contact the Cloudbait Observatory to file their reports .
Additional details of the event ( from Cloudbait ) :
* Camera name : Cloudbait ( map )

[ open on interior , Capitol Hill , night ]
Sen. Joseph Biden : [ banging gavel ] Gentlemen !
Gentlemen , please !
Please !
Professor
Hill , I want to thank you for your .. patience here today .
You ’ve shown remarkable courage throughout your testimony .
It could n’t have been easy for you – or any of us – to sit here for the last seven hours and talk about penis size , or large - breasted women having sex with animals , or pubic hairs on soft drink cans , or oral sex , or the black man ’s sexual prowess , or large - breasted women having sex with animals .
But we appreciate your candor .
[ rest of committee shake their heads and smile ]
And we , uh .. hope we can reschedule you for another session tomorrow .
Anita Hill : Thank you , Senator . [ stands up to leave , bumps into next witness , Judge Clarence Thomas , and quickly walks away from him ]
Sen. Joseph Biden :
The committee , at this time , would like to call Judge Clarence Thomas .
Judge Thomas ? [ Judge Clarence Thomas sits ]
Judge Thomas , we ’re sorry to have to bring you back , but , as you know , some pretty serious allegations have been made by our previous witness .
Judge Clarence Thomas :
First of all , I want to say that these proceedings are a travesty !
Sen. Joseph Biden : Mmm-hmm .
Well , I understand that .
But you did ask Ms. Hill out on a date ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : Uh .. yes , I did .
[ the committee whisper amongst themselves at the revealing testimony ]
Sen. Joseph Biden :
And she refused ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
That ’s correct .
Sen. Joseph Biden :
How did you go about asking her out for this date ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : I ’m not sure what you mean , Senator .
Sen. Joseph Biden : Well .. did you just go right up and ask her ?
Or did you have one of her friends tell her that you thought she was cute ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : I just walked right up and asked her .
[ the committee whisper amongst themselves ]
Sen . Edward Kennedy :
Were you , uh .. were you drunk at the time ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
No , I was not .
Sen. Joseph Biden :
But she would n’t go out with you ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : No .
Sen. Joseph Biden :
Was she aware that , as her boss , you could have her fired ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
She must have been .
[ the committee members gasp at the shocking statement ]
Sen. Joseph Biden :
And she still did n’t go out with you ? [ Thomas nods no ]
Now , Judge Thomas , there have been charges by Professor Hill that you talked casually with her about graphic scenes in porno movies .
Is that true ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
Yes , it is .
Sen. Joseph Biden : And .. did that work ?
Did it break the ice ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : No , Senator , it actually offended her .
[ the committee is surprised the tactic did n’t work ]
Sen . Howell Heflin : Uh.. what porno movie did you talk about ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : Well ..
I mainly spoke about a favorite of mine , called “ The Hind - Lick Manuever ” .
Sen . Howell Heflin :
That ’s a good movie , Judge !
But do you think hard - core porno is the way to go ?
Because I feel women prefer softer porn .
Sen. Joseph Biden : Senator Thurmond ?
Sen. Strom Thurmond : I agree with Senator Heflin .
Yeah , that ’s right !
The women like something with more stories and costumes , that ’ll transport ’em to another place and time .
That ’s right !
Women do n’t like close - ups of oversized genitalia !
That ’s just never gonna turn ’em on !
[ committee agrees ]
Sen. Edward Kennedy : A , uh .. another good thing is to get them out on your boat for some reason , because , uh .. because then it ’s really hard for them to get away .
Sen. Joseph Biden :
Do you have a question , Senator Kennedy ?
Sen . Edward Kennedy : Uh , yes , I do .
Have you ever tried coming out of the bathroom nude , and acting like you did n’t know someone was there ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : Uh .. no .
Sen . Edward Kennedy :
Well , that ’s too bad .
Because that works , too .
Sen . Paul Simon : Um .. Judge ?
Judge Thomas ?
Judge Thomas , are you aware of that , uh .. division of our .. government .. known as the , uh ..
Criminal Justice , uh ..
Department ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
Of course I am , Senator !
Sen . Paul Simon :
Well , you know when you walk in the main entrance of the Criminal Justice Building .. there ’s this receptionist with short brown hair ?
Judge Clarence Thomas :
The , uh .. one at the third desk on the left ?
Sen . Paul Simon : No , no .
The one at the big , circular desk , uh .. right there in the center there .
Judge Clarence Thomas :
Oh , yes – Sandy .
Sen . Paul Simon : Yes .
Sandy .
Um .. do you think that she ’d go out with me ?
Judge Clarence Thomas : Well , Senator Simon , not knowing your technique , I feel that it would be unfair for me to prejudge your chances with her .
Sen . Paul Simon : Uh - huh .
Uh .. you think it ’s the bow tie , then ?
Sen. Joseph Biden : Senator Simon .
Please .
Sen . Paul Simon : Women just do n’t seem to like the bow tie , do they ?
Sen. Joseph Biden : Senator Simon .
Please !
Sen . Paul Simon : Uh , sorry .
Sorry .
Sen. Joseph Biden : Judge Thomas , I ’d like to thank you for your testimony .
You ’ve been very forthcoming , and , may I say , it ’s been an education .
Judge Clarence Thomas :
Thank you , Senator . [ stands up and exits ]
Sen. Joseph Biden :
The committee calls its next witness .
[ black man walks up ]
Sir , would you please state your name ?

Governor suspends all state business with Bank of America Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008

This BoA set to lose billions in business as Governor , President - elect show solidarity with workers
In a stinging note of support for the laid off workers that have taken up residency in Chicago 's Republic Windows & Doors factory , the Governor of Illinois has suspended business with Bank of America until it reissues credit to the shuttered company .
Bank of America cut off credit to Republic Windows & Doors company last week , and workers , demanding severance pay , began staging sit-ins , effectively taking control of the building .
The governor 's bold move comes immediately after President - elect Obama , himself a Chicago native , expressed sympathy for and agreement with the worker 's plight and resulting actions .
 When it comes to the situation here in Chicago with the workers who are asking for their benefits and payments they have earned , I think they are absolutely right ,  said Obama during a Sunday news conference .
 What s happening to them is reflective of whats happening across this economy . "
Bank of America , Chicago 's second largest bank , has received over $ 15 billion in bailout funds from the federal government .
During a Monday news conference , Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich insisted that the money was intended to be used for purposes such as this .
" We are reaching out to the management and ownership of the company to see what they can do to help resolve this issue , " said Bank of America in prepared statement .
" As a creditor of the company , we continue to honor all of our agreements with the company and have provided the maximum amount of funding we can under the terms of our agreement . "
 Families are already struggling to keep afloat ,  said Blagojevich , in a statement issued by his office .
" I hope that the company will be motivated to exhaust all resources to stay open .
We should be putting people to work during this difficult economic time  not sending them to the unemployment line . "
The New York Times was unable to attain comment from the company 's management late Monday .
" We never expected this , " factory worker Melvin Maclin , vice president of the workers union , told the New York Daily News .
" We expected to go to jail . "
Some workers have even said they are willing to spend Christmas in the factory , if necessary .
Founded in 1956 , Republic Windows & Doors company employed over 700 people at its height .

The pilots of US Airways Flight 1549 achieved one of the rarest and most technically challenging feats in commercial aviation : landing on water without fatalities .
Although commercial jetliners are equipped with life vests and inflatable slides , there have been few successful attempts at water landings during the jet age .
Indeed , even though pilots go through the motions of learning to ditch a plane in water , the generally held belief is that such landings would almost certainly result in fatalities .
Capt .
Chesley B. Sullenberger III , a veteran US Airways pilot , pulled it off while simultaneously coping with numerous other challenges .
In the minutes after takeoff , the pilot managed to maneuver past the skyscrapers of Manhattan and into the crowded Hudson River , even though the engines were disabled after apparently hitting a flock of geese .
Passengers said the plane was vibrating violently and the cabin began to fill with smoke .
To reach its splashdown spot , witnesses said the jet glided over the George Washington Bridge before plopping into the water .
TIKRIT , Iraq , Jan 29 ( Reuters ) -
An Iraqi town has unveiled a giant monument of a shoe in honour of the journalist who threw his footwear at former U.S. President George W. Bush .
The two - metre ( six - foot ) high statue , unveiled on Thursday in former dictator Saddam Hussein 's home town of Tikrit , depicts a bronze - coloured shoe , filled with a plastic shrub .
" Muntazer : fasting until the sword breaks its fast with blood ; silent until our mouths speak the truth , " reads an inscription , in honour of journalist Muntazer al - Zaidi , who hurled his shoes at Bush and called him a " dog " at a news conference during the former president 's final visit to Iraq .
Zaidi has been held in jail in Baghdad since the incident , facing charges of assaulting a visiting head of state .
Fatin Abdul Qader , head of an orphanage and children 's organisation in the town , said the one - and - a - half - tonne monument by artist Laith al - Amiri was titled " statue of glory and generosity " .
" This statue is the least expression of our appreciation for Muntazer al - Zaidi , because Iraqi hearts were comforted by his throw , " she said .
These are the 100 Greatest Stand Up Comics of All Time as ranked by Comedy Central and discussed by comedians Greg Giraldo , Dom Irerra , Judy Gold , and Mario Joyner and rotating guests Phyllis Diller , Richard Jeni , Pat Cooper , David Brenner , and Richard Lewis .
They aired the list over the course of the week of April 12th - 16th on Comedy Central
The show itself was severely lacking , particularly because the four main panelists rarely knew anything noteworthy to distinguish any of these comics from one another .
There was an everpresent variation of " he / she really opened the door for other african - american / latino / female / satirical / improvisational / prop comics everywhere " to be said for everybody on the list , along with other token phrases like " he / she really knows how to own his / her material " and " he / she really puts his / her audience at ease and just enjoys himself / herself " .
All in all , while the list does have enough merit to be of use ( At the least it 's a comedian metanode ) I determine the whole gimmick as just a way for Comedy Central to sell DVDs .
I mean , they 'll put on Wanda Sykes ( Who has a Comedy Central DVD available ) , but not Whoopi Goldberg ?
Are Kevin James , David Alan Grier and Jim Breuer ( all of whom have Comedy Central DVDs ) all really more impactual , important and funny than Sarah Silverman ( Who did not make the list ) ?
Not even mentioning the severe lack of comedians overseas ( While Bob Hope was born in England , it 's Eddie Izzard who represents here ) .
Maybe I 'm just a Conspiracy Theorist .
That being said , they at least left out Carrot Top .
Here 's the list .
Fenfluramine , the appetite suppressant drug banned in the US in 1997 due to fears over its links to heart conditions , has been shown to have serious long - term effects .
In a report published today in BMC Medicine , researchers have shown that people who stopped using fenfluramine eleven years ago had damaged heart valves up to seven years later .
Fenfluramine ( and the closely related dexfenfluramine ) were widely prescribed as half of a so - called ‘ fen / phen ’ drug combination used to combat obesity .
Since its withdrawal , there have been reports that tens of thousands of lawsuits have been filed against the drug ’s manufacturers over damage caused .
In this study , Charles Dahl from the Central Utah Clinic led a team of researchers who studied the heart condition of 5743 former fenfluramine users .
He said , “ Valve problems were common in individuals exposed to fenfluramines , more frequent in females and associated with duration of drug use in all valves assessed ” .
Heart valves , such as the aortic , mitral and tricuspid valves , ensure that blood flows in the correct direction around the heart .
When they fail , blood back - flows ( termed regurgitation ) .
If the regurgitation is severe enough , congestive heart failure and / or the need for heart valve surgery may occur .
Dahl said , “ We found clear evidence for a strong , graded association between duration of exposure to fenfluramines and prevalence of aortic regurgitation and for mild or greater mitral and tricuspid regurgitation ” .
This is the largest study to examine duration of exposure to the drug and the first to estimate the incidence of valvular surgery among prior users .
The authors found that 0.44 % of former fenfluramine users in this group had valve surgery as a result of the use of fenfluramines .
This risk for valve surgery was increased approximately seven fold .
They write , “ This is probably a conservative estimate , as another study has shown that there exists a 17 - to 34 - fold excess of clinically apparent ( presumably severe ) , valvular disease in persons who had used fenfluramines for four months or longer ” .
The medical marijuana advocacy group Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) filed a lawsuit Wednesday against the California Department of Motor Vehicles after it revoked the license of a medical marijuana patient solely for being a medical marijuana patient .
The plaintiff is Rose Johnson , 53 , of Atwater .
Johnson , a registered medical marijuana patient , had a clean driving record and no accidents in 37 years behind the wheel .
But the DMV refused to renew her license on July 26 after obtaining her medical records and finding out she used marijuana medicinally .
According to the DMV , Johnson 's license was revoked " because of ... [ an ] addiction to , or habitual use of , [ a ] drug , " thereby rendering her unable to safely operate a motor vehicle , even though no evidence existed to substantiate this claim .
" The DMV cannot simply disregard California 's medical marijuana law , " said ASA Chief Counsel Joe Elford , who is representing Ms. Johnson in her claim against the DMV .
" When the voters of California enacted the Compassionate Use Act , they never intended to authorize the DMV to strip medical marijuana patients of their drivers ' licenses , " continued Elford .
" The DMV should not be in the business of revoking the licenses of drivers like Ms. Johnson simply because she is a medical marijuana patient . "
ASA said Johnson is not alone in losing her license .
Suspension or revocation of drivers ' licenses for qualified medical marijuana patients has occurred in at least eight California counties , including Alameda , Butte , Contra Costa , Glenn , Merced , Placer , Sacramento , and Sonoma .
The DMV justifies its license revocations of medical marijuana patients by calling them " drug abusers " despite no evidence to back that claim .
The DMV has not taken similar blanket action against people prescribed opiates , barbiturates , sedatives , tranquilizers , or stimulants .
State and local police in California have been instructed by Attorney General Jerry Brown to respect the state 's medical marijuana laws and not arrest medical marijuana patients or take their medicine .
" The DMV is not under a different set of requirements than local police in California , " said Elford .
" The failure to uphold California 's medical marijuana law is entirely inappropriate for any local or state agency . "
The lawsuit was filed in Merced Superior Court .
It is expected to be heard sometime in the next few months .
Too often when reporting on renewable energy news , we bloggers can sometimes project the feeling that everything is going to be alright , look at all the pretty technology we ’re rolling out and saying it will power this many homes and take this many cars off the road and so on .
In an effort to get some perspective on these numbers I want to take as an example a story doing the rounds of the internet this very day .
The story is entitled – Government : Off - Shore Wind Could Power Every UK Home by 2020
and it says :
A recently completed study from the Department of Energy and Climate Change has concluded that off - shore wind power may be the key to the UK ’s energy future .
According to the study , 5,000 - 7,000 new turbines could be built off the coast by 2020 .
The turbines could generate 25 GW of power — the equivalent of 25 large coal - fired plants .
8 GW of additional offshore wind power are already planned .
There ’s just one problem — many of the current UK off - shore projects may not even be completed .
Emily Highmore , a spokeswoman for the London Array project , warned , “ Off - shore wind has always , and will always be , very expensive .
We ca n’t be confident it will go ahead , but we believe it ’s a cracking project and very important to helping the government meet its renewables targets . ”
However , if current and future projects come to fruition , up to 70,000 new jobs could be created and UK carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by up to 14 % .
So it ’s great that they have cautioned about the fact that the wind turbines may not be built at all , but let ’s assume they were all built and more .
The UK ’s own DTI , ( Department of Trade and Industry ) estimates the potential offshore wind generation resource is 4.6 kWh per day per person , from both shallow and deep waters .
The UK government announced on 10th December 2007 that it would permit the creation of 33 GW ( 13 GW more than is being claimed here ) of offshore capacity ( which would deliver on average 4.4 kWh/d per person ) .
To obtain this average power requires roughly 10 000 ‘ 3 MW ’ wind turbines ( They ’re called ‘ 3 MW ’ but on
average they deliver 1 MW . )
What would this 10 GW of power cost to build ?
Well , the 32 MW Kentish Flats farm cost £ 105 million , so 10 GW would cost about £ 33 billion .
This statement violates my rules of comprehensibility – who has got a good feeling for what a billion means ?
But “ 3 million per MW ” or “ 3 billion per GW ” is something we might compare with nuclear power .
Nuclear power stations cost about 1.25 billion per GW to build .
So at present prices the capital cost of offshore wind is greater than the capital cost of nuclear power .
However , we ’re not really comparing like with like here .
The 1 GW delivered by a typical nuclear power station is always on ; the power delivered by wind farms is erratic and would need a large amount of baseload generation to back it up .
Nuclear power and wind power have different clean - up costs and different risks , but I would think that if anything they would actually compliment each other quite well .
I have n’t talked about maintenance because I do n’t know the costs of that .
If any readers of this site would be kind enough to supply that information , or comment on it I would be very happy to see it .
Special construction requirements .
Another bottleneck constraining the planting of wind turbines is the special ships required .
If Britain were to erect 10,000 wind turbines over a period of 5 years then roughly 100 jack - up barges would be required .
These cost £ 60 million each , so an extra capital investment of £ 6 billion would be required .
Not a deal - breaker compared with the £ 33 b price tag we already quoted , but the need for jack - up barges is certainly a detail that requires some forward planning .
A second way of expressing the £ 33 billion cost of offshore wind delivering 4 kWh/d per person is to share it among the UK population ; that comes out to £ 550 per person .
Not too bad , and certainly less than the cost of recent bank bailouts .
So those are the possible costs , now let ’s look at the power generated .
Remember that figure of 4 kWh per day per person , let ’s take that see what that kind of power can really achieve :
If If you have the kettle on for 20 minutes per day , that ’s an average power consumption of 1 kWh per day .
One ring on an electric cooker has the same power as a toaster : 1 kW .
If you use two rings of the cooker on full power for half an hour per day , that corresponds to 1 kWh per day .
A microwave oven usually has its cooking power marked on the front : mine says 900 W , which is nearly a kilowatt ; but it actually consumes about 1.4 kW .
If you use the microwave for 20 minutes per day , that ’s 0.5 kWh per day .
A regular oven guzzles more : about 6 kW ( when on full ) .
If you use the oven for two hours every six days , that ’s 2 kWh per day .
So by the time you ’ve made a few cups of tea , and done some cooking you ’ve used up all the power generated by those offshore wind turbines .
I do n’t want to imply any criticism of the websites , or authors involved , in fact they are one of the reasons I think we have a decent chance of transitioning to a better culture .
As I said before I am just seeking to make a point about the truly vast challenges that await us all , as we strive to make the transition from a fossil fuel to a renewable energy civilization .

Here ’s a little - known fact : Denver light - rail trains are the emptiest in the nation .
Denver light - rail cars seat 70 and have room for at least that many standing , yet they carried an average of less than 14 people in revenue service in 2007 .
In the rest of the nation , the average was 24 .
If only RTD , Denver ’s transit agency , had managed to find some 14 - passenger buses ( which retail for about $ 50,000 each ) .
It could have saved taxpayers the $ 1.2 billion or so that it spent building light rail .
This fact is among many revealed in a new report published by the Independence Institute of Golden , Colorado , which has long been critical of RTD ’s dreams of rail empire .
The report shows that RTD has repeatedly and continually lied to voters about the high costs and minimal benefits from building more rail lines in Denver .
People who think Denver light - rail trains are full , or that they carry as many people as four freeway lanes , or that they are environmentally friendly need to listen less to RTD propaganda and take a closer look at the actual performance of light rail .
This report is a good place to start .
Here are just a few of the facts exposed by the report .
1. RTD spent 28 percent more than its original cost estimate on the Southwest light - rail line and 59 percent more on the Southeast line .
Yet RTD frequently insists it has always built its transit projects on budget .
2. DenverÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s light - rail lines use as much energy and generate more greenhouse gases per passenger mile than the average SUV .
Yet RTD maintains that light rail is good for the environment .
3 . Denver - area traffic grows more every five months than all the cars FasTracks is projected to take off the road .
Yet RTD claims FasTracks will significantly reduce congestion .
4. U.S. light - rail lines built with public - private partnerships went an average of 60 percent over budget .
Yet RTD insists that public - private partnerships can save 30 percent on construction costs .
5 . By failing to negotiate agreements with BNSF and Union Pacific prior to the 2004 election , RTDÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s poor planning added more than $ 300 million to the projected cost of FasTracks .
Yet RTD blames all of the cost increase since 2004 on unforeseeable increases in materials costs .
Transit agencies like RTD are supposed to provide an efficient transportation alternative for people who cannot or would rather not drive .
Instead , RTD tells lies in order to promote a wasteful , high - cost transit system that mainly benefits the contractors who build it , not the people who might ride it and certainly not most of the people who will have to pay for it .
Apple announced Friday that App Store customers have downloaded more than 500 million applications to date , indirectly revealing that per-day downloads have more than doubled since early December .
When AppleInsider last visited the numbersÂ early last month , Apple claimed over 300 million downloads .
Today 's announcement means that in the 42 days since December 5th , another 200 million have been downloaded for an average rate of 4.76 million per day .
That 's more than twice the daily run-rate of 2.2 million apps per day witnessed last month .
Microsoft : Big Security Hole in All IE Versions
On Wednesday , Security Fix warned readers about a newly - discovered security hole in Internet Explorer 7 .
I 'm posting this again because Microsoft now says the flaw affects all supported versions of IE , and because security experts are warning that a large number of sites are being compromised in an effort to exploit this vulnerability and install malware on vulnerable systems .
The SANS Internet Storm Center reports that hackers are breaking into legitimate Web sites and uploading code that could install data - stealing software on the machine of a user who visits the site using Internet Explorer .
SANS 's chief technology officer Johannes Ullrich estimates that thousands of sites have been seeded with this exploit to date .
For example , Web security firm Websense reports that hackers have compromised the Chinese Web site for ABIT , the maker of motherboards that power many home computers .
So far , the exploits appear to be only stealing online gaming credentials , but SANS and others warn that attackers will likely use this exploit more deftly in the coming days and weeks .
According to Microsoft 's revised security advisory , this flaw is present in every version of IE in use today , from IE5 all the way through to IE8 Beta 2 .
Microsoft 's advisory includes a host of recommendations for mitigating the threat from this vulnerability .
Some of the company 's suggestions did not work when I tried them on my Windows Vista system , or did not work without some tweaking that was not mentioned in the advisory .
For instance , Microsoft recommends enabling a feature called " data execution prevention , " by clicking " Tools , " " Internet Options , " then " Advanced , " and then checking the box next to that option .
However , when I tried to make the changes in IE7 on Vista , I found that option grayed out .
To make that change , I had to close out of IE completely , then right click on the IE icon , select " Run as Administrator , " and then alter the setting .
Microsoft also suggests shifting IE 's Internet and local Intranet security settings to " high . "
No problems changing that per Microsoft 's instructions , except that few sites will load properly in IE because changing that setting disables active scripting , a feature that many Web sites use .
In addition , Microsoft says users can mitigate the threat from this flaw by de-registering the vulnerable component , a system file called " oledb32.dll " .
To do this , users need to run the Windows command prompt as administrator ( to open a command prompt , click " Start " then Run , then type " cmd.exe " ) , and type or cut - and - paste the following command :
Regsvr32.exe /u " Program Files\Common Files\System\Ole DB\oledb32.dll "
This generated an error message on my Windows Vista machine , complaining that the action could not be performed .
The command worked fine on my Windows XP system .
I would advise Windows users to consider browsing the Web with anything other than Internet Explorer , at least until Microsoft issues a patch to fix this vulnerability .
It is not my intention to over - hype the situation , but as we have seen time and again , attackers are usually very quick to take advantage of flaws in IE because the program is the default browser for close to 80 percent of the planet .
And do n't count on your anti-virus program to save you from these types of attacks .
A scan of the exploit being served up by several of the hacked sites produced atrocious results : VirusTotal.com reported that only four out of the 32 anti-virus programs it used to scan the malware detected it as malicious or suspicious .
We ’re in the last days of the George W. Bush presidency , and while people have been writing postmortems for Bush since 2006 , it ’s only now really appropriate to do so .
It ’s a daunting task to summarize an entire presidency in a single article , so I ’m going to take someone else ’s review of Bush 43 and bash it , because I am a petty man , devoid of original thought , who seeks only to tear down others .
I received such motivation after reading an article by Fred Barnes in The Weekly Standard .
You may know Barnes as that middle - aged , white conservative guy who appears on Fox News ( he co-hosts a talk show with Mort Kondracke — a middle - aged , white semi- conservative guy on Fox News ) .
It should be noted that Barnes was once called “ the last Bush loyalist ” in an article on Slate .
Anyway , the article is entitled “ Bush ’s Achievements :
Ten things the president got right . ”
His original title , “ Ten Things I Love About Bush , ” was abandoned for obvious reasons .
My initial reaction was , “ Wow , President Bush got 10 whole things right ?
That ’s 1.25 things right per year !
Way to go !
Here ’s your tri-colored ‘ personal best ’ ribbon . ”
Obviously , Americans love things in packages of 10 , so I understand Barnes ’ choice .
He even leaves us with the cliffhanger that Bush has “ maybe more ” than 10 achievements .
Nice save — you would n’t want to go too far out on that limb .
Barnes starts by saying , “ The liberal line is that Bush dangerously weakened America 's position in the world and rushed to the aid of the rich and powerful as income inequality worsened .
That is twaddle . ”
While I had never heard the word “ twaddle ” before , the context , to me , suggested a definition of “ perfectly good claims that are worthy of investigation . ”
On the contrary , “ twaddle ” basically means “ nonsense . ”
Barnes goes on to explain why these claims are nonsense : “ [ text not found ] . ”
Oh wait , that ’s right — he ’s writing for The Weekly Standard .
No need here to explain why liberal arguments are meaningless .
Onward and upward , my friends !
Barnes then praises the President ’s courage , stating that he was “ vilified and abused ” for “ defiantly doing the right thing . ”
I agree completely with this statement ; however , I would alter it slightly by removing “ the right , ” pluralizing “ thing , ” and using some carefully placed italic font :
Bush has been vilified and abused for defiantly doing things .
For example , Bush has defied the Constitution , defied known evidence , and even defied logic .
But I ’ll just pull a Fred Barnes here and leave that statement where it is .
I want to move on to the top 10 list itself .
I was pretty sure that “ Remember the ingredients to a Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwich ” would be on this list , but the fact that it ’s not worries me a little .
However , I should also state at this time that Barnes brings up some issues that I flat out do n’t know enough about to support or criticize .
So , I ’ll just take a pass , and you can feel free to talk amongst yourselves .
Barnes begins the list chronologically ( I hope ) by praising Bush ’s “ decision in 2001 to jettison the Kyoto global warming treaty so loved by Al Gore , the environmental lobby , elite opinion , and Europeans . ”
I do n’t know much about the Kyoto Protocol , but I know enough to acknowledge that this is a dumb statement .
First of all , I love what the term “ elite ” has become in this country .
People who own a dictionary can recall an ancient time when “ elite ” meant “ the best of something , ” but as the media taught us in the 2008 election , “ elite ” actually means “ pompous ” and “ faggy . ”
And as for the Europeans , it used to actually be okay to at least consider policy decisions made in Europe , but today we view Europeans as a group of dandy fops who only care about the rights of same - sex terrorist marriages .
But regarding the substance of Barnes ’ claims , all Bush did was not submit the Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for ratification .
We are still a signatory of the Treaty ; it ’s just that our signature means nothing until we ratify it .
Bush could have withdrawn us from Kyoto altogether if he really wanted to , but I suppose that would n’t have been “ courageous ” enough for Barnes .
He also argues that this stand ( if you can call it that ) taken by Bush allowed “ time for facts to catch up with the dubious claims of alarmists , ” and “ [t ] he skeptics , who point to global cooling over the past decade , are now heard loud and clear . ”
Ah , another person who heard the misnomer “ global warming ” and immediately thought “ If this is anything short of the world getting hotter , it ’s 100 percent bullshit . ”
Et tu , Fred Barnes ?
This is why “ climate change ” has become the preferred term — because the consensus is that the temperature is not the best indicator of dangerous climate changes .
Barnes ’ number two achievement of Bush is the use of enhanced interrogation techniques , secret prisons and wireless eavesdropping .
He honestly should have just put this as number one ; that way , you could immediately stop taking him seriously .
Actually , legally speaking , I do n’t disagree with the way certain wireless eavesdropping is conducted , but regardless I would hardly call that a fantastic achievement .
Barnes cites these three things as saving countless American lives .
That is , “ countless ” because you ca n’t actually count them .
“ But as Charles Krauthammer said recently , ‘ Those are precisely the elements which kept us safe and which have prevented a second attack . ’”
No shit , Charles Krauthammer said that ?
You mean , fellow Weekly Standard writer ( and op - ed columnist for The Washington Post ) and Fox News contributor , Charles Krauthammer ?
So , were you guys just having a beer when he said this ?
Argument successfully supported !
Barnes then quotes Lincoln from a speech defending his suspension of Habeas Corpus : “ Are all the laws but one to go unexecuted , and the government itself go to pieces , lest that one be violated ? ”
But this argument is undercut by the fact that Lincoln then followed up by saying , “ Guess what ?
Article I , Section 9 of the Constitution gives me a legal right to suspend Habeas Corpus in times of rebellion or invasion for the purposes of public safety , BE - OTCH ! ” I ’m paraphrasing , of course .
Third , Barnes says that Bush has rebuilt presidential authority that was badly diminished as a result of Vietnam , Watergate and Bill Clinton .
He then proceeds to discuss the expansion of the president ’s legal authority without clarifying what Vietnam , Watergate and Bill Clinton had to do with that .
The closest link I can think of would be the case of U.S. v. Nixon , in which the Court basically just prevented the position of president from becoming a virtual absolute monarchy , free from judicial review .
Reading in between the lines , what Barnes is really saying is that these three things degraded the respect , not authority , of the presidency .
You wo n’t hear me claim the opposite , but I would tack George W. Bush onto the end of that list of things that diminished the respect of the United States Presidency .
Bush ’s “ unswerving support for Israel ” is achievement number four .
Ca n’t argue with that : I find it quite an achievement when anyone , let alone the president , can blindly support Israel without even remotely considering the other side of the coin .
Says Barnes , “ He was clever in his support .
Bush announced that Ariel Sharon should withdraw the tanks he 'd sent into the West Bank in 2002 , then exerted zero pressure on Sharon to do so . ”
Yup , Bush was clever in his empty statements .
Remember when he cleverly stood in front of a “ Mission Accomplished ” banner ?
President Bush ’s fifth success is No Child Left Behind .
I ’m not an expert in NCLB , so I ’m going to take a pass on this one .
It seems to me that it has been a failure , even by its own standards : its goal of 100 percent proficiency ( or even slightly lower ) by 2014 is unattainable .
I suppose it ’s not surprising though , considering the “ Texas Miracle ” on which it was based turned out to be more like the “ Texas Non-Miracle Bullshit . ”
“ Sixth , Bush declared in his second inaugural address in 2005 that American foreign policy ( at least his ) would henceforth focus on promoting democracy around the world . ”
I do n’t get it ; was the achievement that he simply said that stuff ?
Was it Bush ’s grammar ?
Syntax ?
Because I can assure all dictators and anti-democratic regimes reading this article that as long as you have something strategic to offer the United States , you ’re safe .
Bush has proved that he was not referring to you .
Barnes ’ seventh item is the 2003 Medicare prescription drug benefit .
[ Whizzzzzzz … ]
That ’s the sound of something going right over my head .
Sorry , I know nothing about Medicare .
Eighth is an apparent tie between the appointments of John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court .
Two strapping , young , white , conservative lads — the Supreme Court is a woman and an African - American away from being Augusta Country Club again .
With regard to the Roberts appointment , I may disagree with him on a lot of issues , but I can admit that he ’s probably the smartest justice on the court .
I ’m not sure you can consider the Alito appointment an achievement after the embarrassment Bush suffered when he tried to appoint Harriet Miers to the bench .
Bush ’s ninth achievement is apparently strengthening ties with East Asian democracies without upsetting China .
I do n’t have a criticism of that as long as it ’s actually true .
The 10th achievement , described by Barnes as “ a no- brainer , ” is the surge .
First of all , supporters of the surge , Barnes included , always mention how its successes are fragile and tenuous .
How can you call that a great achievement ?
As helpful as it may be , I still call that “ running out the clock ” or “ buying time . ”
And speaking of buying , when people are talking about “ the surge , ” are they referring to the increase of U.S. troops ?
Or are they talking about the increase of payments to Sunni militias to get them to stop firing at us and start firing at other Sunnis ?
This no -brainer confuses me .
Do I think Bush is the worst president of all time ?
No , and you ’re an idiot if you think so .
However , I ’m equally sick of people comparing him to Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower and talking right now about how historians decades from now will appreciate what he did .
I ’d like to think that Truman and Eisenhower did n’t spend their final days in office ostracizing the media in press conferences and saying , “ Just wait until years down the road — you ’ll think I was the cat ’s pajamas ! ”
Well , at least I learned a new word : twaddle .
Thirty - two years after most grammar schools were abolished the 11 - plus exam which controlled entry to them still divides opinion among parents and teachers .
But how difficult was it ?
Once it was the nerve - racking ritual faced by every schoolchild in the UK , but these days the 11 - plus exam is a fading memory .

The exam , which all children were required to take in their final year of primary school , decided what sort of education a child could go on to .
Those who passed went to grammar schools , while those who failed did n't .
There are now no grammar schools in Wales or Scotland .
In Northern Ireland , this is the last academic year to have an 11 - plus style exam .
In England , 164 grammar schools remain , and pupils wishing to attend must still pass an exam .
Competition in these areas is fierce , and a BBC Radio 4 programme has found parents spend as much as £ 1,800 on private tuition to help their children .

Cisco is rolling out new security , collaboration and storage hardware as part of a $ 100 million effort targeting small and medium - sized businesses .
With the new SMB - focused solutions , Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) executives say they 're providing features tailored especailly for smaller business .
This is not enterprise scale technology retro-fitted for smaller players .
As part of the effort , Cisco is rolling out the Cisco Smart Business Communications System Release 1.4 , Cisco Network Storage Systems and the Cisco Spam and Virus Blocker .
The product releases come as Cisco expands its overall focus beyond its core base of large enterprise customers to target a wider swath of technology buyers , including home users and small businesses .
" It 's been on our roadmap to take our product , which was primarily built for the large enterprise and the ISP world and bring it in as a form factor for the small business , " Keith Valory , director of product management in Cisco 's security technology business group , told InternetNews.com .
" But we always felt you can't just build a product .
You also have to have the whole support ecosystem around it .
Cisco announced a $ 100 million effort in November to tackle the SMB space with support , channel and product resources .
Valory noted that the new product releases are the first installment on that $ 100 million commitment .
The Cisco Spam and Virus Blocker is derived from technology first developed in Cisco 's Ironport division .
Cisco acquired IronPort in 2007 for $ 830 million .
Cisco continues to deliver IronPort technology under the IronPort brand name , but with the new SMB offering will be branding the technology as Cisco .
The product was built from the ground up for SMBs , he added .
But what about Cisco's Unified Threat Management ( UTM ) devices , which the company offers with other vendors ?
UTM devices offer the promise of spam and virus protection and are often aimed at the same SMB market as these latest releases .
" There is a always a positioning thing between a UTM product and a purpose built e-mail security product , " Valory commented .
" The primary driver is that the UTM devices in the market today do n't stop spam very well . "
Valory claimed that by way of IronPort 's senderbase spam technology , which is a global network for tracking and blocking spam , the Spam and Virus Blocker appliance will be as effective as IronPort 's large enterprise offerings .
" Our small business customers get the same technology that Fortune 500 companies get and that 's something that a UTM today can't offer , " Valory argued .
" UTM is often deployed in firewall mode so the processing required to do anti-spam is difficult . "
Though Cisco is providing large enterprise capabilities to small business , Valory claimed that there are a number of differences .
The key factor being support resource that are specifically trained and geared for the needs of small and medium enterprises .
" If one support person has to one minute be helping a big global customer and then switch gears and try and help out a small office it's a night and day experience , " Valory commented .
" I really think it 's just the focus on the small customers as opposed to trying to play both ends of the spectrum . "
Do Republicans risk further marginalization by being so vocal about their differences with the president ?

The one known surviving militant behind last week 's terrible attacks in Mumbai is reported to have come from the Pakistani village of Faridkot .
The BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan travelled there to speak to some of the villagers .
Faridkot villagers do not want to be linked to the Mumbai attacks " We 're tired of being hounded by people from the media , " says Bilal , a Faridkot villager .
" They have been coming here every day since the news broke . "
He is referring to reports in the international media , following the terror attacks in Mumbai , which said the only surviving militant comes from Faridkot in the province of Punjab .
The reports , which have led to an outcry in India , said the gunman is a Pakistani national variously named as Ajmal Amir Qasab or Kasav .
The information came from interrogation of the gunman , the reports added .
Fertile recruiting ground
They also said that Qasab is a 21 - year - old and a fluent English speaker .
That description seems to be at odds with the general population in the village he is said to hail from .
Confusingly , there are three villages by the name of Faridkot in this part of southern Punjab .
A BBC Urdu service colleague visited two of them and found no one who knew of the man currently in Indian detention .
I visited a third Faridkot , about 50 km ( 31 miles ) from Multan on the road to Khanewal .
It is an archetypal Punjabi village - a dusty enclave of mud and stone buildings of about 4,000 people .
We are all hardworking , honest people here
Farmer Mohammad Ilyas Khan Almost all of the villagers are semi-literate farmers and labourers .
They are surrounded by green fields and brimming canals .
Nearby Multan - known as city of the saints - is one of the oldest cities in the world and the hometown of Pakistan 's current prime minister and foreign minister .
Located close to the Indian border , the city also houses the headquarters of the Wifaq - ul - Madaris ( association of religious schools ) , which operates establishments throughout Pakistan .
Khanewal is another , smaller city in southern Punjab , an area which since the partition of India has long been known for its strong religious sentiments and staunchly anti-Indian views .
It is also one of Pakistan 's most under - developed and poverty stricken areas .
Multan and its adjoining districts have served as a fertile recruitment ground for militant organisations fighting in Kashmir and Afghanistan .
In particular , hundreds of young men joined the Lashkar - e - Toiba and the Jaish - e - Mohammad groups to fight Indian forces in Kashmir .
' Indian propaganda '
But just a week ago , this Faridkot was just another obscure village in Pakistan 's rural landscape .
Now , question marks over the identity of Mumbai 's attackers has shaken it out of its rustic existence .
CAPTURED GUNMAN
Suspect named as Azam Amir Qasab 21 years old , fluent English speaker Told police he is from Faridkot village , in Pakistan 's Punjab province Said the attackers took orders from handlers in Pakistan
Muslims refuse to bury militants Pakistanis wary of Mumbai claims
In pictures : Mumbai aftermath School is out , and dozens of girls and boys line the broken streets as we venture deep into the village .
A local and his friends are willing to talk , although they are a little jaded by the questions .
" We are all hardworking , honest people here , " says Mohammad Ilyas Khan , a local farmer .
" People in the village rarely leave and that is only for occasional work or business trips . "
Ilyas Khan adds that no - one from the village has been to India , and he does not know of anyone who has been a member of a militant organisation .
" There were three Ajmals in the village , and none of them fits the description of the man the media has named , " he explains .
" One Ajmal worked in Faisalabad ( another city in the Punjab ) and was killed in an accident .
The other two are young men who live in the village .
One works as a waiter and the other is employed in a factory . "
Qamar - uz - Zaman , another villager , says the men have been recently questioned by Pakistani security agencies .
Faridkot residents fear for the future if war with India breaks out " Obviously , it was a serious accusation and the officials came here to check things out , " he said .
" They checked the ID cards of both the men and their activities . "
Evidently , the security personnel were satisfied by the answers they received as no arrests or detentions have taken place so far .
But the villagers are quite perturbed by this recent turn of events , and vehemently denounce what they call " Indian propaganda " .
" No man from our village has ever been involved in any such activity , " one says .
" It is not fair that so many people have been disturbed by these false accusations . "
Another says : " We are worried now because India is turning belligerent and is threatening to attack .
We are scared of what can happen if war breaks out .
" The loss will not be just of Faridkot , or Khanewal .
It will be for all of Pakistan . "

Japanese culture is both fascinating and frustrating , all depending on your experiences in this vastly modernized yet strangely conservative nation .
The cultural differences vary in magnitude based on your own country of origin , but nonetheless are still pretty interesting to know .
Here is a small collection of facts worth knowing whether you 're planning a visit , or simply need more random tidbits of information to entertain your friends with .
All of these were acquired through my own personal experiences living in Tokyo .
BATHING RITUAL :
If you are a guest at a Japanese family 's house for the night , you are expected to take a bath .
The traditional house usually has a room with a separate bathtub and shower , and the tub is filled with hot water each evening for all of the family members to bathe in .
Yes , it 's true , everyone uses the same bath water throughout the night .
As a guest , you are offered to be the first to bathe , and even politely trying to refuse this offer will seem like an insult .
There is a very strict procedure to follow as well , as you can't just jump into the water and muck it up for everyone else .
Before you get into the tub , you are required to shower with the separate shower head located near the tub .
Once you 're done shampooing and washing off you can finally take a soak in the tub .
Not too long though , the water needs to be hot enough for the next person .
DRINKING RULES :
LOSING OR FINDING SOMETHING :
The rule for finding things in Japan is simple , you are required to report it to a local Police box [ Koban ] and provide the officers with your name , address , and number .
If within six months the item is n't claimed , it becomes your property .
I once found a digital camera on top of a pay phone in Shibuya and spent ten minutes trying to figure out where I was staying on a map so I could provide them with an address .
The police officer even called a special translator hotline to help me out .
CELLPHONES :
HAVING TO GO :
Thankfully , not only is finding a restroom in Japan easy , with virtually every coffee shop or restaurant freely available , but you are free to pee in public as long as you do it discreetly .
There is no law barring you from using that nice looking bush on the side of the road as a makeshift urinal .
In fact , it 's not unusual to walk through small alleys or steets at night and see taxi drivers letting loose on some poor tree .
It sounds disgusting , and it is , but at least you know that when you really have to go there is n't a law stopping you from it .
LINING UP FOR A DRINK :
BICYCLES :
SLEEPING ON THE STREET :
ULTRA HIGH -TECH TOILET SEATS :
Also worth noting is the slipper situation .
You are usually provided with a pair of house slippers when you enter a home as wearing shoes inside is rude .
When you enter a bathroom , there should be another pair of slippers near the door that should be changed into when entering .

Four Ways for Detroit to Save Itself
THESE days , as we contemplate the future of the automotive industry , we would do well to remember the words of Henry Ford :  Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently . 
For Detroit , there is plenty of failure .
But there are also plenty of opportunities to begin again .
In fact , there are many new technologies to make cars safer , cheaper , cleaner and more convenient .
All these could be adopted by the automobile industry in the near future and without too much trouble .
Here are just four technologies that could be put on the road in the next several years .
These technologies  some of which we invest in  are win-wins .
They have the potential to improve energy efficiency , cut down on accidents , reduce pollution and make commuting more convenient .
They might even help put the American car industry back in the drivers seat .

The press is resounding with acclaim for the accession to Power of Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Fed ; economists from right , left , and center weigh in with hosannas for Alan ’s greatness , acumen , and unparalleled insights into the " numbers . "
The only reservation seems to be that Alan might not enjoy the enormous power and reverence accorded to his predecessor , for he does not have the height of a basketball player , is not bald , and does not smoke imposing cigars .
The astute observer might feel that anyone accorded such unanimous applause from the Establishment could n’t be all good , and in this case he would be right on the mark .
I knew Alan thirty years ago , and have followed his career with interest ever since .
I found particularly remarkable the recent statements in the press that Greenspan ’s economic consulting firm of Townsend - Greenspan might go under , because it turns out that what the firm really sells is not its econometric forecasting models , or its famous numbers , but Greenspan himself , and his gift for saying absolutely nothing at great length and in rococo syntax with no clear - cut position of any kind .
As to his eminence as a forecaster , he ruefully admitted that a pension - fund managing firm he founded a few years ago just folded for lack of ability to apply the forecasting where it counted  when investment funds were on the line .
Greenspan ’s real qualification is that he can be trusted never to rock the establishment ’s boat .
He has long positioned himself in the very middle of the economic spectrum .
He is , like most other long - time Republican economists , a conservative Keynesian , which in these days is almost indistinguishable from the liberal Keynesians in the Democratic camp .
In fact , his views are virtually the same as Paul Volcker , also a conservative Keynesian .
Which means that he wants moderate deficits and tax increases , and will loudly worry about inflation as he pours on increases in the money supply .
There is one thing , however , that makes Greenspan unique , and that sets him off from his Establishment buddies .
And that is that he is a follower of Ayn Rand , and therefore " philosophically " believes in laissez - faire and even the gold standard .
But as the New York Times and other important media hastened to assure us , Alan only believes in laissez - faire " on the high philosophical level . "
In practice , in the policies he advocates , he is a centrist like everyone else because he is a " pragmatist . "
As an alleged " laissez - faire pragmatist , " at no time in his prominent twenty - year career in politics has he ever advocated anything that even remotely smacks of laissez - faire , or even any approach toward it .
For Greenspan , laissez - faire is not a lodestar , a standard , and a guide by which to set one ’s course ; instead , it is simply a curiosity kept in the closet , totally divorced from his concrete policy conclusions .
Thus , Greenspan is only in favor of the gold standard if all conditions are right : if the budget is balanced , trade is free , inflation is licked , everyone has the right philosophy , etc .
In the same way , he might say he only favors free trade if all conditions are right : if the budget is balanced , unions are weak , we have a gold standard , the right philosophy , etc .
In short , never are one ’s " high philosophical principles " applied to one ’s actions .
It becomes almost piquant for the Establishment to have this man in its camp .
Over the years , Greenspan has , for example , supported President Ford ’s imbecilic Whip Inflation Now buttons when he was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
Much worse is the fact that this " high philosophic " adherent of laissez - faire saved the racketeering Social Security program in 1982 , just when the general public began to realize that the program was bankrupt and there was a good chance of finally slaughtering this great sacred cow of American politics .
Greenspan stepped in as head of a " bipartisan " ( i.e. , conservative and liberal centrists ) Social Security Commission , and " saved " the system from bankruptcy by slapping on higher Social Security taxes .
Alan is a long - time member of the famed Trilateral Commission , the Rockefeller - dominated pinnacle of the financial - political power elite in this country .
And as he assumes his post as head of the Fed , he leaves his honored place on the board of directors of J.P. Morgan & Co. and Morgan Guaranty Trust .
Yes , the Establishment has good reason to sleep soundly with Greenspan at our monetary helm .
And as icing on the cake , they know that Greenspan ’s " philosophical " Randianism will undoubtedly fool many free market advocates into thinking that a champion of their cause now perches high in the seats of power .
THE FREE MARKET Volume 9 , Number 10 October 1991
The Mysterious Fed by Murray N. Rothbard
Alan Greenspan has received his foreordained reappointment as chairman of the Fed , to the smug satisfaction and contentment of the entire financial Establishment .
For them , Greenspan ’s still in his heaven , and all ’s right with the world .
No one seems to wonder at the mysterious process by which each succeeding Fed chairman instantly becomes universally revered and indispensable to the soundness of the dollar , to the banking and financial system , and to the prosperity of the economy .
When it looked for a while that the great Paul Volcker might not be reappointed as Fed chairman , the financial press went into a paroxysm of agony : no , no , without the mighty Volcker at the helm , the dollar , the economy , nay even the world , would fall apart .
And yet , when Volcker finally left the scene years later , the nation , the economy , and the world , somehow did not fall apart ; in fact , ever since , none of those who once danced around Volcker for every nugget of wit and wisdom , seem to care any longer that Paul Volcker is still alive .
What was Volcker ’s mysterious power ?
Was it his towering , commanding presence ?
His pomposity and charisma ?
His strong cigars ?
It turns out that these forces really played no role , since Alan Greenspan , now allegedly the Indispensable Man , enjoys none of Volcker ’s qualities of personality and presence .
Greenspan , a nerd with the charisma of a wet mackerel , drones on in an uninspired monotone .
So what makes him indispensable now ?
He is supposed to be highly " knowledgeable , " but of course there are hundreds of possible Fed chairmen who would know at least as much .
So if it is not qualities of personality or intellect , what makes all Fed chairmen so indispensable , so widely beloved ?
To paraphrase the famous answer of Sir Edmund Hillary , who was asked why he persisted in climbing Mt. Everest , it is because the Fed chairman is there .
The very existence of the office makes its holder automatically wonderful , revered , deeply essential to the world economy , etc .
Anyone in that office , up to and including Lassie , would receive precisely the same hagiographic treatment .
And anyone out of office would be equally forgotten ; if Greenspan should ever leave the Fed , he will be just as ignored as he was before .
It ’s too bad that people are n’t more suspicious : that they do n’t ask what ’s wrong with an economy , or a dollar , that supposedly depends on the existence of one man .
For the answer is that there ’s lots wrong .
The health of Sony or Honda depends on the quality of their product , on the continuing satisfaction of their consumers .
No one particularly cares about the personal qualities of the head of the company .
In the case of the Fed , the acolytes of the alleged personal powers of the chairman are never specific about what exactly he does , except for maintaining the " confidence " of the public or the market , in the dollar or the banking system .
The air of majesty and mystery woven around the Fed chairman is deliberate , precisely because no one knows his function and no one consumes the Fed ’s " product . "
What would we think of a company where the President and his PR men were constantly urging the public : " Please , please .
Have confidence in our product  our Sonys , Fords , etc " ?
Would n’t we think that there was something fishy about such an enterprise ?
On the market , confidence stems from tried and tested consumer satisfaction with the product .
The proclaimed fact that our banking system relies so massively on our " confidence " demonstrates that such confidence is sadly misplaced .
Mystery , appeals to confidence , lauding the alleged qualities of the head : all this amounts to a con-game .
Volcker , Greenspan , and their handlers are tricksters pulling a Wizard of Oz routine .
The mystery , the tricks , are necessary , because the fractional - reserve banking system over which the Fed presides is bankrupt .
Not just the S&Ls and the FDIC are bankrupt , but the entire banking system is insolvent .
Why ?
Because the money that we are supposed to be able to call upon in our bank deposit accounts is simply not there .
Only about 2 % of that money is there .
The mystery and the confidence trick of the Fed rests on its function : which is that of a banking cartel organized and enforced by the federal government in the form of the Fed .
The Fed continually enters the " open market " to buy government securities .
With what does the Fed pay for those bonds ?
With nothing , simply with checking accounts created out of thin air .
Every time the Fed creates $ 1 million of checkbook money to buy government bonds , this $ 1 million quickly finds its way into the " reserves " of the banks , which then pyramid $ 10 million more of bank deposits , newly created out of thin air .
And if someone sensibly wants cash instead of these open book deposits , why that ’s okay , because the Fed just prints the cash which immediately become standard " dollars " ( Federal Reserve notes ) which pay for this system .
But even these fiat paper tickets only back IOU ’s of our bank deposits .
It is interesting that , of the rulers of the Fed , the only ones that seem to be worried about the inflationary nature of the system are those Fed regional bank presidents who hail from outside the major areas of bank cartels .
The regional presidents are elected by the local bankers themselves , the nominal owners of the Fed .
Thus , the Fed presidents from top cartel areas such as New York or Chicago , or the older financial elites from Philadelphia and Boston , tend to be pro-inflation " doves , " whereas the relatively anti-inflation " hawks " within the Fed come from the periphery outside the major cartel centers : e.g. , those from Minneapolis , Richmond , Cleveland , Dallas , or St. Louis .
Surely , this constellation of forces is no coincidence .
Of course , anyone who thinks that these regional bank presidents are insufferable anti-inflation " hawks " ai n’t seen nothing yet .
Wait till they meet some Misesians !

Editor 's note : Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
For a rival view , read here
Paul Begala says Coleman 's challenge to results of the recount could deprive his state of a senator for months .
( CNN ) --
You know you 're low when you have lower ethical standards than a convicted felon , but that 's where former Sen.
Norm Coleman finds himself .
His fellow former senator , Ted Stevens of Alaska , decided not to contest his narrow defeat .
Stevens had little realistic chance of overturning the result , and Alaska needed both its senators as hundreds of billions of dollars were being spent by Congress .
Even though he betrayed the public trust , Stevens ' last public act put his state first .
Not so for Coleman , of Minnesota , who has gone to court to block Al Franken from taking office as the newly elected senator .
The case could drag on for weeks or even months -- and all the while , Minnesota will be fighting for federal funds with one senator tied behind its back .
When initial election night reports suggested a narrow Coleman win , Coleman said if he were trailing , he would forgo a recount and called on Franken to do so .
" If you ask me what I would do , " he said , " I would step back .
I just think the need for the healing process is so important . "
But apparently the healing process is less important to former Sen. Coleman now than it was in November .
Of course , that 's not the first example of former Sen.
Coleman employing situational ethics .
He was , after all , a self - professed Clinton - Gore Democrat who morphed into a Bush - Cheney Republican .
He decried unscrupulous trial lawyers who file lawsuits on behalf of consumers -- and now has filed a lawsuit seeking to have the courts giveth what the voters hath taken away .
While former Sen. Coleman litigates , Minnesota misses out .
Sen .
Amy Klobuchar is doing all she can , but right now , Minnesota has only one more vote in the Senate than Burkina Faso .
Give it up , former Sen. Coleman .
You 're like one of those Japanese soldiers hiding in the caves in the 1970s ; like one of those doctors who keeps shocking the dead patient 30 minutes after he flat - lines ; like a pathetic , creepy stalker .
You had a count , then a recount .
Hundreds of Minnesotans participated .
Each ballot was painstakingly and publicly examined .
A bipartisan state canvassing board supervised the whole process and declared that Franken has won .
It 's over .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala .

Senate to vote on bailout tomorrow ; Obama , McCain to return
The Senate will take up the bailout package tomorrow , aides in both parties ' leadership offices tell Crypter Marty Kady .
Both John McCain and Barack Obama will return for the vote .
A top McCain aide tells Crypter Amie Parnes that McCain is scrapping plans for a Louisiana fundraiser .
He 'll spend the weekend in Colorado and Arizona .
The proposal will be taken up along with a renewable energy tax credit extension .
Aides say the bill will include an increase in the amount of deposits insured by the FDIC from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 -- a provision called for by Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) and earlier offered by House Republicans .
The vote is scheduled for 7:30 pm tomorrow night , after sundown , respecting the Jewish holiday .
The chamber will also vote on a millionaires ' surtax proposed by Sen.
Bernie Sanders , a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats .
“ This is a brilliant move by Harry [ Reid ] , and I believe it will help pick up votes on both sides of the aisle , ” said Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) of the Senate majority leader .
UPDATE : From Senate GOP leadership :
The Senate will vote on the economic rescue plan tomorrow night after a series of stacked votes starting at 7:30 .
The structure is this :
The Senate will call up H.R. 1424 , the text of which will be substituted with the economic rescue plan ( a Dodd amendment which must have the consent of both the Majority and Minority Leaders ) .
The only other amendment in order will be a Sanders amendment that will be handled by a voice vote .
The bill will be subject to a 60 - vote threshold for passage .
UPDATE II : House Republicans are saying the Senate vote tomorrow is the work of bicameral , bipartisan negotiations .
From a House GOP Leadership aide : “ The Senate moving forward tomorrow with the economic stability package gets us one step closer to the bill becoming law – and that is a good thing .
The decision is a product of bipartisan - bicameral discussions and we believe that changes to the bill will help us garner more support from House Republicans and smooth the bill to passage . ”
Social activism startup Virgance is no slow mover .
The San Francisco startup , which last month took the wraps off two projects aiming to change the behavior of corporations through consumer buying power and help intelligently distribute philanthropic wealth , has acquired a solar - power cooperative effort called 1 Block Off the Grid ( or 1BOG ) that will give homeowners in 20 cities leverage to go green .
Like Virgance ’s other efforts , 1BOG is all about community effort toward a common good .
But there ’s an added element to 1BOG :
It ’s also a great way to personally benefit from activism .
Under the plan , consumers who want to install solar panels band together into coordinated buying groups to cut a deal for their own home ’s installation .
The resulting avingss can be really good :
One of the participants in 1BOG ’s inaugural program in San Francisco cut 43 percent off list price , according to co-founder Sylvia Ventura .
For the average customer , the benefit will probably be closer to about 20 percent off , or $ 1.50 per watt that ’s installed .
Apply that to a $ 25,000 solar system , and you ’ve just saved $ 5,000 — and rebates knock off much of the rest of the price .
Some 180 people received a home evaluation out of that group , with 35 eventually buying , which made the “ 1 Block ” appellation rather fitting .
However , there ’s nothing to limit the size of the groups that go in for the packages .
And since coordinated solar buys are n’t new — some cities have run their own — it ’s Virgance ’s method of marketing and profiting from 1BOG that really stands out .
The three founders of 1BOG will manage the 20 cities that the company is moving into without any further assistance , combining outreach through blogs and newspapers with word - of - mouth through people joining the program , who are also operating out of self interest , knowing that larger groups equal larger savings .
When it comes time to negotiate the installations , the 1BOG group kicks in , using their knowledge to haggle down the price ( co- founder Dave Llorens is , himself , a solar installer ) .
For 1BOG ’s cut , it takes 25 cents per watt , out of the total average savings of $ 1.75 .
So on that $ 25,000 solar system alone , Virgance might make almost $ 1,000 dollars .
With hundreds or thousands of participants , the numbers add up .
The idea seems almost too easy , as reflected by the confidence of Virgance CEO Steve Newcomb , who told me that 1BOG alone will be “ in the millions of dollars of revenue very , very soon . ”
But it ’s also worthwhile to remember that the solar installation market is very new , and there ’s a lot of room for new ideas .
And sometimes , it ’s the simple ideas that work best .

VIDEO : Why the “ Stimulus ” Will Be a Disaster
by American Elephant
Democrats want to spend almost a trillion dollars on a so - called “ stimulus ” bill ( it will be over a trillion with interest alone ) — the largest increase in government spending ever .
Dan Mitchell from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity explains how these policies have been tried many times before , both here and elsewhere , and details how and why they have failed every time , everywhere .
Absolute MUST - see TV for every American :
A fairly new filing from Apple discusses the advantages of using proximity sensors more generously to aid its multi- touch technology on devices larger than the iPhone , which would allow certain functions to be invoked without the user having to physically touch the display .
More specifically , the electronics maker believes the combination of these two different types of sensors — multi- touch and proximity — could be used to detect the presence of one or more fingers , body parts or other objects hovering above a touch - sensitive surface .
The detection of fingers , palms or other objects hovering near the touch panel is desirable , Apple says , because it can enable the computing system to perform certain functions without necessitating actual contact with the touch panel , such as turning the entire touch panel or portions of the touch panel on or off , turning the entire display screen or portions of the display screen on or off , powering down one or more subsystems in the computing system , enabling only certain features , dimming or brightening the display screen , and so forth .
" Additionally , merely by placing a finger , hand or other object near a touch panel , virtual buttons on the display screen can be highlighted without actually triggering the ' pushing ' of those buttons to alert the user that a virtual button is about to be pushed should the user actually make contact with the touch panel , " the filing says .
" Furthermore , the combination of touch panel and proximity ( hovering ) sensor input devices can enable the computing system to perform additional functions not previously available with only a touch panel . "
The proximity sensors could be composed of IR transmitters for transmitting IR radiation , and IR receivers for receiving IR radiation reflected by a finger or another object in proximity to the panel .
To detect the location of touch events at different positions relative to the panel , multiple IR receivers can be placed along the edges touch - screen 's blackened display bezel , like those on the latest iMacs and MacBooks , the company says .
However , the July 2008 filing primarily focuses on an " integrated photodiode matrix , " or proximity panel that includes a two - dimensional grid of multiple IR transmitters and a grid of multiple IR receivers .
For example , a grid of IR receivers can be placed on the panel behind a multi - touch screen , allowing each IR receiver to serve as a " proximity pixel " indicating the presence or absence of an object in its vicinity and , in some cases , the distance between the receiver and the object .
Data received from multiple receivers in of a panel could then be processed to determine the positioning of one or more objects above the panel .
" The transmitters and receivers can be positioned in a single layer , or on different layers .
In some embodiments , the proximity panel is provided in combination with a display , " Apple explained .
" The display can be , for example , a liquid crystal display ( LCD ) or an organic light emitting diode display ( OLED display ) .
Other types of displays can also be used .
The IR transmitters and receivers can be positioned at the same layer as the electronic elements of the display ( e.g. , the LEDs of an OLED display or the pixel cells of an LCD display ) .
Alternatively , the IR transmitters and receivers can be placed at different layers . "
Yesterday was a rare off day in the middle of press tour , as no channel wanted to present on the day of the Golden Globes .
After spending much of Sunday getting caught up on writing ( when I was n't busy tearing my hair out at Giants - Eagles ) , I 'm going to be running around to a bunch of set visits today , highlighted by a stop at the " CSI " set a few days before William Petersen 's final episode .
So since I have no sessions from yesterday to report on , and since I 'll be out and about pretty much all of today , I thought I 'd revisit a session from last week that I wanted to write up but never found a chance to : Comedy Central 's " Important Things with Demetri Martin , " which premieres on February 11th .
Martin's the latest " Daily Show " correspondent to get promoted into his own series , and based on both the very funny pilot for " Important Things " and the equally funny press conference , he looks to be worthy of the gig .
" Important Things " is a mix of sketches , stand - up , music and animation , with each episode built around a topic that can be very broad ( power ) or very narrow ( chairs ) .
As Martin put it , " It 's a good show , and it 's thing - oriented . "
I 'll be writing more about it closer to the debut , but in the meantime , a few highlights from the session :
• Martin rattled off a series of little - known facts , including that " Most castles in America are located in fish tanks ...
So we have what is called a submerged monarchy in the United States . "
• Martin made extensive use of his trademark sketch pad ( which is a key part of the series ) to show us various diagrams , including an empty circle that he described as " a pie chart about procrastination . "
• In talking about his target audience , he said he ideally would like the whole world to watch , but will settle for America .
" Then I started thinking , okay , we have about 300 million people in the country .
Look , realistically if I get a third of those people , that 's a hundred million people watching this show .
So that 's great .
That takes a lot of pressure off because that means 200 million people I do n't even care about , 200 million people can hate the show and it really does n't matter .
I can disregard that two - third right off the top .
So we 're going just for the hundred million that are the core of my demo . "
Do you want to be one of those 200 million who are outside his core demo ?
I do n't think so .
Bay Area real estate market bolstered by investments from China Feb .
15th , 2013 By Pete Carey
The Bay Area 's housing market is playing host to a growing numbers of foreigners -- many from China -- who are looking for a future home , a good investment or a safe place to park their money .
Wei Luo , an electrical engineer - turned - contractor and real estate investor , said he has helped at least 10 friends from China buy about 15 homes and condominiums in the Bay Area starting in 2009 , and they 're clamoring for more .
" All my friends , they say this price is so low , " said Luo , who operates a construction company in Fremont .
" Some of my college classmates went back to China , started a business and now they come back and invest .
Some buy and just leave it .
They do n't even want to rent them out . "
Their appetite for Bay Area real estate rises from a mixture of politics and a growing global market in real estate , according to professionals .
China 's housing prices appear to have peaked , encouraging some people to sell and look for other investments .
Chinese buying power has never been stronger , thanks to the country 's booming economy , but there 's widespread political unease as a new government is formed .
Also , land is leased from the government in China , not owned like it is in the United States .
All of that , plus the fact that U.S. real estate prices are just climbing off the bottom after a historic crash , makes the Bay Area property market attractive to Chinese investors .
" I tell all my friends , ' You got money ?
Buy , buy , buy , ' " While it 's difficult to track the exact number of foreign buyers of Bay Area real estate , investors accounted for around a quarter of all Bay Area sales in November , about double the average going back to 1988 , according to the real estate information company
And real estate agents say that in some areas , one in five people making offers is either in China or buying for relatives or investors in other countries .
With its large Asian - American population , good schools and good weather , the Bay Area is a prime shopping area for Chinese eager to buy property abroad .
And that 's helping to push up prices here .
" The foreign investors are bringing the competition to another level , " said Amy Sung of DeLeon Realty in Palo Alto , which offers a Chinese translation on the home page of its website .
" We have people who are already here who have come here to study and then they stay , " Sung said .
" And then we have people in the new rich , who come here with a visitor 's visa or investor 's visa .
And there are the really high - end buyers who come here for a weekend , identify properties and then go home . "
Thirty to 40 percent of all the offers are cash , Sung said .
" They 're buying investment properties , pretty much everything that comes to the market . "
All that investor buying is helping push prices up .
Absentee buyers -- mostly investors -- paid a median price of $ 309,000 , up 22 percent from a year ago , according to The median price for cash deals , which typically are done by investors , was $ 320,000 , up 27 percent from a year earlier .
David Lo , a Bay Area real estate agent , is helping friends and family in Asia buy property in Mountain House and other towns in the Central Valley .
" I 've always stayed connected with friends and families in Asia .
So when they heard about my real estate investment portfolio they became interested in pooling in with me , " he said in an email from Taipei , where he was on business .
" Location - wise , the Bay Area is ideal for Chinese nationals . "
The appetite for a piece of the Bay Area is " definitely increasing , " Lo said , " especially among wealthy Chinese families with young children seeking a better way of life and education in the U.S.
In their eyes , America is still the promised land of opportunity , political freedom , and securer financial future . "
The San Jose metro area is the top seller 's market in the country , according to a ranking by Zillow of such factors as days on the market and prices near or above asking price .
" But much of that strength is driven by investor interest , " Zillow chief economist Stan Humphries said in a recent report .
The increased demand helps drive up prices , " particularly for less - expensive homes in these markets , " he said .
Even high - cost places such as Cupertino are seeing prices rise .
" China is a growing economy and one of few countries that is still not busted by the bubble , " said Gilbert Wong , vice mayor of Cupertino , which is the first choice for many Chinese buyers .
" They see places like the United States and Canada as good , safe places to put their money in .
It 's good for us because we 're coming out of a recession and we need the influx of money coming in . "
Kevin Kieffer of Keller Williams in Danville said investors are targeting homes priced at $ 300,000 and less in Concord , Pleasant Hill and Martinez -- all good areas for rental housing .
" About 30 percent of offers coming in are from Chinese buyers , and for cash , " Kieffer said .
" Rarely is there a Chinese - financed offer that 's not cash . "
He said one client is looking for a home armed with $ 425,000 in cash wired to him by his mother in India .
" That 's happening quite a bit , that money for a deal will come from many sources -- parents or relatives abroad , or whatever it happens to be , " said Barbara Lymberis , president of the Santa Clara County Association of Realtors .
" The seller and buyer could be domestic , but the money is global .
Funds can be banked anywhere in the world and utilized anywhere in the world . "
Jennifer Tasto , a broker at Property Services in Burlingame , said she has done $ 5 million in cash transactions in the past 12 months with Chinese buyers , becoming an expert in global money transfers along the way .
One client is buying a home for her children even though they 're still in elementary school .
Tasto said she lost one bidding war for a Palo Alto home even though her client offered $ 390,000 over asking price .
She said one of her clients explained that his aim is to hold a piece of real property in a country where there is solid law and protection for property rights .
" I 'm finding that in a lot of Asian countries , not just China , people cannot own land , " Tasto said .
" They are buying a land lease .
Here , when you buy real estate , you buy the dirt . "
With fewer homes on the market than normal , the competition from investors paying cash continues to squeeze out first - time buyers .
But it helps boost prices , which in the long run should persuade more would - be sellers to list their homes .
Machinist Jason
Poling said it took him and his wife from June to November , and 16 failed bids , before he finally got lucky on his 17th offer and snagged a $ 325,000 home in San Ramon .
The competition was fierce with as many as 14 offers on some houses , he said .
About half the bidders were investors , he said . " >

OTTAWA–Liberals
MPs and the party executive today confirmed Michael Ignatieff as their interim leader .
The national executive officially appointed the Toronto MP as leader this afternoon , following an endorsement by the Liberal caucus this morning in a closed door meeting said to be marked by an inspiring display of unity .
The high point of the caucus gathering was an embrace between Ignatieff and Bob Rae after Rae explained why he was stepping aside in the leadership race on behalf of his old friend Ignatieff , MPs said .
" It was really tough to keep a dry eye , " MP Martha Hall Findlay told reporters afterwards .
The Liberals ' national executive announced Ignatieff 's installation as interim party chief after consultations with riding association presidents and various ex-officio members across the country .
Ignatieff wo n't be ratified as full - time leader until the party 's convention in May in Vancouver .
Liberal MPs expressed deep relief this morning that the party was spared a possibly damaging split after Rae announced yesterday that he was dropping out of the leadership contest .
Rae 's decision opened the way for a welcome outpouring of unity in a party that has spent the last few years trying to recover from the bitter divisions spawned by the clash between former prime ministers Jean Chretien and Paul Martin .
Now that Ignatieff has seized his long - sought prize of the Liberal leadership , it raises fresh questions about the future of the opposition coalition that has vowed to defeat the Conservatives next month .
The fate of the Liberal - New Democrat coalition will be among the pressing issues facing Ignatieff as he prepares to take over the leadership of a party battered by cash woes , two lost elections and dismal poll numbers .
Late yesterday , Ignatieff paid tribute to the two candidates who had pulled out of the race and hailed the party for responding " quickly to changing circumstances to offer stability and leadership to Canadians . "
The 61 - year - old Liberal MP for Etobicoke - Lakeshore was assured of the leadership yesterday after Rae — the last rival candidate in the race — dropped out , conceding he did n't have enough support to win in the party 's stripped - down contest that left little time to sign up new backers .
Ignatieff was the runner - up in the 2006 contest that saw Stéphane Dion elected party leader .
The Liberals are in a rush to have a new leader in place by the end of January , when a key budget vote could see the Conservatives defeated , sparking a new election or paving the way for a Liberal - led coalition to take power .
Ignatieff , who launched his leadership bid by promising to " outwit and outthink " the Conservative government , faces a key decision over the coming weeks , whether or not to remain in the coalition with the NDP and defeat the government .
New Democrat MPs and some in the Liberal ranks , including Rae , have been adamant that Harper 's Conservatives must be toppled no matter what is in the Jan. 27 budget .
But Ignatieff has been lukewarm to the idea of a coalition , and has suggested he would prefer to see the budget before acting .
On Sunday , he said " coalition if necessary but not necessarily coalition . "
" I think it 's very important for Canadians to have the coalition option so that if Mr. Harper presents a budget which is not in the national interest we can present to Canadians a coalition alternative to spare us a national election , " he told CTV's Question Period .
Yesterday , Harper tried to fracture the coalition by extending an olive branch to the Liberals , saying he 's hoping the new leader will " be willing to sit down with me " and talk about the economy .
" I 'm optimistic that the next leader of the opposition may want to look at different kinds of arrangements in the best interests of the country , " Harper said in an interview with CBC News .
" It 's in the interests of the government to find a consensus , certainly among the federalist parties ... to find things we can agree on in the short - term to make sure we do whatever we can to help the economy , to keep people working . "

While willing to talk , the Liberals doubt that the Prime Minister is serious about working with the opposition .
" You 'll pardon us if we have just a touch worth of scepticism from an invitation from Mr. Harper , " MP John McKay said on his way into the caucus meeting .
He said the Conservatives should start by opening the books so the opposition can see what the fiscal situation really is .
McKay said that , rather than the small budget surpluses forecast by the Harper government , Ottawa is facing budget deficits of between $ 6 billion and $ 15 billion .

Update :
The latest version , 1.17 , compiles on 64 - bit platforms out of the box , so the patch below is no longer necessary .
Nicolas Lehuen ’s pytst is a C++ ternary search tree implementation with a Python interface .
It ’s an excellent tool — and it is also really , really fast .
Unfortunately version 1.15 does n’t compile on 64 - bit platforms , giving the following error messages :
pythonTST.h:178 : error : cannot convert ' int* ' to ' Py_ssize_t * ' for argument ' 3 ' to ' int PyString_AsStringAndSize( PyObject* , char** , Py_ssize_t * ) ' tst_wrap.cxx :
In function ' PyObject * _wrap__TST_walk__SWIG_1( PyObject* , int , PyO bject ** ) ' : tst_wrap.cxx:3175 : error : cannot convert ' int* ' to ' Py_ssize_t * ' for argument ' 3 ' to ' int PyString_AsStringAndSize( PyObject* , char** , Py_ssize_t * ) ' tst_wrap.cxx :
In function ' PyObject * _wrap__TST_close_match( PyObject* , PyObject* ) ' : tst_wrap.cxx:3250 : error : cannot convert ' int* ' to ' Py_ssize_t * ' for argument ' 3 ' to ' int PyString_AsStringAndSize( PyObject* , char** , Py_ssize_t * ) ' tst_wrap.cxx :
In function ' PyObject * _wrap__TST_prefix_match( PyObject* , PyObject *) ' : [... and so on ... ]
Until Nicolas releases an updated version , here is the quick fix :
cp pythonTST.h pythonTST.h.orig cp tst_wrap.cxx tst_wrap.cxx.orig sed -r 's / int size / Py_ssize_t size / ' < tst_wrap.cxx.orig > tst_wrap.cxx sed -r 's / int length / Py_ssize_t length / '
< pythonTST.h.orig > tmpfile sed -r 's /sizeof\( int\ )/sizeof( long ) / ' < tmpfile > pythonTST.h
Run these commands from the pytst source directory and you should be all set .
I ’m not sure if this a fully satisfactory solution , but at least this will get the test suite running again .
Women tend to like smart men because they 're usually more successful and better providers .
But here 's another reason :
Their sperm is better , a new study says .
Researchers at King 's College London , the University of Delaware and the University of New Mexico recently compared results from five intelligence tests given to 425 Vietnam War vets in 1985 as part of the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention 's Vietnam Experience Study .
These vets , aged 31 to 44 , also provided sperm samples , so the researchers analyzed the sperm per milliliter of semen , plus how many of the sperm swam normally , and other measures of sperm health .
The smarter the men were , the more sperm they produced and the better their wee ones swam — and it did n't matter how old the men were or whether they smoked , drank or were obese .
But why might these two seemingly unrelated traits be linked ?
Why would calculus aces or business consultants make better sperm ?
Turns out that intelligent people are generally healthier than their less - clever peers — studies have shown that brainiacs are , for instance , less likely to suffer from heart disease and Alzheimer's .
Scientists have suggested that smart people may score less stressful jobs in safer places and that they may make better lifestyle choices , for instance by exercising more and eating better .
In other words , maybe bright people actually listen to the Surgeon General .
But these newest findings , to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal Intelligence , found that negative habits had little effect on sperm quality , so they do n't support that theory .
The researchers instead speculate that intelligence might be passed down as part of a larger package of good attributes .
One gene can influence multiple traits , so the genes involved in smarts may somehow improve sperm quality — and perhaps other characteristics as well .
This could help explain , then , why intelligence can be so sexy :
It could simply be an indicator that a person has a lot of good genes and traits , says study co-author Geoffrey Miller , a psychologist at the University of New Mexico .

At the bottom of the customize menu make sure it is set to " icons " rather than " text and icons . "
If there are particular buttons you do not use much you can remove them from the toolbar .
The other issue some people have is that they accidentally turn it off and forget how to turn it back on .

Will Peak Uranium Hit Nuclear Plants ?
December 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
The safety of nuclear plants is often debated , but we rarely hear about another potential issue for nuclear energy : peak uranium .
That ’s the point in time when when the maximum global uranium production is reached and begins to enter a permanent decline .
And while we ’ve known for some time that high - quality uranium supplies have been declining for the past 50 years , nuclear operators are finally getting nervous .
Kansai Electric
Power , a uranium supplier in Japan , is in the midst of buying uranium mines to secure long - term supply .
The company ’s manager , however , believes that no amount of money will be able to buy all the uranium necessary for the years ahead .
According to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the rapid expansion of nuclear power will almost double the world ’s need for uranium by 2030 .
But unlike with peak oil , uranium fuel can be reprocessed — meaning that uranium supplies can theoretically be secured for hundreds of years .
Advanced reactors , fuel cycle technologies , and alternative fuels like thorium just need to be explored more thoroughly .
And if things get desperate , we can start looking into unconventional uranium sources like phosphates , seawater , and uraniferous coal ash .
Perhaps the current uranium panic will stoke interest in such exploration .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Russian leaders are offering an olive branch to the incoming Obama administration in hopes that it will scrap a planned missile - defense system based in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Russian President Dimitry Medvedev told French journalists that he had spoken by phone with President - elect Barack Obama and that they hoped to meet as soon as possible .
“ I hope … we ’ll be able to find a way out of these [ difficult ] situations , which we have n’t been able to do with our current colleagues , ” Mr. Medvedev said in the interview , which was broadcast Thursday .
Within hours of Mr. Obama ’s election last week , the Russian president threatened to base short - range missiles in Kaliningrad , a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania .
An Obama transition official confirmed that the two spoke Saturday morning .
“ They both expressed a desire to meet early in the new administration and the president - elect underscored the need to collaborate on the financial crisis , nuclear proliferation , including in Iran and North Korea , and in fighting terrorism , ” the official said .
“ The issue of missile defense did not come up in the phone call , ” the official said , talking on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak for attribution .
Mr. Medvedev suggested in Thursday ’s interview that Russia would change course if the U.S. abandoned plans for a European missile defense .
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said he was perplexed by the Russian threat .
“ Quite frankly , I ’m not clear what the missiles would be for in Kaliningrad .
After all , the only real emerging threat on Russia ’s periphery is in Iran and I do n’t think the Iskander [ Russian ] missile has the range to get there from Kaliningrad , ” Mr. Gates said Thursday in the Estonian capital , Tallinn .
“ Why they would threaten to point missiles at European nations seems quite puzzling to me , ” added Mr. Gates , who was in Europe to attend a NATO meeting .
The Russian threat was the latest move in a protracted dispute over U.S. plans to base 10 interceptors in Poland and a missile guidance radar in the Czech Republic .
The U.S. insists missile defenses are needed to protect Europe from Iran .
Undersecretary of State William Burns and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov , in Moscow earlier this week , agreed to hold the next round of security and missile - defense talks in December , State Department spokesman Robert Wood said .
The two also discussed “ the global economic crisis and the need for coordinated action during this weekend´s summit meeting of G - 20 leaders in Washington , ” Mr. Wood said .
Russia has been hard hit by the crisis and the accompanying plunge in oil prices .
Its stock market fell more than 12 percent on Thursday .
Toby Gati , a Russia analyst and former assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research , said the Russians perceive a chance to improve relations .
“ Whenever there ’s a new president , there ’s always a new opportunity , ” she said .
“ The Russians were surprised by the impact of the financial crisis .
They thought their hard currency reserves of half a trillion dollars were a Maginot line , ” she said .
“ They did n’t realize that they ca n’t be aggressive in foreign policy and make nice in economic affairs .
Interdependence creates interdependence . ”
Mr. Medvedev is to attend the weekend financial summit in Washington .
Russia has called for a major overhaul of the global financial system that would give emerging economies a bigger voice in the World Bank , International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions .
Ms. Gati said the Obama administration should make a decision on missile defense based on U.S. interests , not on how the Russians will react .
Mr. Obama said during the campaign that he supports missile defense when the technology proves reliable .

A Silent Electric Plane

Your Eminence ,
I am writing to you on this very important day , the 27th of January , which was declared by the UN as the international day of commemorating the Holocaust .
I am sure that you will understand our sorrow and pain concerning the recent events .
The reactions to the news of the pope 's lifting the excommunication ban on the member of the Society of Saint Pius X has caused great consternation here in Israel and throughout the Jewish world , in particular because of the fact that one of the four bishops involved , Richard Williamson , is an open Holocaust denier .
Even if the move in itself was not intended in any way to relate to the Church 's relationship with the Jewish people , when it involves the embrace of someone who publicly expresses such odious and outrageous opinions , then it definitely does affect our relationship .
The Chief Rabbinate 's Commission under the chairmanship of Chief Rabbi Shear Yashuv Cohen has deliberated on this matter and believes that without a public apology from Bishop Williamson and recanting his deplorable statements it will be very difficult for the Chief Rabbinate of Israel to continue its dialogue with the Vatican as before .
You will appreciate that under such circumstances it would be wiser for us to postpone our next meeting in Rome at the beginning of March until this matter is clarified .
Please convey this message also to the highest authorities of the Holy See .
Yours sincerely ,
Oded Wiener ,
Director General of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel
This letter was sent from Oded Wiener to Cardinal Walter Kasper , president of the Holy See 's Commission for Religious Relations with Jewry on 27 January 2009
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Disgraced money manager Bernard Madoff ’s suspected $ 50 billion fraud scheme looks set to burn even those who pulled their investments out long before the scandal rippled into the global financial system .
Such investors may have counted themselves fortunate , withdrawing their money years ago to buy a house or to pay for a daughter ’s education , and may have even sighed with relief because they ended ties with Madoff long before the scandal erupted late last week .
But they , too , could face trouble , lawyers say .
Because of a legal concept known as “ fraudulent conveyance , ” they could be forced to return their profits and even some of their initial investments to help offset losses incurred by others entangled in the long - running Ponzi scheme .
A Ponzi scheme is an illegal investment vehicle that pays off old investors with money from new ones , and relies on a constant stream of new investment .
Such schemes eventually collapse under their own weight .
“ There were no profits .
It was just other people ’s money , ” said Brad Alford , who runs investment adviser Alpha Capital Management LLC in Atlanta .
Alford is well versed in fraudulent conveyance after one of his clients withdrew money from a $ 450 million scheme by Connecticut hedge - fund company Bayou Group LLC a year before it collapsed in scandal .
“ We ended up settling with the estate , giving back all the profits and half of our principal . ”
Bankruptcy - receivership practices make all investors vulnerable , he added .
“ Once they can go into bankruptcy they can go back six years .
Anything past your principal , I ’m guessing , is fair game to be brought back in . ”
Philip Bentley , a lawyer at Kramer , Levin , Naftalis & Frankel LLP , who defended investors sued in 2006 by lawyers representing the Bayou estate , said he expected the court - appointed trustee now in control of Madoff ’s U.S. operations to look hard at who withdrew money from Madoff .
“ The trustee is going to look very closely at redemptions and seriously consider bringing suits just because the trustee ’s job is to bring in assets any way he can , ” Bentley said .
“ Potentially the numbers are enormous . ”
‘ STAGGERING ’ LAWSUITS
But the judge could decide to limit how many years back the estate can demand investors return their money , said Jay Gould , a former investment - management attorney at the Securities and Exchange Commission who heads the hedge - fund practice at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw and Pittman LLP .
“ In this case , because of the magnitude of the losses and the scope of the great number of people who were defrauded , this could be a situation where people say ‘ you know we are just going to draw the line here at six months or at one year or at this , ’ ” he said .
“ But that ’s not certain .
You really are working with people who have obligations , ” he said .
“ The receiver has an obligation under the law to pursue all the assets wherever they happen to be within the bounds of the law . ”
The law could shock investors who innocently entrusted their money with Madoff , a 70 - year - old Wall Street legend , long before he was accused of defrauding banks , charities and rich individuals whose assets he managed at Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC , which he launched in 1960 .
“ I ’m sure it will be a surprise to those who had no idea about his position but wanted to buy a house , and took the money out , ” said Tamar Frankel , who teaches securities law , corporate governance and legal ethics at Boston University .
Alford said he expects several types of lawsuits , including one focused on fraudulent conveyance and another against so - called feeder funds , or hedge funds set up by outside investment advisory firms that marketed Madoff ’s investments to high net - worth individuals and pension funds .
And he expects a third group of lawsuits to focus on litigation against advisers for entrusting 50 to 100 percent of their money with one manager .
He said this could defy the “ prudent man rule ” that enjoins money managers to handle investors ’ money as they would their own .
“ I think the lawsuits are going to be staggering .
This is going to go on for years and years , ” he said .

Companies in this article Splash Damage
Splash Damage studio director Paul Wedgwood has criticised the pressure that some developers are under to achieve specific high ratings based on Metacritic scores , particularly when financial rewards depend on it .
And he feels that the ratings system employed by some consumer videogames sites does n't necessarily help , stating his preference for a five - star system , rather than a percentile - based one .
Speaking to GamesIndustry .biz late last year , Wedgwood was asked if he felt that trusting a developer 's bonus on the thoughts of a selection of journalists - and specifically one instance where a team was required to turn in nine - out - of - ten scores rather than eights - was n't a bit arbitrary .
" Personally I think it 's ridiculous , " he responded .
" In the film industry , four stars is an amazing score .
I think it 's a really good idea for a developer to go to a publisher and demand that they get an additional bonus for achieving a certain review score , but it should n't affect their royalties or anything else .
If you have a high - selling game , you have a high - selling game .
" We know that some websites score quite high and some quite low , but in general , all websites tend to score between 60 and 100 .
There 's never a 37 .
It 's as if that whole section does n't exist , so zero starts at 60 , so three stars , and goes up to five .
It 's just not really an accurate enough measure .
" I think that if anything , the games press should take the pressure off themselves , and just go across to star ratings , which for films is nothing more than a recommendation that you buy it , watch it when you get the chance , or rush out and see it straight away , and it 's your personal recommendation .
It 's not a ' score ' .
If that was all you did , nobody would hate you guys for it .
" Out of ten is a good start .
Percentiles put too much pressure on a journalist to justify an exact score .
It puts too much pressure on the developer to try and identify these criteria that lead to very specific point increases or decreases , which is not at all what the developer should be focusing on . "
He was also clear , however , that there was no such pressure on his team , now working under a deal with Bethesda owner ZeniMax Media - but freely admitted that high ratings was something that Splash Damage were keen to receive .
" Yes , " he agreed , " The shameless pursuit of critical acclaim .
It 's not so much that it 's purely the reception that we get from critics alone - we also mean critical acclaim from fans , and feeling like we 've made something that they want to play .
But really it 's this notion that you focus on the quality of the game , you do n't have a set release date irrespective of that .
" It 's a sad fact that in 2007 , two of the highest - selling videogames were also two of the lowest - rated .
So that 's one of the things we 're trying to get across to students - that it 's better to be a play - tester at Epic than it is a lead artist at a terribly naff studio that 's focused purely on getting something out in time . "
The full interview with Paul Wedgwood , in which he also talks about the company 's relationship with ZeniMax , as well as the future of digital distribution , is available now .
Tom Farber gives a lot of tests .
He 's a calculus teacher , after all .
So when administrators at Rancho Bernardo , his suburban San Diego high school , announced the district was cutting spending on supplies by nearly a third , Farber had a problem .
At 3 cents a page , his tests would cost more than $ 500 a year .
His copying budget : $ 316 .
But he wanted to give students enough practice for the big tests they 'll face in the spring , such as the Advanced Placement exam .
" Tough times call for tough actions , " he says .
So he started selling ads on his test papers : $ 10 for a quiz , $ 20 for a chapter test , $ 30 for a semester final .
San Diego magazine and The San Diego Union - Tribune featured his plan just before Thanksgiving , and Farber came home from a few days out of town to 75 e-mail requests for ads .
So far , he has collected $ 350 .
His semester final is sold out .
That worries Robert Weissman , managing director of Commercial Alert , a Washington - based non-profit that fights commercialization in school and elsewhere .
If test - papers - as - billboards catches on , he says , schools in the grip of tough economic times could start relying on them to help the bottom line .
" The advertisers are paying for something , and it 's access to kids , " he says .
About two - thirds of Farber 's ads are inspirational messages underwritten by parents .
Others are ads for local businesses , such as two from a structural engineering firm and one from a dentist who urges students , " Brace Yourself for a Great Semester ! "
Principal Paul Robinson says reaction has been " mixed , " but he notes , " It 's not like , ' This test is brought to you by McDonald 's or Nike . ' "
To Farber , 47 , it 's a logical solution : " We 're expected to do more with less . "
The National Education Association says teachers spend about $ 430 out of their pockets each year for school supplies .
This semester , Christine Van Ruiten , a teacher at E.C. Reems , a charter school in East Oakland , has spent $ 2,000 .
She scours Craigslist for free supplies and posts requests to DonorsChoose.org , which matches teachers with donors .
Founded in 2000 by Charles Best , then a Bronx teacher , DonorsChoose has funded about 65,000 projects totaling $ 26 million .
Best calls it " a more dignified , substantive alternative for teachers than selling candy door - to - door — and certainly than selling ad space on final exams .
That 's crazy . "

Kennedy wants Clinton to lead health reform push Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) has been offered a prominent spot in the Democratic senate 's push for healthcare reform .
Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D - MA ) , who 's crafting a healthcare bill , wants the former first lady to lead the push for one of his proposals .
Kennedy asked Clinton to lead a working group to explore reforming insurance coverage as a means to achieve comprehensive healthcare reform .
Sens. Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) and Barbara Mikulski ( D - MD ) will lead working groups on public health and on improving quality .
" I look forward very much to working with them , with all our colleagues on the committee and throughout Congress , and with the Obama Administration to achieve the goal at long last of quality , affordable health care for all Americans ,  Kennedy said Tuesday .
The Los Angeles Times has more details .
The potential assignment comes a decade and a half after Clinton led a controversial effort to reshape the healthcare system as first lady during her husband 's first term in the White House .
That campaign collapsed amid bitter opposition from many in the healthcare industry and accusations that Clinton ran a secretive process that ignored input from important stakeholders .
President - elect Barack Obama has not indicated how he plans to tackle healthcare .
But many involved in the debate have high hopes that his push will be more successful .
Doctors and business and consumer groups are gearing up for an effort to improve care and bring about 46 million uninsured people into the system , something Obama and Clinton made centerpieces of their presidential campaigns .
Clinton 's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday .
The Collapse of Capitalism and the Safety Net of Gold By Darryl Robert Schoon
Jan 22 2009 10:49 AM www.drschoon.com
For Ponzi schemes to succeed , they must expand faster than the request for redemptions .
If they do not , they will collapse .
This is what happened to Bernard L Madoff Investment Services , the largest Ponzi scheme in history .
The same is about to happen to capitalism .
Although capitalism is not a Ponzi scheme , credit - based economies , sic capitalism , and Ponzi schemes share the same fatal flaw .
Both must constantly expand or they are in danger of collapse .
Today , because capitalist economies are no longer expanding , but contracting , their continued contraction will lead to collapse .
PUNDITS PUNDIDIOTS & PREDICTIONS Dr. Philip Tetlock , author of Expert Political Judgment ( Princeton University Press , 2005 ) , has done remarkable work regarding the ability to accurately predict future events .
In a highly disciplined scientific study , Dr. Tetlock had asked experts to predict future events and over 20 years analyzed their predictive accuracy and methodology of thinking .
Tetlock ’s study concluded that experts are no better in predicting the future than anyone else ; in fact , the better known the expert , often the lower the ability to accurately predict .
Louis Menand ’s review of Tetlock ’s Expert Political Judgment in The New Yorker perhaps says it best : .. Tetlock claims that the better known and more frequently quoted they [ experts ] are , the less reliable their guesses about the future are likely to be .
The accuracy of an expert ’s predictions actually has an inverse relationship to his or her self - confidence , renown , and , beyond a certain point , depth of knowledge .
On March 2 , 2007 , Dr. Tetlock spoke to the Positive Deviant Network by speaker phone as he was unable to attend in person .
Martha and I were in the audience along with other members of the PDN .
The previous day we had distributed my 148 page analysis of the US and global economy to the PDN .
In How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process , The Time of the Vulture , I had predicted prices of US and global real estate would fall 40 to 70 % and the stock market 70 to 90 % , plunging the US and perhaps the world into another Great Depression .
At the time in the early spring of 2007 , there was no evidence of an impending economic disaster .
The next day when the feedback came back from the PDN , it was neither pleasant nor positive .
Perhaps it was a variant of the “ shoot the messenger� ?
syndrome , but there was loud and vocal opposition to the dire economic predictions I had made .
Later that day , again by speaker phone , when PDN members were given the opportunity to engage in a dialogue with Dr. Tetlock , PDN member Dr. James Hardt , a neuroscientist and researcher on the effect of brain waves on human consciousness took the opportunity to say that he had read my economic analysis and found it remarkable .
The comment by Dr. Hardt was especially meaningful as Dr. Hardt had scored far higher than all other PDN members in both knowledge - based and predictive tests .
The PDN experience underscored the fact that the truth — when unpleasant and predicted — is rarely welcome in any venue .
The reason why pundits are popular is not because they tell the truth .
Pundits are popular because they tell people what they want to hear , the truth not withstanding .
The unpleasant truth is that the truth when unpleasant has never been popular .
In the past , I would have laid the cause of America ’s ignorance of economic issues at the foot of corporate and government interests who gain the most in today ’s corrupt environment .
But the truth is the present state of ignorance and corruption could not have occurred without the abiding and willing denial of the America people .
Americans themselves have chosen denial , sound bites and slogans over substantive discourse and understanding .
While in the short term it has been easier to do than the alternative , i.e. to think , in the long term it will prove fatal .
The bill for collective denial and ignorance is coming due in America ; and , when it is paid — as it will be — America will never be the same .
Nor , will the world THE LAST STAGE OF CAPITALISM AND PONZI FINANCE Like Ponzi schemes , capitalist economies must constantly expand or they will collapse .
This is because capitalism is a system wherein credit - based money has been substituted for real money , i.e. savings - based money such as gold and silver ; and credit - based money soon turns into compounding debt .
The end of such systems has always been bankruptcy .
When credit - based economies contract , governments , businesses and families are no longer able to pay the principal and compounding interest on their debt and economic collapse results .
The current system began when the Bank of England , England ’s central bank , started issuing credit - based paper banknotes in place of gold and silver in 1694 .
This system was transferred by private bankers to America in 1913 in the form of the Federal Reserve Bank , the US central bank equivalent of the Bank of England .
The credit - based central bank system then spread after WWII to the rest of the world .
As the credit - based system spread , so too did the resultant compounding debt and now , the day of reckoning for everyone has arrived .
WHY IS EVERYONE SURPRISED ?
When credit - based capitalist economies contract , they are unable to pay and service previously incurred debt .
This is now happening in the US , the UK , the EU and Japan .
After economic contraction , corporate , individual and government bankruptcy comes next .
After sustained economic contraction , systemic collapse occurs .
Alan Greenspan , the pundit ’s pundit for much of the last three decades , presided over much of the expansion of global credit during and after the 1980s , an expansion that led to extraordinary and unsustainable levels of global debt .
The truth is levels of US debt have been untenable for much longer than we believe .
Buckminster Fuller stated that the US was actually bankrupt in the 1930s , and that we have only postponed the realization of such and the inevitable day of reckoning by various forms of ledger sheet cheating .
While Alan Greenspan reigned as chief pundit for those who believed his economic prognostications to be true , the man who really understood our credit - based economy was Hyman Minsky , a little - known economist who , unlike Greenspan , happened to be right .
Hyman Minsky ’s perhaps greatest contribution to the current economic dialogue is his “ financial instability hypothesis� ? , which postulates that when capitalist systems mature , they became increasingly unstable .
Minsky ’s theory did not sit well with those in government and Wall Street who presided over increasingly mature capitalist markets .
They instead much preferred the more positive outlook of Alan Greenspan , “ the thinking man ’s Abby Joseph Cohen� ? , who publicly saw only a “ bit of froth� ?
as the greatest financial storm of the century , the next Great Depression , was brewing .
IF ALAN GREENSPAN WAS A CARDIOLOGIST ALL HIS PATIENTS WOULD BE DEAD
In Minsky ’s “ financial instability hypothesis� ? , the ability to pay the principal and interest on debt is the critical marker .
There are three types of “ units � ? in Minksy ’s financial instability model , each type / unit more unstable than the previous .
The first type , hedge financing units , possess the ability to pay both principal and interest payments from existing cash flow .
This is the optimal mode .
The second type , speculative finance units , cannot repay principal payments but can meet their existing obligations by�?
rolling over� ?
their debt .
The third type in Minsky ’s model are Ponzi units which can only pay down debt by selling assets or by borrowing .
This is the most common form of debt repayment today .
This is because as per Minsky ’s model , capitalist markets are now mature — perhaps overly mature and somewhat incontinent and beginning to smell — and have thus made the progression from hedge to speculative to Ponzi finance .
BERNARD MADOFF ’S BROTHER SAM
In 1960 , from the very beginning when Bernard Madoff first began soliciting money , the end of his scheme was destined .
But because Bernard Madoff was unusually bright and capable , his Ponzi scheme lasted far longer and was far more successful than any such previous scam .
The same can be also said for the Ponzi scheme of Bernie ’s brother , Sam , aka “ Uncle Sam� ? .
But unlike Bernie , Uncle Sam did not think up his scheme on his own .
He was acting as the agent of the original schemers in England who realized that England ’s economy was no longer expanding as it had previously in the 18th and 19th centuries .
So , in the early 20th century , in 1913 , the original schemers convinced Uncle Sam to run the same scheme in America that had been so profitable to them in England .
The scheme was capitalism , def. commerce in combination with capital markets founded on credit - based paper money issued from a central bank .
The scheme was to profit by indebting businesses , entrepreneurs , workers and savers and government and , as bankers , the schemers would get rich off the hard work , savings and productivity of others ; and , in the US , their scheme worked as well as it had in England .
As the economy expanded and the nation became increasingly indebted , bankers became increasingly wealthy .
It is no coincidence that the “ financial services sector , sic the paradigm of parasites� ?
recently comprised the largest share of both the UK and US economies , economies which correspondingly had the lowest rate of savings in the world .
It is also no coincidence that as the indebtedness of each nation grew the share of economic activity and the exorbitant salaries and bonuses of bankers grew as well .
Unfortunately for the host and parasite in capitalist economies , there is a limit to how much a parasite can safely take from the host before the host dies , a limit only discovered after the process has gone too far .
In December 2008 , the end came for Bernie ’s Bernard L Madoff Investment Services .
In 2009 , the same will happen to his brother , Sam who is now using Ponzi finance to pay for US borrowing .
In 2009 or some time shortly thereafter , the credit - based paper money scheme of bankers , sic capitalism , will bring down what but a few decades ago was the most powerful economy in the world , the United States of America .
Uncle Sam , just like his brother Bernie , is toast .
“ Look , they ’re circling the wagons .�?
“ But we ’re not in the circle .�?
“ Thought you would be ?�?
When wagon trains would come under attack , the wagon masters would “ circle the wagons � ? for protection .
Such is happening today as capitalism itself is now under attack .
What Americans are finding out , however , is that only the bankers are currently inside the circle — bankers are now the only ones being protected , the very ones responsible for the crisis in the first place .
Observers and especially Americans might believe that something is wrong with this picture .
What they do not understand is that the picture is a perfect reflection of the power dynamic underlying capitalism .
Bankers could not have accomplished their nefarious ends had they not first secured the full cooperation and protection of government .
This they did in England when they promised King William they would extend all the credit he wanted to wage his wars .
This was replicated in the US when private bankers staged a midnight coup by passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 which illegally transferred the right to issue money from government into the hands of private bankers .
This is the reason the US government has first protected the bankers , not the public , in this crisis .
Bankers give government the unlimited credit that governments overspend , thereby indebting the nation and future generations into perpetuity .
The US government bailout of bankers , TARP , is “ owe - back� ? time .
The rest is history , or is about to become so .
When people have their eyes shut and their minds closed , they will not see nor understand what is happening to them .
Trust me on this , although many will not understand what is about to happen , it will not prevent it from happening .
What we are about to experience is an economic tragedy in personal terms that will exceed anything in recent memory .
Even the Great Depression of the 1930s will not equal what is now about to be ; and those who thought their adherence to a belief system about God was faith are now about to find out the difference .
IGNORANCE DENIAL CONSEQUENCES
Uncle Sam is now engaged in the same activity that caused Bernie ’s investors so much trouble , the use of Ponzi finance to pay bills .
It is estimated that the US deficit may increase this year by two trillion dollars .
As recently as 1980 , the total US debt after 200 years was only $ 980 billion dollars .
Now , 28 years later , US indebtedness will probably exceed $ 12 trillion , a very , very large sum—unless of course it is not going to be paid back .
The truth is all countries are now running deficits and all major economies have determined that extraordinary levels of fiscal stimulus are needed to avert a global deflationary collapse .
Where is all the money going to come from ?
While some economic answers are difficult to come by , the answer to that question is very simple .
The currencies of all countries are now fiat , meaning they are but paper coupons printed at will by their governments .
The answer is : Governments will print the money they need .
It is said that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke studied the Great Depression and concluded the road not taken was the correct answer to what would have prevented the Great Depression , that infinite liquidity could have prevented the deflationary collapse if made available in time .
Ben Bernanke ’s answer closely resembles that which would be given by a focus group of New York heroin addicts , that only an unlimited and immediate supply of heroin would offset the irreparable pain and harm that would otherwise result if nothing is done .
HELICOPTER BEN IS AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN AS
NEEDLE BEN TO THE CREDIT JUNKIES ON WALL STREET THE EXPIRATION DATE WRITTEN IN INVISIBLE INK
ON PAPER MONEY WILL BE DETERMINED BY
THE SPEED OF THE PRINTING PRESSES
When will the yen go to zero ?
When will the dollar disintegrate ?
When will the pound become worthless ?
When will the time be too late ?
Listen to the speed of the presses
As money is made overnight
The faster the presses are running
The closer the time will be for flight
But no one can tell the hour
When money will lose its worth
For the future is still too cloudy
And tomorrow ’s yet to be birthed .
But the day is coming so trust me
Do n’t trust the money they print
Whether a dollar a euro or peso
It ai n’t comin ’ out of a mint
It ’s printed with ink on some paper
But it used to be silver or gold
When money was more than a promise
Not a fraud that we ’ve been sold THE PRINTING PRESSES ARE RUNNING
This process has already begun .
M1 , the measure of “ narrow money aggregates� ? , the amount of cash and coins in circulation and in overnight deposits has been rising in the past six months .
M - 3 , the broadest measure of monetary aggregates is no longer made public by the US government .
But M - 3 will explode upwards as governments seek to provide even more credit to deflating markets , a fact the US government does not want known .
M-1 , NARROW MONEY AGGREGATES

Ben Bernanke ’s antidote to a US deflationary depression may well result in hyperinflation .
Hyperinflation will spell the end of the US currency because hyperinflation removes all remaining vestiges of confidence in paper money .
Confidence is the essential ingredient in the global con game called capitalism now being run by bankers and their unwitting co-conspirators in government , a game that is now about to end .
In the near future , paper money will become increasingly worthless as all governments increase the printing of their respective currencies hoping to prevent deflationary forces from progressing .
Governments will be helpless to do so but this will only cause more money to be printed in the futile hope of containing that which cannot be contained .
No experiment with paper money has every worked .
The primary intent has always been to spend what does not exist .
This underlying intent will in the end destroy whatever paper money has built in the interim .
Were it not for the safety concerns about the ink used in the printing of paper money , in the future the best use for paper money would be as toilet paper — of course , the quality of the paper would have to be much improved in order to gain wider acceptance .
FREEDOM VERSUS FRAUD A CRASH COURSE IN THE AUSTRIAN SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS Bernard Madoff ’s fraud lasted 48 years and took in $ 50 billion .
However , the monetary fraud perpetrated by bankers in collusion with government has lasted far longer and has taken in far more than Bernie ’s home grown Ponzi scheme — and the pain and losses will be commensurately greater as well .
Ludwig von Misis , Carl Menger , Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk , and Friedrich Hayek are the best known proponents of the Austrian School of Economics .
Like Hyman Minsky , they are not as well known as John Maynard Keynes , Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan .
The reason being is that they served the truth whereas Keynes , Friedman and Greenspan served power .
From Wikipedia : Austrian School economists advocate the strict enforcement of voluntary contractual agreements between economic agents , the smallest possible imposition of coercive ( especially government - imposed ) commercial transactions and the maximum openness to individual choice ( including free choice as to the voluntary means of exchange ) .
What most do not understand is that today ’s markets are not free .
Believing they are free and being told it is so is not the same as being so .
Government intervention occurs no less in today ’s capitalist markets than it did in yesterday ’s communist markets .
The only difference being method and subtlety .
The manipulation of the gold price , intervention in foreign exchange markets , the raising and lowering of interest rates , the use of tax incentives to promote / distort economic activity are all signs of government intervention .
Compared to communism , capitalist markets indeed appear free .
Compared to free markets , capitalism is a rigged game .
GOLD MODERN ECONOMICS AND THE TRUTH
We are now approaching the end - game , the resolution of past economic sins that cannot be banished by government intervention .
Indeed , it is government intervention at the direction of bankers that caused today ’s problems .
More of the same will only result in more of the same .
The bankers ’ scam could not have happened had not King William allowed England ’s bankers to replace England ’s gold and silver coins with paper bank notes in 1694 .
Capitalism ’s resultant empire known first as imperialism and later as globalization lasted 315 years .
It is now about to end .
As paper currencies increasingly lose value , the price of gold and silver will rise .
As those in government know all too well , gold and silver move inversely to the value of paper assets in fiat systems .
Economics is not rocket science and neither is fraud .
But “ modern economics � ?
is a misnomer , modern economics is a monetary fraud clothed in the guise of free markets .
If you truly want to be free , this is something you might want to think about — that is , if you want to think .
Lies will seek you out , but the truth must be sought .
Faith , gold and silver will be priceless in the days ahead .

I am willing to rent out my bathroom in my 1 bedroom east village home .
My bathroom is large .
You can easily put a twin air mattress in there .
I only ask that when I need to use the bathroom , you or your air mattress are not in it .
I do ask that when you are in the apartment , you confine yourself to the bathroom .
I do not feel comfortable with a stranger walking around my living room .
This might change as I get to know you better .
You may have guest over as long as they are cnfined to the bathroom as well .
This might seem a bit odd but please remember the rent is $ 400 and the bathroom is large .
1 at A
Son of a bitch .
It finally happened .
Over the weekend , I read this horrible news story about a daycare killing in Belgium where a crazed man with a painted face walked into the nursery and started attacking the children there .
Two kids and one staff member were killed , while ten other children and two adults were injured .
Today many European newspapers are reporting further information suggesting that the killer was inspired by Heath Ledger 's Joker .
The police have not uncovered a motive yet , but suggested that the attack was timed with the anniversary of Heath Ledger 's death ( Ledger died January 22nd of last year , the attack was on the 23rd ) .
I do n't know , but it does sound like this 20 - year - old psycho is trying to be the Joker :
He is described as a film buff and a loner ( never a good combo , apparently ) by the people who knew him .
He painted his face white with black circles around his eyes , just like Ledger 's Joker .
He also dyed his long greasy hair red .
Maybe his local supermarket was out of green dye ?
He walked into the daycare center with a 12 - inch knife quoting a line from The Dark Knight ( " I have one question , " Joker 's line when he crashed Harvey Dent 's fundraiser ) and then escaped on his bicycle .
When the police caught him hours later , he was calm and cooperative .
They found a set of knives , an axe and a toy gun on his persons .
They also found a note with the address of two other daycare centers .
He refused to say anything during interrogation , instead laughing at grinning at the cops .
They found no prior criminal records or any history of mental illness .
You know , you can't get any worse than brutally killing innocent children for no reason , but to do so as a tribute to an internationally beloved actor who died tragically ?
That 's just asking for ... I do n't even know .
Police have taken Mr. Joker to a secure location away from the town where it happened , in fear of another psycho dressing up as Batman and challenging him to a fight .
Well , no , not really , but they are worried about vigilante actions , given the emotional and high - profile nature of the murders .
I do n't know if this would affect The Dark Knight in any way ( doubtful ) , but Dutch mag Menzo has been forced to change their Heath Ledger tribute issue 's cover from Joker to normal - Heath due to the sensitivity of the case .
With still no end in sight to the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip , growing international concerns about the soaring civilian toll are putting an uncomfortable spotlight on the military ’s behavior in a densely populated region .
But while their own legal experts insist that the number of civilians killed by the Israeli military and the devastation of an entire enclave are totally irrelevant to the question of the proportionality of the attacks , human rights groups and high ranking UN officials see things a different way .
Earlier today , the United Nations Human Rights Council voted 33 - 1 to condemn Israel for gravely violating the human rights of Palestinians and called for an independent fact - finding mission to investigate potential violations of international human rights law , particularly in Israeli attacks on UN facilities .
Only Canada voted against the the resolution .
Rights group have also accused Israel of targeting civilians , using banned weapons , holding Palestinian families in homes for use as human shields , and attacking medical facilities .
Amnesty International said the shelling of residential streets alone was “ prima facie evidence of war crimes , ” with investigator Donatella Rovera condemning the indiscriminate use of force by the Israeli military .
The Vatican seeks to separate the bishops ' status from their views
The Pope has lifted the excommunication from the Roman Catholic Church of four bishops appointed by a breakaway archbishop more than 20 years ago .
One of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre 's appointees , Briton Richard Williamson , outraged Jews by saying the Nazi gas chambers did not exist .
Two of the other three appointees are French while the fourth is Argentinean .
Israel 's envoy to the Vatican said the papal decision would " cast a shadow on relations with Jews " .
" We have no intention of interfering in the internal workings of the Catholic Church , however , the eagerness to bring a Holocaust denier back into the Church will cast a shadow on relations between Jews and the Catholic Church , " Mordechai Lewy told Reuters news agency .
Lefebvre , who died in 1991 , rebelled against liberal reforms in the Church , such as the end of the Latin Mass .
He opposed replacing the traditional Mass with services in national languages .
The Vatican said the excommunications had been lifted after the bishops affirmed their willingness to accept Church teachings and papal authority .
' No gas chambers ' Relations between the Vatican and representatives of the Jewish faith have been strained throughout much of the Church 's recent history ; Jewish groups have accused the wartime - era Pope Pius of turning a blind eye to the fate of the Jews in World War II .
The latest move by Pope Benedict is likely to add to those strains .
Bishop Richard Williamson recently told Swedish TV : " I believe there were no gas chambers .
I think that two to three hundred thousand Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps but none of them by gas chambers . "
The Vatican has distanced itself from those remarks .
But its spokesman , Rev Federico Lombardi , still stood by the decision to rehabilitate Bishop Williamson and the others .
" This act regards the lifting of the excommunications , period , " he told reporters .
" It has nothing to do with the personal opinions of a person , which are open to criticism , but are not pertinent to this decree . "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President - elect Barack Obama 's January 17 train trip from Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , to Washington is intended to make the inauguration the most open and accessible in history .
President - elect Barack Obama 's train ride from Philadelphia to Washington will pose myriad security risks .
But it is also presenting the U.S. Secret Service with security problems .
Miles and miles and miles of them .
In addition to the well - publicized " whistle stops " in Philadelphia ; Wilmington , Delaware ; and Baltimore , Maryland , the Presidential Inauguration Committee says the public will have the opportunity to view the train at other locations along its 137 - mile route .
But the committee has not indicated where those sites will be , and the Secret Service has yet to release what security restrictions will be in place .
Security experts say the train ride presents traditional threats to the VIPs on board , as well as countless buildings , homes and warehouses along the route .
And there are non-traditional vulnerabilities : scores of bridges and tunnels that could be sabotaged .
And , two environmental groups have warned , terrorists could take a page from al Qaeda 's playbook , using existing infrastructure , in this case chemical plants along the route , as an attack method .
In a letter to the Secret Service , Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth wrote that they were worried that security efforts focused on the Obama entourage " might not extend to the larger community which may suffer serious consequences in case of even one moderately successful terrorist release of ultrahazardous chemicals . "
" We will be urging Mr. Obama and [ Vice President - elect Joe ] Biden to re-consider " plans to travel by train , the groups wrote .
In response , Secret Service spokesman Eric Zahren told the groups , " Please be assured , the U.S. Secret Service is working closely with federal , state and local agencies to maintain a safe and secure environment for all of our protectees . "
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , whose department includes the Secret Service , said he is confident of the agency 's abilities to protect the president - elect .
" Remember , the Secret Service has taken the president to Iraq and to Afghanistan , to some very hostile places around the world .
I 'm comfortable that we have the skills , working of course with state and local authorities , to protect the president - elect in Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Washington , D.C. , " Chertoff said .
Chertoff said he is aware of the environmental groups ' concerns .
" I suspect it 's being done , frankly , largely as a public relations ploy , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's any particular threat from chemical plants along the train route . "
iReport.com : Send your photos from the train stops
A former Secret Service agent said the agency has had experience with presidential train trips and said authorities typically install chemical , biological and radiological detectors along the route .
Amtrak and the Secret Service will not say whether Obama 's train car will be armored , though experts say special cars have been used in the past .
" Security will be provided in the air , on the ground and in the water , " said Amtrak Police Department Chief John O'Connor .
" It 's a daunting challenge , but there are many , many police departments that are working together to make this happen . "
Once the train reaches its final destination , the presidential inauguration itself will offer an attractive target for terrorists because of " the historic significance of the nation 's first minority president , " a U.S. intelligence assessment said .
The report hastened to add that no specific threat has been detected thus far .
The document says the swearing - in of the first minority president " increases the potential threat , particularly stemming from individuals on the extremist fringe of the white supremacist movement . "
But it adds that no such groups are known to have threatened the inauguration so far .
The report further noted that " lone offenders " not connected to organized groups pose the greatest potential threat because such offenders are often the most difficult to detect .
The document says there have been some reports of lone offenders making threats but no indication that any of the potential threats " have progressed past rhetoric to operational planning . "

The chances of Windows 7 suddenly winning over Windows XP users in droves are slim to none .
Windows 7 is a better Vista but does n't deliver enough advantages or differentiation from Windows XP to woo XP users from their stable , reliable and functional desktop OS .
Windows 7 successes will come from new computer sales , NetBooks and Vista users treading water waiting for a lifeline out of Vista 's turbulent and tragic waters .
Windows 7 " Mac - like " improvements to the taskbar may even stave off some users considering the move to a Mac over buying another Windows PC .
What will it take for Windows XP users to convert ?
I 've been using the Windows 7 public beta as my full - time laptop OS and have reached some pretty firm conclusions about Windows 7's ability to woo XP , Vista , Linux and Mac users over to the new OS .
I believe it will require an OS with strong client OS and application virtualization , or some of the promise of a tightly integrated Live Mesh and Windows Azure services to significantly differentiate Windows 7 from the same old desktop OS it presents itself as today .
Why such dire predictions for Windows 7 ability to convert Windows XP users ?
As I 've said , Windows 7 will do very well but just not with XP users .
Like our new President Barak Obama , Windows 7 is overburdened with expectations from many constituents , especially Windows XP users who 've strongly resisted moving to Vista .
Windows 7 has a lot of making up to do for the Windows Vista debacle and that clearly is Windows 7's aim .
But merely achieving par with what Vista promised to be at its launch more than two years ago is n't compelling enough to move XP users from their now hardened position about upgrading .
Let 's dig into why this is the case and why Windows 7 will win and lose with different users .
First , lets start with the obvious -- Vista was guilty of many sins .
The most talked about were its instability , compatibility issues and lack of drivers .
But Vista also did a makeover on the Windows UI , masking XP dialog boxes and settings with new Vista windows .
That meant users had to search and dig to find things they already knew how to do in Windows XP .
In many cases the makeover was n't any better or was worse than the original XP design ( wireless networking is a good example . )
Windows 7 yet again has redesigned the UI as well as added some new and redesigned features , landing it somewhere between Vista and a newly designed Windows OS .
Where Windows 7 Wins
New Computers : Windows 7 will be much more palatable as an OS shipped on new computers purchased at Best Buy , Micro Center or online at Dell , HP , Sony , etc .
Users wo n't be faced with the " Vista dilemma " as Windows 7 does n't carry with it the same stigma and baggage as did Vista .
In retail stores and as an OS on new computers , Windows 7 will be a big hit .
Upgrade For Vista Users : For existing Vista users , a Windows 7 upgrade is pretty much a no - brainer .
Its faster boot up , shutdown and sleep , and overall improved performance alone make it worth the upgrade .
Add in the UI improvements and you have a clear winner .
Windows 7 even narrows the gap a bit between Windows and Mac OS X's ease of use , though it certainly does n't bring with it the cool factor Apple does with many users .
NetBooks : Vista 's girth and bloat make it a no - op for NetBooks .
XP fills that role today just fine ( as does Linux , btw ) .
Both Windows 7's improved performance and its ability to be slimmed down into smaller OS disto's means Windows 7 can easily replace Windows XP as the default NetBook OS .
Where Windows 7 Loses ( or Does n't Over Woo Users )
Windows XP
Users :
There 's no doubt Windows 7 is a huge improvement over Vista , but is it enough to get XP users to upgrade ?
I suspect not unless users are forced to make a change as Microsoft begins to drop support for Windows XP in 2012 and beyond .
Lets look at why .
Windows 7 is very much aimed at being a better Vista , not a better Windows XP .
Windows 7 brings us both improvements to existing Vista and some XP features , as well as some new features added in the OS .
Examples of improvements are the simplified ( and more powerful ) taskbar interface , improved wireless networking setup , faster boot , shutdown and sleep , and less chatty balloon and UAC messages .
Added features are things like the new Device Center , PowerShell , Libraries for managing data across storage and computing devices , and redesigned home networking paradigm .
Windows 7 also benefits from the security improvements originally designed into Vista , but these benefits have been intangible to most users and IT shops .
The net - net is when you peel back the new improvements and additions in Windows 7 , what 's underlying all these changes are many of the very same redesigned screens , features and changes found originally in Windows Vista .
Windows 7 is the OS Microsoft should have ( and wish they had ) shipped as Vista .
Fundamentally , Windows 7 is playing catch up to get back to square one .
It 's not obvious the improvements in Windows 7 will get XP users to shell out the dough and go through the pains and effort to upgrade to W7 .
If anything , Vista fortified XP users belief they already have a perfectly good OS in XP and it's going to take a pretty compelling story to get them to go through any kind of Windows OS upgrade .
The upgrade justification from XP can't be made on productivity improvements or economic benefits .
It ca n't be made on better security ( the difference is n't tangible enough ) .
It ca n't be made on new features or capabilities in Windows 7 - they just are n't compelling enough .
If I look into my crystal ball , I do see a future where XP users want to upgrade ( aside from being forced to my Microsoft cutting back support for XP . )
In an upcoming podcast ( that will be posted next week ) , Citrix CTO Simon Crosby makes a supposition that we 're moving into a world where businesses do n't necessarily buy computers from some or all of their employees .
Rather , users can freely use their own computers or computers employees purchase with a stipend provided by the business .
It 's an interesting possibility and is actually a world many of us live in today .
Contractors , consultants , and increasingly employees , use their own laptops to connect to the corporate network .
Personally , I 've not used a corporate supplied computer for the last five to six years .
Despite corporate policies , today many end users use their corporate - supplied computers for both a mix of personal and business purposes .
In some respects , businesses are giving into this practice just as they 've given into allowing many users to customize their Windows environment , install their own applications and play music on business computers .
In my experience this is much more prevalent in knowledge worker environments vs. call centers or other task orient operations .
The future Simon paints is one where these personal and business computing environments are virtualized onto the same computer , rather than intermingled as they are today .
Businesses will deliver virtualized full OS plus apps , and stand - alone virtualized apps , to computers that users own .
This maintains the security of corporate data and applications , and allows the business to viably deliver a computing environment they manage on computers they do n't .
Obviously this vision is in line where Citrix is going with XenServer , XenApp and their newly announced Project Independence , and given my own views about desktop and application virtualization I can see merit in a lot of Citrix 's vision .
While we have n't seen much of this yet , I believe it would be wise for Microsoft to continue to improve Windows 7 as an easily virtualized OS and a platform for delivering virtualized applications .
Microsoft has partially move Live Essential apps into the cloud .
As they move Office and other apps online , the OS becomes thinner and thinner , less bloated with applications that entangle themselves into the registry and Windows folder of Windows 7 .
The degree to which Microsoft improves and refines Windows 7 to function as a virtualized OS and support virtualized applications , Simon 's vision can become one that 's possible beyond just through Citrix 's offerings and product plans .
Add in the synchronization capabilities of Live Mesh and applications that tie into Live Framework ( LiveFx ) , you have a significantly differentiated and compelling environment to shift XP users to Windows 7 .
Is it going to take all this to get Windows XP users moved over to Windows 7 ?
Maybe not , but XP users and IT shops need to see a lot more differentiation between XP and Windows 7 than exists today .

Experts hope the maps will give Thomas Harriot the credit he deserves " Moon maps " created by a little - known Englishman 400 years ago are to go on display to mark the launch of the International Year of Astronomy .
Experts say they prove their creator - Thomas Harriot - beat Galileo to become the first man to view the Moon through a telescope .
The Italian philosopher is credited with the feat in December 1609 .
But papers at the West Sussex Record Office show that Harriot drew images of the Moon several months earlier .
And Dr Allan Chapman , a science historian at Oxford University , said Harriot 's composite drawing of the Moon - produced in 1612 or 1613 - marked " the birth of modern cartography " .
" Thomas Harriot was not only the first person ever to draw an astronomical body with a telescope on 26 July 1609 , he rapidly developed to become an absolutely superb lunar cartographer , " he said " There were n't equivalent lunar drawings to be done for another 30 years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Tragically , no - one knew of it until relatively recent times , so Galileo gets all the credit . "
Harriot was a wealthy gentleman with no desire for fame and fortune , unlike Galileo , said Dr Chapman .
" He was comfortably off and had two friends in the Tower of London for political crimes and had no wish to raise his profile .
" Galileo in Italy on the other hand was relatively hard - up , mid-40s and wanted fame and distinction .
Galileo goes for publication .
Harriot stays nice and quiet ; and it was n't until modern times that Harriott 's achievements get noticed . "
The first Moon map he drew - on 26 July 1609 - will be on display in Florence , Italy , this summer as part of an exhibition on Galileo .
A selection of other images will go on display at the Science Museum in London from 23 July at an exhibition , Cosmos and Culture , to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy .
International Year of Astronomy marks 400 years since Galileo 's work Astronomer Sir Patrick Moore said : " I 'm sorry Harriot is n't better known over here ... after all , we all know Galileo .
" But Harriot was first ... and his map of the Moon is better than Galileo's . "
" Looking at Harriot 's map , it really is a work of art .
He saw the mountains , craters and the so - called seas .
It really is a wonderful thing and it's British . "
" Harriot was first , no question about it , and his map of the Moon was good .
Galileo came after , but went much further .
" Harriot never took things as far as he might have done .
We 've got to give Galileo pride of place but do n't forget Harriot . "
The general public can see copies of the priceless originals - privately owned by Lord Egremont - at the West Sussex Record Office in Chichester .
There will also be a month - long exhibition at the Record Office , from 24 July , featuring Harriot 's images of Jupiter 's satellites , sunspots and Halley 's comet .
A range of events across the UK and internationally are being staged to celebrate the IYA , which is being officially launched in Paris on Thursday .
British astronomers hope that , 400 years on , Harriot will finally get some of the wider recognition that he deserves .
Astronomers in Wales also played a role .
Dr Chapman said letters to Harriot from Sir William Lower in Carmarthenshire prove that astronomers there were also making observations on the Moon .
The early telescopes utterly changed our view of the heavens

Barack Obama walked the halls of the Senate for four years , and in his earliest decisions after the presidential election assembled a coterie of key advisors with deep roots in Congress .
He is the first president elected directly from Congress since John F. Kennedy -- leading to high expectations that he would know how to handle congressional egos .
So it came as a surprise that Obama ’s first real workweek in Washington as president - elect was marked by collisions with his former colleagues , including some who helped him win the White House .
In naming a CIA director and in shaping his massive economic stimulus plan , Obama managed to rankle some lawmakers from his own party by stepping crosswise of their procedures , prerogatives and personal feelings .
Advertisement
Now , as the incoming president moves into the details of governing and begins in earnest to try to revive the ailing economy , the question is whether last week ’s ruffled feathers have been smoothed and whether there are more tensions ahead .
Some clashes could be the inevitable stumbles of a new relationship .
Others may reflect contending visions of how to do business , involving basic differences between the Obama viewpoint and what the president - elect refers to as the Washington way .
“ I do see a culture clash , ” said Dee Dee Myers , a White House press secretary for President Clinton .
“ For a campaign that got kudos for being as well - run as Obama ’s , they probably thought they were going to come to Washington and continue with that successful framework .
In many ways they have .
But there ’s also a lot of acclimating that ’s going on too . ”
The week began with Obama antagonizing some influential members of Congress with his surprise choice of Leon E. Panetta , a former Clinton White House official , to head the CIA .
Days before the nomination was official , word reached Capitol Hill , where Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) was beginning her tenure as the first woman to head the intelligence committee .
Advertisement
She said she had n’t been consulted on Panetta and was thinking about opposing his nomination .
The departing committee chairman , Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) , also raised concerns about the choice .
It was an inauspicious start to the week , coming with word that the Obama transition team was readying a massive tax cut component to his economic stimulus package to lure Republican support for the broader plan .
The tax cut strategy drew some pointed comments from Democratic lawmakers , who are less enthusiastic about tax cuts and suggested that their votes should n’t be taken for granted .
As they emerged from a private meeting of the Senate Finance Committee at midweek , several expressed skepticism about two tax cuts taking shape in the Obama plan .
Both missteps were corrected by week ’s end .
After Obama and Vice President - elect Joe Biden called Feinstein to apologize , she reversed her position and supported the Panetta nomination .
Advertisement
And Lawrence H. Summers , Obama ’s national economic advisor , met with Democrats on the finance committee to convey that their message had been received .
Obama on Friday said that he would work with lawmakers to “ hone and refine ” his economic recovery plan , signaling his intent to respond to Democratic concerns about the plan as it takes shape .
“ If members of Congress have good ideas , if they can identify a project for me that will create jobs in an efficient way that does not hamper our ability over the long term to get control of our deficit , that is good for the economy , then I ’m going to accept it , ” Obama said in a news conference .
Obama certainly is n’t the first incoming president to stumble in his early dealings with Congress .
President Carter ’s dismissal of Washington norms resulted in a rocky relationship that hindered his agenda throughout his administration .
President Clinton struggled with lawmakers even when he had a Democratic Congress , just as President Bush grew detached from fellow Republicans .
Obama was mindful of the week ’s perils and , in several cases , managed to resolve the conflicts .
Advertisement
But others remain in play to varying degrees of tension .
For one thing , even some Senate committees had to scramble to learn Obama ’s Cabinet choices .
The Energy and Natural Resources Committee , led by Sen. Jeff Bingaman ( D - N.M. ) , never got official notice of two Cabinet nominees within its jurisdiction : Energy Secretary - nominee Steven Chu and Interior Secretary - nominee Ken Salazar .
Rather , the staff of the committee pestered aides on the Obama transition team for clues as to whom the picks might be , ultimately ferreting out the names through their own efforts .
“ Did Bingaman receive a phone call from Obama , Biden or [ transition co-chairman John ] Podesta ?
No , he did not , ” a committee aide said .
“ We were very curious and wanted to keep our chairman informed .
At our initiative , we pressed these [ Obama staff ] guys pretty hard .
And through breaking news and leaks and our own undisclosed sources and through our own people working on the inside , we did know in advance . ”
Advertisement
Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) said Obama did not alert her before announcing two major environmental picks : Lisa Jackson , his nominee for Environmental Protection Agency administrator , and Carol Browner , the new climate change czar .
Boxer leads the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works .
“ Maybe it ’s because he did n’t want a lot of people knowing his choices , did n’t want to leak things out , ” Boxer said .
“ That could be .
But I think the chair of a committee can be trusted . ”
Likewise , Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - Ga. ) , a conservative member of the House Appropriations Committee -- which will draft a large portion of the stimulus bill -- said he was frustrated by the lack of information available about the stimulus package .
“ I ’m very disappointed .
I ’ve read more in the public media than I ’ve learned as a member of Congress , ” he said .
“ I ’d be very interested in tax relief .
I want to be part of it .
But I have not been invited to any of these classic backroom meetings . ”

House Democratic Caucus Chairman John B. Larson ( D - Conn . ) heard that comment and joked , “ You sound just like members of my caucus . ”
Another potentially troublesome point of discussion is what to do about the government ’s $ 700 - billion bailout of the financial sector .
The House could act as early as this week to set tougher restrictions on recipients of the bailout money , even as the Obama team crafts its own set of rules .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said Friday that he had been working closely with the Obama transition team on legislation and that he trusted the Obama staff to run the program effectively .
Still , he said , “ We intend to trust but verify . ”
Advertisement
As Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy ( D - R.I. ) said last week , “ We worked hard to get Obama elected .
We ’re all in this together .
. . .
But we ’re also not going to necessarily be a rubber stamp . ”
Back in Chicago for the last two years , Obama ’s team has operated as a tight cadre of insiders who famously exercised control over its message and image .
If the campaign officials were n’t confirming something , it could scarcely be confirmed through other sources .
After the president - elect ’s first full week of doing business in Washington , though , members of that team are facing a new reality :
They ’re reading about their own business in Capitol Hill releases and news accounts .
They ’re bumping up against Hill - sized egos that operate on their own terms .
Former White House spokeswoman
Myers thinks one person actually can influence Washington culture , arguing that Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan both did so .
Advertisement
“ It ’s absolutely possible , ” Myers said .
Obama “ can do a lot to set a tone , to say , ‘ I expect this ; it ’s important . ’ ”
She said the moment might be right .

First up : economic stimulus package
Obama urges Congress to act quickly on his plan , which could end up costing $ 1 trillion .
NATION , A10
Officer sympathizes with suspect about his Sergeant 's demeanor .
THE 'ROE ' RULING THE 'ROE ' RULING The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973 that a Texas law criminalizing most abortions violated a woman 's constitutional right of privacy , which the court said was implicit in the due- process clause of the 14th Amendment .
" Jane Roe " was an alias used to shield the identity of Norma McCorvey , who sued Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade .
In the 7 - 2 decision , the court sought to balance a woman 's right to privacy with a state 's interest in regulating abortion .
Only a " compelling state interest " would justify restrictions , it concluded .
Legal challenges have limited the reach of Roe but not overturned it .
WASHINGTON  President Obama on Friday quietly ended the Bush administration 's ban on giving federal money to international groups that perform abortions or provide information on the option .
Liberal groups welcomed the decision , while abortion rights foes criticized the president .
Known as the " Mexico City policy , " the ban has been reinstated and then reversed by Republican and Democratic presidents since Ronald Reagan established it in 1984 .
Democrat Bill Clinton ended the ban in 1993 , but Republican George W. Bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in office .
' ROE V. WADE ' : Thousands rally in Washington for annual march FAITH & REASON : Abortion , stem cells :
Are religious voices ' bystanders ' in changing times ?
A White House spokesman , Bill Burton , said Obama signed an executive order on the ban , without coverage by the media , late Friday afternoon .
That was in contrast to the midday signings with fanfare of executive orders on other subjects earlier in the week .
Obama 's action came one day after the 36th anniversary of the Supreme Court 's landmark Roe v.
Wade ruling that legalized abortion .
The Bush policy had banned U.S. taxpayer money , usually in the form of Agency for International Development funds , from going to international family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide information , counseling or referrals about abortion .
The rule also had prohibited federal funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method .
Both Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton , who will oversee foreign aid , had promised to do away with the rule during the presidential campaign .
Clinton visited the U.S. Agency for International Development on Friday but made no mention of the step .
Obama has spent his first days in office aggressively signing executive orders reversing Bush administration policies on issues ranging from foreign policy to government operations .
TV cameras were invited in for Wednesday 's announcements on ethics rules and for Thursday 's signing of orders on closing the Guantanamo Bay prison camp and banning torture in the questioning of terror suspects .
In a move related to the lifting of the abortion rule , Obama also is expected to restore funding to the U.N. Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , probably in the next budget .
Both he and Clinton had pledged to reverse a Bush administration determination that assistance to the organization violated U.S. law .
The Bush administration had barred U.S. money from the fund , contending that its work in China supported a Chinese family planning policy of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization .
UNFPA has vehemently denied that it does .
Organizations that had pressed Obama to make the abortion - ban change were jubilant .
" Women 's health has been severely impacted by the cutoff of assistance .
President Obama 's actions will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies , abortions and women dying from high - risk pregnancies because they do n't have access to family planning , " said Tod Preston , a spokesman for Population Action International , an advocacy group .
Anti-abortion groups criticized the move .
" President Obama not long ago told the American people that he would support policies to reduce abortions , but today he is effectively guaranteeing more abortions by funding groups that promote abortion as a method of population control , " said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee .
Obama also is expected at some point to lift or ease restrictions on federal money for stem cell research , an issue that divides people along similar battle lines , but there was no word about any action on that Friday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has expressed interest in pressing legislation on stem cells in the first 100 days of the new Congress if the new administration does n't act .
Some scientists want broader use of embryonic stem cells than is currently allowed , hoping for new treatments for many diseases .
Obtaining stem cells from four - or five - day - old embryos kills the embryos , and many opponents see that as taking life .

One of only four surviving British veterans of World War I has died at the age of 108 .
William Stone , from Watlington in Oxfordshire , was the last British serviceman to have seen active duty in both world wars .
Mr Stone , who was known as Bill , joined the Royal Navy on his 18th birthday in September 1918 and served on HMS Tiger .
In 2004 he was presented with the National Veterans ' Badge .
He died at a care home in Sindlesham , Berkshire .
Born in Ledstone , Kingsbridge , South Devon , on 23 September 1900 , he followed his brothers into the navy , serving as a stoker .
During World War II he was a chief stoker on HMS Salamander and took part in the evacuation of Dunkirk , making five trips to pick up troops from the beaches .
He was a man of great faith and his recipe for long life was : clean living , contented mind and trust in God
Anne Davidson , daughter Mr Stone also served in the Sicily landings of 1943 with HMS Newfoundland and was mentioned in despatches after a torpedo attack as the ship made its way back to Malta .
In an interview with the BBC in 2007 , Mr Stone said : " Dunkirk was the worst part of my life .
" One of our sister ships , Skipjack , was bombed , and 200 soldiers and all crew were killed .
" During our trips to Dunkirk , I was often stationed on the quarterdeck helping men get aboard Salamander as they swam out from the beach .
" Those were awful days but one just carried on as if nothing had happened - there was nothing else that you could do . "
Mr Stone married Lily in 1938 and their daughter Anne was born the year after .
He went on to run a tobacconist and hairdressing shop in Devon , retiring in 1968 to move to Oxfordshire .
Mrs Stone died in 1995 .
In a statement , Mr Stone 's daughter said : " [ He ] had a remarkable , long , healthy and happy life .
( L - R ) Henry Allingham , Harry Patch and Bill Stone pictured last year " He thoroughly enjoyed going to events , meeting people and , whenever possible , regaling those around him with his fund of naval stories and jokes .
" He was a very determined character both in his naval career and in civilian life and , no doubt , this contributed greatly to his longevity .
" He was a man of great faith and his recipe for long life was : clean living , contented mind and trust in God .
His motto - ' keep going ' .
" William will be sadly missed by his family and many friends " .
The other known remaining British veterans of World War I are 112 - year - old Henry Allingham and 110 - year - old Harry Patch , who both live in Britain , and 107 - year - old Claude Choules who lives in Australia .
Minister for Veterans Kevan Jones MP paid tribute to Mr Stone .
" We owe a great deal to the men and women who served this country with such distinction during those wars to protect our liberty , " he said .
" [ Mr Stone ] was a man who represented the courage , spirit and determination of his generation .
He was an inspiration to us all . "
Mr Stone died on Saturday at the Masonic Care Home at Sindlesham near Wokingham , where he lived for the past two years .
A funeral will be held later in the month at St Leonard 's Church in Watlington .

Firstly , let 's break it down to basics , because in truth , the way in which active camouflage works is exceedingly simple ; have you ever hooked a video camera to a television while it was on " record " mode ?
It 's nothing special , and does n't do much more than make a bigger image of what the camera already sees , but it 's the idea that counts .
Now , say you were to take that camera , set it on the television , and turn it so it faced the opposite direction as the screen ; you 'd get an exciting picture of ... well ... nothing - a wall , probably , but nothing special , right ?
Ah , but here 's the trick !
Take away the edges of the television , everything but the screen , set the camera directly behind it and voila !
you can see right through it ; the camera is invisible !
Not excited yet ?
Consider that , by placing the screen and the camera in such a manner that they face the same direction , you 'll get a picture of yourself and the room you 're in , say , your living room or kitchen ; people who walk into the room will see themselves on the screen and instantly notice it , ( and probably do something silly , but that 's beside the point , ) but , by taking the camera and turning it so it faces the opposite direction , the screen will show a picture of whatever is behind it , meaning if a person walks by the camera , he or she will show up on the screen and , if the camera 's placed right , there will be little , if any real difference ( at least from a reasonable distance ) in the way he or she looks before , during , and after he or she passes behind the screen .
Or , on an even greater scale , imagine a screen so large it serves as a wall of your home , connected to a whole cluster of cameras outside ; from the outside , all you see is a wall of cameras , ( though I 'm sure the cameras could easily be disguised so your neighbors would n't get uneasy ) but on the inside , it looks like there 's absolutely no wall there at all - it 's just invisible , giving you a view of the road , trees , neighboring houses , etc .
This is the basic idea behind active camouflage - it is essentially a screen that projects what a camera sees in such a way as to fool the naked eye into perceiving something as transparent , no matter how many curves , creases or folds are in it .
Before you do , please consider that the Baby Jesus loves you - Even if you have sinned , the Baby Jesus will still be there for you and will forgive you .
The Baby Jesus can save you from the pain and suffering of the world and all He asks of you is that you return His love .
Is that so much to ask for Salvation ?
On Saturday , January 17 , after 22 days of pounding Gaza with bombs and missiles , tanks and mortars , ground troops and sniper fire ; after 22 days of horror for the Palestinian people of Gaza who saw their schools bombed , their children murdered and maimed , and life turned into a hell on earth ; after 22 days which took the lives of at least 1,200 Palestinians , including 350 children , “ with more buried under rubble , ” as the New York Times ( 1/18/09 ) acknowledged , and wounded another 5,200 ; after 22 days that left 26,000 Gazans unable to live in their homes , damaged 20,000 residential buildings , and destroyed much of Gaza ’s already - battered infrastructure , Israel declared a “ unilateral ceasefire . ”
Israel ’s declaration came one day after the announcement of an agreement — not with the Palestinians or the Hamas government of Gaza which it had been assaulting , but between Israel and the United States .
The next day Hamas also agreed to a one - week ceasefire , and the fighting has reportedly stopped — for now .
Israel and the U.S. will no doubt try to portray this ceasefire as an act of compassion that demonstrates their humanity , their sincere desire for a peaceful resolution , and their hope that what they claim the source of the problem — Hamas rocket fire into Israel — can be solved .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
And no amount of lies and hypocrisy on the part of the world ’s biggest terrorists will erase the images burned into the memories of millions and millions globally of 22 days of wanton slaughter perpetuated on one of the world ’s most battered peoples — the Palestinians of Gaza , who are confined into the world ’s largest open - air prison / concentration camp , in an area the size of the city of Detroit , with no way in , and no way out .
Israeli claims they achieved many of their objectives with the 22 - day massacre of Gaza .
That alone — the fact that mass , in many cases indiscriminate , murder of civilians , women , and children , including the massacre of refugees at a United Nations camp , achieved Israel ’s “ objectives ” speaks starkly to the totally unjust nature of the Israeli assault .
Israeli Aims …
Israeli rhetoric about the nature of the assault on Gaza has been overt and bloodthirsty .
On January 10 , Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said that “ Israel is not going to show restraint anymore … it is not a missile against a missile . ”
A senior Israeli military officer told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz , “ For us , being cautious means being aggressive . ”
He said , “ From the minute we entered , we ’ve acted like we ’re at war .
That creates enormous damage on the ground …
I just hope those who have fled the area of Gaza City in which we are operating will describe the shock .
Maybe someone there will sober up before it continues . ”
( Haaretz , 1/7/09 )
The massacre in Gaza was a continuation of Israel ’s 60 - year campaign to ethnically cleanse Palestine , destroy Palestinian society , and break the spirit of the Palestinian people .
More broadly , this deliberately vicious assault was aimed at politically and militarily weakening and sending a message to any forces in the region who stand in the way of unfettered dominance by the U.S. imperialists and their regional attack dog Israel .
Again , recent Israeli rhetoric has overtly proclaimed the aim of crushing the Palestinian people .
The International Herald Tribune recently printed a quote from Moshe Yaalon in 2002 , when he was chief of staff of the Israeli armed forces : “ The Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people . ” ( 1/9/09 ) .
And in February 2008 , an Israeli minister , speaking of the situation in Gaza , warned that the Palestinians could bring on themselves what he called a “ holocaust . ”
“ The more Qassam [ rocket ] fire intensifies and the rockets reach a longer range , they will bring upon themselves a bigger shoah because we will use all our might to defend ourselves , ” Matan Vilnai , Israel ’s deputy defense minister , told army radio .
( Shoah is the Hebrew word normally reserved to refer to the Jewish Holocaust .
It is rarely used in Israel outside discussions of the Nazi extermination of Jews during the second world war , and many Israelis are loath to countenance its use to describe other events . )
The massacre in Gaza is linked to strategic aims of the U.S. and Israel to target Iran , which is considered their biggest obstacle in the Middle East due to its size , its location , and its energy resources , and because it has emerged as a regional pole of opposition to some of the directions the U.S. wants to take things and to Israel ’s unchallenged ability to dictate terms to the Palestinians and its neighbors .
Such forces come into conflict with certain U.S. and Israeli goals , even though they do n’t represent a liberating future or a fundamental break from imperialism .
Nonetheless , it ’s the U.S. and Israel who are overwhelmingly responsible for the widespread suffering and deep oppression in the Middle East , and are the greatest obstacles to liberation in the region — including because of the ways imperialism has fueled and activated Islamic fundamentalism .
The U.S. and Israel are quite willing to engage in horrific and unprovoked slaughter in order to achieve these objectives because dominating and reshaping the Middle East - Central Asia region and strengthening Israel are crucial to maintaining U.S. global power and supremacy .
Preparing for a Ceasefire by Intensifying the Slaughter
Israel ’s actions during the days leading up to the ceasefire were a gory illustration of its reactionary , anti-Palestinian people objectives , despite all its hollow protestations to the contrary .
On just one day — January 15 — even as Israel was discussing a ceasefire , it bombed a UN headquarters , a major hospital , and the offices of international news media groups .
The media offices were bombed , according to reports , “ after Israeli forces assured Reuters that a 16 - story Gaza building used as a media center by correspondents for the international press was not a military target , ” and after Reuters news service had provided the Israelis with their GPS coordinates to avoid accidental strikes .
Israel targeted UNRWA — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency created to assist Palestinian refugees from the 1948 - 49 war and their descendants .
The Israelis have hit UNRWA facilities four times during the current assault on Gaza — including on January 6 when 43 Palestinians were murdered when an Israeli shell hit a school compound in Jabaliya refugee camp .
According to the Times of London ( 1/15/09 ) , “ The main UN compound in Gaza was left in flames today after being struck by Israeli artillery fire . ”
A UN spokesperson quoted on “ Democracy Now ” ( 1/16/09 ) stated : “ Our warehouses have been hit by some type of explosive and have caught alight .
The fire has spread from the workshops by the oil and spread to the warehouses .
One by one , the warehouses are going up .
We ’re now trying to build a buffer zone between the warehouses and the offices to try and stop the offices .
We ’ve lost all our food and all our medicine to this fire . ”
The fire spread so relentlessly , destroying vital food and medical supplies , because Israel targeted the UNRWA headquarters with white phosphorous — a deadly chemical weapon , whose use against civilians is a violation of international law .
On January 15 the Times of London reported that spent shells found by Gaza doctors proved that Israel was using this deadly agent , which can severely burn or kill if touched or inhaled .
On the very day Israel announced its ceasefire , the New York Times reported that “ two brothers , ages 5 and 7 , were killed about 7 a.m. by Israeli fire at the school .
Their mother , who was among 14 others wounded , had her legs blown off . ”
UNRWA ’s Gaza director , John Ging , told the press , “ These two little boys are as innocent , indisputably , as they are dead .
The question now being asked is : is this and the killing of all other innocent civilians in Gaza a war crime ? ”
UNRWA ’s spokesperson , Christopher Gunness , said : “ Where you have a direct hit on an UNRWA school where about 1,600 people had taken refuge , where the Israeli Army knows the coordinates and knows who ’s there , where this comes as the latest in a catalogue of direct and indirect attacks on UNRWA facilities , there have to be investigations to establish whether war crimes have been committed , ” as well , he added “ as violations of international humanitarian law . ” ( NYT 1/18/09 )
All this is aimed at sending a message to the Palestinian people that there is no refuge for them from Israeli assaults , and a message to the world that no UN resolutions will impede it from assaulting Palestinians , and perhaps destroying or emasculating UNRWA itself , and furthering the effort to destroy Palestinian society .
Overflowing Morgues , Hospitals Awash in Blood , And Hundreds of Thousands Without Water and Electricity
This comes when life in Gaza has become a waking nightmare .
Human rights attorney Yadin Ilam told “ Democracy Now ” ( 1/16/09 ) : “ We know for a fact that 250,000 people are without electricity since the war started twenty days ago , and half a million people are without proper water .
Sewage is overflowing to the street , and we are on the verge of epidemics . ”
Caoimhe Butterly paints a gruesome picture in her on - the - scene report on CommonDreams.org ( 1/16/09 ) : “ The morgues of Gaza ’s hospitals are over - flowing .
The bodies in their blood - soaked white shrouds cover the entire floor space of the Shifa hospital morgue .
Some are intact , most horribly deformed , limbs twisted into unnatural positions , chest cavities exposed , heads blown off , skulls crushed in .
Family members wait outside to identify and claim a brother , husband , father , mother , wife , child .
Many of those who wait their turn have lost numerous family members and loved ones .
Blood is everywhere .
Hospital orderlies hose down the floors of operating rooms , bloodied bandages lie discarded in corners , and the injured continue to pour in : bodies lacerated by shrapnel , burns , bullet wounds . ”
Ceasefire : Continuation of the Assault by Other Means
The U.S. - Israeli “ ceasefire ” is an effort to continue to pursue these criminal aims .
For one , there are reports that many Israeli troops will not immediately leave Gaza .
Israeli military forces continue to surround Gaza , and Israel and Egypt continue to imprison the people of Gaza and control all access in an out .
One element of the ceasefire is a U.S. - Israeli -Egyptian effort to tighten the strangulation of Gaza by destroying tunnels from Egypt that Gazans have relied on for basic supplies as well as small arms ( without which they would be totally defenseless ) .
So the starvation of Gaza will probably intensify as a result of this “ ceasefire . ”
Further , by declaring a “ unilateral ” ceasefire , Israel has refused to deal directly with Hamas , which is currently the Palestinian authority in Gaza , or to recognize any of the Palestinian people ’s legitimate demands , such as lifting the siege of Gaza .
The U.S. - Israeli action also cuts out any other big power internationally from having any say - so about the deal .
And Israeli officials insist they have the right to attack again .
A key part of the “ ceasefire ” was a US - Israeli “ memorandum of understanding , ” signed the day before , that calls for “ expanded cooperation to prevent Hamas from rearming through Egypt . ”
The agreement , which is vague , promises increased American technical assistance and international monitors , presumably to be based in Egypt , to crack down on the smuggling .
As important , the United States agreed to work with NATO partners to interdict arms smuggling into Gaza by land and sea from Syria and Iran , and in a letter , Britain , France and Germany also offered to help interdict the smuggling of arms to Hamas . ”
( NYT , 1/18/09 ) The U.S. is promising Egypt $ 33 million in aid to detect and destroy the tunnels into Gaza .
During the signing ceremony , the U.S. again gave Israel 100 percent support while blaming the slaughter on the victims : “ We ’ve said repeatedly that the continued supply of armaments to Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza … is a direct cause of the current hostilities , ” Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said .
“ It is therefore incumbent upon us in the international community to prevent the rearmament of Hamas so that a cease - fire will be durable and fully respected . ”
“ Only Democracy in the Middle East ”
Israel is further codifying the apartheid conditions inside Israel by banning the only three Arab parties represented in Israel ’s parliament — the National Democratic Assembly , the United Arab List and the Renewal Movement — from running in next month ’s elections .
The reason — they ’ve opposed Israel ’s attack on Gaza and participated in demonstrations against it ( leading to over 600 arrests ) .
The parties were barred on grounds of “ violating a 2002 law by refusing to recognize Israel as a Jewish state and by supporting a terrorist organization . ”
( Jonathan Cook , Electronic Intifada , 1/14/09 )
Israel ’s Treaty Record : No Better Than America ’s Toward Native Americans
Israel ’s record on upholding international law and its agreements with the Palestinians is no better than how the U.S. repeatedly broke its agreements with Native Americans .
John Wolfensohn , a UN official in charge of overseeing the May 2005 disengagement of Israeli forces and withdrawal of Israeli settlers from Gaza , resigned in April 2006 , telling Haaretz ( 7/21/07 ) that Israel violated agreements made to ensure the border into Gaza remained open : “ Every aspect of that agreement was abrogated . ”
Mark Perry , co-director of the Conflicts Forum , a British - American group which mediates between the West and Islamist groups , including Hamas , stated on PBS ’s “ Newshour ” ( 1/5/09 ) that contrary to US - Israeli propaganda , “ During the six months of the cease - fire [ agreed on between Israel and Hamas in June 2008 ] , there were 153 violations of the cease - fire by Israel , and 36 Palestinians in Gaza were killed by Israeli forces .
Most important of all , the economic siege of Gaza continued . ”
There Is Still an Urgent Need for Greater Resistance
All this points to the fact that the temporary halt in Israel ’s aggression against the Palestinian people of Gaza is ongoing — and could break out into intensified slaughter at any time .
And the criminal siege of Gaza and the U.S. - Israeli campaign of ethnic cleansing continues .
That means that the need for speaking out and resisting these US - Israeli crimes remains urgent .
One heartening example ( and there needs to be much more of this ) : On January 15 , protestors blocked Israeli consulates in Los Angels and San Francisco .
“ Democracy Now ” reported , “ On Thursday , nine people were arrested after chaining themselves together to block the Israeli consulate in San Francisco .
The protest came one day after six Jewish activists held a similar action at the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles .
Dozens of others gathered outside the consulate , chanting ‘ U.S. Jews say not in our name . ’ ”
People need to learn more about the real nature of Israel , its relationship to the U.S. , and the crimes both have committed against the Palestinian people , and then act on the logic of that understanding .

I love Xbox Live and have happily used the service since it first went into beta .
It has only become better over the years , with features big and small creating what feels like a " service " in the truest sense of the word , one that combines many elements to provide a cohesive online experience .
It 's difficult to imagine gaming without it , and the innovations it has made have had an undeniable impact on the way all of us play games .
I use it to watch movies and keep in contact with friends .
I 've played a ton of games and will often scroll through my gaming history , just to be reminded of some of the great times I 've had with my console .
I have personally invested hundreds of dollars in downloadable content and arcade titles .
Microsoft has worked very hard to make gamers who use their service feel like people instead of numbers by providing so many customization options to allow users to create a real identity .
But there is a problem , one that I discovered today , which threatens to destroy all of that identity and reduce users to a second - class status permanently .
This is my personal voyage of discovery into how Microsoft has created a system by which the promise of their so - called superior online service can be easily ripped away from its users , placing them in a position where they stand to lose everything they have ever used it for .
My fiancé has come down with some kind of horrible head cold and taken the day off from work .
Unable to do much more than blow her nose and moan with discomfort , using the Netflix streaming service over Live seemed like the perfect way to get a little rest and recovery time .
But since she does not use her Gold membership as much as I would like , it expired about a month ago and we had not yet bothered to reinstate the pay service .
No problem , right ?
All that would need to be done is toss in a credit card number and we 're good to go .
Hell , I already had a 12 - month subscription card just for the occasion .
Type in the code , hit " redeem " and we 're off to the races .
Or so I thought , until I received an error message stating that my console was unable to retrieve information from Xbox Live .
A call to Xbox customer support eventually revealed the problem : the Microsoft Passport ID associated with the Gamertag , something which existed in this case for the sole purpose of having a subscription to Live , had been closed for inactivity .
According to the customer service representative I spoke with , failure to log in to your Passport account for a period of three months essentially closes the account .
Live Gamertags are linked to the Passport account , and the system is designed in such a way that a closed account prevents you from performing actions such as adding MS points or signing up for Gold service .
An affected Gamertag still technically exists in some capacity and can even log in to Live as a Silver member ( and , presumably , Gold until such time as the subscription expires ) .
Friends lists are active and messages can be sent across the service , but you are in a purgatory where you can never take full advantage of Live ever again .
Once closed , Passport accounts can never be re-associated with a Gamertag , even if reinstated .
Microsoft support does offer a solution in these circumstances .
All you have to do is register for a new Gamertag , essentially wiping out your entire history as a customer of the company and starting from scratch .
In an attempt to be helpful , they cheerfully suggest using one of the free month - long introductory accounts that come with every 360 purchased -- if any are still available on your console .
The potential implications of such a policy are staggering .
When Microsoft first introduced the Gamertag system with the launch of Live , it was marketed as your identity on the service .
It has become , through the advent of Achievements , a personal gaming history .
For those of us who have a passion for this hobby , it 's a window into not only our accomplishments but a reflection of who we are as gamers .
Every game you have ever played on your 360 , for good or ill , is reflected in your Gamertag .
As if it were not bad enough to lose all of that , consider the purchase history , which is also gone .
Every XBLA game , DLC item and Marketplace video you have ever downloaded is suddenly at risk .
That shiny , new Gamertag will never be able to replace them if they are lost , and the potentially hundreds of dollars spent on these items will also become lost in the ether .
To put things into a larger , societal context , Microsoft has promised us a product that is intended to last forever .
But situations like this merely demonstrate that even in a digital landscape where information will conceivably be stored for eternity , we are still expected to follow the consumer - based economic credo of disposable goods when something breaks .
If it is n't working , we should happily run out and buy a new one .
This sort of situation should be unacceptable to everyone involved , especially Microsoft .
Here is a consumer who is ready and willing to hand them money for their services , but cannot because the system is engineered in a way that prevents them from doing so .
That 's just bad business .
A discovery of microscopic diamonds a few feet beneath the surface of North America reveals that a comet caused a cataclysm of fire , flood and devastation nearly 13,000 years ago that extinguished mammoths and mastodons and dealt a blow to early civilization , scientists said Friday .
The nanodiamonds , so small that they are barely visible in an electron microscope , are thought to be remnants of that comet , which would have hit about 65 million years after the much larger collision that wiped out the dinosaurs .
According to the theory -- which has its critics -- as the comet broke apart , it rained fire over the entire continent , igniting the plains and the forests and creating choking clouds of smoke .
Heat from the explosions and the massive fires melted substantial portions of the Laurentide glacier in Canada , sending waves of water down the Mississippi and into the Gulf of Mexico .
That triggered changes in Atlantic Ocean currents , which ushered in a 1,300 - year ice age known as the Younger Dryas .

Battered by fire and ice , as many as 35 species of mammals , including American camels , the short - faced bear , the giant beaver , the dire wolf and the American lion , either immediately vanished or were so depleted in number that humans hunted them to extinction .
The humans , a Paleo - Indian grouping known as the Clovis culture for the distinctive spear points they employed , suffered a major population drop , disappearing in many areas for hundreds of years .
The researchers -- including James P. Kennett of UC Santa Barbara and Douglas J. Kennett of the University of Oregon -- had earlier discovered the thin layer of black soil containing iridium and other debris that they thought indicated a massive comet or meteor impact .
But critics suggested a variety of less dire explanations .
The discovery of the nanodiamonds , however , reported Friday in the journal Science , provides the most powerful support for the comet theory because the gems can only be created under the extreme temperatures and pressures of a massive explosion , such as a comet striking the Earth ’s surface .

“ There ’s no other way we can interpret the presence of these diamonds other than an extraterrestrial impact , ” said James Kennett , a paleooceanographer .
Such an impact would be the most likely source of nanodiamonds , critics agreed .
But many argued that the one - page paper in Science did not provide enough evidence to support the authors ’ claim .
“ Nanodiamonds could be a good indicator of an impact event . . . but after reading the paper , I was n’t convinced they found diamonds , ” said physicist Tyrone Daulton of Washington University in St. Louis .
“ Maybe they found diamonds and maybe they did n’t . ”
Spectroscopist Peter Buseck of Arizona State University said that he “ would n’t question that they saw nanodiamonds , ” but added that for such a potentially important discovery , he “ would like to have it well supported . ”

Archaeologist Douglas Kennett , lead author of the report and James Kennett ’s son , conceded that the restrictive format of the rapid publication limited the amount of data the team could incorporate into their paper .
But he said the presence of nanodiamonds had been confirmed in three separate laboratories .
“ There are going to be a lot of follow - up papers that will clearly demonstrate that these are diamonds , ” he said .
The findings may tie together a variety of hitherto mysterious events in North America that all occurred beginning about 12,900 years ago , the beginning of the Younger Dryas -- also known as the Big Freeze .
The Kennetts and their colleagues reported last year that they had found the black layer , radiocarbon - dated to 12,900 years ago , at 10 archaeological sites scattered around the continent .

In addition to charred remains from forests and other flora , the black mat contains iridium , carbon spherules and fullerenes containing helium - 3 , all characteristic of an extraterrestrial impact .
But critics said the evidence was insufficient to prove an impact , particularly in the absence of a demonstrable crater .
James Kennett and his colleagues went back to the mats they had collected and performed what he termed the “ extremely labor - intensive ” process of looking for the nanodiamonds .
That involved using acids to dissolve everything else in the samples , then using a variety of techniques to identify the diamond residue .
They found a family of at least five different forms of diamonds , including some that are formed only by impacts , they reported in the Science paper .
Moreover , the nanodiamonds were found only at the bottom of the black mat -- not in the soil either below or above it .
Advertisement
Such diamonds have previously been found in the thin layer of soil that marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and Tertiary eras of Earth ’s history 65 million years ago , when the dinosaurs disappeared in the aftermath of what is widely believed to have been a meteorite impact .
In a series of papers presented last month at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco , the team also reported that at least 15 of the 35 species that became extinct during the Younger Dryas disappeared within 100 years of the event .
Their fossils appear “ right up to the base of the black mat and never go above it , ” James Kennett said .
The other species may have been hunted to extinction by humans , as has often been speculated , but only after their numbers were greatly reduced by the fires and climate change .
Advertisement
There was also a “ major population crash ” of humans , he added :
In the Great Plains , all traces of humans disappeared for about 200 years .
Southern California was even more severely affected , with evidence of human occupation disappearing for most of the Younger Dryas .
James Kennett is convinced there was a cometary impact .
“ I ’ve counted up 15 major things that occurred at 12,900 years ago , ” he said .
“ I ’d like somebody to explain that to me in some other way . ”

Orwell 's 2009 - United States Big Brother is Watching
war is peace
freedom is slavery
ignorance is strength
“ All political thinking for years past has been vitiated in the same way .
People can foresee the future only when it coincides with their own wishes , and the most grossly obvious facts can be ignored when they are unwelcome .
Political language ... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable , and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . ”
George Orwell
George Orwell wrote his legendary novel 1984 just after World War II .
It is renowned for its portrayal of government 's encroachment on the rights of the individual .
It was Orwell 's warning against totalitarianism , specifically Stalin's Soviet Union .
Pervasive thought control and surveillance of citizens is prominent throughout the novel .
After living through the last eight years under the Bush administration and observing the marketing effort of the coming stimulus plan by the Obama team , the U.S. has moved closer than ever to Orwell 's nightmare world .
In the novel , The Party maintained control of Oceania by manipulating facts , history , and citizens to retain power and dominate the masses .
In the United States of today we theoretically have two major parties , Democrats and Republicans .
In reality , we have one Party made up of the wealthy elite ruling class backed by enormous corporate interests and protected by the military industrial complex .
There are no major differences between Republicans and Democrats , just minor meaningless variations .
They are both under the control of the fascist corporate oligopoly that runs this country .
Representative Ron Paul explains how The Party is able to maintain control in today 's world :
“ Pretending that a true difference exists between the two major candidates is a charade of great proportion .
Many who help to perpetuate this myth are frequently unaware of what they are doing and believe that significant differences actually do exist .
Indeed , on small points there is the appearance of a difference .
The real issues , however , are buried in a barrage of miscellaneous nonsense and endless pontifications by robotic pundits hired to perpetuate the myth of a campaign of substance .
Influential forces , the media , the government , the privileged corporations and moneyed interests see to it that both party 's candidates are acceptable , regardless of the outcome , since they will still be in charge .
It 's been that way for a long time .
The two parties and their candidates have no real disagreements on foreign policy , monetary policy , privacy issues , or the welfare state .
They both are willing to abuse the Rule of Law and ignore constitutional restraint on Executive Powers .
Neither major party champions free markets and private - property ownership .
Those candidates who represent actual change or disagreement with the status quo are held in check by the two major parties in power , making it very difficult to compete in the pretend democratic process .
This is done by making it difficult for third - party candidates to get on the ballots , enter into the debates , raise money , avoid being marginalized , or get fair or actual coverage . ”
Government has progressively acquired more power over the lives of Americans .
They have done it subtly for decades but it has accelerated at warp speed in the last eight years .
Since 9/11 , Americans have seen their liberties taken away on a scale reminiscent of the McCarthy years during the 1950s .
In the last year , government has taken advantage of this financial crisis to step into the breach and gained complete control over our banking system and auto industry .
They are choosing the winners and losers in our society .
They have chosen to save their rich ruling elite brethren who made billions by taking excessive criminal risk , and throw the middle class under the bus .
The average American does not see the insidious method that The Party has used to gain overwhelming power over their lives .
The U.S. government has used chaos , fear , and exaggeration to expand their control .
The method used to gain control is simple .
Government creates a problem , fans the flames to make the problem appear to be extremely dangerous , and then provide a solution that only government can implement .
The Government now spends $ 2.9 trillion per year , or 20 % of GDP .
With the proposed stimulus , government spending could breach 30 % of GDP .
In 1929 , Government spending accounted for only 9 % of GDP .
In 2000 , when President Bush ascended to power , spending on National Defense was 3.8 % of GDP .
Today it is 4.8 % , having risen by 79 % since 2000 .
In 1940 , prior to WW II , National Defense accounted for 2.5 % of GDP .
TRUTH GOVERNMENT PROPAGANDA

Source : CBO
By 2011 , 30 % of all the spending in our country will be done by BIG GOVERNMENT .
When the costs of Homeland Security , veteran 's benefits , interest on the debt related to military spending , spending on NASA and nuclear arms are included , National Defense accounts for 54 % of Government spending .
The Military Industrial Complex is calling the shots when it comes to how government operates .
A question everyone needs to ask themselves :
Is it worth the loss of liberties and rights to allow the government to control and protect you ?
Control of Information and History
Who controls the past controls the future .
Who controls the present controls the past .
Party slogan 1984
The complete lack of interest or care about American history by the vast majority of citizens , allows them to be misled by the State .
The past is portrayed as being worse than today .
The public is easily manipulated by the propaganda put out by the government and trumpeted by Big Media .
As the Democrats make their misleading case for a $ 1 TRILLION pork filled stimulus package , they are telling the American public that FDR's New Deal spending in the 1930s worked to pull the country out of the Great Depression .
That is a bold faced lie .
The GDP of the U.S. was $ 104 billion in 1929 .
It did not exceed that level until 1941 as spending on National Defense jumped by 500 % .
Unemployment was still 19 % in 1938 , years after the New Deal programs had been instituted .
Economists Lowell E. Gallaway and Richard K. Vedder argue that the " Great Depression was very significantly prolonged in both its duration and its magnitude by the impact of New Deal programs .
Without Social Security , work relief , unemployment insurance , mandatory minimum wages , and without special government - granted privileges for labor unions , business would have hired more workers and the unemployment rate during the New Deal years would have been 6.7 % instead of 17.2 % . ”
If the American public was not being misled , they would see that the next decade will be a government induced nightmare .
The Bush administration led by Dick Cheney , have been masters of manipulating the masses through lies , deception and half truths .
I can easily envision Dick Cheney speaking the O'Brien dialogue from 1984 .
There will be no curiosity , no enjoyment of the process of life .
All competing pleasures will be destroyed .
But always — do not forget this , Winston — always there will be the intoxication of power , constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler .
Always , at every moment , there will be the thrill of victory , the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless .
If you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face ... forever .
In the 1980s the United States provided Sadaam Hussein with the weapons and funding to fight a war with our mortal enemy , Iran .
We provided Osama Bin Laden with weapons to defeat our other mortal enemy , the Soviet Union .
We enabled these maniacs to gain power and prestige in the Muslim world .
By the 1990 's these two were our sworn enemies .
The vast majority of Americans have no idea that we supplied these men with weapons and financial support , which ultimately led to thousands of American deaths .
Alliances and enemies are interchangeable in the America of today , very much like Oceania in Orwell 's 1984 .
Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia .
In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines .
Actually , as Winston well knew , it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia .
But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which HE happened to remember .
Officially the change of partners had never happened .
Oceania was at war with Eurasia : therefore Oceania had ALWAYS been at war with Eurasia .
The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil , and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible .
Everything faded into mist .
The past was erased , the erasure was forgotten , the lie became truth Jackie Jura – www.orwelltoday.com
The U.S. government controls the flow of information that is used to stage - manage public opinion .
Every statistic is massaged in a way to reflect the most positive view of the world .
The gullible public and clueless Wall Street professionals accept these statistics with no questions asked .
Government has learned that they can make bad news seem like a victory if they 've built expectations for worse news .
The Bush administration a few years ago forecasted a budget deficit of $ 400 billion and broke out champagne bottles when it finished at $ 300 billion .
Only government bureaucrats could celebrate such a disastrous result .
The Party attempts to keep the public in the dark , but the Resistance exists to shed light on their lies .
Economist John Williams has been uncovering the government manipulation of facts and revealing the truth for many years .

The government reports an unemployment rate of 7.2 % to the public .
This figure does not include discouraged workers or marginally attached workers .
A discouraged worker is one who is willing , able and ready to work but has given up looking because there are no jobs to be had .
This level is currently 13.8 % .
During the Clinton administration , The Party decided that if you were discouraged for more than a year , you no longer counted .
If these people are included , the current unemployment rate is 17.8 % .
This is a comparable figure to the 25 % rate from the Great Depression .
If you use the non-seasonally adjusted change in employment figures , the U.S. lost 2.8 million jobs in 2008 .
In this figure is a made up number that is supposed to account for the number of jobs gained or lost by small business .
This birth / death model adjustment added 904,000 phantom jobs in 2008 .
This is an insult to the intelligence of all thinking Americans .
Luckily for the government , there are very few thinking Americans who care about such things .
Reality is that small businesses probably lost 1 million jobs , which would make the true loss 4 to 5 million jobs .
The Party will report the true numbers two years from now in a footnote after the market closes on a Friday .

If the price of hamburger rose , I 'm sure a government robot would theorize that we would substitute with dog food .
Further hedonistic “ adjustments ” were introduced to reduce reported inflation .
Based on the methodology used in 1980 , our current “ deflationary ” environment has led to a drop from 13 % to 9 % .
Ask yourself whether your true everyday costs are up 1 % or 9 % in the last year .
When using the real inflation figures , you realize that we have been in a recession since 2000 .
This explains why the majority of Americans have fallen behind in the last eight years .
The median household income was $ 50,557 in 2000 .
Using the government CPI adjusted figure for 2007 , median household income had fallen to $ 50,233 .
If you used real inflation , the figure would be in the range of $ 47,000 .
Trickle down has n't worked as advertised .
Only the rich ruling elite surged ahead .
The criminals on Wall Street partied like it was 1999 , while the middle class fell further into oblivion .
Now that the rich are losing their shirts in the market , we have a REAL crisis .
All the government information manipulators are working around the clock to spin the story in a way that will ensure permanent government control of our economy and our lives .

Psychological Manipulation - Freedom is Slavery , War is Peace
Party Slogan 1984
The concept of doublethink as described in Orwell 's 1984 is being used effectively by The Party in our current totalitarian state :
The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one 's mind simultaneously , and accepting both of them .... To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them , to forget any fact that has become inconvenient , and then , when it becomes necessary again , to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed , to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies — all this is indispensably necessary .
Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink .
For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality ; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge ; and so on indefinitely , with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth .
The Bush administration has used doublethink almost exclusively since 9/11 .
In both foreign affairs and the economy they have told deliberate lies , while ignoring inconvenient facts , in order to create an artificial reality .
Karl Rove understood what journalist Walter Lippman noted in 1922 about the average American :
“ Elites can manufacture consent because the average American is like a deaf spectator in the back row at a sporting event :
He does not know what is happening , why it is happening , what ought to happen . ”
The Bush / Cheney / Rove propaganda machine that convinced the majority of Americans to support a pre-emptive war against Iraq spun , scores of lies using partial facts and ignoring any fact that did not fit into their reality .
Satellite pictures of mobile biological weapons labs , listening to informants ( Curveball ) that provided information they wanted to hear , ignoring information that did n't fit , and creating fantasy meetings between 9/11 hijackers and Iraqi agents were all spun to keep the lie one step ahead of the truth .
Orwell was clearly speaking about people like Dick Cheney and Karl Rove when he wrote these words :
“ All the war - propaganda , all the screaming and lies and hatred , comes invariably from people who are not fighting . ”
When Joe Wilson exposed the Bush administration lies about Iraq trying to obtain materials to build nuclear bomb from Africa , his wife was revealed as a CIA agent by Karl Rove and Dick Cheney as retribution for interfering with their reality .
Only in the doublethink world created by Karl Rove could a man get shot three times , win three Purple Hearts and a Silver Star fighting in Vietnam , like John Kerry , and be declared a coward and traitor .
In the meantime , his presidential opponent was protecting the skies of Texas during the Vietnam War .
Other examples of doublethink are as follows :
Fighting for Peace – You can not fight for peace .
You fight to kill .
George Carlin once said “ Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity ” .
Fighting , or any form of conflict , is the very thing that stands in the way of peace .
Fighting is the opposite of peace .
This is reminiscent of the Ministry of Peace , which conducts perpetual war .
The Iraq war was n't about democracy , it was about oil .
Orwell knew the reality of war .
“ War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed classes think they are going to profit from it . ”
Pre - Emptive War –
This concept is a warped rationale for attacking an opponent before they attack you .
The Bush / Rove propaganda machine provided visions of mushroom clouds and weapons of mass destruction as their reason for attacking a country that had no nuclear or mass destruction weapons .
Orwell described war in 1948 :
“ Every war when it comes , or before it comes , is represented not as a war but as an act of self - defense against a homicidal maniac . ”
The Iraq War was sold as an act of self defense against Sadaam Hussein .
Peace - Keeping Forces -
Peace keeping forces are those troops left in a country to help enforce a particular regime .
The very fact that a military presence is required would suggest that there is no peace there to ' keep ' .
The U.S. soldiers that will be left in Iraq for eternity will be called peace keepers , as civil war simmers and bombs explode daily .

Department of Defense - The Department of Defense bears striking resemblance to Orwell 's ' Ministry of Peace ' not only in the classic use of doublethink in the name but also in its actions .
Both are primarily concerned with warfare and seem to spend the majority of their time and efforts dealing in attack and invasion as opposed to the implied defense or peace .
Another country has not attacked the U.S. since 1941 , but we have invaded other countries seven times since then .

War on Terror –
The definition of war according to Webster 's is a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations .
President Bush 's war on terror is an open ended war against no nation or state in particular .
It can never be won or lost .
It is just a justification for never ending expenditures and restrictions on civil liberties .
Orwell described the effect of nationalism :
“ The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side , but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them . ”
The war on terror concept allows Dick Cheney to think it is fine to torture prisoners and not give them a fair trial while spending years in Guantanamo .
Don Rumsfeld thought it was OK to abuse prisoners at Abu Ghraib , until someone took a few pictures and ruined his party .
The following quotes from Mr. Rumsfeld show his level of remorse :
“ We 're functioning in a — with peacetime restraints , with legal requirements in a wartime situation , in the information age , where people are running around with digital cameras and taking these unbelievable photographs and then passing them off , against the law , to the media , to our surprise , when they had not even arrived in the Pentagon . ”
“ What has been charged so far is abuse , which I believe technically is different from torture .
I 'm not going to address the ' torture ' word . ”
He is more concerned with people breaking the law with cameras then about the torture being inflicted upon prisoners .
Sacrificing Rights to Insure Freedom -
This is the most dangerous aspect of doublethink in our society today .
With Orwellian surveillance like listening in on private conversations and acts such as ' The Patriot Act ' , we are being forced to give up the very freedoms that ' The War on Terror ' is alleged to protect , all in the name of freedom .

With Orwellian surveillance like listening in on private conversations and acts such as ' The Patriot Act ' , we are being forced to give up the very freedoms that ' The War on Terror ' is alleged to protect , all in the name of freedom .
Affirmative Action –
This is the concept of discriminating against white people or men in an attempt to end discrimination .
The best person for a job is not chosen because a quota for minorities must be met .
This is to justify the years of discrimination against minorities and women .
A new era of discrimination will surely solve a past era of discrimination .
Orwell explains who could go along with such doublethink :
“ There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them . ”
Corporations , government and educational institutions have instituted this reverse discrimination policy to relieve their perceived guilt for past offenses .
Language as Thought Control
“ In our age there is no such thing as ' keeping out of politics . '
All issues are political issues , and politics itself is a mass of lies , evasions , folly , hatred and schizophrenia . ”
If George Orwell thought politics were like that in the 1940's , imagine what his thoughts would be if he were alive today .
With 17,000 lobbyists , hundreds of PACs , thousands of PR leeches , and thousands of sleazy lawyers running Washington DC , orchestrating the actions of 550 elected officials , the game of politics has never been at such a low point .
The best job in Washington is at the Ministry of Slogans & Acronyms .
The use of acronyms fits into the Orwellian concept of Newspeak , “ the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year . ”
The aim of The Party is make thoughtcrime or speech impossible by removing any words or possible constructs which describe the ideas of freedom or rebellion .
The dumbing down of concepts before they are sold to the American public is how this is accomplished today .
Shock and Awe – This was the Don Rumsfeld marketing phrase for the initial stage of the Iraq Invasion .
The U.S. military launched 1,700 air attacks , including 504 cruise missiles on March 21 , 2003 .
The U.S. military insisted that the strikes were surgical and we did everything to avoid civilian casualties .
Reports of casualties ranged from 3,000 to 6,000 .
We inflicted devastation on par with 9/11 on innocent Muslim citizens .
This was U.S. terrorism disguised as self defense .
The U.S. military refers to this as collateral damage .
USA Patriot Act - Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 .
It is beyond comprehension that people in our government spend their time creating acronyms that disguise the fact that they are taking away civil liberties .
These people must work in the Ministry of Truth , the masters of propaganda .
The definition of Patriot according to Webster 's is , one who loves his or her country and supports its authority and interests .
By naming it the Patriot Act , anyone that voiced dissent , did n't love their country and was cast as a traitor .
This act was rammed through Congress on October 26 , 2001 , only forty - five days after the 9/11 attack .
Senators and Congressmen did not even read the law before passing it .
The Party now has legal authority without a court order to wiretap your phone , read your emails , listen to cell phone conversations , search your mail , search your financial records , search your medical records , detain anyone who they suspect may commit terrorism , and indefinitely detain you based on secret evidence .
Terror Threat Levels –
The threat levels are used by government officials to manipulate the public through the use of fear .
The local law enforcement authorities have no idea what they are supposed to do when the level is changed .
The public has no idea what the colors mean .
The threat level was raised shortly before the 2004 Presidential election .
No one ever explains why the level is raised or lowered .
Operation Iraqi Freedom – The Party always has a catchy patriotic slogan for the invasion of other countries .
The “ facts ” sold to the gullible American public was that we needed to attack Iraq because they had Weapons of Mass Destruction that would eventually be used on American cities .
False links to 9/11 and fake stories about nuclear weapons from Africa were the immediate reasons .
Freedom and Democracy were not part of the equation .
Only after we found no WMD did the invasion purpose become freeing Iraqis from the tyranny of Sadaam Hussein .
If this was the real reason , then we should be invading North Korea , Russia , China and 50 other dictatorships throughout the world .
Community Reinvestment Act – This should be named the U.S. Taxpayer Gets Screwed Act .
This law forced banks to make mortgage loans to poor people who should have been renting .
This is another Democratic Party welfare state boondoggle .
Bob McTeer , president of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank from 1991 to 2004 , described the pressure on banks :
“ There was a lot of pressure from Congress and generally everywhere to make homeownership affordable for poor and low - income people .
Some mortgages were made that would not have ordinarily been made .
When a bank made a decision to purchase mortgaged - backed securities , they would somehow determine if some of them were in zip codes covered by the CRA , and therefore they could get CRA credit . ”
The result was subprime losses in the billions being foisted onto the backs of American taxpayers who made their mortgage payments .
People who received these loans do n't pay taxes .
Death Tax – A deliberate and carefully crafted word designed by the Republican Party in order to gain support for repealing the estate tax .
Repealing the estate tax had no support among the American public .
Manipulating the name of the tax generated support for repeal .
Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 –
This brilliant piece of legislation signed in July 2008 was designed to instill confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and keep subprime borrowers in their homes .
It did n't help housing or the economy recover .
It just poured more money down a rat hole .
Fannie & Freddie collapsed under the weight of their incompetence and billions of losses in September 2008 .
They continue to make bad loans to undeserving borrowers , but now the losses flow directly to you and I , the American taxpayer .
Government Accountability –
If this is n't the biggest oxymoron in history , I do n't know what is .
The Party has a tremendous interest in making sure that no one knows where our tax dollars are spent and whether they were spent wisely .
A company has a bottom line and can calculate a return on the investments they make .
No one can calculate a return on anything Government does .
If every government project was listed on - line and citizens could see what was spent and for what purpose , the bureaucracy would come crashing down .
Therefore ,
The Party will never allow light to be shone upon their deeds .
Department of Homeland Security -
Its stated goal is to prepare for , prevent , and respond to domestic emergencies , particularly terrorism .
This department most resembles Orwell 's Ministry of Love , the agency responsible for the identification , monitoring , arrest and torture of dissidents , real or imagined .
We are n't too far off from being monitored by telescreens .
This department was created after 9/11 .
Its biggest claim to fame is the response to Hurricane Katrina , when 1,836 Americans died .
Mismanagement , incompetence , lack of preparation , and slow response were the traits best exhibited by this agency that spends $ 50 billion per year and employs 208,000 bureaucrats .
The department was blamed for up to $ 2 billion of waste and fraud after audits by the GAO revealed widespread misuse of government credit cards by DHS employees , with purchases including beer brewing kits , $ 70,000 of plastic dog booties that were later deemed unusable , boats purchased at double the retail price ( many of which later could not be found ) , and iPods ostensibly for use in " data storage " .
It is pure luck that we have not experienced another terrorist attack .
It is not due to the actions of this agency .
Troubled Asset Relief Program – This is also known as TARP or the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 .
It 's lucky they put a date at the end , so we can have another in 2009 and another in 2010 .
A better name would be WARP - Worthless Asset Reprieve Program .
This catchy little acronym described assets as if they had a bad day at the office .
I 'm troubled by the bullshit that keeps being rammed down my throat by politicians and bankers .
Assets are n't troubled .
The “ assets ” on the books of the biggest banks in the world are worthless .
They are fictitious pieces of paper backed by nothing .
This $ 700 billion bad banker bailout was supposed to buy these assets from the banks and allow the banks to lend .
Henry Paulson lied to Congress and used the first $ 350 billion to buy preferred stock in the banks .
It has been a miserable failure .
The second $ 350 billion will be thrown at these same banks and nothing will happen .
No one knows how the money is being spent and Bank of America and Citicorp are on the brink again .
The U.S. banking system is insolvent and is being propped up by the American taxpayer .
Stable Prices –
It seems the politicians running The Party these days like to pick and choose what they want from John Maynard Keynes .
They prefer the goodies of increased government spending and ignore the other advice :
“ The best way to destroy the capitalist system is to debauch the currency .
By a continuing process of inflation , governments can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens . ”
One of the key mandates of the Federal Reserve is price stability .
This is a lie .
The facts are that the Federal Reserve purposefully generates unending inflation which slowly lowers the standard of living of every American .
The US dollar has lost 95 % of its purchasing power since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created by a Congress in the back pockets of bankers .
Foreclosure Mitigation – Barney Frank is demanding that the 2nd $ 350 billion of TARP funds be used for this purpose .
It is a noble goal to reduce foreclosures .
I 'm sure Mr. Frank is a noble man .
What this really means is that he would like to take your tax dollars and give them to people who bought houses with mortgages they could not afford .
Rather than being properly kicked out of the house , you will make their mortgage payment for them , along with your own monthly mortgage payment .
That is what mitigation means .
Quantitative Easing –
This is a luminous term that 98 % of Americans do n't understand .
It sounds so soothing .
When Ben Bernanke uses the term in his speeches you can imagine blue birds singing on his shoulder .
What it means is that the Federal Reserve will print as many dollars as it takes to generate inflation so that the country 's enormous debt burden can be inflated away .
Instead of one helicopter , picture thousands of B - 52s dropping dollars over NYC .
Japan tried the same thing in the 1990s with absolutely no success .
Ben 's motto is , when you earnestly believe you can compensate for a lack of skill by doubling your efforts , there 's no end to what you can't do .
Economic Recovery Program – This is Barrack Obama 's first contribution to Newspeak .
His shrewd economic team did n't like the sound of stimulus program .
It sounded too much like Bush 's rebate checks , which did n't work .
Of course , one of the key elements of this plan is a $ 500 rebate per person .
The term investment is used quite often in this plan .
Investment in infrastructure , education , green initiatives , and energy are the backbone of the plan .
Ask yourself why we have 156,000 structurally deficient bridges , crumbling water pipes , antiquated power grid , urban decay , and dangerous schools .
It is because we have relied on the Government to be responsible for these things with taxes we have already paid .
Now we are supposed to support a program with future tax dollars to do what Government should have done in the first place .
When you are stuck in a traffic jam next year and see six union construction workers standing on the side of the road all making $ 50 an hour watching one guy with a jack hammer working , know that your tax dollars have been spent wisely .
Love Big Brother or Make a Stand Now
In the end , Winston Smith , the rebel in Orwell 's 1984 , is brought to Room 101 and O'Brien threatens to let rats chew his face off if he does n't pledge his love for Big Brother .
He cracks and learns to Love Big Brother .
We are nearing a point of no return in this country .
Government is acquiring more power and the citizens are losing their liberty and freedom .
We can either learn to love it or make a stand against it now .
Ayn Rand in her book Atlas Shrugged describes how we have slowly transformed our country into Orwell 's Oceania :
" Politicians invariably respond to crises -- that in most cases they themselves created -- by spawning new government programs , laws and regulations .
These , in turn , generate more havoc and poverty , which inspires the politicians to create more programs . . . and the downward spiral repeats itself until the productive sectors of the economy collapse under the collective weight of taxes and other burdens imposed in the name of fairness , equality and do - goodism . "
Orwell lived during a time of unadulterated evil , with madmen like Hitler and Stalin using the Big Lie and military brutality to keep their populations under their jackboot .
Orwell saw a bleak future :
“ The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world .
Lies will pass into history .
During times of universal deceit , telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act . ”
We are living in times of universal deceit .
Your government is lying to you , the media is lying to you , organized religion is lying to you and corporations are lying to you .
Most Americans are oblivious to the lies or simply do n't care .
If you believe that bigger government will solve our troubles , borrowing more money will solve the quandary of too much debt , giving your tax dollars to the worst run banks and corporations is good policy , letting government choose the winners and losers in banking , autos , and energy is a good scheme , debasing the currency is a fine idea and allowing government agencies to monitor your conversations and emails makes you safer , then learn to Love Big Brother .
I , on the other hand , will not sit idly by while this country goes into permanent decline .
I prefer liberty , freedom of speech , freedom of thought , free markets , and freedom to live my life as I wish .
Government is too big , too powerful , and too regulating .
New regulation is the current mantra from the Democrats .
We had plenty of regulations .
Government is just not capable of enforcing the laws that already exist .
More laws will not make government more competent .
Much of what I write , people do not want to hear .
Orwell understood what liberty meant .
“ If liberty means anything at all , it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear . ”
I 'm angry with what has been going on in this country for the last eight years .
I believe there are millions of other frustrated angry Americans who are tired of having this country dominated by crooked politicians in the back pocket of corporate fascists from the Defense Industry , Financial Industry , and Healthcare Industry .
Only a few people within Government are as angry and ready to fight for liberty .
Ron Paul is able to channel that anger :
“ The issue boils down to this : do we care about freedom ?
Do we care about responsibility and accountability ?
Do we care that our government and media have been bought and paid for ?
Do we care that average Americans are being looted in order to subsidize the fattest of cats on Wall Street and in government ?
Do we care ?
When the chips are down , will we stand up and fight , even if it means standing up against every stripe of fashionable opinion in politics and the media ?
Times like these have a way of telling us what kind of a people we are , and what kind of country we shall be . ”
Together we stand , divided we fail .
Get involved with organizations that tell the truth about our economic and political crisis .
David Walker , Ross Perot and Ron Paul are those people .

The only thing that reassures me is that everyone has a breaking point .
And much as I abhor guns , it is likely that the US government will find it much harder to subjugate the American people than the British .
28 Feb 09 , 19:11 US Evil ?
Oh gee , an article from the UK about the US doing something wrong .
I 'll pass .
Typical Anglo bull shit about the US , that is n't sourced , but that 's ok , because the target audience does n't need sources to know the US is evil .

In the past , we 've joked about how with pretty much every security breach , there 's an initial estimate of the damage done , followed much later by a second report that admits the breach impacted many more people .
It happened with the VA .
It happened with Choicepoint .
And , it happened with TJX , who raised the bar on being the worst security breach ever not once , but twice to impact nearly 94 million people .
Who could top that ?
Step up to bat , Heartland Payment Systems .
Chris writes in to point out that Heartland appears to have picked a pretty good day to announce a security breach that may impact over 100 million people .
Everyone 's off paying attention to the inauguration , so they might miss the news as it comes out today -- but they 're likely to hear about it soon enough .
It appears that Heartland 's own computers were infected with malware which passed on information about transactions to some scammers .
Heartland is now claiming that this really is n' tbig a deal , because personal information was n't included in the breach -- meaning the data was useful for creating new cards with bogus data , but not useful for " card not present " transactions such as internet transactions or creating fake cards of real people .
Because of this , Heartland does n't think that it should need to offer credit monitoring services to impacted users , which has become the somewhat standard penance for those caught leaking credit card info .
Of course , some are already questioning the timing of announcing the breach .
Considering they figured out what happened a week ago , it does seem a bit of interesting timing to wait until the inauguration was underway to disclose this information .
Still , given the history of so many earlier breaches turning out to be much worse later on , what 's the over - under on the next announcement about how much worse this breach actually was ?

The first test of an unmanned Ares I could take place next summer .
The test , however , will use a spacecraft that is very different from the Ares I to come .
It will involve a solid rocket booster of the same length that the shuttle uses , and the second stage and capsule will be dummies .
Four more test flights are scheduled before the rocket is used beginning in 2015 .
The Ares V is a much brawnier rocket designed to send equipment to the Moon and beyond .
Its first stage includes two solid rocket boosters and a liquid - fueled set of six rocket engines .
The design process has run into technical problems .
Orion is far heavier than the Apollo capsule and weight issues have required redesigns of both the capsule and the rocket , further complicating technical issues .
Engineers have also had to come up with ways to dampen potentially dangerous vibrations along the shaft of the rocket as the solid rocket engine empties .
Some inside the development program have complained that it is run with a my - way - or - the - highway attitude that stifles dissent and innovation .
Jeffrey Finckenor , an engineer who left NASA this year , sent a goodbye letter to colleagues that expressed his frustrations with the program .
“ At the highest levels of the agency , there seems to be a belief that you can mandate reality , ” he wrote , “ followed by a refusal to accept any information that runs counter to that mandate . ”
The letter was posted to the independent NASA Watch Web site .
Mr. Finckenor has refused to comment further .
Leroy Chiao , a retired astronaut who flew three shuttle missions and served aboard the space station , said that the 2004 announcement by Mr. Bush of NASA ’s new direction “ was a time of great optimism . ”
Mr. Chiao is not involved with the Constellation project today , but he said it was clear from some of the leaked discussions that “ the program has not panned out as I , and the vast majority of people , had hoped . ”
Sunny Assessments
NASA officials say the Constellation program is actually coming along well .
In an interview in November , Mr. Griffin said , “ I ca n’t imagine somebody thinks you ’re going to develop a new space transportation system and encounter no challenges . ”
The ones NASA is encountering , he said , are “ routine in the extreme . ”
Douglas R. Cooke , a leading space agency official on the Constellation program , told reporters this month that the weight and vibration issues were well on their way to being fixed .
And Neil Otte , the launching chief engineer for the Constellation rockets , said that solving tough problems was what engineers did for a living .
When they encounter a particularly difficult challenge , he said , their attitude is , “ Hey , it ’s starting to get fun now , and we ’re earning our money . ”

[ Transcript is in the video and at the link . ]
Rick Warren has called for a second Christian Reformation , and he has stated his intent of inspiring ' one billion '
Christians , half of all Christians globally , to become personally and ' radically ' committed to changing the world .
... Warren described a global Christian movement to bring the message of Jesus Christ to every man , woman and child on Earth .
" It 's going to cover the planet , " he proclaimed , " and then the end is going to come . "
Calling for " total mobilization of this church " and " radical devotion " to the cause , Pastor Warren sketched out his vision , which he declared was from God , of a " revolution " , launched through Warren 's " Purpose Driven " network of hundreds of thousands as pastors globally , to create a Christian world regime .
Though Warren 's speech was in the idiom of Christianity , he did not seek to inspire his Saddleback audience with examples of great religious leaders who have changed history through persuasion or other nonviolent approaches .
Rick Warren looked to 20th century exemplars of vision and dedication but not to Mohatma Gandhi , Martin Luther King , or any other religious leaders .
... [ P]astor Warren described how in 1939 in a packed Munich Stadium before the leader of the Third Reich , young brown - shirted men and women spelled out in formation , with their bodies , words in German which read " Hitler , we are yours . "
" And they nearly took the world , " pastor Rick told the stadium crowd .
So , let 's see .
Rick Warren is not only virulently anti-gay anti-choice , and misogynist , and murderous , he also believes that Christians should follow Jesus like people followed Hitler , Lenin , and Mao , doing " whatever it takes " to " cover the planet " with Christianity to bring the Rapture : Awesome choice , Obama .
Early symptoms of pregnancy - nausea , cramps , tender boobs , mood swings - are a drag .
All - natural home remedies that are safe for an embryo are pretty much useless .
Especially when you 've scheduled an abortion .

Try Googling any of these symptoms , and you 'll find a bunch of websites that begin with something like " Congratulations .
You are on a journey of a lifetime … " or " Some symptoms of early pregnancy can be unpleasant , almost to the point of dampening the joy of your good news … "
And good luck trying to find any advice on how to deal with some of the more annoying and uncomfortable symptoms , that actually interfere with your day - to - day life , that do n't involve vitamins , saltines , water , and " lots of rest . "
All of the information of alleviation puts the well being of the fetus first and the mother second .
But what about the women who have no intentions of seeing a pregnancy to term ?
What about the women who could barely find time in their calendars to schedule their abortions , who have to face grueling workdays until their appointments under conditions that would prompt any man to take a sick day ?
There is very little information out there for the many women in this predicament , because frankly , nobody cares about them .
Despite their individual situations , they 're collectively seen as irresponsible , selfish , and undeserving of the kind of help that would make their lives a little easier for the days or weeks they have to wait to terminate the pregnancy .
Some women might even feel a little guilty or ashamed to seek such relief .
Abortion is an option , not an obligation to quietly suffer .

As far as sucky symptoms of unwanted pregnancies go , what 's the harm in throwing the bathwater out with the baby ?
Here is a guide to treating them , that no doctor would probably ever recommend .*
Cramping
Cause :
This is most likely happening because of implantation , when the egg is attaching itself to the uterus , or because the uterus is preparing itself for the long haul by growing .
It feels like bad menstrual cramps .
Cure : Take a Midol .
All it really is is ibuprofen and some caffeine anyway .
The instructions merely say to consult a doctor before taking , if you are pregnant , but it wo n't cause a miscarriage .
If it did , then abortion pill manufacturers would be out of business and back alley abortionists would 've hung up their wire hangers long ago .
If you have anything harder like Vicodin around the house , pop some of those .
But then , who are you ?
Nicole Richie ?
Cramps suck and all , but over - the - counter stuff should do the trick .
But then , who are we to deny you a good time with your dolls ?
If you 're not that into pharmies , weed also helps , too .

Fatigue
Cause : Changing hormone levels and low blood sugar .
Cure :
If you 're lucky , Adderall .
If you 're not , then drink some coffee .
Lots of it .
Make like you 're Julia Roberts in Steel Magnolias and eat candy or drink juice .
And take naps if you can .
Now is the time to cut yourself some slack .
If you know who the father is , and he 's still hanging around , guilt him into doing shit for you , like your dishes or your laundry or your grocery shopping so you can catch a few Zzzs .
Because what 's he doing in all this , other than footing half the abortion bill ( hopefully ) ?
As Homer Simpson says , " It 's not uteri , it 's uterus . "
Nausea
Cause : Back in the dark ages , before there were women doctors , " morning sickness " was thought to be psychological .
It 's not .
People still do n't know exactly what causes it , but it most likely has something to do with rapidly rising levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) .
It affects 50 % - 90 % of pregnant women .
And " morning sickness " is a misnomer .
It can happen at any given time of the day , and for some unlucky ladies , it 's constant .
It 's the worst of all the symptoms , as it's invasive , inconvenient , and miserable .
Doctors will suggest these stupid bracelet things for acupressure , ginger , saltines , and cold compresses .
Cure :
What you do n't want to do is go anywhere near your spice cabinet , old takeout in your fridge , or rest your head on your BF 's shoulder .
Your changing hormone levels will give you a heightened sensitivity to aromas , and that will make you wanna ralph .
Also , do n't try to force a puke .
It 's not like being drunk , in which puking will make you feel better .
You 'll just feel like you have to puke more right after , and your throat will hurt .
Pregnancy - related nausea operates a lot like motion sickness .
So take some Dramamine .
Get some food in your stomach .
It sucks , but saltines , are indeed , your friend in this situation .
Marijuana is also known to eliminate nausea and will help rebuild an appetite .
Word to the wise :
Do n't take a massive bong hit that will make you cough deeply , because then you 'll just hurl .
Also , make sure that you 're head is in the right space , because if you 're freaking out about this pregnancy thing , you 're totally only going to fan the flames of your anxiety when you light up .

Breast Tenderness
Cause :
The increase in hormones causes blood to rush to your breast , causing swelling and soreness .
Sometimes they 're just sore to the touch , but other times , they even hurt when their just kind of moving around , like if you 're getting dressed , or exercising or walking quickly without a bra on .
Cure :
You can try different bras , do " breathing exercises , " or try temperature treatments with hot or cold compresses , but you should probably just cut the crap and take some kind of pain med , over - the - counter or otherwise .
Mood Swings / Irritability
Cause : Jerkass hormones again , and also , you 're going through some shit right now .
Cure :
Whatever , ride the highs and then be a bitch when you feel like it .
If necessary , avoid people who are remotely annoying .
And if you get sad , blow off trivial responsibilities ( like going to the gym , or mopping , or running errands ) and just do what you feel like doing .
Idiots are always basing women 's behavior on hormones no matter what , so this is your get - out - of - jail - free card .
Kinda like how you do n't have to use birth control for the time being .
Live it up , because those - along with breast swelling , for some women - are the only " pros " to this pregnancy compared to a much longer list of " cons . "

* We are NOT doctors .
If you do anything on this list and , then have a change of heart about terminating the pregnancy , do n't blame us if the baby has low birth weight or flippers .
The Early Signs Of Pregnancy [ Women 's Health ]
Simon Cowell is Back on the Market
" Terri phoned Simon and finished it in September , about six weeks ago .
They are going to remain close friends .
Simon thinks the world of Terri and that is n't going to change .
He also understands her reasons for ending it . "
Outspoken American Idol judge ( 48 ) and girlfriend of six years ( 34 ) have ended their relationship .
Cowell 's rep confirmed the much speculated gossip to People magazine .
So that 's grand - not only does Simon 's rep , let the world know that his client was dumped , he added that there were not any other people involved in the split " certainly not on Simon 's side . "
Seymour and Simon met when she was 18 but did not get involved until after an interview she conducted with him in 2002 .
Never one to shy away from telling it like it is , he spoke openly to the press about the fact that he was not interested in marriage or having children and in the end Terri wants to have children .

The past usually finds a way of catching up with us .
Could Britain 's colonial sins pose a risk to our relationship with the soon - to - be most powerful person on Earth ?
According to the Times , Barack Obama 's grandfather was imprisoned and tortured by the British during Kenya 's Mau Mau uprising .
The claim is spread across three pages of the newspaper and illustrated with black and white photographs of detention camps operated by British soldiers in the 1950s .
Hussein Onyango Obama , the president - elect 's paternal grandfather , had served with the British army in Burma during the second world war and later found work back in Kenya as a military cook .
Like many army veterans , he returned to Africa hoping to win greater freedoms .
But his aspirations soon turned to resentment of the occupying British .
He became involved in the Mau Mau independence movement and was arrested as early as 1949 , probably on charges of membership of a banned organisation .
During two years ' detention he was subjected to horrific violence , according to the story 's authors , Ben Macintyre and Paul Orengoh .
Tortures inflicted on Kenyan prisoners sometimes involved such barbaric implements as " castration pliers " .
" The African warders were instructed by the white soldiers to whip him every morning and evening till he confessed , " Sarah Onyango , 87 , tells the Times .
The behaviour of British soldiers is the subject of continuing legal action in the UK courts from victims seeking reparations for torture and mistreatment suffered more than 50 years ago .
The Kenyan Human Rights Commission is still gathering evidence .
The alleged torture of Onyango reportedly left him permanently scarred and bitterly anti-British .
Barack Obama 's memoirs , the paper observes , show that he too is no admirer of British colonialism .
Obama 's family connection to the Mau Mau was already known – some US commentators have even used the label to smear him as a " Mau Mau insurgent " .
Obama , with more pressing contemporary problems on his plate , is unlikely to be fixated on extracting revenge from the UK .
But he may draw the broader historical conclusion that the imposition of torture and repressive violence has a habit of undermining the political legitimacy of world - class powers .
He has already signalled his determination to close the Guantanamo Bay detention centre and speed up withdrawal from Iraq .
We will have to wait and see whether his grandfather 's experience has a bearing on his policies on Afghanistan and international terrorism .
Dentist sues over negative
Yelp review ' I do n't want these lies to be posted on the Web site '
A pediatric dentist in Foster City has sued two people over negative comments about her practice that were posted on the review site Yelp , accusing them of libel .
The suit , filed in December in Santa Clara County Superior Court , asks for damages because of the posting , which complained about how Yvonne Wong treated a boy who visited her with cavities .
" I do n't want these lies to be posted on the Web site about me , " Wong said in an interview .
" I 'm not looking for money . "
Wong said she had no choice but to also sue Yelp because the company refused to take the review down .
In the posting , the author , " T.J. , " complained that the boy was " light headed " after a filling because Wong gave him laughing gas , and that she used fillings containing mercury .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Wong 's attorney , John Terbeek of San Leandro , said the boy 's parents should have known about the mercury because they signed a consent form disclosing it .
Terbeek said he probably will dismiss the charges against Yelp because he was n't aware when he filed the suit that Web sites publishing third - party content are protected under U.S. law .
But Wong 's case stands against Tai Jing and Jia Ma of Los Altos , the boy 's parents .
They could not be reached for comment .
This is the second lawsuit to emerge over negative reviews on Yelp , a popular Web site with headquarters in San Francisco .
On Friday , a San Francisco chiropractor , Steven Biegel , settled a libel case he had filed against a former patient , Christopher Norberg , after Norberg posted a review complaining about Biegel 's billing practices .
Details of the settlement are confidential .
Norberg replaced his post on Biegel 's Yelp page with an apology that reads , " A misunderstanding between both parties led us to act out of hand .
I chose to ignore Dr. Biegel 's initial request to discuss my posting .
In hindsight , I should have remained open to his concerns .
Both Dr. Biegel and I strongly believe in a person 's right to express their opinions in a public forum . "
The apology is also posted at standforspeech.com , a Web site Norberg had created to raise funds for his defense .
Both men declined to discuss the case other than to say it has been settled to their mutual satisfaction .
" This is an issue I want to put behind me , " Biegel said .
Despite Wong 's case , Yelp continues to stand by reviewers ' rights to post negative reviews about businesses .
Yelp does not allow businesses to publicly respond to reviews , although business owners can contact reviewers privately .
Wong said it never occurred to her to contact the boy 's parents .
" I would be very upset and would not know what to say to them , " she said .
No Yelp user has ever been successfully sued , according to Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman , who posted a blog entry about Biegel 's case last week .
" Personally , I 'm glad we live in a country where freedom of expression is so well protected , " he wrote .
T.J. has since taken down all but one sentence of the review , although Wong 's low one - star rating remains on Yelp .
The full review also still turns up in a search on Google , as does Norberg 's negative review of Biegel .
Norberg 's lawyer , Michael Blacksburg , predicts more cases .
" Yelp and other bulletin board sites ... need to think about how to protect the reviewer and reviewee from flame wars or potentially libelous statements , " he said .
" How do we culturally train our public to responsibly publish online ? "
" If children are in a home in which they are getting insufficient stimulation , where there is not enough interaction , or where communication through the spoken word is not as common or extensive or imaginative as it might be , that is bound to have an impact , " he told the Daily Mail .
The Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) says there is no evidence that proves Tehran is edging towards developing nuclear weapons .
Departing CIA Director Michael Hayden said Thursday that the Islamic Republic ’s production of low - enriched uranium does not necessarily substantiate an Iranian objective to build atomic weaponry .
He said that even if the country does gain the capability to create highly enriched uranium , still there is no “ clear proof ” that Iran will use the material to fuel a nuclear warhead .
Washington accuses Tehran of developing a nuclear military program .
Iran , a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , insists its program is poised for the civilian applications of the technology .
This is while UN nuclear watchdog Director General Mohamed ElBaradei disputed Western claims and ruled out suggestions that the Iranian nuclear program should be considered hostile .
“ They [ Iranians ] , as I just recently mentioned still do n’t even have the nuclear material , the low - enriched uranium , to develop one nuclear weapon , ” he said in an address to the London City Hall .
“ But even if they decide to walk out tomorrow from the Non-Proliferation Treaty - and you go into a lot of scenarios - it is not that we are going to see Iran tomorrow having nuclear weapons .
” The International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which has extensively monitored Iran ’s nuclear work since 2003 , said in its latest report that it could not find any ‘ components of a nuclear weapon ’ or ‘ related nuclear physics studies ’ in the country .

The international body that advises most major governments across the world on energy policy is obstructing a global switch to renewable power because of its ties to the oil , gas and nuclear sectors , a group of politicians and scientists claims today .
The experts , from the Energy Watch group , say the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) publishes misleading data on renewables , and that it has consistently underestimated the amount of electricity generated by wind power in its advice to governments .
They say the IEA shows " ignorance and contempt " towards wind energy , while promoting oil , coal and nuclear as " irreplaceable " technologies .
In a report to be published today , the Energy Watch experts say wind - power capacity has rocketed since the early 90s and that if current trends continue , wind and solar power - generation combined are on track to match conventional generation by 2025 .
Rudolf Rechsteiner , a member of the Swiss parliament who sits on its energy and environment committee , and wrote today 's report , said the IEA suffered from " institutional blindness " on renewable energy .
He said : " They are delaying the change to a renewable world .
They continue touting nuclear and carbon - capture - and - storage , classical central solutions , instead of a more neutral approach , which would favour new solutions . "
Today 's report compares past predictions about the growth of wind power , made by the IEA and others , with the capacity of wind turbines actually installed .
It says : " By comparing historic forecasts on wind power with reality , we find that all official forecasts were much too low . "
In 1998 , the IEA predicted that global wind electricity generation would total 47.4GW by 2020 .
This figure was reached in December 2004 , the report says .
In 2002 , the IEA revised its estimate to 104GW wind by 2020 – a capacity that had been exceeded by last summer .
In 2007 , net additions of wind power across the world were more than four - fold the average IEA estimate from its 1995 - 2004 predictions , the report says .
" The IEA numbers were neither empirically nor theoretically based , " it says .
The IEA 's most recent forecast , in its 2008 World Energy Outlook , predicts a fivefold increase in wind energy from 2006 - 2015 , but then assumes a rapid slowdown in deployment over the following decade .
The Energy Watch report calls this a " virtual stagnation " and says " no arguments are given why the wind sector should suffer such a crisis by 2015 and after " .
The report concludes : " The IEA outlook remains attached to oil , gas , coal and nuclear , and renewables seem to have no chance to reverse this trend .
This organisation … has been deploying misleading data on renewables for many years [ and is still doing so ] . "
It adds : " One has to ask if the ignorance and contempt of IEA toward wind power and renewables in general is done within a structure of intent . "
Mr Rechsteiner , who says he has investments in a handful of wind turbines , said the IEA routinely drew senior staff from the fossil - fuel industry .
" The oil business is very skilful in keeping its energy access exclusive , " he says .
The IEA describes itself as an " intergovernmental organisation which acts as energy policy advisor to 28 member countries in their effort to ensure reliable , affordable and clean energy for their citizens " .
It refused to comment on today 's report .
The Energy Watch group is run by the Ludwig Bölkow Foundation in Germany .
John Hemming , the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley and a member of the Energy Watch group , said : " The IEA has been complacent , and part of the conventional wisdom that the solution is more oil and gas .
The British government relies on the IEA .
In the land of the blind , the one - eyed man is king — but the IEA 's one eye has a cataract . "
Today 's report says the number of wind turbines installed over the last decade has grown by 30 % annually , and total windpower capacity is more than 90GW – the equivalent of 90 conventional coal or nuclear power stations .
It adds that the boom in wind energy is " so far barely touched by any sign of recession or financial crisis " .
If current trends continue , the report claims wind capacity could reach 7,500GW by 2025 – making half of all new power projects wind or solar .
Conventional power stations could be phased out completely by 2037 , it claims .
Werner Zittel of the Energy Watch group , said : " It is time to realise that the many detractors of wind energy have got it wrong .
We have seen more than 10 years of unprecedented growth in this sector …
This is not about morals or environment but the commercial reality that wind , coupled with hydro , solar , biomass and geothermal energy is not only a rapid and cost - effective alternative , but one that could deliver all our energy requirements within the first half of the century . "
Participation in Cabal / Hackage development
All , I just mentioned ideas for Cabal 2 but I should also like to talk about how we can go about increasing participation in the development effort .
We currently have nearly 200 open tickets which include many important bugs and no shortage of good ideas for useful new features .
Our limiting factor is developer time .
Most of us use the Cabal / Hackage system in one way or another .
Most of us are familiar with its annoyances and limitations .
Unfortunately the number of people helping out has dropped rather in the past year or so .
Perhaps we should run a little poll like the darcs hackers did to find out what we could do to increase participation so we can get on with building the tools that we all want , but a bit more quickly .

Link of the day - Talent Is Overrated : What Really Separates World - Class Performers from Everybody Else
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) – Indonesian photographer Ilham Anas wo n't be at U.S. President Barack Obama 's inauguration on Tuesday .
Instead he 'll be starring as an Obama look - alike on Indonesian TV .
Anas , 34 , who from some angles bears a resemblance to the new U.S. president , shot to fame in Jakarta after Obama , 47 , won the election in November , and is now earning income as an Obama double .
Many Indonesians have a keen interest in Obama , who lived in Jakarta for four years after his American mother , Ann Dunham , married Muslim Indonesian Lolo Soetoro following the end of her marriage to Obama 's Kenyan father .
" When Obama won , my colleagues played a practical joke on me -- they made me wear a suit , a tie , and took pictures of me posing as Obama , " Anas told Reuters on Saturday .
" The pictures spread very quickly on the Internet .
It was phenomenal .
Then TV stations and an advertising agency got in touch with me . "
That led to an appearance in a pharmaceuticals advertisement in the Philippines where he played Obama , who is due to be sworn in as the 44th U.S. president on Tuesday .
Anas , who was born and raised in Bandung , West Java , said he feels lucky to resemble Obama .
" I never thought I would be a star in a commercial , then this happened .
It 's very fortunate , " Anas said .
" I was in the airport in Malaysia in transit and a man approached me and asked : ' Are you Obama ? ' .
I was very surprised when he asked to take a picture together and bought me a meal , " said Anas , flashing a broad smile .
If he ever gets the chance to meet Obama , Anas said he would ask the U.S. president to take a firm stance in dealing with the conflict between Israel and Palestine .

The Israeli offensive into Gaza continues with devastating effects for Palestinians across the Gaza Strip .
Say what you will , but the military strategy that has marked Israel ’s “ Operation Cast Lead ” clearly only hurts Gaza ’s civilian population .
With much of the water supply and sewage system dependent on electricity , and the impact on hospitals and limited supplies , the damage to civilian infrastructure raises serious medical concerns and unmasks this campaign of collective punishment of the Palestinian people — a predictable and uncreative display of Israeli military might over and against 1.5 million poor Palestinians .
These are actions clearly in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention , to which Israel is a signatory .
And with more than a thousand Palestinians killed and the death toll rising , thousands wounded , Gaza ’s children severely traumatized , and Gaza ’s population without reliable electricity , the obvious disproportionality of the Israeli military response to rocket attacks on southern Israel only underscores its unacceptability .
Overall , US complicity has never been more evident .
The words of the President and Secretary of State , it can be argued , at the least have directly contributed to this recent campaign through its silent legitimization of this violence .
Indeed , the US abstention from the recent UN Security Council call for an immediate ceasefire is interpreted by many as tacit approval , the silent “ wink across the room ” serving as the needed go - ahead for Israel to continue this offensive .
The power of language — which includes silence — reveals itself in this situation .
And all attempts at minimization with the language of “ proportionality ” are examples of hiding this complicity .
With our own occupation in Iraq , with our pouring of billion of US dollars into the Israeli military complex each year , whatever words of “ proportionality ” or “ restraint ” that are coming from the US at this time are sadly misplaced .
Instead an assertion is made that the response must be proportional to the “ threat , ” and that dead bodies and burning cities are not indicators of ethical or moral standards .
“ Threat , ” a category unquantifiable and therefore subject to a calculus dictated by those making the assertion .
Let us keep in mind that the people of Gaza have been living as prisoners in what is essentially the world ’s largest open - air jail .
The Palestinian people have had no control over movement in and out of Gaza , no control over borders ( land , sea , or air ) , no open access to vital services and viable economic opportunity with a poverty rate reaching 80 percent , and have lived constantly under the threat of Israeli military incursions , shelling , and “ targeted assassinations ” that leave entire Palestinian families murdered in the streets .
As the occupying power , Israel has certain obligations under international law in regards to the Palestinian people .
Israel has completely shirked this responsibility and left the burden of responding to the needs of one of the most densely populated areas on earth — the great majority of whom being refugees — to the international community , creating a situation that does not provide the opportunity for a prosperous future but only just prevents Gaza from slipping into humanitarian disaster on a daily basis , let alone during times like these .
In this context , the language of proportionality too easily serves the purpose of hiding these realities and obfuscating overarching power dynamics .
It is hard not to conclude that its purpose is to paint this situation as balanced , without a clear power differential , and with the US as neutral , an “ honest broker ” for peace .
“ Proportionality ” seems to reveal a critical weakness of the “ just war ” tradition as it is or is not applied in situations of conflict or the response of the international community to those situations .
According to this ethical tradition , war is “ just ” and “ justified ” if it meets certain criteria , among them the criterion of proportionality .
In reflecting on the justice of resorting to the use of violent force in the first place , jus ad bellum , the criterion of proportionality is met by concluding that the overall destruction expected from the use of force will be outweighed by the good to be achieved .
Concerning the justice of conduct within war itself , jus in bello , proportionality means that the force used must be proportional to the wrong endured , the ends sought , and to the possible good that may come .
The more disproportional the number of “ collateral ” civilian deaths , for example , the more suspect will be the sincerity of a belligerent nation ’s claim to justness of a war it initiated , which is why weapons of mass destruction are usually seen as being out of proportion to legitimate military ends .
Now there are several other criteria and considerations when engaging this tradition , but proportionality is an essential piece that , in contexts of severe power imbalance , must be examined seriously , beyond the rhetoric of political means and ends , which only cheapens whatever ethical resources we have to appeal to in the first place .
But then again , who among the powers is engaging in ethical reflection right now , besides those who seek to appropriate ethical language as a legitimizing tool ( i.e. “ proportional to the threat ” ) ?
Yet , the manner in which the language of “ proportionality ” is employed often carries with it the assumptions of “ neutrality ” and a “ distanced objectivity . ”
Words that at least in this context , and perhaps it can be argued in most contexts , are at best inadequate and inappropriate but most often downright disingenuous and dangerous .
The continued employment of such language seems to reveal the weakness and inadequacy of this “ just ” tradition as it is typically exploited .
In a land of walls , checkpoints , land confiscation , and colonization — where Israeli military incursion occur on a daily basis , terrorizing an entire society , where Palestinians are randomly dragged away to add to the over 10,000 Palestinian men , women , and children sitting in Israeli jails , and where every response to Israeli aggression is labeled “ terrorist ” by those who control and employ such ahistorical and decontextualized language and calculate “ proportionality ” according to their own interests , the language of “ proportionality ” immediately dehumanizes , denying the value of human life .
It too often becomes the language of violence and oppression .
At a time when so many are seeking to live in a world that is defined with a deeper , richer definition of peace , we should at least seek to be consistent with the moral and ethical formation of our language and our own actions .

A Holyoke man could be the first person in Massachusetts cited for possession of marijuana , an action that lost its criminal status Friday because voters approved a decriminalization referendum in November .
However , 29 - year - old Jose Burgos could still face prison time on charges of trafficking cocaine and possession of a Class A substance with intent to distribute .
Springfield police said they found 0.2 grams of marijuana in Burgos 's pocket during his booking .
He was arrested Friday by the city 's vice control unit , which alleges that Burgos had 119 crack cocaine rocks and 45 bags of heroin in his car .
Burgos is being held on $ 50,000 bail and is scheduled be arraigned tomorrow in Springfield District Court .
Law enforcement officials said yesterday that most arrests for possession of marijuana are made in conjunction with other drug seizures .
" You rarely see people getting arrested for under an ounce of marijuana .
Usually it was a wiseguy or it was an arrest leading to something else , " said Sergeant Sean Sweeney of the Barnstable Police Department .
No one in Barnstable had been issued a citation for marijuana possession as of midday yesterday , Sweeney said .
Yesterday , the Globe contacted police departments across the state , inquiring about marijuana citations .
Only Springfield reported issuing a ticket .
A spokesman for the Boston Police Department said he was unable to determine whether any citations had been issued .
Some law enforcement officials told the Globe on Friday that they would probably not ticket offenders because the law is so poorly written it is difficult to enforce .
Other police departments said that while the law has changed , enforcement will not .
" It 'll be business as usual , just a different way of taking care of it , " said Officer Todd Neale of the Athol Police Department .
Sergeant Richard Perry of the Bellingham Police Department said officers expect to issue tickets for possession , but have not worked out the logistics .
" I can tell you that they 're working on how we would fine the person , " Perry said .
" So right now it would be pretty much the way most departments are handling it :
We 'd confiscate [ the marijuana ] and identify the person and send them on their way . "
Under the marijuana decriminalization law , offenders who are caught with an ounce or less of marijuana get a ticket for a civil violation , but are not criminally charged .
Juveniles have to pay the $ 100 fine and attend a drug abuse counseling course , or the fine will be increased to $ 1,000 .
A spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project , a Washington , D.C. - based organization that rallied support for the ballot initiative known as Question 2 , said yesterday that he had not heard of any marijuana possession citations being issued .
Bruce Merkin predicted that the drug culture in Massachusetts would not change significantly .
In the 11 states that had already decriminalized marijuana , rates of use are about the same , " Merkin said .
" It 's not something that people think about every day , even people who use marijuana regularly .
It 's just not as big a deal as some of the district attorneys are making it out to be . "

6 Reasons to Stay On the Electric Grid
January 23rd , 2009 by Sarah Lozanova
Imagine using only the energy from the sun to power your home .
You would never have to pay an electric bill again and or be impacted by power outages .
It may sound great , but there are numerous advantages to having a solar home that is on - the - grid when available .
The Electric Company Pays for Solar Energy
What is better than having no electric bill ?
Having an electric meter that spins backwards .
Most states have net metering laws requiring the electric company to purchase excess electricity generated from your solar system .
The details vary by state , but many companies are required to pay the retail rate for the energy .
Oversized Solar System
Off - the - grid solar systems must be sized for the worst case scenario , unless they use a backup generator .
Cloudy weather and snowy solar panels have to be taken into account .
The result is a solar system that is oversized for typical daily use , thus increasing the upfront cost of the system .
Batteries Increase Cost and Maintenance
To have electricity at night and in cloudy weather , batteries are required .
As the name implies , lead acid batteries can be hazardous .
It is crucial that they are recycled when no longer useful .
Luckily , lead acid batteries have an extremely high recyling rate .
Batteries also increase the upfront cost of the solar system , require regular maintenance , occupy storage space , require the system to have extra components ( a charge controller ) , and typically need to be replaced every 5 to 10 years .
Batteries Cause Efficiency Loss Up to 15 %
A glass placed on the bottom of a sink under a faucet acts very similarly to a battery on a solar system .
When empty , most of the water makes its way inside .
Once it is nearly full , much of the water splashes out .
When it is completely full , nothing else can fit .
Some energy is wasted when the batteries are full .
If the house were on - the - grid , the excess energy would have been consumed by a neighbor .
DC Appliances
Batteries and the solar system work with DC electricity .
Most of our electronic gadgets run off AC current .
To avoid purchasing an inverter to convert to AC and experience the minor efficiency losses , many folks who are off - the - grid will use only DC appliances .
This certainly limits the available appliances , although these appliances tend to be far more efficient .
Lifestyle Change
Having an off - the - grid solar system makes people far more aware of their energy use .
This can be seen as both a good and a bad thing .
For example , under certain weather conditions you may not be able to watch television or charge your cell phone .
There certainly are instances when it is best to be off - the - grid , but the majority of us are not in the situation .
I have a solar system and find great satisfaction in seeing a credit on my electric bill .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Amid the depressing news of layoffs and company shutdowns , comes this surprising bit of uplift -- our region is a stalwart when it comes to the number of corporate headquarters .
Team NEO , the region 's business - attraction group , reports today that the 16 - county region is fourth among the nation 's largest metropolitan areas in its share of people working at business headquarters .
In 2006 , 41,000 people worked at corporate and division headquarters from Youngstown to Lorain , including 18,500 in Cuyahoga County , data showed .
As a percent of the total work force , headquarters employment in Northeast Ohio ranked higher than Boston , Chicago and Atlanta , Team NEO 's research showed .
BY THE NUMBERS
Northeast Ohio has lots of corporate headquarters .
Here 's the Top 10 .
1. St. Louis
2. New York
3. San Francisco
4. Northeast Ohio
5. Detroit
6. Boston
7. Philadelphia
8. Chicago
9. Atlanta
10 . Seattle
Northeast Ohio has 22 headquarters that are from Fortune 1000 companies .
Here is the list :
Goodyear Tire & Rubber
Progressive
Eaton
FirstEnergy
Parker Hannifin
Sherwin- Williams
KeyCorp
Timken
Aleris International
Lubrizol
Nacco Industries
RPM International
Diebold
PolyOne
Ferro
Medical Mutual of Ohio
Cleveland - Cliffs
Lincoln Electric Holdings
American Greetings
Applied Ind. Technologies
Jo Ann Stores
Schulman ( A. )

" People who are managing business is a particular strength here , " says Tom Waltermire , Team NEO 's chief executive .
The numbers are no surprise to Ned Hill , the interim dean of Cleveland State University 's urban affairs college .
Hill , an influential economist , has been telling people for years that the density of business headquarters here is an economic driver .
From 2000 to 2006 , an industrial sector formally known as " management of companies and enterprises " saw a 5.7 percent annual growth in jobs , according to Hill 's research .
That sector 's gross domestic output totaled $ 4.4 billion across 16 counties in 2006 , research showed .
Hill knows the numbers do n't seem right .
For years , the region has been rocked by the departure of landmark headquarters , from the likes of British Petroleum in 1998 to National City Bank last month .
The bank is now subordinate to PNC Bank headquarters in Pittsburgh .
But the loss of corporate titans obscures the fact that headquarters large and small are plentiful here , Hill said .
Team NEO 's research showed 541 headquarters in 2006 , employing an average 70 - plus people per site .
" We tend to measure ourselves on the big icons that are n't here , " Waltermire said .
" You need to consider all the others that are just below the radar screen . "
The region has 22 Fortune 1000 companies headquartered here , TeamNEO noted .
And the number of chief executives , accountants and general managers in the region is well above the national average , another indicator of headquarters activity , Team NEO reported .
The large number of headquarters results from the region 's historic strength and diversity in manufacturing , Hill said .
A number of the headquarters are privately owned , small - to mid-sized companies whose operations have gone national or global , Hill said .
Others were acquired by larger companies and became branch headquarters , he said .
Headquarters remain here , or are attracted to Northeast Ohio , for a number of reasons , including our heartland location and affordable cost of living compared to the East and West coasts , officials said .
Too , the region is rich in businesses that support corporate headquarters , including banks , law firms and accounting firms .
Team NEO brandishes the bounty of headquarters when it sells the region to business prospects like GCA Services Group , Inc. and its chief executive Robert Norton .
Norton and his board decided 1 ½ years ago to move the company headquarters from suburban Philadelphia to downtown Cleveland .
GCA is a large , facilities - maintenance company , employing 30,000 people who clean schools and companies in 38 states .
Sales last year approached $ 500 million , said Norton .
GCA liked Ohio as the " center of the country " and saw prospects in a state where it had few accounts , Norton said .
The company is saving hundreds of thousands of dollars on its lease in the US Bank Centre on Euclid Avenue , compared to the Philadelphia site , Norton said .
GCA employs about 40 in its headquarters .
The buzz - cut , Harley Davidson - loving Norton had inside knowledge before he came .
The headquarters is a few blocks west of Cleveland State University , where Norton graduated in 1973 .
He grew up in Stow .
" My heart is here , " said Norton .
" It 's been good for us so far . "

According to Sondra she was told to wear a sweater to games and was lectured about her clothing choices .
" Ca n't you come to the stadium dressed like a regular person ? " she was asked .
" I guess some ladies got jealous and complained , " Sondra figures .

John had a few laughs at the expense of the Tennessee GOP earlier today .
Who ’s laughing now ?
XXXX :
We ’ve had several missions for the RedState Army of Activists .
You probably have n’t noticed as we ’ve primarily directed them to individual states .
This should be one for an individual state , but we need to take this nationwide and make it a national rebuke .
Meet Kent Williams .
He is allegedly a Republican in Tennessee .
The GOP took the State House in Tennessee and rallied to one of their own to be Speaker .
Williams had other plans .
He made a deal with the Democrats , betrayed the Republicans , and got himself elected Speaker .
He then put a Democrat in the number two spot .
On opening day of the legislature the outgoing Democrat Speaker of the House stood behind Williams whispering directions in his ears .
It ’s clear he ’s a weak mind and will be putty in the hands of the Democrats .
Here ’s the assignment :
Kent Williams ’ address is XXX , XXX XXX XXXX ( redaction mine , not Erickson ’s of course )
Go here and send Kent Williams some silly putty .
Let ’s put in his hands a pretty accurate representation of what he is .

Children are among injured civilians in the north Aid agencies in Sri Lanka say they have evacuated hundreds of civilians wounded in fighting between troops and Tamil Tiger rebels .
The UN and the Red Cross ( ICRC ) say they have escorted the injured to a hospital in the town of Vavuniya .
The Sri Lankan military says it is continuing its advance into rebel - held territory in the north - west .
A BBC correspondent in the north says artillery fire can still be heard from the front line .
See map of the region International agencies say hundreds of civilians have been killed in the fighting and a quarter of a million more are trapped .
They say further convoys must be permitted .
Sri Lanka 's defence secretary , Gotabaya Rajapakse , told the BBC that the numbers are exaggerated , there are no civilian casualties and aid agencies are panicking .
Deaths A UN convoy , which was trapped in the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu , succeeded in its second attempt in three days to evacuated the critically wounded civilians .
UN spokesman Gordon Weiss said the convoy had taken hundreds of civilians wounded by the fighting , including 50 critically wounded children , to hospital in Vavuniya .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Mr Weiss said that other civilians were waiting to be evacuated but he was unclear exactly how many .
He rejected the Sri Lankan government view that there was no humanitarian crisis in the north .
" Our staff witnessed the deaths and injuries of dozens of people over the weekend , " he said .
" There are a quarter of a million who are imperilled because they have been forced into a pocket of territory about a third the size of London . "
Later , the ICRC said that it had escorted 226 sick and wounded patients requiring urgent medical treatment from the north to Vavuniya Hospital .
Local journalists in the town are not being allowed to talk to anyone who has been evacuated from rebel - held areas .
The pro-rebel TamilNet website quoted a rebel spokesman , S Puleedevan , denying reports that the rebels had initially prevented the ICRC convoy from leaving .
INSURGENCY TIMELINE 1976 : Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam form in the north - east 1987 : India deploys peace - keepers to Tamil areas but they leave in 1990 2002 : Government and rebels agree ceasefire 2006 : Heavy fighting resumes 2009 : Army takes main rebel bases of Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu
S Lanka army in ghost ' Tiger ' town Rebel weaponry rendered useless Voices from Sri Lanka Mr Puleedevan described the reports as " mischievous " .
" In fact , we have been repeatedly urging the ICRC to facilitate the unhindered transportation of injured civilians who need urgent attention and also for the provision of medical facilities locally , " he said .
In the latest fighting , the army says that it has captured a key crossroads in the north .
Military spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara said that troops had taken the Vishwamadu junction on Wednesday afternoon after heavy fighting .
The junction , near the village of Vishwamadu , lies along one of the few major roads remaining in rebel - held territory .
' No ceasefire '
The BBC's Ethirajan Anbarasan - who was taken by the army to a town just north of the former rebel administrative centre at Kilinochchi - said he passed abandoned fields and villages on his way to the war zone .
Our correspondent says senior army officials there say they have inflicted heavy damage on the Tigers .
They also say they have captured one of the rebels ' boat yards in which they found a small submarine and two unfinished submarines .
The defence ministry also said that the three " suicide boats " and a large haul of rebel maritime equipment were also discovered .
There has been no independent confirmation of the claims and no word from the rebels .
The military has released pictures of captured rebel submarines Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) have expressed concern over the plight of civilians and have blamed both the government and the rebels .
On Wednesday Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapakse denied that the fighting had led to a humanitarian crisis in the north .
He also ruled out any ceasefire for humanitarian reasons , saying it would give the Tigers a chance to reorganise .
" The purpose of this offensive is to eradicate them , " he said .
The military say they are involved in a final push against the retreating rebels .
Moving north from the captured rebel town of Mullaitivu , they are trying to secure the north - east coastline to encircle the rebels and say they hope to control the entire north within weeks .

After years of filming , months of hype and a multi-million - dollar budget blow - out , the much - anticipated film Australia finally opened today , 48 hours after director Baz Luhrmann put the finishing touches to it .
The world premiere in Sydney stopped traffic , with one of the city ’s main streets closed to accommodate thousands of invited guests and onlookers .
But even as the stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman trod the red carpet , critics were sinking their teeth into Australia ’s most expensive and ambitious film on record .
The Melbourne Age called it an “ overlong melodramatic saga ” with “ the pace of a steamroller with engine trouble ” .
The newspaper lambasted Luhrmann for his eagerness “ to trowel on the Aussie cliches ” , and noted , of the film ’s rugged backdrop , that “ there are only so many wide shots of the Aussie outback that the human mind can stand ” .

In fairness , the epic Second World War romance and adventure story was never going to live up to absurdly elevated expectations .
Heralded as a cinematic sensation on the scale of Crocodile Dundee , the £ 88 m film was supposed to rescue the country ’s ailing film and tourism industries , and redefine the national identity .
Promoted as a cross between Gone With The Wind and Out of Africa , the three - hour film follows the fortunes of Lady Sarah Ashley ( Kidman ) , a buttoned - up English aristocrat who inherits her late husband ’s cattle station .
Falling in love with Australia ’s sweeping landscapes , and with an enigmatic stockman ( Jackman ) , she gradually unbuttons herself .
To save the ranch from a predatory cattle baron ( Bryan Brown ) , she has to drive 2,000 cattle hundreds of miles cross-country , with the help of Jackman and an Aboriginal boy , Nullah ( Brandon Walters ) .
They arrive in Darwin just in time for the city to be bombed by the Japanese .
The theme of the Stolen Generations , the mixed - race children removed from their families , also features .
With rumours flying in recent days of rows between Luhrmann and 20th Century Fox over how the movie should end ( happy or sad ) , the director and his stars finally presented themselves at a press conference this afternoon .
But controversy was avoided .
Jackman said the film had given him his greatest role to date .
Luhrmann , the director of Strictly Ballroom and Moulin Rouge , said he felt under a lot of pressure .
Kidman revealed that Australia could be her last film : she might up giving acting and have more children instead .
The actress , married to the country singer , Keith Urban , fell pregnant with their first baby , Sunday Rose , during filming .
The hype surrounding the movie reached a peak this week , with selected critics invited to a screening on Monday , but forced to sign a secrecy clause preventing them from revealing crucial plot details or passing judgement before the premiere .
But reviews began trickling out today , and not all were negative .
Melbourne ’s Herald - Sun , which – like 20th Century Fox – is part of Rupert Murdoch ’s empire , was positively gushing .
“ A love - letter to the Australian landscape and our history , Australia has international blockbuster written all over it , ” the newspaper declared , calling the film “ a compelling and moving tale which traverses war , race relations , class and the Stolen Generation ” .
With much of the movie shot in the harshly beautiful interior of Western Australia and the Northern Territory , tourism authorities are hoping it will entice more international visitors here .
Luhrmann was even commissioned to make a series of tourism advertisements , to tie in with Australia ’s release locally next week .
( It opens in Britain on Boxing Day . )
Today , fans waited for hours in the rain to catch a glimpse of Kidman , who turned up in a short , white , beaded dress , after a 24 - hour flight from Nashville , Tennessee , where she lives with Urban .
As well as Jackman , Brown and Walters , her co-stars on the red carpet included David Wenham , Jack Thompson and the veteran Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil .
Premieres were also staged in three regional centres where filming was concentrated : Darwin , Bowen in Queensland , and Kununurra , a dusty outback town in Western Australia .
This is the inauguration procession of the 25th President of the USA , William McKinley , the first sitting president to be captured on film .
This clip was filmed on March 4 , 1897 and follows the Procession down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C .
Sinatra : 29 Links and Resources For A Quicker , Easier Way to Build Webapps
By Peter Cooper
Sinatra , a Ruby " micro framework " for developing Web applications , is hot stuff !
Despite being over a year since we first mentioned Sinatra ( as used on a 100 line blogging app called Reprise ) , only now does Sinatra seem to have reached critical mass - it's on the cusp of becoming really popular .
This is a good time , then , to check it out and see where it could fit into your own projects ( with the new Rails Metal functionality ( in edge / 2.3 only ) you can ever run a Sinatra app as a lightweight companion integrated with your Rails apps ! )
Sinatra 's official homepage provides an incredible number of alluring examples .
Just install the sinatra gem or clone its git repository and you can have an ultra basic webapp running in just five lines of code :
require ' rubygems ' require ' sinatra ' get ' / ' do ' Hello world ! ' end
Lots of awesome articles about Sinatra , Sinatra apps , and various links and resources have cropped up over the past few months .
The remainder of this post links to the best we 've found - most of which you should find useful as you start to explore Sinatra in detail .
If you know of any others , please post links in the comments !
Of course , if you ultimately agree with Ross Lawley that Sinatra 's a " horrid looking ruby web framework that looks its born straight from the worst PHP frameworks " then you might also want to check out Ramaze !

Three little bobcat kittens were discovered in a tree next to the Dyess AFB Hospital in mid-August ( one of them is pictured above ) .
This story has its beginnings in the spring of 2005 when a bobcat who apparently had no natural fear of humans gave birth to two kittens in the hospital ’s courtyard , out in the open , on the sidewalk .
The mother was sedated and she and her kittens were relocated about three miles away in a secluded area on base .
When the kittens were old enough to travel the mother brought them back to live in a hollow area under the foundation of the entrance to the pharmacy .
Mothballs were used to discourage the cats ; they left ; and the entrance was plugged .
They did not return .
This year , 2006 , this same female gave birth to three kittens under a storage shed at the Outdoor Recreation Compound .
When the kittens were old enough to leave the den , she took them to her old familiar den near the hospital .
Apparently the kittens got spooked having never been that close to humans and went up the tree .
The mother was not disturbed by the people but when a crowd gathered , she withdrew .
Not wanting the kittens to loose their natural fear of humans , the decision was made to capture the young , put them in a cage to entice their mother ’s return , capture her and then relocate all to the wild far from base .
Pictures of the kittens , those involved in their capture , and how the rest of the story unfolds can be viewed here .
While this story is exciting , it also did n’t have to happen .
Because someone had probably fed the mother at some point in her life , she lost her natural fear of humans and her unnatural behavior put her kittens and herself at risk of loosing their lives .
Now , who behaved badly ?
Let ’s review the top 20 music videos of all time compiled by VH1 .
I think they got the top 20 videos right although I have to disagree with the order on the list .

Motorola Renew is World 's First Carbon Neutral Mobile Phone
January 7th , 2009 by Andrew Williams
[ social_buttons ]
Motorola has announced plans to launch the world ’s first completely carbon neutral mobile phone , at CES 2009 in Las Vegas .
The shell of the W233 Renew is made entirely of recycled water bottles , and will be available via T - Mobile within the next three months .
The struggling cell phone manufacturer has also teamed up with CarbonFund.org to offset the energy used in the manufacture , distribution and operation of each phone throughout its lifetime .
As part of the alliance , Motorola will invest in renewable energy sources and global reforestation projects .
The company also plans to print all of the phone ’s documents on post - consumer recycled paper using vegetable - based inks .
According to Jeremy Dale , corporate vice president , global marketing , Motorola Mobile Devices , “ Today , natural resources , energy and time are more precious than ever before .
From the product ’s design , to the packaging to our partnership with Carbonfund.org , we wanted to ensure that this device makes the right impact with consumers and the environment . ”
There is no news yet on a price , but Motorola have announced that the phone will be “ extremely affordable . ”
Now , if they can make one model carbon neutral , how about rolling the approach out to the entire range … ?

Sony ( SNE ) has been going through a rough patch : Sales of the PS3 are down , Bravia HDTV sales are down , and it barely sounds like CEO SIr Howard Stringer is really in control of the company .
So what 's the recovery plan ?
Sony Computer Entertainment Europe President David Reeves has an answer : Make money .
From Sony 's official Playstation site :
The most important thing for us as a company in the very short term is for us to start making money .
This is a pledge that was made last March and is something that we are still very much on target to achieve .
Once we have achieved this , I think it will be a very exciting time for PlayStation .
Let 's hope David does n't mean getting the PS3 build price ( about $ 450 and falling ) below the PS3 retail price ( $ 400 ) , because that will take a while .
For Sony to " start making money " on the PS3 over the long term , meanwhile , it needs to keep the PS3 from ending up an abandoned format -- something the expensive game console is well on its way to becoming if the company does n't quickly cut its price .
And that , unfortunately , will likely lead to more losses over the near term .

The 37 - year - old has been singled out by whistleblower Harry Markopolos as the woman who failed to detect the scam despite his lengthy warnings .
It was Cheung who signed off on a 2006 SEC investigation that effectively gave Madoff the all clear .
She said , “ I was shocked ” to learn last month that Madoff had been charged with – and confessed to – operating a massive Ponzi scheme at his Manhattan firm that swindled thousands of investors .
“ I think it ’s a tragedy , ” said the married mother of two , who is a graduate of Yale University and Fordham University Law School .
But when asked if she would have done anything differently in her Madoff probe – which ended with “ no evidence of fraud ” – she demurred .
“ I ca n’t answer that , ” said Cheung , who left the SEC in September for personal reasons unrelated to Madoff .
“ If someone provides you with the wrong set of books , I do n’t know how you find the real books . ”
“ Everyone in the New York office behaved ethically and responsibly and did as thorough an investigation as we could do , ” said Cheung .
“ I supervised some lawyers and I was supervised by many levels above me .
I ’m just mid-level management . ”
“ I had no incentive to give anyone a pass .
I had an incentive to bring cases that should be brought , especially big cases , ” she said .
“ I was not influenced , and I do n’t believe anyone in the New York office was influenced , by any other desire than to find out the truth .
. .
There is no other reason to work there for so long , except that I love what I do . ”
She added , “ No one in my office had any incentive to miss something like this . ”
Regarding Madoff specifically , Cheung said , “ I never met the man .
I had no personal connection , no financial connection , no social connection . ”
Cheung spoke outside her Flatiron District co-op after media reports detailed how the SEC failed to catch Madoff even after investigating his Manhattan broker - dealer firm at least eight times over 16 years .
Some of those reports have noted an April 2008 e-mail that Markopolos wrote another SEC exec .
“ Cheung , branch chief in New York , actually investigated [ Markopolos ’ claims ] but with no result that I am aware of .
In my conversations with her , I did not believe that she had the derivatives or mathematical background to understand the violation , ” Markopolos wrote .
Cheung said that when she read a critical New York Times piece on Sunday mentioning that e-mail , she was on a plane with her children , and that she burst into tears .
As for Markopolos ’ reference to her supposed lack of mathematical acumen , Cheung said , “ Investigations are conducted by lawyers and examiners and investigators .
We have experts available to help us . ”
Cheung and other SEC staffers had met Markopolos in New York in November 2005 , after years of him suggesting to the agency that Madoff was an arch - crook .
Markopolos once had worked at a rival firm , but Cheung told The Post , “ I did n’t have enough interactions with [ Markopolos ] to be able to judge his motivations . ”
Markopolos gave the investigators a long memo that flatly said that “ Madoff Securities is the world ’s largest Ponzi scheme . ”
Soon after , in January 2006 , the New York branch of the SEC opened an enforcement case on Madoff based on Markopolos ’ claims .
The document authorizing that probe is signed by three SEC staffers : Cheung , attorney Simona Suh , and Assistant Director Doria Bachenheimer .
But after interviewing Madoff and a principal of Fairfield Greenwich Group - his biggest hedge - fund investor – as well as reviewing documents , the SEC probe “ found no evidence of fraud , ” according to a case closing recommendation signed off by those three staffers .
The probe did find that Madoff had violated regulations by acting as an investment adviser without registering , but said he should not be disciplined because he had remedied the situation .
Philip Michael , a lawyer for Markopolos , said the failure by Cheung and the other probers to find Madoff ’s fraud suggests that “ she just did n’t understand what was going on ” even after Markopolos gave her a road map .
Brad Friedman , a lawyer for Madoff ’s victims , called the SEC ’s failure to find the fraud “ stunning . ”
“ They had every red flag in the world , ” Friedman said .
“ Even with a map and a flashlight , they could n’t find it . ”
As to why the SEC did n’t discover the fraud , Cheung said .
“ We still do n’t know exactly what happened .
We do n’t know when it started . ”
“ It ’s personally very upsetting , especially , since I am not able to respond in any substantive way .
. .
I ’m not in a position to defend myself .
I am forced to see one side of the story , ” Cheung said , referring to Markopolos ’ characterization of her .
“ He has no basis to judge what we did or did not do in any investigation because we ’re not able – as we told him at the time – we were not able to give him updates as to what we were or were not doing with his information .
And that is a strong commission policy , that we do not disclose what is happening in a confidential , non-public investigation .
And that is for the benefit of everyone . ”
“ There ’s nothing I can say about what we did in this investigation other than to say we worked as hard as we could , ” she said .
“ I was not influenced , and I do n’t believe anyone in the New York office was influenced by any other desire than to find out the truth . ”
“ With the SEC , we ’ll never have search warrant authority to knock down somebody ’s door , and search his secret records , and nobody would want to live in a world where we could do that , ” she said .
“ We conduct investigations professionally and without regard to the stature of the people .
You should be able to see that from the kind of cases that we bring . ”
Cheung adamantly denied looking the other way for future gain in the financial industry .
“ Any allegations that we were somehow swayed by the prospect of a high - paying job are ridiculous and unfair .
. ..
Allegations of impropriety and unethical behavior are so unfair and hurtful . ”
She said , “ I have never been pressured to walk away from a case by any of the career staff or division of enforcement .
I do n’t believe the New York office has ever walked away from a case based on influence or the reputation of individuals involved .
We have investigated fraud and pursued it . ”
As for her future , “ I am staying home with two kids now , ” she said .
“ I did n’t leave for a high - paying job .
My reason for leaving was purely personal .
I never interviewed for another job . ”

Utilizing an outdoor grill or camp range indoors will play out badly for you .
Not only is it a bad concept to let these burn inside , it also takes in oxygen to stay hot and replaces it with carbon monoxide .
2 ) Inside the charcoal bucket and the cover , scrub the ash with a wire brush .
This ought to be done prior to you put her away for the off season , as moisture combined with the ash makes an extremely effective acid that will wind up consuming through the chassis .
I like to utilize a cleansing solution for the interior that consists of a healthy dose of baking soda to neutralize the acid because of that .
If you did refrain from doing it last fall , however , this is the time to obtain it sparklingly clean .
If you do not deal with a gas grill with regard there ’s a possibility you might wind up being pried off the nearby wall .
Gas is verycombustible so you outdoor grill mustclean and inspect your unitfrequently to keep it in safe operating condition .
A cover will keep the “ natural elements ” off your grill .
In the majority of cases your grill will be exposed to the outdoors .
On your patio , deck , or just outside the garage back entrance ( like me ) , and it will get exposed the weather .
An excellent heavy - duty cover will protect your charcoal or gas grill from the wind , rain , snow , and sun .
Maybe you are a camper or tailgate and utilize the Go-Anywhere grill or the Q - series .
A cover will secure your Baby Q from getting sprinkled on from the 8 - hour old ice water in the 60 - quart cooler or being considered in the back of your truck .
Come on .
Get it covered .
After about five minutes , use the tongs to turn the sirloin .
Do not use a fork to do this .
Prepare them for a number of minutes , then use the tongs to turn them 45 degrees to get the grill marks .
Cook them for 3 or 4 minutes more .
These types are probably the very best gas grills for most consumers .
These types consist of huge , no -excesses models that can likewise manage significant quantity of grill products , in addition to medium - sized grills with additional packages .
Mid -priced grills usually come with side burners , a rotisserie burner , smoker grid , fire igniter , dual storage space , and extra stainless trim .
The majority of have the very best burners or grates with longer service warranties , but few have the very same function .
When you have the area you are going to paint sand with great sand paper , you must use 0000 fine steel wool to do a fine sanding task on the entire location to obtain the sanding scratches out .
You best grill should not see any scratches in the paint or steel if you desirean actuallygreattask .
Me , I ’m not so fussy , I simply sanded with rough steel wool and painted .
What is a cooking spatula ?
A great deal of individuals think a cooking spatula is among those things that you utilize to flip hamburgers on the grill .
This is n’t really technically exactly what a spatula is .
Technically speaking , those are called flippers .
Exactly what a great deal of people call a rubber scraper is in fact called a cooking spatula .
You know , those things you use to scrape out the remainder of the batter when you are putting out brownie batter into a pan ?
That ’s a spatula .
Partisanship be damned , Sarah Palin is one fetching governor .
If elections are won on looks , Obama is in trouble : With Palin by his side , McCain 's ticket suddenly looks like a Christmas card for the coolest cat at the Scottsdale retirement center .
And do n't think commentators have n't noticed .
If data collection for this sort of thing was available ( or if " research " fell under my list of duties ) , you can bet that on the day of the " Palin for VP " accouchement Twitter neared critical mass :
She 's inexperienced !
She 's hot !
She 's inexperienced !
I just found out my boyfriend gave me HPV :(
She 's hot !
Suddenly , the only thing more fascinating than Palin 's position on polar bears ( hates them ) was which female archetype she most resembled .
The comparisons came as quickly as an unexpected pregnancy .
( Forced ?
Yeah , forced . )
And sure , you can't help but feel that if Palin had been sitting in the Senate from the first minute of her thirtieth birthday , maybe the discourse would n't be as much fun as it has been .
( After all , no one 's commenting on how Joe Biden could pass for the love child of Bobs Barker and Uecker . )
But while the topic is being bandied about , let 's just throw out the five most popular look - alikes and see how they stack up to the Palinator .

Fey before he started bad - mouthing her .
Double Mint :
In my opinion , this is the most accurate likeness .
The hair , the glasses , but most of all the intensity behind those big brown eyes that makes you want to refute creationism just to see what will happen .
And then have Fey on your other side telling pro-choice knock - knock jokes .
It 's every independent 's dream .
Wonder Woman
This content is imported from YouTube .
You may be able to find the same content in another format , or you may be able to find more information , at their web site .
Major Likeness : Smoldering intensity .
Major Difference : Palin discourages sex education , while for many young boys Wonder Woman was sex education .
Superpowers : Judging by the G.O.P. response and the media 's unabashedly positive coverage of her convention speech ( if I hear " A star is born ! " one more time , I 'm going to think she 's actually made of burning gasses ) , Sarah Palin 's superhuman powers go beyond even those of Obama .
Just make pretend the guy in the video is a polar bear living above an untapped oil derrick .
BAM !
Success !

Freemasonry in Greece : Secret History Revealed
By Ioannis Michaletos | balkanalysis.com
A topic insufficiently researched in Greece nowadays is the existence and historical progression of freemasonry in the country .
Great debates occur whenever this theme is mentioned , with conspiracy theorists doing their best to blame all of the misfortunes of the Greek state on the existence of the lodges .
This article will examine briefly the intriguing and little - known history of freemasonry in the Greek world , as it has unfolded over the past two centuries .
The Early Days : Venetian Influence and the Spirit of Revolution
The first Freemasons Lodge in Greece was created in 1782 on Corfu .
At the time , the island was still under Venetian rule , while most of the rest of Greece was occupied by the Ottomans .
The Lodges name was  Beneficenza and was under the direction of the Grand Lodge of Verona , based in Padova , Italy .
During that period there were quite a few Greek people residing or studying in Northern Italy , and they were the ones who formed the nucleus of the first Greek lodge ; soon they would spread the organizational structure of Freemasonry all around the Greek diaspora in Europe .
Rigas Feraios Rigas Feraios
In 1790 in Vienna an organization similar in some respects to the Masons was formed by Greek merchants and intellectuals .
It was called  Bon Cuisins ,  and was presumably associated with the Greek pre-revolutionary intellectual Rigas Feraios , one of the leading figures in spreading revolutionary idea among those Greeks still under the Turkish occupation .
This era was one of intellectual ferment , following the American and French revolutions , and thus offered an excellent environment for the dissemination of new ideas .
This ideological development would ultimately lead to the dissolution of the world of empires and the emergence of the nation - state .

This era was one of intellectual ferment , following the American and French revolutions , and thus offered an excellent environment for the dissemination of new ideas .
This ideological development would ultimately lead to the dissolution of the world of empires and the emergence of the nation - state .
In the case of Greece , it seems that the lodges became veritable repositories of knowledge , where the information and ideals needed to start an uprising were collected and shared with a select few .
Usually , these were Greeks of the diaspora who had the intellectual capacity , as well as the capital , to take the first decisive revolutionary actions .
After 1789 , a series of Masonic lodges opened throughout the Heptanisa ( seven islands ) off of the western Greek coast , islands such as Corfu , Kefalonia , Lefkada , Ithaka , Zakinthos .
At that time , these represented the only area in the Hellenic world in relative peace and prosperity , being as they were under Venetian control .
Ioannis Kapodistrias ( 1776 -1831 ) Ioannis Kapodistrias ( 1776 - 1831 )
In 1810 , one of the leading figures of Corfu , Dionysios Romas , merged together the two existing local lodges , Filogenia and Agathoergia and thus created the Grand Anatolian Lodge of Hellas and Corfu .
After this event , Masonic lodges mushroomed across the Hellenic world so that already by 1812 the Greeks in Moscow were able to organize a formidable secret society .

After this event , Masonic lodges mushroomed across the Hellenic world so that already by 1812 the Greeks in Moscow were able to organize a formidable secret society .
Under the auspices of Ioannis Kapodistrias , the then - Russian Foreign Minister , a Masonic lodge that encompassed the Greek elite of Tsarist Russia and played an important role towards creating the framework for the forthcoming Greek revolution was created .
Interestingly , it was named the  Phoenix Lodge .
The ancient symbol of the Phoenix  the mythical bird that rises from its own ashes  is frequently encountered in Greek mysticism .
Ioannis Kapodistrias would become the first head of state in Greece ( 1827 -1831 ) and was the head of the Phoenix Lodge while still in Moscow .
In fact , he even named the first Greek currency phoenix ,  but after his assassination by a Greek clan chief , the famous drachma was born .
The grandest Greek secret society of them all , the Philiki Etaireia ( Friendly Society  ) used the phoenix as its symbol .
Nowadays it is still one of the symbolic emblems of the Freemason Lodges in Greece .
Lastly , during the Junta in Greece ( 1967 - 1974 ) the symbol of the regime was the Phoenix again ; presumably this owed to the membership of some of its officers in certain Greek Masonic lodges .

One of the most important organizations in modern Greek history , the One of the most important organizations in modern Greek history , the Philiki Etaireia was established on September 14 , 1814 in Odessa ; it is widely assumed to have been an offshoot of the Phoenix Lodge of Moscow .
However , Kapodistrias himself would later voice his opposition to the organization .
It was created in order to prepare the Greek populace to rise up against the Ottoman Empire .
Its leaders were Nikolaos Skoufas , from the Arta province of Epiros , Emmanuel Ksanthos from Patmos in the Dodecanese , and Athanasios Tsakalov , also from Epirus .
These men had previous connections with secret societies .
Ksanthos was a member of the Lodge of Lefkada , while Skoufas associate Konstantinos Rados was a devotee of the Italian  Charcoal - burners  Carbonarism movement , an equivalent to the Greek group which sought the unification of Italy .
For his part , the much younger Tsakalov had been a founding member of Ellinoglwsso Xenodoxeio ( the  Greek - speaking Hotel ) , an unsuccessful precursor to the Etairia that was devoted to the same goal of an independent Greece .
It is worthwhile to note that the date of the societys creation was that of the  Holy Cross ,  which in the Greek Orthodox calendar has been associated with the miraculous victory of the Byzantine Empire against a combined Avar - Persian siege in 614 AD .
According to hagiographic tradition , Constantinople was in dire danger of falling to the barbarians , until the patriarch of the city ran across the walls , armed with an icon of the Virgin Mary ( the icon now resides in the Monastery of Dionysiou on Mt. Athos ) .
Considering the symbolism and importance of the day for the Greek nation , one can assume that the creators of the Philiki Etaireia chose it in order to highlight to their followers the historical role that this organization planned to play in the future .
Indeed , the members of the organization were inevitably high - born and ambitious , and included many Phanariots living in Russia .
They firmly believed in the mutual obligation to the Etairias secrecy , to the extent that those who revealed its secrets were murdered .
" The founders of Philiki Etaireia " " The founders of Philiki Etaireia " With such severity was the Filiki Etairia able to maintain its cohesion and , in less than seven years , to encompass the length and breadth of Greek populations in Europe , from Alexandria and Antioch to Budapest and Trieste .
Most importantly , it created the intellectual foundations upon which a revolutionary uprising could be established .

Freemasonry in Greece after 1830 : Philanthropy , Scandal and Schism During the early years of independence in Greece , there was no notable activity among the Freemasons .
Only in 1863 , the year that the new Glücksburg royal dynasty came to Greece , was the Panellinio Lodge established in Athens , soon to be followed by numerous others in provisional Greek towns .
In 1867 , the Grand Orient Lodge of Italy accepted the autonomy of Greek Freemasons and the  Great Orient Lodge of Hellas was created .
The same organization has been known under this name since 1936 .
The 19th century saw the Freemasons in Greece engaged in continuous recruitment of new members , despite the fact that it never became fully accepted by Greek society .
Freemasonry was often viewed as a heresy by the Orthodox Church , or as a manifestation of unwanted foreign influence in the political sphere .
Nevertheless , various philanthropic initiatives were undertaken as a result of Masonic activity .
Schools , hospitals , support during wartime , scholarships and so on were the legacy of Greek lodges .
These factors explain why , in 1927 , the Greek state recognized the Hellenic Lodge as a philanthropic association administered by the Ministry of Public Health .
Unfortunately , during the WWII occupation most of the Greek Masonic archives were destroyed by the Germans .
The lodges stopped operating during this turbulent period .
In the aftermath of the war , Freemasonry gradually regained its previous influence and spread further in Greek society .
Today , a grand building in the centre of Athens attests to the economic affluence of the organization that has managed to retain its veil of secrecy right through the present day .
During the military dictatorship in Greece of 1967 - 1974 , officers involved in the Junta were accused of being Freemasons , something that was decidely bad public relations for the Greek Grand Lodge .
In 1980 , a Greek journalist , Kostas Tsarouchas , revealed the names and ranks of numerous Greek Freemasons .
This revelation created a certain havoc in the Athenian world , because a large number of politicians , judges , academics and other were said to be involved - precisely at a time when political passions in the country were running high , one year before the first socialist government of Andreas Papandreou took power .
Later , in 1993 , the Grand Lodge of Greece was accused by the mother lodge of London of engaging in political activity , supposedly a no - no for Freemasons worldwide .
Thus once again was the image of the Greek Lodge tarnished , and as a result a schism began that ultimately brought about the creation of several unrecognized Masonic Lodges in Greece .
However , it should be added that politics and Freemasonry do mix ; it would be incomprehensible to expect otherwise from a class of people frequently involved in politics and who exercise political clout .
The 1993 argument with the Grand Lodge in London happened , according to rumors , from the different opinions between the Greeks and the British over who had the right to initiate and take under its influence the newly emerging Masonic lodges of the Balkan states .
If true , this would most certainly amount to an act of politics of the higher level .
Moreover , the global Freemason movement has always been heavily influenced by its Anglo - Saxon members , and even nowadays the majority of the members worldwide are to be found in Britain , the USA , Canada and Australia .
Obviously , the influence they exert is not only spiritual but political as well .
Greek Freemasonry : Some Conclusions
Even though it is difficult to keep track of developments in the Freemason world due to its secrecy , some interesting notes can be made so far as the Greek example is concerned .
In our days numerous associations have been active within the Greek society such as the Rotary Club and the Junior Chamber International , and there has been a veritable mushrooming of esoteric societies and other forms of more or less secret fraternities .
This proliferation of groups has weakened the traditional supremacy of the Freemasons in Greece .
On balance , the Greek Freemasonry movement has most historical significance in that it was the main procreator of the revolutionary organizations of the early 19th century , chief among them the Philiki Etairia .
Similar societies both before and after have drawn from a rich tradition of esoteric customs , symbols and activities .
These can be traced ultimately back to the pagan mystery cults of Greek Antiquity , and the later crypto-Christian groups ( when Christians were still being persecuted by the Roman Empire ) .
It can even be argued that the pyramidal , multi- leveled organizational hierarchy of the Philiki Etairia resembles somewhat the neo-Platonic conception of the universal organization of ideality and divinity as laid out by ancient authors such as Porphyry and Plotinus .
If all of these are indeed manifestations of the unique Greek passion for convoluted and complex organization , irrational rules and secrecy ( the undoing of which would open onto time - honored themes of scandal and betrayal ) , then one can perceive a continuous historical tradition , in which Freemasonry becomes just one epochs manifestation of the seminal impulses and psyche of a people .

Some interesting footage of deck - hits aboard aircraft carriers , some rarely seen crashes - and near misses .
The chap in the last scene has a lucky escape ..
Mikel Smith , 19 , and Jovan McCreary , 21 , sat at Alienware game stations , maneuvering the camouflaged antiterrorist troopers of Rainbow Six through a series of casinos under siege .
Muzzles flared on screen ; sounds burst in their headphones .
“ We ’re just here to play the games , ” said Mr. Smith , who said he was not considering enlisting in the Army .
At the sign - in desk , where visitors fill out an information sheets and receive bar - coded photo identification cards , he indicated that he did not want to be contacted by a recruiter .
Beside Mr. Smith , Mr. McCreary leaned back in his black mesh chair .
“ I got the same game at home , but it ’s better here , ” he said .
He , too , was not interested in the Army Experience Center ’s other purposes .
“ We ’re going to college next year , ” he said .
First Sgt. Randy Jennings , the supervising officer on this day , said the center ’s intent was not just to recruit personnel , but also to inform young people about the Army , in an area where they have little contact with service members .
Most recruits live near rural bases .
If the program is deemed a success , the Army might replicate it in other cities .
“ We want to put people in the Army , but that ’s about our third priority , ” Sergeant Jennings said , gesturing to a kiosk with descriptions of 179 jobs in the Army , including details on salaries and benefits .
“ Most people think joining the Army means being a grunt , and that Iraq equals death .
We try to show them that there ’s more to the Army than carrying a gun .
If people come in here and they learn that but they do n’t join , that ’s O.K . ”
Most of the staff  both military and civilian  wore casual clothing ; there was no hard sell .
Conversations with recruiters might take place in an adjacent room or the central lounge area , where there were comfortable leather chairs and a soundtrack of Jane ’s Addiction and the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
But on this afternoon , the only action was on the video games and simulators .
Osama Rasaras , clerk
I live in Dura and work as a clerk for the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem .
In 2003 , I married my wife Sonia , 29 , from Rafah .
I entered the Gaza Strip with a visitor 's permit .
After marrying , I stayed with my wife in Gaza for about a year and a half .
Then we received a permit to enter the West Bank and moved to Dura .
We have two children , Ahmad , 4 , and Dalal , 18 months .
Dalal was born with brain damage and is completely paralyzed .
We had a good life in Dura .
On 26 December 2007 , my wife went to the Gaza Strip to visit her father , who had suffered a stroke .
She took the children with her and planned to return home a week later .
On 17 September 2008 , Dalal was scheduled to undergo surgery in the French St. Joseph Hospital , in Jerusalem , and then to go to Jordan for further treatment .
Since my wife and children went to Gaza , the Israelis have refused to issue them a permit to return to the West Bank .
My wife submitted requests to the Palestinian Liaison and Coordination offices , which forwarded them to the Israeli side , but the Israelis refuse to approve the request .
My wife has a document confirming that the Palestinian Authority will pay for any treatment for my daughter , and also a referral to the hospital in Jerusalem , but the Israelis still refuse .

About six months ago , I met the director of the Office for Civilian Affairs in Ramallah , Mr. Hussein a - Sheikh .
He tried to help solve the problem with the Israeli side , but nothing has changed .
I also contacted Physicians for Human Rights and they contacted the Civil Administration .
Officials at the Civil Administration claimed that they did not receive a request from the Palestinian Authority to allow my wife and children to enter , even though I know that the Palestinian side made requests at least four times .
I do n't understand why the Israelis refuse to allow my wife and children to return home .
It is an inalienable right that anyone is entitled to .
I have n't seen my wife and children for a year .
Dalal is in pain and suffers from convulsions , and I can do nothing to help her .
The only thing I can do is call every day and ask how they are .
My wife begs me to help her come home , but I do n't know what to do .
She says that my son , Ahmad , is very sad because we are not together .
I hope that human rights organizations will help me reunite with my family and help my sick daughter .

His testimony was given to Musa Abu Hashhash in Hebron on 9 November 2008 .
Cathy Woods ’ new granite counters were radioactive .
They contained as much uranium as commercial uranium ore .
The showroom that sold Cathy her Jupurana Bordeaux granite did not warn her that some granite is radioactive .
When I contacted the salesman , posing as a customer , he assured me their granite “ is no more radioactive than soil or water ” .
However , Cathy ’s granite emitted gamma radiation at many times background .
The radon gas emitted by the stone tripled the radon concentration in her kitchen .
Jupurana Bordeaux is one of the granites that are likely to be radioactive .
Just weeks after having her counters installed , Cathy learned of the possibility and enlisted the assistance of professionals to assess her exposure to radiation and radon gas .
Radon is a daughter product of uranium , so granites containing uranium will emit radon .
According to the EPA , radon is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers .
Cathy and her husband both have family histories of cancer , so they were very concerned about elevated radiation and radon in their kitchen .
Some granite quarries are near uranium mines .
Most granite does not contain large amounts of uranium , but some granite can have more uranium than a homeowner would want in the home .
Cathy and I measured radiation from about 1,000 slabs of granite in showrooms around the San Francisco Bay Area .
Most of the granite was only slightly radioactive .
However , a small percentage emitted gamma radiation ( penetrating radiation ) at many times background .
We found Jupurana Bordeaux emitting gamma radiation at nearly 100 times background in the very showroom that claimed none of their stone was radioactive .
When Cathy confronted the owner about his granite , he said he had no intention of warning buyers .
Cathy fell in love with Volga Blue granite to replace her Jupurana Bordeaux .
It is mostly black with shiny crystals and iridescent “ blue eyes ” .
Gamma emission was barely above background , one of the least radioactive granites we had seen .
We were left with many questions about radioactive granite we saw in showrooms .
How much radioactive granite is installed in homes ?
How many of those homes have young children or pregnant women ?
Why do n’t granite showrooms warn their customers ?
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s Sony Corp said it will cut 16,000 jobs , curb investment and pull out of businesses to save $ 1.1 billion a year as the financial crisis ravages demand for its electronics products .
The job cuts are the biggest announced by an Asian company so far in the crisis and underscore the challenges facing Sony , which has fallen behind Apple Inc ’s iPod in portable music and is losing money on flat TVs .
Sony said it would cut 8,000 regular workers , or roughly 4 percent of its workforce of 185,800 , and an equal number or more temporary and contract staff .
But analysts warned the measures may not be bold enough to streamline a sprawling empire that ranges from semiconductors to movies and insurance .
The cuts are also risky because they mean
Sony will be investing less in future growth .
“ The number sounds big , but this staff reduction wo n’t be enough .
Sony does n’t have any core businesses that generate stable profits , ” said Katsuhiko Mori , a fund manager at Daiwa SB Investments .
“ After the workforce reduction , the next thing we want to see is what is going to be the business that will drive the company . ”
Sony is not the only one suffering .
Japanese rival Panasonic lowered its earnings forecasts last month while South Korea ’s Samsung Electronics
Co said on Monday it would cut capital investment and warned of tough times .
Sony ’s U.S. shares , which have fallen more than 60 percent this year , rose 2 percent to $ 20.45 in early trading in New York .
In Frankfurt , its shares rose 4.83 percent to 16.07 euros .
Sony flagged the need for restructuring in October when it more than halved its annual profit forecast , blaming slowing demand for its Bravia liquid crystal display TVs and Cyber - shot digital cameras and a firmer yen .
The restructuring is a setback for Chief Executive Howard Stringer , who had implemented a major make - over after taking the helm in 2005 , and until recently seemed to have put the company on a recovery track .
It also underlines the grim outlook for Sony and its rivals during the year - end shopping season and into next year as the financial crisis grows into a recession that has already engulfed the United States , parts of Europe and Japan .
“ The outlook for the global economy suggests that things would become tougher for Sony next year , and it cannot expect a recovery without these restructuring measures , ” said Fujio Ando , senior managing director at Chibagin Asset Management .

CURRENCY IMPACT
Sony , along with other Japanese exporters , has also been hit hard by a surging yen against the dollar and euro , which cuts into the value of its profits and makes its products less competitive in overseas markets .
Sony said it would raise prices on some electronics products in Europe in response to the weak euro .
South Korean competitors Samsung and LG Electronics have found some relief in the weaker won .

Both companies have adjusted production to cope with falling orders and say they do not plan to cut staff , but analysts are not so sure .
“ Japanese electronics makers suffer more than their rivals in South Korea because of the stronger yen , ” said Lee Min-hee , an analyst at Dongbu Securities in Seoul .
“ But going forward , Korean manufacturers could consider more drastic measures . ”
Sony said it would delay boosting output for LCD TVs in Slovakia and outsource production of image sensor chips , as it aims to cut electronics investment 30 percent in the next business year compared with a prior plan .
It also unveiled plans to reduce its network of 57 manufacturing sites by five or six through outsourcing and by shifting and consolidating factories to low - cost areas .
Earlier this week it announced the closure of a videotape plant in France .
Sony said it would detail the effect of the restructuring on earnings in its third - quarter results in January .
It has already warned that it may need to revise down its profit forecasts further due to yen strength .
Other technology and auto manufacturers could follow suit in the coming weeks with their own restructuring plans , raising the prospect for industry realignment .
“ Sony ’s restructuring might be followed by other Japanese manufacturers .
With the stronger yen , a lot more companies will probably need to do similar reductions .
There will be more mergers , sales of units and restructuring in Japan , ” Daiwa SB ’s Mori said .
Oh I love this .
what did you use for the " fur ? "
I been working on a Bantha pony and been wondering what everyone been using for their ponies .
Kelly Barbaer talks by phone with an Army investigator .
Her husband 's ashes are in the foreground .
Josh Barber FORT LEWIS , Wash .
 Josh Barber , former combat soldier , parked outside the Army hospital here one morning last August armed for war .
A cook at the dining facility , Barber sat in his truck wearing battle fatigues , earplugs and a camouflage hood on his head .
He had an arsenal : seven loaded guns , nearly 1,000 rounds of ammunition , knives in his pockets .
On the front seat , an AK - 47 had a bullet in the chamber .
The " smell of death " he experienced in Iraq continued to haunt him , his wife says .
He was embittered about the post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) that crippled him , the Army 's failure to treat it , and the strains the disorder put on his marriage .
Despite the firepower he brought with him , Barber , 31 , took only one life that day .
He killed himself with a shot to the head .
" He went to Fort Lewis to kill himself to prove a point , " Kelly Barber says . " ' Here I am .
I was a soldier .
You guys did n't help me . ' "
For two days , a surveillance camera recorded the truck sitting in the Madigan Army Medical Center parking lot .
Inside the truck , the body lay undisturbed .
If Josh Barber wanted his suicide to make a statement , no one seemed to notice .
Barber 's suicide is part of a larger story — the record number of soldiers , Marines and combat veterans who have killed themselves in recent years , at a time when the Pentagon has stretched deployments for combat troops to meet President Bush 's security plans in Iraq .
The Marine Corps reported 41 actual or suspected suicides in 2008 , a 20 % increase over 33 in 2007 .
In 2007 , the Army counted 115 suicides , the most since tracking began in 1980 .
By October 2008 , that record had been surpassed with 117 soldier suicides .
Final numbers for 2008 have not been released .
Suicides among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans doubled from 52 in 2004 to 110 in 2006 , the latest statistics available , according to the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) .
And the suicide rate among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is outpacing the rate among civilians , a disturbing trend because the military screens troops for mental health issues and servicemembers typically are healthier than civilians , says Han Kang , a VA epidemiologist .
" Cases like Sgt. Barber 's are heartbreaking and my thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time , " says Sen. Patty Murray , D - Wash . , who has focused on military suicides as an issue and whose staff assisted Kelly Barber through her ordeal .
She says a cultural shift is needed in mental health care to expand outreach and de-stigmatize treatment for servicemembers and veterans .
" These problems can't be solved overnight , " Murray says .
" There is much more that needs to be done . "
Josh Barber 's wife shared his medical records with USA TODAY to provide a cautionary story about a soldier forced out of the service despite psychological illnesses caused by war .
" My husband fell through the cracks , " Kelly Barber says , adding that she also is haunted by the idea that she could have done more to save him .
" My husband 's death should n't go in vain . "
From cook to gunner A large , jovial man who loved food and the outdoors , Josh Barber grew up in Traverse City , Mich .
The youngest of two children , his parents divorced when he was in grade school .
Barber became engaged to Kelly Watson , the sister of his best friend , in 1997 .
He earned a high school equivalency degree before enlisting in the Army in 1999 , and considered a career in the Army .
But he changed his mind after serving in Iraq .
He and Kelly married after his Army basic training and before he began attending cook school .
Barber had no history of mental health problems before enlisting , says his VA doctor , Lisa Olsen .
His biggest problem was keeping his weight to service standards .
The Army 's assignment to cook school led Barber to a job in which he excelled .
His grill work was second to none — whipping up omelets and burgers to taste , always recalling a customer 's favorite style of eggs , according to comments on his memorial page .
He took a job , Olsen notes , that was devoted to serving and feeding other soldiers .
" He probably never suspected that he would be called on to serve in a combat role , " she wrote in a letter to Kelly Barber , now 40 , after his death .
But then , in 2003 , the United States invaded Iraq .
When he arrived in Iraq in October 2004 , contractors did the cooking .
Barber was made a gunner on a Humvee .
He stenciled a skull insignia from his favorite punk rock band , Misfits , onto his .50 - caliber machine gun , and ran convoys .
He worked base security along the Syrian border and manned an observation post near Fallujah during fighting there .
His only joy , Olsen says , were the care packages from Kelly Barber stuffed with beef jerky and jars of Jif peanut butter .
On Dec. 21 , 2004 , in Mosul , a suicide bomber detonated explosives in a mess tent , killing 22 , including 14 soldiers .
Barber stood guard over the carnage .
He would never forget the " smell of death , " he later told Kelly .
The shock of the blast affected others , including Army Gen. Carter Ham , who arrived at the scene 20 minutes after the attack .
Ham told USA TODAY the incident contributed to the combat stress he developed afterward .
" There 's things that go on over there you 'd never believe , " Barber told one of his best friends , Justin Haelle , during a trip home in 2005 , " things I 'll never be able to tell Kelly about . "
Diagnosed with depression Barber earned a combat action badge for fighting in Iraq .
When he rotated home in September 2005 , he filled out a health survey saying he had seen Americans and insurgents killed and wounded , had fired his weapon in combat and feared for his life .
He admitted feeling numb and detached from others .
Barber left active duty in 2006 for the Army Reserve .
Now a civilian , he got a job as a temporary cook in the dining facility at Madigan Army Medical Center here at Fort Lewis , about 40 miles south of Seattle .
Shortly after coming home , he went deer hunting in Michigan with his father , Dennis , something both had happily anticipated after Josh Barber 's long absence .
But the son did n't kill anything that day .
Later he told friends that he never even loaded his rifle while walking the brush .
One night during that hunting trip , the sound of gunfire woke Dennis Barber .
He found his son , who had been drinking , blasting away at a paper target out in the darkness .
" What the hell are you doing ? " he says he asked .
Josh Barber stopped shooting and eventually went to bed .
Dennis Barber now wonders about that night .
" The armed forces can train you to do things you normally would n't do , " he says of his son 's experience .
" But they 've never been able to train people how to forget . "
Barber 's military records show he was forced out of the Reserve after a diagnosis of depression that was listed as " non-duty related . "
The Army provided no clarification on this issue .
His plea to be retained and transferred into one of the newly created Warrior Transition Units for psychological care went unanswered , Kelly Barber says .
" The once smiling , happy man I knew is now quiet and depressed , reliving the events he experienced in Iraq today and full of guilt , " she wrote in a 2006 letter to the VA .
" He has had to face many demons . "
About that same time , VA counselors diagnosed him with combat - related PTSD .
Classic symptoms were emerging , according to his medical records .
Barber suffered nightmares filled with combat and explosions .
He had flashbacks marked by moments when he simply seemed to be deep in thought , often while drinking vodka .
" He feels quieter and more isolated and feels somewhat less of a nice guy than he did before he deployed , " counseling notes say .
Life was unraveling in different ways .
It took more than seven months for the VA to re-evaluate his wartime disability and grant him benefits .
At work , he struggled to be retained as a permanent employee and promoted .
He was reprimanded for his anger , according to his records .
By this spring , Kelly Barber was working 52 hours a week at two hospital clerical jobs .
Josh Barber was drinking more , an increasing area of friction .
The strain on the marriage was evident .
Kelly Barber would find her husband crying in his sleep .
He awoke from nightmares covered in sweat , his heart racing .
His moods would alternate between feelings of apathy and moments of tearful reactions to small things , medical records show .
It was unclear whether Barber continued to take his anti-depression medication .
During one conversation about his drinking , Barber blurted out that he was afraid of going to hell for killing an innocent Iraqi in the war .
Barber told his wife that if it was n't for her , he would have committed suicide long ago .
Kelly Barber says she told him they would work through his problems .
When she awoke early on Aug. 24 , Josh Barber was drinking vodka in front of the TV .
Kelly Barber said she yelled at him for the first time .
" I said , ' If you continue to drink like this , I do n't know how much more I can take , ' " she recalls .
She now agonizes over that memory every day .
" Did I give him an ultimatum ? "
He vanished that night with his guns and ammunition in the Ford F - 150 that Kelly Barber gave him as a coming - home gift from Iraq .
He left a note : " I love you .
Please do not blame yourself .
Sorry . "
The search for answers Army Col. Ronald Place , acting hospital director on the day Josh died , said " the whole family at Madigan Army Medical Center has suffered a lot with Mr. Barber 's suicide . "
Place said identifying and treating psychologically wounded soldiers has improved since Barber left the Army , but more needs to be done .
" This young man served honorably in combat for 12 months , " Place says .
" We 're still looking at how could we have potentially helped this civilian employee . "
One problem is a failure to seek help , Place says .
Barber showed signs of anxiety , anger and detachment from others in a Fort Lewis questionnaire filled out in November 2005 .
But he did not request any counseling , according to the document provided to USA TODAY .
A leading suspect in the rise of suicides are the long and multiple combat deployments — not as a direct cause , but as a leading factor behind the stresses and family divisions that result , says Col. Carl Castro , an Army psychologist and suicide researcher .
The historic causes of suicide are hopelessness borne of stress , failed relationships and legal and financial problems , he says .
Soldiers have been required to serve multiple 12 - to 15 - month combat tours , with short periods of rest in between .
More than 60 % of soldiers who killed themselves in 2008 were , or had been , deployed , figures show .
" So the question becomes , ' Well , what could be affecting those factors in making them higher ?
And that 's really where we then start looking at frequent and long deployments , " Castro says .
Surveys of troops reveal that mental health can fray after six or seven months of war , Castro says .
" You start seeing huge differences in terms of depression scores , PTSD rates , all sorts of mental health issues , " he says .
" And I think it has to do with the separation from family and friends and that social support network . "
To find answers , the Army joined with the National Institute of Mental Health in October seeking proposals for a $ 50 million study .
It will track a cross-section of soldiers over years , sifting for clues about signs of self - destruction and also evidence of resilience , says Robert Heinssen , project officer .
The hope is for initial results in a year , he said .
" We 're trying to work it so we get as fast a start - up as possible because soldiers are dying .
We feel that urgency . "
Still reeling from twin blows of Josh Barber 's suicide and his heavily armed appearance at Fort Lewis , his family and friends struggle to make sense of it .
" Every time he turned around , he felt like he was getting slapped in the face , " his friend Haelle says .
A memorial service with military honors will be held for Barber on March 6 , at Sarasota National Cemetery in Sarasota , Fla .
" Everybody wants to know why , " his father Dennis Barber says .
" Why did you have all that ammunition ?
What was he going to do out there , have a stand - off ?
I do n't think so .
But then again , when people snap , you never know what you 're going to do .
" Josh took that ( answer ) with him , " Dennis Barber says .

NEW YORK , Jan. 12 ( UPI ) -- President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration will be screened live in 27 U.S. theaters , MSNBC said Monday .
The cable channel said it had reached a deal with Screenvision to put its coverage of the inauguration on 27 theaters in 21 markets , The Hollywood Reporter said .
Admission will be free and tickets are being distributed at MSNBC.com .

The programming will be presented from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. EST .
The arrangement gives MSNBC an opportunity to reach an audience in movie theaters , and it gives theater operators a chance to bring people into theaters -- and perhaps sell some popcorn and beverages -- at a time of day when movie attendance typically does n't amount to much , the report said .
The signal will not be high - definition , but the cable channel and Screenvision say the picture will be high - quality .
MSNBC President Phil Griffin said , " It 'll look great . "
Griffin told the Reporter the exhibiting its inauguration coverage in movie theaters is intended to " reach people we 've never reached before . "
" We 're going to do numerous things like that to get our name out there , " he said .
" Ubiquity is the name of the game in 2009 . "
Rising US crude oil reserves signal that demand is continuing to weaken Oil prices dropped sharply as US crude oil stocks rose more than had been expected - suggesting demand for energy has eroded even further .
US light , sweet crude fell $ 5.95 to $ 42.63 a barrel in New York - ending a week of gains .
Earlier in London , Brent crude oil fell $ 4.67 to $ 45.86 a barrel .
Oil prices had been rising because of the Gaza crisis and apparent halting of Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine amid a dispute .
Investors have been concerned that the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could spread to the rest of oil - rich Middle East and affect supplies .
Rising reserves
However the unexpectedly large rise in US crude oil stocks has once again underlined the significance of weakening consumer demand for oil .
Demand for oil appears to remain weak as traders are seeking as many as 10 supertankers to store crude
Addison Armstrong , Tradition Energy
The Energy Information Administration said US crude oil stocks had risen by 6.7 m barrels instead of the expected figure of 1.5 m barrels .
Jim Ritterbusch of energy consultants Ritterbusch and Associates said : " This will take a lot of steam out of the geopolitical argument that this Russian - Ukraine standoff is going to disrupt supplies appreciably .
" This report 's telling us that we 've got a big supply cushion out there that can easily absorb a temporary curtailment of European supply . "
Crude prices dropped alongside Wall Street , where the Dow ended down 2.7 % on Wednesday .
Bleak trading statements from Time Warner , Intel and news of Alcoa 's job cuts combined with more evidence of rising unemployment have undercut expectations that demand for energy will rebound further .
" This has been a speculatively led rally here in the past couple of weeks , " said Mr Ritterbusch .
" It did n't have a lot of fundamental impetus behind it , and now we 're getting evidence that there 's a lot more crude and product supply out there than what we thought . "
Supertanker storage Demand for gasoline , or petrol , also appeared to be falling .
US gasoline inventories rose by 3.3 m barrels , more than twice what analysts had expected .
US gasoline consumption is falling , according to the weekly report by MasterCard .
Consumption last week was down 3.5 % compared with the same week a year ago .
Tom Kloza at Oil Price Information Service , said the sharp drop in prices was not necessarily surprising : " It does n't necessarily mean that we 've seen this sea change or this tremendous shift in sentiment on trend .
" It 's just illustrative of sort of this incredible kind of irregular heartbeat that commodities have displayed probably since November . "
Crude oil has now become so cheap , it is being stored at sea to avoid selling it at current market prices .
" Demand for oil appears to remain weak as traders are seeking as many as 10 supertankers to store crude , " said Addison Armstrong at Tradition Energy .
" The carriers hold about 2 million barrels of crude and traders are seeking to lease the ships for three to nine months , " he said .

One of the most frequent questions I get is , “ What software do you use to visualize data ? ”
A lot of people are excited to play with their data , but do n’t know how to go about doing it or even start .
Here are the tools I use or have used and resources that I own or found helpful for data visualization â€ “ starting with organizing the data , to graphs and charts , and lastly , animation and interaction .
Organizing the Data
Data are hardly ever in the format that you need them to be in .
Maybe you got a comma-delimited file and you need it to be in XML ; or you got an Excel spreadsheet that needs to go into a MySQL database ; or the data are stuck on hundreds of HTML pages and you need to get it all together in one place .
Data organization is n’t incredibly fun , but it ’s worth getting to know these tools / languages .
The last thing you want is to be restricted by data format .
PHP
PHP was the first scripting language I learned that was well - suited for the Web , so I ’m pretty comfortable with it .
I oftentimes use PHP to get CSV files into some XML format .
The function fgetcsv( ) does just fine .
It ’s also a good hook into a MySQL database or calling API methods .
RESOURCES :
Python
Most computer science types – at least the ones I ’ve worked with – scoff at PHP and opt for Python mostly because Python code is often better structured ( as a requirement ) and has cooler server - side functions .
My favorite Python toy is Beautiful Soup , which is an HTML / XML parser .
What does that mean ?
Beautiful Soup is excellent for screen scraping .
RESOURCES :
MySQL
When I have a lot of data – like on the magnitude of the tends to hundreds of thousands – I use PHP or Python to stick it in a MySQL database .
MySQL lets me subset on the data on pretty much any way I please .
RESOURCES :
R
Ah , good old R .
It ’s what statisticians use , and pretty much nobody else .
Everyone else has it installed on their computer , but have n’t gotten around to learning it .
I use R for analysis .
Sometimes though , I use it to extract useful subsets from a dataset if the conditions are more complex than those I ’d use with MySQL and then export them as CSV files .
RESOURCES :
Microsoft Excel
We all know this one .
I use Excel from time to time when my dataset is small or if I ’m in a point - and - click mood .
Charts and Graphs
Alright , the data are processed , formatted , and ready to go .
Now it ’s time to visualize .
The software I use for static charts and graphs depends on the task at hand , so I try not to limit myself to anyone piece of software .
For example , R is good for quick results , but no good for a Web application .
Adobe Illustrator
I use Adobe Illustrator for publication - level graphics .
I learned how to use it when I was at The Times out of necessity and have been enjoying it since .
You can manipulate every element of a graph with a simple click and a drag – which can be a blessing and a curse .
RESOURCES :
R
If you have a particular type of ( non-animated , non-interactive ) statistical visualization in mind , R has probably got it .
R is free with countless libraries available .
If you ca n’t find a library to suit your needs , you can always script it yourself .
One cool thing about R is that you can save your graphics as PDF and then polish it in Adobe Illustrator .
RESOURCES :
PHP Graphics Library
I ’ve only had limited experience the the PHP GD library .
There are several PHP graphing packages available , but I have n’t found one that I liked a whole lot , so I ’m usually more satisfied drawing my own graphs with the GD library .
The Sparklines PHP graphing library is n’t half bad either .
RESOURCES :
HTML + CSS + Javascript
You can surprisingly do quite a bit with some simple HTML and CSS .
You can make graphs and of course tables as well as control colors and sizes .
For example , a lot of the tag clouds you see on the Web are just HTML and CSS .
Throw Javascript in to the mix and you ’ve got yourself a party i.e. interaction capabilities .
RESOURCES :
Flash / Actionscript
Flash and Actionscript is better known for animating and moving data , but it can be used for static stuff too .
It ’s pretty good if you want to add interaction to your visualization like highlighting or filtering .
I ’ve done some stuff from scratch and also played around with Flare , the Actionscript visualization toolkit .
RESOURCES :
Microsoft Excel
It ’s pretty rare that I use Excel for graphics .
If I need something really quick though and the data are already in an Excel spreadsheet , I ’ll click that graph button .
RESOURCES :
Animating the Data
There are several options to create animated and interactive data visualization , but these are the only ones I use ( and for the most part , dominate what you see on the Web ) .
Processing
Yeah , it ’s called Processing .
I ’ve seen mostly designers use it , but there ’s no reason it ca n’t be used elsewhere .
Processing uses a canvas metaphor where you draw and make sketches and then get a Java applet out of it .
Processing was created to make programmatic goodness available to non-programmers .
RESOURCES :
Flash / Actionscript
Flash and Actionscript has been my point of interest lately â€ “ mostly because the Java applet is dead as far the Web is concerned .
The interactive / animated visualization you see from places like The New York Times , Stamen Design , and web applications are usually implemented with Flash and Actionscript .
Not sure if it ’s Flash ?
The tell tale sign is a simple right click on whatever you ’re looking at .
Take a look at my previous post on How to Learn Actionscript for Data Visualization for more details .
RESOURCES :
Phew , that was a lot .
I started this out as a list of 10 tools and resources , and it just kept growing .
I did n’t realize I use so many things .
It just goes to show that for any given job , there ’s a tool that ’s right and one that ’s not .
The amazing thing is that these are only the tools I use .
There are lots of others out there .
Do you use something that ’s not on the list to visualize data or know of another resource that would be useful ?
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- President Bush announced a rescue plan for General Motors and Chrysler LLC Friday morning that will make $ 13.4 billion in federal loans available almost immediately .
The money will come from the $ 700 billion fund set aside to bail out Wall Street firms and banks in October .
With these loans , Treasury will have committed virtually all of the $ 350 billion of that fund that it can hand out without additional authorization from Congress .
Once Congress releases the other $ 350 billion , the two automakers will be able to borrow an additional $ 4 billion .
GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) will get $ 9.4 billion from the first allocation of federal loan money , while Chrysler would get the other $ 4 billion .
The loans are for three years , but the money will have to be repaid in full within 30 days if the firms do not show themselves to be viable by March 31 .
Bush : " Preventing disorderly bankruptcy "
During brief remarks at the White House , President Bush said in normal times he would have not been in favor of preventing a bankruptcy of the two companies .
But the current state of the economy and credit markets left him no choice but to act .
" Government has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and stability of our economy , " he said .
" If we were to allow the free market to take its course now , it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers . "
" In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession , allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action , " Bush added .
In a statement , President - elect Barack Obama said today 's loan was " a necessary step to help avoid a collapse in our auto industry that would have devastating consequences for our economy and our workers . "
Obama added that " the auto companies must not squander this chance to reform bad management practices and begin the long - term restructuring that is absolutely required to save this critical industry and the millions of American jobs that depend on it . "
Conditions similar to auto bailout bill
The terms of the loan are similar to those set in the auto bailout legislation that was passed by the House last week but was shot down in the Senate .
Executives at GM and Chrysler must agree to limits on their compensation and eliminate perks such as corporate jets .
The companies also must issue warrants , which convert into non-voting stock , to the government .
GM Chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner , who had previously agreed to reduce his salary to $ 1 a year in return for the federal loans , said at a press conference Friday he has no intention to resign .
Some critics of GM have called for him to do so .
" You think I would have gone through what I did the last two months if I did n't want to stay ? " he said .
The loans do not include the concept of a so - called " car czar " to oversee the automakers , although it does say that a designee of the President would determine if the automakers are making the changes necessary for them to be considered viable .
The Bush administration official said Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would fill that role in the remaining days of the current administration .
The loans call for the automakers to prove they are viable by March 31 , even though they are not expected to be profitable by that date .
They must submit the details of the plans by Feb. 17 .
The government wants the automakers to reduce their debt load by two - thirds via a debt for equity exchange with current bondholders and get the United Auto Workers union to agree to wages and work rules competitive with non-union plants operated by Asian auto manufacturers by the end of next year .
Wagoner said negotiations with GM debt holders and the union will begin almost immediately now that the loans are in place .
He added that the company is confident it will be able to meet the targets set out as terms of the loan .
In addition , the government is calling for GM and Chrysler to use their stock to pay for half the funds needed to cover future retiree health care expenses , which will be paid by union - controlled trust funds , rather than the automakers themselves , starting in 2010 .
But there is flexibility for the companies and the incoming Obama administration to allow the loans to continue even if these targets are not reached , as long as GM and Chrysler can provide an explanation as to why they are viable without hitting those targets .
Republican senators demanded hard targets for labor union concessions and cited the UAW 's resistance to agree to them as the reason the bill died last week .
A Bush administration official cautioned that the government should not play a big role in the union negotiations that will take place in the next three months .
" We do not feel it is appropriate for government to dictate the specific terms of negotiations between management and labor or management and dealers or management and creditors , " the official said .
UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said the union does not want further concessions to be spelled out in the loan agreement , but that the union would hold talks with the government about how to make the Big Three more competitive .
" We will work with the Obama administration and the new Congress to ensure that these unfair conditions are removed as we join in the coming months with all stakeholders to create a viable future for the U.S. auto industry , " he said .
Time was running out
GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) has warned it will fall below the minimum amount of cash it needs to continue to operate without $ 4 billion in federal loans before the end of the month .
Privately held Chrysler said it will need $ 4 billion or it will also run out of cash early next year .
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) has more cash on hand and has said it should be able to avoid tapping into federal dollars unless the weak auto sales continue longer than it expects in 2009 .
Shares of GM soared more than 10 % Friday morning on the news of the loan and Ford was up 5 % .
U.S. auto sales plunged to 26 - year lows last month as tight credit , rising job losses and weak consumer confidence have led to a virtual collapse in the auto market .
All of the major automakers , including Asian automakers Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) , are cutting back production .
But the situation is particularly severe at GM and Chrysler .
In the last week , those two automakers announced shutdowns of assembly lines for at least a month , several weeks longer than the typical shutdowns during the December holiday season .
These days you seem to hear a lot about building a web app in 20 minutes using framework X and language Y .
The most exaggerated of these I read recently was ( Re) writing Reddit in Lisp in 20 minutes and 100 lines .
Here is a brief critique , without having watched the movie at all :
100 lines of code in 20 minutes is 300 lines an hour .
Typically you would expect to be able to do 30 - 40 LOC / hour , so this is very good going .
Here are a few explanations , all of which are possible , with varying degrees of plausibility ( and I ’m ignoring the possibility that the author was exaggerating in terms of time — though he is clearly exaggerating with the use of the word ‘ rewrite ’ , as other people have pointed out ) :
The author is a super genius .
He had half the code written in his head before he sat down to type .
He knew the problem domain exceptionally well — he wrote something similar in python ( or lisp ) the week before .
He had a working installation of everything he needed , to which he could just add a few pages i.e. he had already done all the ‘ set up ’ phase .
He was benefiting from the development honeymoon period ( more below ) .
There are some other possibilities that probably do n’t apply to this case , but often contribute to the ‘ 20 minute web app ’ syndrome :
Lots of copy and paste was involved
You have a framework or piece of software that , out of the box , happens to provide a very large proportion of what you need .
The ‘ honeymoon ’ period of software development is the bit that comes after you have set your machine up etc , and you start coding from nothing .
If you have nice frameworks or libraries , you can get fantastic levels of productivity at this point .
There are various reasons , but I think you can summarise it by saying that you are doing zero ‘ maintainance ’ programming , and you have , at that point , a very small application that suffers from none of the problems of large applications .
For instance , achieving OAOO is very easy when you are writing the code for the first time .
Even if you do produce duplication , it ’s very easy to keep track of , and you have n’t yet suffered the pain of not obeying OAOO .
You also have n’t had to worry about the finishing touches and tying up loose ends — it makes no sense to do them yet , so you rightly ignore that for now — but those finishing touches take time .
Nor have you had to worry about deployment etc .
The problem is that none of the above will help the more normal programmer to maintain that kind of productivity on a larger application .
The honeymoon period is soon over , and finding ways to remove duplication and write maintainable , flexible code with few defects becomes much harder .
Even the techniques that may have made the initial development phase so easy and productive may turn out to be the bane of your life ( such as copy - and - paste , and lots of the shortcuts and methodologies typically encouraged by PHP ) .
So , I ’m going to present to you an account of an application that took a lot longer than 20 minutes to write .
I intend to make it as balanced as possible .
What I ’ve been doing for 10 months Since September ( September 2nd , to be exact , according to my Subversion logs ) , I ’ve been working on a Django project in my spare time , and it ’s finally complete .
I ’ve kept a pretty complete log of my hours , split by activity , so I ’m hoping it will be of some use to those trying to make realistic estimations of coding time .
The project is now live at www.cciw.co.uk.
It is a website for a charity that runs outdoor Christian camps , which I ’ve been involved in all my life ( literally ! ) .
The website has all the details of the camps , camp sites , leaders etc , and a community of people who have been on the camps , based around a message board and photo gallery system .
[ Edit 2017 : the site is now quite different in emphasis since this article in 2006 , since the forums were removed after being killed by Facebook etc. , but it is still Django and still actively developed ] .
Until a few days ago , the website was running under PHP with a flatfile database .
The new website is mainly a re-implementation of the existing functionality , but I have added quite a few things and tidied quite a lot up , and I did n’t bother trying to salvage any of the existing PHP code by porting it — I wrote everything from scratch .
Aims
My main aims were : to get rid of the ropey old PHP code ( not to mention the flatfile database ) , and produce some clean , maintainable code .
code ( not to mention the flatfile database ) , and produce some clean , maintainable code .
to make it easy to moderate the message boards .
The main users of the website are 11 - 17 year olds , and the camps are strongly Christian in ethos and aims , so it ’s very important that the camp website is always a safe and fun place for the campers to interact .
to make the website manageable by other people instead of just me , and hopefully write myself out of the picture .
to add some fun new features .
to generally increase usability .
to get a reliable database , and a proper SQL one that would enable things like the ‘ stats roundups ’ I occasionally do .
one that would enable things like the ‘ stats roundups ’ I occasionally do .
to do some test driven web - development .
Hours I ’ve spent a total of 240 hours on the project , or about 6 working weeks .
That ’s quite a lot , and quite a bit more than you typically hear quoted for Django apps , but the project is probably fairly large compared to most of the ones you hear about :
It contains 22 database models , about 60 view functions ( which vary massively in size — a handful are straight generic views , some of the message board ones are moderately complex ) , 15 Atom feeds and a total of 56 template files .
It also has 14 custom template tags and various other bits and pieces as you would expect in a project of that size .
Also , the figure given above totals all my activities , including : learning Django ( and Python to some extent )
data migration ( a lot of it — I was careful to ensure none of the old message boards were lost , and some of them go back 6 years to an even older system .
I even managed to rewrite any embedded URLs in message board posts etc so that they are still correct )
design mockups ( I ’m not much of a designer , but I ’m the only person who is working on this ) , and then the actual designs in XHTML 1.0 strict , the highest quality stuff I ’ve done so far in terms of semantic HTML and clean CSS .
1.0 strict , the highest quality stuff I ’ve done so far in terms of semantic and clean .
all the setup and deployment issues ( setup was easy , but final deployment was harder because of a component I wrote that used the same database , and some of the same tables , but was deployed earlier , so I had to do a bit of a database merge ) .
a fair amount of content editing
oh , and writing the code ( models , views and templates ) , testing and debugging , which accounted for about 75 % of the time spent ( perhaps a little less , it ’s not always easy to divide up the time correctly ) .
In terms of code there are about 2000 lines of template code , 6000 lines of Python , and 900 lines of migration scripts ( done in Python ) .
I know LOC are n’t that accurate a measure of program size , but hopefully that ’s of some help .
Given those figures , it looks like I was reasonably productive — averaging over the complete time that comes to about 37 LOC / hour , which is reasonable .
I also have been careful to avoid cut - and - paste , which can be an easy way to get stuff done , ( and add LOC ) , but also an easy way to leave an unmaintainable mess behind !
The great design of Django , including things like template inheritance , and the power of the Python language makes it possible to really keep duplication to a minimum .
Some of the things that added to the development time were : trying to handle my existing data properly ( which added a fair amount of special casing etc )
changing Django APIs — which meant sometimes I had to rewrite , and sometimes I avoided features that I knew were not stable , and went for something that might not have been optimal just to crack on .
lack of ability in the design area
deciding to change to Postgres part way through ( though that was fairly trouble free )
and probably a bit of perfectionism .
I should also point out that the framework is more mature than when I started !
In fact , some of the things I coded have become part of Django — the hours where I was consciously hacking on Django itself I was careful to log separately , but nevertheless some of the code I wrote for CCIW ended being generic and has made it ’s way into the core framework — so that ’s code you wo n’t have to write if you start with Django now .
On the other hand , there are some things which would increase a realistic estimate of the coding time .
The main one is that for at least half of the code I was writing , especially the message board code , I had a very good idea of what I was doing , having implemented it once already , even if it was several years ago .
It ’s very difficult to measure the effect of this — although the python code I wrote bears very little resemblance superficially to the original PHP code , it is very likely that my subconscious knowledge of how it would work in general helped me a lot .
Analysis
I ’m quite pleased with my results !
I ’m not sure if I can really give a less biased view .
I normally find with programming that by the time I ’ve finished a project , I ’m already quite unhappy with the quality of the code , and I have a list of ‘ cleanup ’ TODOs , or even ‘ rewrite this large chunk of it ’
TODOs , which usually never get done .
By the time a few years have passed , I ’m downright ashamed .
So far I do n’t feel this way about any of the code — let ’s see how long that lasts !
The quality of the HTML is pleasing - the Django validator app I wrote ( development time not included ) made creating the entire site using only XHTML 1.0 strict really very easy — a task that I used to think was quite a challenge .
The only part that proved tricky was writing a bbcode parser that would accept anything the users can throw at it and always produce valid XHTML that matched what the user would expect to get .
In terms of visual design , I ’m reasonably pleased — though there are quite a few places that could do with a designer ’s eye .
And as for end user experience , I ca n’t really say yet .
I ’ve tried to slim down the interface and make the pages a bit simpler than they were before , but some new features , especially ‘ tagging ’ , have added more things back in .
[ Edit 2017 - the site has had several major visual revamps since this article was written ] .
In terms of making the website easy for other people to manage , Django ’s admin has solved pretty much all of that .
For the main models that other people will have to administer ( which are details of the camps we run , camp sites they run at and people who run them ) , it ’s astonishing how well the automatic admin functionality caters for it — it does a lot more than I would have managed to create if I were writing a custom admin interface manually .
I ’ve also made the website self - maintaining as much as possible — for instance , every year each camp that has just finished gets a new forum , and this now creates itself on first access .
The website also has a concept of the ‘ next year ’ , which depends on when camps finish etc , and the ‘ clock ’ for this ticks over automatically .
For moderation , everything now has a feed , so it is very easy to aggregate message board posts for the entire website , or for an individual user , and be aware of new topics etc .
I discovered some nice patterns while doing the Atom feed work — detailed below .
On a downside , I did very little test driven development .
I came to the conclusion that Django ’s view functions are very difficult to test .
They take complex objects and return complex objects , and their output is highly dependent on what is in the database , so you have to do a lot of set up first .
The view functions themselves often do very little — in fact some were just generic views , so testing them would just have been testing Django .
Some do quite a lot however , but what exactly they do will depend on the validity of input and data in the database etc .
I realised that unit tests are pretty inappropriate , but functional tests , using a tool like twill , would be perfect .
Unfortunately , after installing and playing around with twill , I never got around to writing tests with it , partly because of the pain of having to write setup code .
I know that other Djangoers have done good work here , but with time constraints this was the first thing to go .
I did , however , write tests the parts of the system which could be decoupled easily from the view functions — in particular most of the bbcode parser was developed in a test driven manner , which worked very well .
[ Edit 2017 - I now used django - functest for functional tests ]
Feeds I did n’t use Django ’s “ high level ” feed framework , as it did n’t fit very well , but the lower level one was just perfect for what I wanted .
Feeds are all available at URLs with ?
format=atom appended to the normal page .
To handle this , I ’ve got mini- framework involving a handle_feed_request ( ) function and base CCIWFeed class that inherits from feeds .
Feed .
With these in place ( 25 lines of code ) , my class for generating the feed for new message board posts , for example , looks like this : class PostFeed ( CCIWFeed ) : template_name = ' posts ' title = " CCIW message boards posts " ##
This is called by CCIWFeed.items ( ) def modify_query ( self , query_set ) : return query_set .
order_by ( '- posted_at ' ) [ : POST_FEED_MAX_ITEMS
] def item_author_name ( self , post ) : return post .
posted_by_id def item_author_link ( self , post ) : return add_domain ( get_member_href ( post . posted_by_id ) ) def item_pubdate ( self , post ) : return post .
posted_at ( Plus there are two templates to support this ) .
However , you can also get a PostFeed for a specific member — i.e. all posts that were created by that member .
The only thing that needs to change is the title , so the implementation is just the following : def member_post_feed ( member ) : " " " Returns a Feed class suitable for the posts of a specific member . " " " class MemberPostFeed ( PostFeed ) : title = " CCIW - Posts by %s " % member .
user_name return MemberPostFeed
The view code has to call member_post_feed ( ) with a specific member , and passes the generated class to the feed handling code .
It does n’t require a special view — it just requires two lines in the existing HTML view for a specific member ’s posts .
This pattern is repeated quite a number of times , and I think it is wonderfully elegant — it ’s so easy to see what it is supposed to do , and using a class in the same way you use closures is so expressive .
