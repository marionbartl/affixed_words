FALLUJAH – Three years after a devastating U.S. - led siege of the city , residents of Fallujah continue to struggle with a shattered economy and infrastructure and a lack of mobility .
The city that was routed in November 2004 is still suffering the worst humanitarian conditions under a siege that continues .
Although military actions are down to a minimum inside the city , local and U.S. authorities do not seem to be thinking of ending the agonies of the over 400,000 residents of Fallujah .
" You , people of the media , say things in Fallujah are good , " Mohammad Sammy , an aid worker for the Iraqi Red Crescent in Fallujah , told IPS .
" Then why do n’t you come and live in this paradise with us ?
It is so easy to say things for you , is n’t it ? "
His anger is due to the fact that the embattled city is still completely closed and surrounded by military checkpoints that make it look like an isolated island .
Those who are not genuine residents of the city are not granted the biometric identification badge from the U.S. Marines , and are thus not allowed to enter the city .
Since the November 2004 U.S. - led attack on the city , named Operation Phantom Fury , which left approximately 70 percent of the city destroyed , the U.S. military has required residents to undergo retina scans and finger - printings in order to gain a barcode for identification .
" This isolation has destroyed the economy of the city that was once one of the best in Iraq , " Professor Mohammad al - Dulaymi of al - Anbar University told IPS .
" All of the other cities in the province used to do their wholesale shopping in Fallujah , but now they have to find alternatives , leaving the cities businesses to starve . "
All of the residents interviewed by IPS were extremely angry with the media for recent reports that the situation in the city is good .
Many refused to be quoted for different reasons .
" Fallujah is probably the city that had the most of media coverage in the history of the occupation , " Hatam Jawad , a school headmaster in Fallujah , told IPS .
" People are tired of shouting and appearing on TV to complain , without feeling any change in their sorrowful living situation .
Some of them are afraid of police revenge for telling the truth . "
Many residents told IPS that U.S. - backed Iraqi police and army personnel have detained people who have spoken to the media .
" I am not going to tell you whether it is good or bad to be a Fallujah resident , " 55 - year - old lawyer , Shakir Naji , told IPS .
" Why do n’t you just ask what the prices of essential materials are and judge for yourself ?
Kerosene for heating is almost one U.S. dollar per liter , a jar of propane gas is $ 15 , and it is not winter yet , when the prices will definitely be doubled . "
Water and electricity services are at a minimum in the city .
An Oxfam International report released in July found that 70 percent of Iraqis do not have access to safe drinking water .
Since the November 2004 siege , entire neighborhoods remain totally destroyed , and with no water or electricity .
Most of the businesses in Fallujah remain closed .
" We depend upon the private sector for electricity , " Fatima Saed , a woman whose husband was detained in 2005 and has not been released yet , told IPS .
" In my situation , to pay $ 50 a month [ for electricity ] is a disaster because I have to cut it from the quantity and quality of food that I buy for myself and my kids . "
The Oxfam report also stated , " At the beginning of May 2007 , the Central Office for Statistics and Information Technology ( COSIT ) , part of the Iraqi Ministry of Planning , released a survey highlighting the fact that 43 percent of Iraqis suffer from ‘ absolute poverty ’ .
The poverty of many families is rooted in unemployment , which affects probably more than 50 percent of the workforce . "
Fallujah General Hospital , situated across the Euphrates River from the city , is still functioning , but with a minimal number of specialist doctors and medical supplies .
The only doctor who would speak to IPS did not want his name published .
" The manager of this hospital is a good man and he is trying hard to improve the services , but the Ministry of Health in Baghdad still treats us here as a bunch of terrorists .
We are suffering both corruption from the ministry and ignorance about al - Anbar province from this ( Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ) administration , " he explained .
" We do not have enough medicines , and the equipment brought to us by contractors is still in boxes and seems to be part of the corrupt contracts of the province .
It is impossible to work under such conditions . "
People coming for treatment or surgery in the hospital appeared desperate to get their essential needs met .
" We have to buy cotton , bandages , medicines , and all we need from private pharmacies , " 35 - year - old Muath Tahir , a teacher who had his appendix removed three days earlier , told IPS .
" Those who can manage would go to the private hospital for better treatment , but my $ 230 salary is not even enough for my daily needs .
This city has become impossible to live in . "
There ’s nothing like the freedom to move and live where we want .
Perhaps the greatest expression of postmodern mobility is when transportation devices are combined with living spaces .
Creative portable living solutions can blend with urban surroundings , be adapted to different individuals or can be the epitome of over - the - top luxury .
This strange vehicle might look like a reconfigured garbage truck but it is actually an off - road luxury living vehicle – a converted mobile home .
The series of Unicats are complete with top - of - the - line beds , bathrooms , kitchens and storage space and can travel on rough terrain .
At the same time , they really do look like garbage trucks and can blend perfectly into an urban setting for mobile downtown parties .
The A - Z Wagon Stations are designed for maximum flexibility .
Within a fixed shape the outside can be decorated and the interiors can be infinitely reconfigured and personalized by the owner and occupant .
Some users have taken them and created plush lounges equipped with sound systems and others have created spartan and well - organized workspaces .
There is no mistaking this 2.5 million dollar mobile home for anything but the luxury liner of portable housing .
An entire sports car neatly slides into the undercarriage and the interior looks like it could be the cockpit and living quarters of a futuristic space ship .
The real question is : would you be willing to spend a mansion ’s ransom on this and then be brave enough to take it on the road ?
In a press conference today , President Bush reiterated that " we believe in a strong dollar policy , " but he could have fooled us , considering what 's happened to the greenback .
The dollar 's ravaging continues today , and the news only seems to get worse .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has clearly sparked more selling with his comments about potential bank failures and judgment that current challenges exceed that of the 2001 - 2002 slowdown period .
Standard & Poor 's earlier today said the U.S. 's credit profile could come under threat if consumers and businesses continue to pull back on spending , and analysts say certain central banks around the world are welcoming dollar weakness as a way to offset higher commodity costs .
Let 's say it this way -- it was a big deal a while back when the Canadian dollar reached parity with the U.S. dollar .
But if the current trend continues , pretty soon the Australian dollar will buy $ 1 as well -- it was lately at $ 0.9484 .
The euro , meanwhile , was closing in on $ 1.52 , and the dollar is in danger of falling below 105 yen .
Something like this .
Four women who worked for Houston - based Halliburton Co. 's former subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root have filed federal lawsuits against the companies , claiming they endured sexual harassment and , in two cases rape , while working in Iraq .
Attorneys say their clients encountered a sexually - charged atmosphere where women were repeatedly demeaned and solicited for sex despite reporting harassment to supervisors .
The lawyers for women in the alleged rape cases say they are turning to the civil courts in part because they have n't been able to determine whether federal authorities are pursuing criminal prosecutions .
KBR would not comment specifically on the cases , but a spokeswoman said sexual harassment is barred .
Before being deployed to Iraq , all KBR employees are briefed on the company 's code of business conduct , which " strictly prohibits sexual harassment by KBR employees , " said KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne .
Halliburton spokeswoman Cathy Mann said her company " is improperly named " in the lawsuits .
Halliburton and KBR split earlier this year .
Experts say they fear that untold numbers of crimes by civilian contractors have not been prosecuted because of ambiguities over which judicial system to apply to U.S. civilians working in a foreign war zone .
"
You are using more and more contractors and yet you 've created a legal netherworld where there 's , at the least , a lack of accountability , " said Peter W. Singer , a fellow with the Brookings Institution and author of the book Corporate Warriors .
" At the same time you 're paying contractors more and than you pay soldiers yet you 're holding soldiers to higher standards .
" United States Department of Justice spokesman Bryan Sierra said U.S. attorneys recently told Congress that only three criminal cases have been prosecuted .
He did not say why U.S. attorneys have not prosecuted more cases .
Singer said it is largely due to jurisdictional problems .
The plaintiffs in the lawsuits say the culture among the largely male dominated contractor population was hostile to women when they worked there in 2004 and 2005 .
In court papers filed in May , a married Conroe woman said that she needed surgery to repair torn muscles and ruptured breast implants after she was drugged and brutally raped by a drunken co-worker and other men , firefighters , in a coed dorm at Camp Hope in Baghdad in July 2005 .
A rape kit taken shortly after she awoke included DNA from a man who was sleeping in her bed as well as other unknown " John Doe " suspects , according to the lawsuit filed by Houston attorney Todd Kelly .
" This attack never would have occurred but for the ' boys will be boys ' attitude that permeated the environment that defendants first created , then failed to warn ( the woman ) about ?
an environment that was excused , if not encouraged , and of which the defendants had ample prior notice , " states the suit , filed on May 30 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in Beaumont .
Kelly is representing the Conroe woman , then 20 , as well as a married North Carolina woman who filed a suit in May alleging that she was nearly raped in a separate 2005 incident .
In another lawsuit filed in January in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida , a woman alleges that she was raped by a drunken male KBR employee at an apartment in Ramadi , Iraq , in December 2005 .
On Tuesday , an Oklahoma woman filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma , claiming she was fired in October 2005 for reporting sexual harassment .
The Chronicle is not naming the women because they say they are victims of sex crimes .
Each woman is seeking unspecified damages .
Their lawyers say the problems were exacerbated because KBR permitted the consumption of alcohol in barracks .
And even when it banned alcohol later in 2005 , the company did little to stop its employees from drinking in living quarters , said said John Spiegel , a Miami attorney representing a Florida woman .
That suit states that the woman was raped by a drunk coworker who entered her room with a stolen key .
But KBR 's Browne said the company does not permit alcohol in its living quarters and it " does fully investigate improper conduct including any allegations of sexual harassment .
" The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , however , found that KBR 's investigation into the Conroe woman 's allegation was " inadequate and did not effect an adequate remedy , " according to a May 8 letter from the EEOC 's Houston District Director R.J. Ruff Jr.KBR told EEOC officials that the male accused in the rape claimed that the woman " consented to have sex with him , " according to the EEOC letter .
Lawyers for the alleged rape victims say KBR , Halliburton and federal authorities have refused to say whether their alleged attackers will face criminal charges or whether they are still in Iraq .
All of the women have stopped working for the company .
'' Our client is left with the continuing fear her attacker is walking the streets free and may attack her again , '' said Spiegel , the attorney [ URL " www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4932496.html " ;]

All net firms keep an eye on how much people download UK net firms are resisting government suggestions that they should do more to monitor what customers do online .
The industry association for net providers said legal and technical barriers prohibit them from being anything other than a " mere conduit " .
The declaration comes as the government floats the idea of persistent pirates being denied net access .
And in the US one net supplier has admitted to " degrading " traffic from some file - sharing networks .
Traffic control
Net firms have been stung into defining their position by the emergence this week of a draft government consultation document that suggests ISPs should be drafted in to the fight against piracy .
It suggested that people who persistently download and share copyrighted material could have their net access removed .
A spokesman for the Internet Service Providers Association ( ISPA ) said the 2002 E - Commerce Regulations defined net firms as " mere conduits " and not responsible for the contents of the traffic flowing across their networks .
If they did n't do traffic management we would all complain
Gavin Johns , Epitiro
He added that other laws on surveillance explicitly prohibited ISPs from inspecting the contents of data packets unless forced to do so by a warrant .
The spokesman said technical issues also made it hard for net firms to take action against specific types of traffic .
For instance , he said , while some people use peer - to - peer networks to download copyrighted material many commercial services , such as Napster and the BBC 's iPlayer , use file - sharing technology to distribute music and TV legally .
In the US , Comcast admitted in documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission that it does " degrade " some traffic from peer - to - peer networks .
The spokesman added : " We know that all ISPs are involved in traffic management but that is to optimise the service for all their customers . "
A spokesman for Virgin Media said its traffic management system came into play during peak times - between 1600 and 2100 .
Action was taken against any customer whose usage exceeded a limit associated with their tariff during that five hour window , he said .
" If you exceed that threshold we will drop your speed for five hours from when the excess is recorded , " he said .
Browsing speeds are most often managed during the busiest times Andrew Ferguson , an editor at Think Broadband , said net service firms manage their bandwidth in many different ways .
Almost all , he said , manage traffic but at certain times impose other systems to smooth out the peaks .
" Some firms will happily let you use as much as you like but will charge you accordingly , and business products that are more expensive often allow unlimited use , " he said .
Others impose charges on customers who regularly exceed their download limits and a few manage their system so users cannot exceed a monthly download cap .
The limits that firms impose can also vary widely .
" Any ISP that does not do traffic management is not going to stay in business very long , " said Gavin Johns , managing director of net management firm Epitiro .
He said it was essential to ensure that services which have to be delivered in real time , such as voice and streaming video , were usable .
" Different applications use different ports and have different payloads , " said Mr Johns , " They look completely different from a network point of view . "
" If they did n't do traffic management we would all complain , " he said .
Mr Ferguson from Think Broadband said although traffic management was common , net providers imposed it in contrasting ways .
" What varies is the degree it impacts users and the openness of providers in telling users it exists and what is and is not managed , " he told the BBC News website .
" Traffic management has a poor reputation as in many cases it is used to keep bandwidth costs down for a provider with little respect to the consumers ' wishes , " he said .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Ghanaian President John Kufuor will visit Kenya next week in an attempt to break the country ’s political deadlock and end its explosion of ethnic violence , his foreign minister said on Saturday .
The mission by Kufuor , chair of the African Union , to a nation swept by tribal clashes since a December 27 election the opposition says was rigged , had appeared to have been abandoned on Friday after Kenyan authorities rejected the idea .
But Kenya ’s deputy foreign minister Moses Wetangula flew to Ghana for talks on Saturday , and Ghanaian Foreign Minister Akwasi Osei-Adjei told Reuters that embattled Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki , official election winner , had now approved the trip .
“ The Kenya president is inviting President Kufuor in his position as the AU chairman to visit that country to assess the situation and advise ... he is going there next week to talk to both sides on ways of ending the violence , ” he said .
“ I must emphasise that we are not going to go there immediately to validate the election results as to who has won or not . ”
Earlier on Saturday , Kibaki said he was ready to form a national unity government to end riots and political bloodletting that have killed at least 300 people and forced 250,000 from their homes .
The opposition said the offer changed nothing , Kibaki should step down and only internationally - mediated talks would end the crisis .
“ The country is burning .
We ’re extremely distressed that this government has put roadblocks in the way of President Kufuor coming here more quickly , ” said Salim Lone , spokesman for Kibaki ’s rival Odinga .
A spokesman for Kibaki ’s team said he could not immediately comment on what had caused the hold - up in Kufuor ’s visit .
He said he had just returned from Rift Valley -- where some of the worst tribal clashes have taken place -- and repeated the government ’s allegation that the violence was “ genocide ” planned before the polls by opposition leaders .
DISTRUST
The United Nations says the unrest has uprooted 250,000 people , and that many in the west are facing starvation after fleeing violence that included the burning to death of 30 people barricaded in a church .
World powers have been horrified by the bloodshed in what had been seen as one of Africa ’s most stable democracies .
On Saturday , U.S. envoy Jendayi Frazer met both men , shortly before Kibaki unveiled his offer of a unity government .

Odinga had looked on course to win the vote until Kibaki was handed a narrow victory last Sunday .
International observers say the election fell short of democratic standards .
The opposition appeared to have ruled out a national unity government even before Kibaki ’s statement .
“ We know how governments of national unity operate .
We have been there before with Kibaki .
That is a way to cheat Kenyans of their rights , ” Odinga said .

Odinga helped Kibaki win power in a 2002 election , but says the president then broke a promise to award him a new prime minister ’s position .
Their mutual distrust is a key obstacle to ending the standoff .
Meeting Frazer , Odinga reiterated his demand that a transitional government be formed ahead of new presidential vote within three to six months .
Kibaki was sworn in at his residence on Sunday just an hour after the results were announced .
Opposition anger exploded around the country in demonstrations and tribal killings that mostly only subsided on Friday .
The crisis in Kenya , a regional business and transport hub , has already hurt neighbouring countries .
Uganda , Rwanda and Burundi are all suffering fuel shortages .
Credit Robert Zoellick for knowing how to put the best face on a profound embarrassment .
On Friday , the World Bank president announced in a press release that the bank had " joined forces " with the government of India to " fight fraud and corruption " in that country 's health sector .
This is happening at the same time that Mr. Zoellick 's colleagues are hounding bank anticorruption chief Suzanne Rich Folsom , the person primarily responsible for bringing the scandals to light .

Bottom trawling for fish stirs up billowing plumes of sediment that can be seen from space and destroys entire seafloor ecosystems , new imagery reveals .
The technique , used all over the world , is a way to catch fish in deeper parts of the ocean with huge , deep nets , now that many near - shore fish populations have been virtually wiped out from over - fishing .
Several studies have shown the significant impact that trawling has on ecosystems , killing corals , sponges , fish and other animals .
New and previously released satellite images show the extent of the plumes of material kicked up .
And a video of the seafloor reveals how trawling denudes an underwater world .
" Bottom trawling is the most destructive of any actions that humans conduct in the ocean , " said zoologist Les Watling of the University of Hawaii .
" Ten years ago , Elliott Norse [ of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute ] and I calculated that , each year , worldwide , bottom trawlers drag an area equivalent to twice the lower 48 states .
Most of that trawling happens in deep waters , out of sight .
But now we can more clearly envision what trawling impacts down there by looking at the sediment plumes that are shallow enough for us to see from satellites . "
Watling presented his findings Friday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston .
Persistent plumes
As nets are dragged across the seafloor , they can crush coral reefs , drag boulders across the bottom , and trap fish and animals not intended to be caught , called bycatch .
All this activity stirs up sediments from the seafloor , which create the persistent plumes in the wake of the fishing ships .
Watling and his colleagues say that the plumes visible in satellite images are likely just the " tip of the iceberg " as most trawling is in waters that are deep enough that the plume remains hidden by the water above .
" Bottom trawling repeatedly plows up the seafloor over large areas of the ocean , " said fellow presenter John Amos of SkyTruth , a digital mapping non-profit group aimed at environment issues based in West Virginia .
( Images of these plumes can be seen on the group 's website . )
Bans and restrictions Scientific studies showing the impacts that trawling has on ecosystems have led to increasing restrictions on the practice .
In 2005 , the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean banned trawling there below depths of 1,000 meters ( 3 , 289 feet ) .
The United States closed large deep - sea areas off the coast of Alaska to bottom trawling in 2006 .
Many South Pacific nations have also put a stop to the practice , and the United Nations began deliberations on a trawling moratorium in the high seas in 2006 .
But there are still tens of thousands of trawlers operating in the Gulf of Mexico , off the coast of many Latin American countries , off the west coast of Africa , in Chinese waters , and the North Sea .
" We 're a long way from protecting the ocean floor from bottom trawling , " Norse told LiveScience .

Global confidence in the US economy has reached zero , as was proved by last month ’s stock market meltdown .
But there is an enormous anomaly in the US economy above and beyond the subprime mortgage crisis , the housing bubble and the prospect of recession : 60 years of misallocation of resources , and borrowings , to the establishment and maintenance of a military - industrial complex as the basis of the nation ’s economic life
The military adventurers in the Bush administration have much in common with the corporate leaders of the defunct energy company Enron .
Both groups thought that they were the “ smartest guys in the room ” — the title of Alex Gibney ’s prize - winning film on what went wrong at Enron .
The neoconservatives in the White House and the Pentagon outsmarted themselves .
They failed even to address the problem of how to finance their schemes of imperialist wars and global domination .
As a result , going into 2008 , the United States finds itself in the anomalous position of being unable to pay for its own elevated living standards or its wasteful , overly large military establishment .
Its government no longer even attempts to reduce the ruinous expenses of maintaining huge standing armies , replacing the equipment that seven years of wars have destroyed or worn out , or preparing for a war in outer space against unknown adversaries .
Instead , the Bush administration puts off these costs for future generations to pay or repudiate .
This fiscal irresponsibility has been disguised through many manipulative financial schemes ( causing poorer countries to lend us unprecedented sums of money ) , but the time of reckoning is fast approaching .
There are three broad aspects to the US debt crisis .
First , in the current fiscal year ( 2008 ) we are spending insane amounts of money on “ defence ” projects that bear no relation to the national security of the US .
We are also keeping the income tax burdens on the richest segment of the population at strikingly low levels .
Second , we continue to believe that we can compensate for the accelerating erosion of our base and our loss of jobs to foreign countries through massive military expenditures — “ military Keynesianism ” ( which I discuss in detail in my book Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic ) .
By that , I mean the mistaken belief that public policies focused on frequent wars , huge expenditures on weapons and munitions , and large standing armies can indefinitely sustain a wealthy capitalist economy .
The opposite is actually true .
Third , in our devotion to militarism ( despite our limited resources ) , we are failing to invest in our social infrastructure and other requirements for the long - term health of the US .
These are what economists call opportunity costs , things not done because we spent our money on something else .
Our public education system has deteriorated alarmingly .
We have failed to provide health care to all our citizens and neglected our responsibilities as the world ’s number one polluter .
Most important , we have lost our competitiveness as a manufacturer for civilian needs , an infinitely more efficient use of scarce resources than arms manufacturing .
Fiscal disaster
It is virtually impossible to overstate the profligacy of what our government spends on the military .
The Department of Defense ’s planned expenditures for the fiscal year 2008 are larger than all other nations ’ military budgets combined .
The supplementary budget to pay for the current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , not part of the official defence budget , is itself larger than the combined military budgets of Russia and China .
Defence - related spending for fiscal 2008 will exceed $ 1 trillion for the first time in history .
The US has become the largest single seller of arms and munitions to other nations on Earth .
Leaving out President Bush ’s two on - going wars , defence spending has doubled since the mid-1990s .
The defence budget for fiscal 2008 is the largest since the second world war .
Before we try to break down and analyse this gargantuan sum , there is one important caveat .
Figures on defence spending are notoriously unreliable .
The numbers released by the Congressional Reference Service and the Congressional Budget Office do not agree with each other .
Robert Higgs , senior fellow for political economy at the Independent Institute , says : “ A well - founded rule of thumb is to take the Pentagon ’s ( always well publicised ) basic budget total and double it ” ( 1 ) .
Even a cursory reading of newspaper articles about the Department of Defense will turn up major differences in statistics about its expenses .
Some 30 - 40 % of the defence budget is “ black ” , ” meaning that these sections contain hidden expenditures for classified projects .
There is no possible way to know what they include or whether their total amounts are accurate .
There are many reasons for this budgetary sleight - of - hand — including a desire for secrecy on the part of the president , the secretary of defence , and the military - industrial complex — but the chief one is that members of Congress , who profit enormously from defence jobs and pork - barrel projects in their districts , have a political interest in supporting the Department of Defense .
In 1996 , in an attempt to bring accounting standards within the executive branch closer to those of the civilian economy , Congress passed the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act .
It required all federal agencies to hire outside auditors to review their books and release the results to the public .
Neither the Department of Defense , nor the Department of Homeland Security , has ever complied .
Congress has complained , but not penalised either department for ignoring the law .
All numbers released by the Pentagon should be regarded as suspect .
In discussing the fiscal 2008 defence budget , as released on 7 February 2007 , I have been guided by two experienced and reliable analysts : William D Hartung of the New America Foundation ’s Arms and Security Initiative ( 2 ) They agree that the Department of Defense requested $ 481.4bn for salaries , operations ( except in Iraq and Afghanistan ) , and equipment .
They also agree on a figure of $ 141.7bn for the “ supplemental ” budget to fight the global war on terrorism — that is , the two on - going wars that the general public may think are actually covered by the basic Pentagon budget .
The Department of Defense also asked for an extra $ 93.4bn to pay for hitherto unmentioned war costs in the remainder of 2007 and , most creatively , an additional “ allowance ” ( a new term in defence budget documents ) of $ 50 bn to be charged to fiscal year 2009 .
This makes a total spending request by the Department of Defense of $ 766.5 bn .
But there is much more .
In an attempt to disguise the true size of the US military empire , the government has long hidden major military - related expenditures in departments other than Defense .
For example , $ 23.4bn for the Department of Energy goes towards developing and maintaining nuclear warheads ; and $ 25.3bn in the Department of State budget is spent on foreign military assistance ( primarily for Israel , Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , the United Arab Republic , Egypt and Pakistan ) .
Another $ 1.03 bn outside the official Department of Defense budget is now needed for recruitment and re-enlistment incentives for the overstretched US military , up from a mere $ 174 m in 2003 , when the war in Iraq began .
The Department of Veterans Affairs currently gets at least $ 75.7bn , 50 % of it for the long - term care of the most seriously injured among the 28,870 soldiers so far wounded in Iraq and 1,708 in Afghanistan .
The amount is universally derided as inadequate .
Another $ 46.4bn goes to the Department of Homeland Security .
Missing from this compilation is $ 1.9bn to the Department of Justice for the paramilitary activities of the FBI ; $ 38.5 bn to the Department of the Treasury for the Military Retirement Fund ; $ 7.6bn for the military - related activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ; and well over $ 200 bn in interest for past debt - financed defence outlays .
This brings US spending for its military establishment during the current fiscal year , conservatively calculated , to at least $ 1.1 trillion .
Military Keynesianism
Such expenditures are not only morally obscene , they are fiscally unsustainable .
Many neo-conservatives and poorly informed patriotic Americans believe that , even though our defence budget is huge , we can afford it because we are the richest country on Earth .
That statement is no longer true .
The world ’s richest political entity , according to the CIA ’s World Factbook , is the European Union .
The EU ’s 2006 GDP was estimated to be slightly larger than that of the US .
Moreover , China ’s 2006 GDP was only slightly smaller than that of the US , and Japan was the world ’s fourth richest nation .
A more telling comparison that reveals just how much worse we ’re doing can be found among the current accounts of various nations .
The current account measures the net trade surplus or deficit of a country plus cross - border payments of interest , royalties , dividends , capital gains , foreign aid , and other income .
In order for Japan to manufacture anything , it must import all required raw materials .
Even after this incredible expense is met , it still has an $ 88 bn per year trade surplus with the US and enjoys the world ’s second highest current account balance ( China is number one ) .
The US is number 163 — last on the list , worse than countries such as Australia and the UK that also have large trade deficits .
Its 2006 current account deficit was $ 811.5 bn ; second worst was Spain at $ 106.4bn .
This is unsustainable .
It ’s not just that our tastes for foreign goods , including imported oil , vastly exceed our ability to pay for them .
We are financing them through massive borrowing .
On 7 November 2007 , the US Treasury announced that the national debt had breached _$9 trillion for the first time .
This was just five weeks after Congress raised the “ debt ceiling ” to $ 9.815 trillion .
If you begin in 1789 , at the moment the constitution became the supreme law of the land , the debt accumulated by the federal government did not top $ 1 trillion until 1981 .
When George Bush became president in January 2001 , it stood at approximately $ 5.7 trillion .
Since then , it has increased by 45 % .
This huge debt can be largely explained by our defence expenditures .
The top spenders
The world ’s top 10 military spenders and the approximate amounts each currently budgets for its military establishment are :
Rank Country Military budget 1 . United States ( FY 2008 budget ) $ 623bn 2 . China ( 2004 ) $ 65 bn 3 . Russia $ 50bn 4 . France ( 2005 ) $ 45 bn 5 . United Kingdom $ 42.8bn 6 . Japan ( 2007 ) $ 41.75bn
7 . Germany ( 2003 ) $ 35.1bn 8 . Italy ( 2003 ) $ 28.2bn 9 . South Korea ( 2003 ) $ 21.1 bn 10 .
India ( 2005 est. ) $ 19bn World total military expenditures ( 2004 est ) $ 1,100bn World total ( minus the US ) $ 500bn
Our excessive military expenditures did not occur over just a few short years or simply because of the Bush administration ’s policies .
They have been going on for a very long time in accordance with a superficially plausible ideology , and have now become so entrenched in our democratic political system that they are starting to wreak havoc .
This is military Keynesianism — the determination to maintain a permanent war economy and to treat military output as an ordinary economic product , even though it makes no contribution to either production or consumption .
This ideology goes back to the first years of the cold war .
During the late 1940s , the US was haunted by economic anxieties .
The great depression of the 1930s had been overcome only by the war production boom of the second world war .
With peace and demobilisation , there was a pervasive fear that the depression would return .
During 1949 , alarmed by the Soviet Union ’s detonation of an atomic bomb , the looming Communist victory in the Chinese civil war , a domestic recession , and the lowering of the Iron Curtain around the USSR ’s European satellites , the US sought to draft basic strategy for the emerging cold war .
The result was the militaristic National Security Council Report 68 ( NSC - 68 ) drafted under the supervision of Paul Nitze , then head of the Policy Planning Staff in the State Department .
Dated 14 April 1950 and signed by President Harry S Truman on 30 September 1950 , it laid out the basic public economic policies that the US pursues to the present day .
In its conclusions , NSC - 68 asserted : “ One of the most significant lessons of our World War II experience was that the American economy , when it operates at a level approaching full efficiency , can provide enormous resources for purposes other than civilian consumption while simultaneously providing a high standard of living ” ( 3 ) .
With this understanding , US strategists began to build up a massive munitions industry , both to counter the military might of the Soviet Union ( which they consistently overstated ) and also to maintain full employment , as well as ward off a possible return of the depression .
The result was that , under Pentagon leadership , entire new industries were created to manufacture large aircraft , nuclear - powered submarines , nuclear warheads , intercontinental ballistic missiles , and surveillance and communications satellites .
This led to what President Eisenhower warned against in his farewell address of 6 February 1961 : “ The conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience ” — the military - industrial complex .
By 1990 the value of the weapons , equipment and factories devoted to the Department of Defense was 83 % of the value of all plants and equipment in US manufacturing .
From 1947 to 1990 , the combined US military budgets amounted to $ 8.7 trillion .
Even though the Soviet Union no longer exists , US reliance on military Keynesianism has , if anything , ratcheted up , thanks to the massive vested interests that have become entrenched around the military establishment .
Over time , a commitment to both guns and butter has proven an unstable configuration .
Military industries crowd out the civilian economy and lead to severe economic weaknesses .
Devotion to military Keynesianism is a form of slow economic suicide .
Higher spending , fewer jobs
On 1 May 2007 , the Center for Economic and Policy Research of Washington , DC , released a study prepared by the economic and political forecasting company Global Insight on the long - term economic impact of increased military spending .
Guided by economist Dean Baker , this research showed that , after an initial demand stimulus , by about the sixth year the effect of increased military spending turns negative .
The US economy has had to cope with growing defence spending for more than 60 years .
Baker found that , after 10 years of higher defence spending , there would be 464,000 fewer jobs than in a scenario that involved lower defence spending .
Baker concluded : “ It is often believed that wars and military spending increases are good for the economy .
In fact , most economic models show that military spending diverts resources from productive uses , such as consumption and investment , and ultimately slows economic growth and reduces employment ” ( 4 ) .
These are only some of the many deleterious effects of military Keynesianism .
It was believed that the US could afford both a massive military establishment and a high standard of living , and that it needed both to maintain full employment .
But it did not work out that way .
By the 1960s it was becoming apparent that turning over the nation ’s largest manufacturing enterprises to the Department of Defense and producing goods without any investment or consumption value was starting to crowd out civilian economic activities .
The historian Thomas E Woods Jr observes that , during the 1950s and 1960s , between one - third and two - thirds of all US research talent was siphoned off into the military sector ( 5 ) .
It is , of course , impossible to know what innovations never appeared as a result of this diversion of resources and brainpower into the service of the military , but it was during the 1960s that we first began to notice Japan was outpacing us in the design and quality of a range of consumer goods , including household electronics and automobiles .
Can we reverse the trend ?
Nuclear weapons furnish a striking illustration of these anomalies .
Between the 1940s and 1996 , the US spent at least $ 5.8 trillion on the development , testing and construction of nuclear bombs .
By 1967 , the peak year of its nuclear stockpile , the US possessed some 32,500 deliverable atomic and hydrogen bombs , none of which , thankfully , was ever used .
They perfectly illustrate the Keynesian principle that the government can provide make - work jobs to keep people employed .
Nuclear weapons were not just America ’s secret weapon , but also its secret economic weapon .
As of 2006 , we still had 9,960 of them .
There is today no sane use for them , while the trillions spent on them could have been used to solve the problems of social security and health care , quality education and access to higher education for all , not to speak of the retention of highly - skilled jobs within the economy .
The pioneer in analysing what has been lost as a result of military Keynesianism was the late Seymour Melman ( 1917 - 2004 ) , a professor of industrial engineering and operations research at Columbia University .
His 1970 book , Pentagon Capitalism : The Political Economy of War , was a prescient analysis of the unintended consequences of the US preoccupation with its armed forces and their weaponry since the onset of the cold war .
Melman wrote : “ From 1946 to 1969 , the United States government spent over $ 1,000bn on the military , more than half of this under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations — the period during which the [ Pentagon - dominated ] state management was established as a formal institution .
This sum of staggering size ( try to visualize a billion of something ) does not express the cost of the military establishment to the nation as a whole .
The true cost is measured by what has been foregone , by the accumulated deterioration in many facets of life , by the inability to alleviate human wretchedness of long duration . ”
In an important exegesis on Melman ’s relevance to the current American economic situation , Thomas Woods writes : “ According to the US Department of Defense , during the four decades from 1947 through 1987 it used ( in 1982 dollars ) $ 7.62 trillion in capital resources .
In 1985 , the Department of Commerce estimated the value of the nation ’s plant and equipment , and infrastructure , at just over _$ 7.29 trillion …
The amount spent over that period could have doubled the American capital stock or modernized and replaced its existing stock ” ( 6 ) .
The fact that we did not modernise or replace our capital assets is one of the main reasons why , by the turn of the 21st century , our manufacturing base had all but evaporated .
Machine tools , an industry on which Melman was an authority , are a particularly important symptom .
In November 1968 , a five - year inventory disclosed “ that 64 % of the metalworking machine tools used in US industry were 10 years old or older .
The age of this industrial equipment ( drills , lathes , etc. ) marks the United States ’ machine tool stock as the oldest among all major industrial nations , and it marks the continuation of a deterioration process that began with the end of the second world war .
This deterioration at the base of the industrial system certifies to the continuous debilitating and depleting effect that the military use of capital and research and development talent has had on American industry . ”
Nothing has been done since 1968 to reverse these trends and it shows today in our massive imports of equipment — from medical machines like _proton accelerators for radiological therapy ( made primarily in Belgium , Germany , and Japan ) to cars and trucks .
Our short tenure as the world ’s lone superpower has come to an end .
As Harvard economics professor Benjamin Friedman has written : “ Again and again it has always been the world ’s leading lending country that has been the premier country in terms of political influence , diplomatic influence and cultural influence .
It ’s no accident that we took over the role from the British at the same time that we took over the job of being the world ’s leading lending country .
Today we are no longer the world ’s leading lending country .
In fact we are now the world ’s biggest debtor country , and we are continuing to wield influence on the basis of military prowess alone ” ( 7 ) .
Some of the damage can never be rectified .
There are , however , some steps that the US urgently needs to take .
These include reversing Bush ’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts for the wealthy , beginning to liquidate our global empire of over 800 military bases , cutting from the defence budget all projects that bear no relationship to national security and ceasing to use the defence budget as a Keynesian jobs programme .
If we do these things we have a chance of squeaking by .
If we do n’t , we face probable national insolvency and a long depression .
At the ABC Debate on Saturday night , the moderator asked the Republicans about how they would address an issue truly affecting nearly every American almost daily–rising gas prices .
The other candidates talked about things like alternative fuels , getting us off the dependence on foreign oil , and increasing investment in technology .
They also “ addressed ” the issue of gas prices by talking about global warming and greenhouse gases , how the oil companies were paying more to protect themselves in lawsuits than on research , and how high gas prices helped fund terrorists .
I 'm sorry , but what in Obama does this have to do with actually fixing the problem of surging gas prices ?
Ron Paul was a doctor for many years .
In that career he could have lost his job or killed a patient if he failed to accurately diagnose and actually address the real problem .
The devotion and dedication he demonstrated to each individual patient in the past is much the same as the commitment he shows to each individual American and their rights now .
His previous job experience and this devotion has made it impossible for him to dodge diagnosing and addressing real issues even today .
Which is why when he was asked about the gas price problem , instead of engaging in ridiculous political speak , he quoted the Wall Street Journal .
The Journal ran an article showing that gas prices were n't rising as rapidly anywhere else in the world .
Only in America .
Why ?
You see , the cost of gas is n't rising , the value of the dollar is decreasing .
Like I explained to my dad , the value of oil has n't increased , it just takes a lot more dollars to buy the same amount because the dollar is worth less .
This issue is n't discussed openly because it does n't resonate with voters the way issues like “ free health care ” or “ securing our borders ” or “ protecting us from terrorists ” do .
How many Americans even realize that the U.S. dollar is worth less than a Canadian Dollar ?
Using the Canadian Dollar as the benchmark , how many people know that after the terrorist attacks on 9/11 the dollar was stronger than it was in 2000 ?
How many people realize that in 2002 , when the war in Iraq began , the value of our dollar began to decrease ?
It has n't stopped its decline since , and is now reaching historical lows .
As the data in the chart below indicates , it was n't the attacks of 9/11 that destroyed our dollar , it was our response to them .
Historic Exchange Rates
How many Americans fail to see the connection ?
How many people in our country do n't seem to understand why this matters ?
And most imporantly , how many presidential candidates are even discussing this issue ?
Ron Paul 's economic and monetary ideology are typically a punchline at best among political pundits with the level of sophistication along these lines :
“ Ron Paul wants to go back to the gold standard .
What 's next ?
Reducing dependency on foreign oil by getting rid or our cars and riding horses ? ”
These pundits are also starting to claim that Ron Paul offers a lot of ideology , but no practical real world solutions to the problems facing America .
These blanket statements influence common voters tremendously in a time when “ practical real world solution ” has become synonomous with “ government entitlement program . ”
These very real solutions Ron Paul supports are hard to grasp for the typical American who has little understanding of economic theory , monetary policy , or interest of anything foreign outside of why Europeans insist on calling soccer “ football . ”
They were probably watching football when this debate was on .
These same people are depending on Social Security for retirement and are scared to death when they hear these political experts tell them that “ Ron Paul wants to end Social Security . ”
Below is my humble attempt at explaining this complicated issue in a way the person I just described can easily understand .
Once understood , this person will also be able to see that the sky may indeed be falling , and that contrary to public opinion Ron Paul is the only candidate running on a platform that would SAVE Social Security until our country was healthy and prosperous enough that it was no longer needed ( which very likely would not be during Paul 's administration even if he were to become a two term president ) .
Monetary Policy and Consequences For Dummies ( like me )
Let 's assume that everyone in America could print their own money .
Or to make it easier , they could just go online to their personal checking account , type in whatever dollar amount they wanted , and that would be how much money had in the bank .
How much would a dollar then be worth ?
This is easy .
It would be worth next to nothing because what $ 1 once bought , it would now take millions to purchase the same good or service because there would be so many dollars .
But let 's change the scenario a little .
Let 's say that this creating of money out of thin air was introduced state by state in alphabetical order .
In other words , only residents of Alabama could print money for the first month , then Alaskans could join in a month later , then Arizona residents and so forth .
Who would benefit the most ?
The Alabamans would .
By the time Wyoming got into the mix , it probably would n't even be worth the bother .
In other words , the people who benefit under a system like this are the people who get to use the newly created money first .
Individuals in our country can't print their own money , but there is a private bank that can .
It 's called the Federal Reserve .
And they do .
And then they lend it to our government with interest .
There are nearly 26 dollars in circulation now for every 1 dollar in circulation in 1959 .
And the rate of printing this money is increasing .
In 2007 alone we printed more dollars than the total amount that existed in 1963 .
While the number of dollars has increased 26 fold , the population has n't even doubled over that same period .
Of course this works out fine for the government .
They get to spend the money first .
And it works out well for the special interest contractors who receive the money .
They are like Alaskans in our example .
The people are Wyoming .
To bring this down to simpler terms which also illustrates the long term consequences of this issue , when many families receive a new credit card in the mail , they feel as if they have “ free money . ”
So they spend it .
And then get another credit card .
Then they max out that card too .
And so it goes until they can no longer meet the minimum payments or get a new card .
When the creditors come calling , there are three ways they can pay off the debt .
One is to raise income .
But that is very difficult for an individual to do .
Another is to borrow money from grandma .
The third is to cut spending on things that the kids really loved and that may have seemed “ necessary ” when the “ free money ” was rolling in , but suddenly does n't seem as much so when the family is facing losing its car or home .
If they can't get more money , get it from grandma , or cut enough spending to pay the debt , they are forced to go bankrupt and then lose everything that really was important to them .
What is the connection here ?
The government has a never ending stream of “ free money ” printed by the Federal Reserve .
As you hopefully now understand , this “ free money ” hurts the individual citizen by devaluing his dollar .
Eventually this debt has to be repaid .
How can this happen ?
Unlike the individual citizen , the government can raise its income rather easily .
This is accomplished by raising taxes .
The second is to borrow from Granny .
The name of the Federal Government 's most benevolent Grandmother is China .
Although Granny may claim she expects the money back , China actually does –with interest .
What happens when Granny cuts us off and wants her money back ?
Well , the individual 's granny does n't have nukes to help her collect like our Government 's Granny does .
The third is to cut spending on things we just can't afford .
No matter how much the “ kids ” may like things like supporting foreign countries , propping up dictators to make us “ safe from terrorists ” , testing children annually to make sure they are n't left behind , providing Federal grants to send people to college , or the idea of free health care ; if we do n't give those things up we wo n't even be able to afford the things we really need –like a way to defend ourselves should Granny China decide to use non economic means to collect what she 's owed .
Ron Paul is the only candidate to offer a solution to this problem .
The first step is to stop activating all of those new credit cards .
This is why he would end the Federal Reserve and offers radical ideas like making sure our dollar is actually worth something .
The second is to cut out spending no matter how unpopular it is or how much the kids may cry about it .
None of this may seem like a major issue right now .
In fact , it does n't seem bad at all .
We are living the high life .
The “ leading ” GOP candidates are like the dads who earn 60,000 ( fiat pre-tax ) dollars who live in the suburbs , live in a house with an interest only adjustable rate mortgage , and “ own ” two import SUV's while mom stays at home because it's “ best for the kids . ”
There is nothing that they can't afford for their family as long as the credit cards keep rolling in .
They just smile and nod and keep promising more .
This does n't seem like a big deal either .
They are living the high life .
At least until the cards are all maxed ; the collection agencies start calling ; their credit score goes down ; the interest rate gets adjusted upward ; they can't afford the mortgage ; the bank forecloses ; and mom leaves with the kids to go live with grandma and grandpa in the house they paid off in 7 years because they did n't believe in being a mooch and borrowing money .
Can you say “ mortgage crisis ” ?
Ron Paul is that wise old grandpappy who kept getting laughed at and called an old - timer who did n't understand how the modern world worked when he repeatedly told his daughter her family needed to learn to live below its means .
The best way to prevent foreclosure is foresight .
Ron Paul 's foresight would not only help us get lower gas prices by restoring the dollar 's value , it would help us stave off bankruptcy or a nuclear attack by China .
When you grow up and understand this issue , it kinda makes the “ major issues ” like national healthcare and terrorism seem about as significant as that pimple you had on prom night does n't it ?

ONLY three years ago the world 's most advanced robotic cars struggled to make their way around even basic obstacles such as large rocks and potholes in the road .
Despite millions of dollars ' worth of high - tech equipment , the vehicles managed to mimic little of what a human can do behind the wheel .
Now , however , they can squeeze into parking places , flip on their indicators before making turns and even display the flair of a London taxi driver when merging into traffic .
This improvement in “ autonomous vehicle technology ” , as the jargon has it , is partly a result of prodding by America 's defence department , which hopes a third of its ground vehicles will be robotic by 2015 .
To that end its research arm , the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , has scaled back the traditional process of handing out large research grants and getting nothing useful in return .
Instead , it has been running a series of grand prix for such vehicles .
The prix in the latest , due to take place on November 3rd , is $ 3.5 m — of which $ 2 m will go to the vehicle best able to negotiate its way round Victorville , a former air force base in southern California , with $ 1 m and $ 500,000 to those in second and third places .
The first of DARPA 's Grand Challenges , in 2004 , was a flop .
The prize on offer then was $ 1 m — winner takes all .
The challenge was to follow a course 229 km ( 142 miles ) long across a desert using only the satellite - based global positioning system as a guide .
That year , no one claimed the prize .
In 2005 , the robots did much better .
Stanley , Stanford University 's modified Volkswagen Touareg , won the money ; four other vehicles also finished the course .
So this time , having allowed the teams an extra intervening year to tinker with their machines , DARPA has made the Challenge more challenging .
Not only must entrants keep to the tarmac and obey the rules of the road , they must also avoid colliding with a number of other cars being steered round the base by stunt drivers .
The desert vehicles relied on radar , laser range - finders and speedy , cleverly programmed computers to avoid meddlesome objects while racing from point to point .
The urban robots will use similar technology to accomplish much more difficult tasks .
In effect , they will be taking the examination to receive a driving licence by demonstrating the ability to park in narrow spaces , slow down and indicate appropriately at junctions , and so on — as well , of course , as avoiding collisions .
Thirty - five teams are spending the week leading up to the event competing for 20 spots in the race .
The favourites are Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University ( whose car came second in 2005 ) .
As in a more conventional motor race , the logos of their sponsors — companies such as Google , Intel and Red Bull — cover almost every centimetre of their vehicles , reflecting millions of dollars in investments .
However , this is not a game that only the well - heeled can play .
Indeed , the Stanford and Carnegie Mellon teams were small operations three years ago ; as is usually the way , sponsorship followed success .
Other academic entrants , such as the University of Louisiana at Lafayette , remain closer to the amateur spirit .
And there are also ad hoc groups of enthusiasts such as Austin Robot Technology , which is composed of a mixture of workers at IBM , AMD and Sun Microsystems , and members of the University of Texas .
There are even some corporate entries .
The Oshkosh Truck Corporation , for instance , has modified some of its off - road military vehicles for the competition ( with the aid , as it happens , of an additional $ 1 m grant from DARPA ) .
Whether any of the entrants will stay the course and win a virtual driving licence remains to be seen .
But if they do not do so this time , no doubt they will next , or maybe the time after that .
The established mixture of competitiveness and amateur fair play will surely continue ( teams routinely patch up each other 's wrecks after a crash ) .
And that seems to produce for DARPA what many millions spent on more run -of - the - mill research projects has failed to generate .

The story of the Piri Reis map is the story of how a perfectly innocent 16th - century navigational chart can end up , through no fault of its own , at the centre of a crackpot theory about our planet ’s ancient history .
Our story begins in 1929 , when the new republican government of Turkey was converting the old Topkapi Palace in Istanbul into a museum .
During the work , a map was discovered that was more than 400 years old but had been hitherto unknown .
( That in itself is not necessarily surprising : maps of that era were state secrets . )
The map was the western third of a portolan chart of the world , drawn on gazelle skin .
It covered the Americas , the Atlantic Ocean , the Iberian peninsula and the western part of Africa .
The rest of the chart , covering the Mediterranean Sea , Indian Ocean and Far East , is presumably lost forever .
The map was the handiwork of an Ottoman admiral named Piri Reis ( “ Reis ” was his rank — admiral ) , who in 1513 compiled the map from many different sources — some ancient , some more recent , including Portuguese charts of Asia and charts made by Columbus that were obtained by his uncle in 1501 when he captured seven Spanish ships .
Piri wrote about his sources in one of the map ’s marginal notes :
In this century there is no map like this map in anyone ’s possession .
The hand of this poor man has drawn it and now it is constructed from about twenty charts and Mappae Mundi ( these are charts drawn in the days of Alexander , Lord of the Two Horns , which show the inhabited quarter of the world ; the Arabs name these charts Jaferiye ) , from eight Jaferiyes of that kind and one Arabic map of Hind , and from the maps just drawn by four Portuguese which show the countries of Hind , Sind and China geometrically drawn , and also from a map drawn by Colombo in the western region .
By reducing all these maps to one scale this final form was arrived at .
So that the present map is as correct and reliable for the Seven Seas as the maps of our own countries are considered correct and reliable by seamen .
Ironically , it is the map ’s correctness and reliability that has since become the issue .
Piri Reis ’s map , fascinating on its own , now leaves the realm of 15th - century navigators and enters the lands of ancient astronauts , ice - age civilizations , and shifting poles .
Enter Charles Hapgood , who uses the Piri Reis map to argue , in his 1966 book , Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings , a number of extraordinary things .
Hapgood saw , at the bottom left of the map , what he believed to be an accurate representation of the ice - free coast of Antarctica .
He fit that into his pre-existing theory that the Earth ’s poles had shifted in the relatively recent past ( or , of you like , that the Earth ’s crust had shifted relative to the poles ) , leaving Antarctica ice - free , and that , 9,500 years ago , there was an advanced civilization that accurately mapped the Antarctic coastline .
And that among Piri Reis ’s ancient sources were maps from that civilization .
( Hapgood was n’t alone ; Erich von Däniken , fan of ancient alien astronauts , argued it was an azimuthal equidistant projection . )
So , the New Agers argue the following about a piece of a 16th - century portolan chart :
It ’s an insanely accurate azimuthal equidistant projection .
It accurately shows the ice - free coast of Antarctica .
It ’s evidence of polar shifting .
The mapping was done by an advanced ice - age civilization .
All of which is based on the fact that the coast of South America curves back towards Africa at the bottom of the map , and that it looks a little like the coast of Antarctica .
It ’s an extraordinary claim , and according to the Sagan doctrine requires extraordinary evidence .
But as is often the case with pseudoscience , the burden of proof is laid on those who have to disprove the claim .
In other words : “ Prove I ’m wrong . ”
So , inasmuch as there are pages about the map ’s place in Hapgood ’s theory , there are also plenty of web sites dedicated to disproving Hapgood ’s theory — not on the basis of its own absurdity , but on Hapgood ’s own terms .
If claims are made to the map ’s accuracy and representation , it ’s surprisingly easy to refute them .
Both Steven Dutch and Diego Cuoghi do just this , pointing out that
the map is tremendously inaccurate around the Caribbean , reflecting Columbus ’s own errors ;
the map does not fit an azimuthal equidistant projection ; and , most importantly ,
the curve in South America ’s coast does not match Antarctica nearly as well ( for one thing , it misses lots of coastline , as well as Cape Horn ) as it does Patagonia , if the map is suddenly turned at that point .
The most persuasive reason for the sudden curve in South America ’s coastline is put forth by Paul Lunde :
To put it more simply , Piri Reis , or the scribe who copied his work , may have realized , as he came to the Rio de la Plata , that he was going to run off the edge of his valuable parchment if he continued south .
So he did the logical thing and turned the coastline to the east , marking the turn with a semicircle of crenelations , so that he could fit the entire coastline on his page .
If that was the case , then the elaborate Hapgood hypotheses — or at least those elements based entirely on the Piri Reis map — would have no foundation whatever .
As is often the case with pseudoscientific theories about old maps , innocuous explanations are ignored in favour of flights of fancy .
It ’s as though the phrase “ Here Be Dragons ” was taken , centuries later , as categorical proof of the existence of fire - breathing reptiles .

An animal rights activist has been ordered to hand over her encryption keys to the authorities .
Section Three of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) came into force at the start in October 2007 , seven years after the original legislation passed through parliament .
Intended primarily to deal with terror suspects , it allows police to demand encryption keys or provide a clear text transcript of encrypted text .
Failure to comply can result in up to two years imprisonment for cases not involving national security , or five years for terrorism offences and the like .
Orders can be made to turn over data months or even years old .
The contentious measure , introduced after years of consultation , was sold to Parliament as a necessary tool for law enforcement in the fight against organised crime and terrorism .
But an animal rights activist is one of the first people at the receiving end of a notice to give up encryption keys .
Her computer was seized by police in May , and she has been given 12 days to hand over a pass - phrase to unlock encrypted data held on the drive - or face the consequences .
The woman , who claims to have not used encryption , relates her experiences in an anonymous posting on Indymedia .
" Now apparently they have found some encrypted files on my computer ( which was stolen by police thugs in May this year ) which they think they have ' reasonable suspicion ' to pry into using the excuse of ' preventing or detecting a crime ' , " she writes .
" Now I have been ' invited ' ( how nice , will there be tea and biccies ? ) to reveal my keys to the police so they can look at these files .
If I do not comply and tell them to keep their great big hooters out of my private affairs I could be charged under RIPA . "
The woman says that any encrypted data put on the PC must have been put there by somebody else .
" Funny thing is PGP and I never got on together I confess that I am far too dense for such a complex ( well to me anyway ) programme .
Therefore in a so - called democracy I am being threatened with prison simply because I cannot access encrypted files on my computer . "
She argues that even if she had used encryption she'd be disinclined to hand over her pass phrase .
" The police are my enemy , I know that they have given information about me to Huntingdon Life Sciences ( as well as hospitalising me ) , " she writes .
" Would I really want them to see and then pass around private communications with my solicitors which could be used against me at a later date in the civil courts , medical records , embarrassing poetry which was never meant to be read by anyone else , soppy love letters or indeed personal financial transactions ? "
Indymedia reports that similar demands have been served against other animal rights activists , a point we have not been able to verify .
The woman was issued a notice by the Crown Prosecution Service , and not ( as might be expected ) the police .
According to the code of conduct , the authorities would normally ask a suspect to put the files into intelligible form , though how this would work when a PC is being held by the police is far from clear .
It 's unclear if the woman was given an official Section 49 notice or simply " invited " to hand over the data voluntarily as part of a bluff by the authorities .
Richard Clayton , a security researcher at Cambridge University and long - time contributor to UK security policy working groups , said that only the police are authorised to issue Section 49 notices .
" What seems to have happened is that the CPS ( who could n't issue a notice anyway ) have written asking the person to volunteer their key , " he adds .
" Should they refuse this polite request , they are being threatened with the subsequent issuing of a notice , which might or might not require the key to be produced ( it might of course just require the putting into an intelligible form of the data ) . "
Clayton expressed concern that the incident illustrates possible holes in the long - delayed code of practice .
" It would clearly be desirable to seek NTAC 's views before approaching suspects with requests for keys ( rather than requests to put into an intelligible form ) - lest the authorities give the impression that they know rather less about the rules ( and the operation of encryption systems ) than everyone else , " he said . ®
When I started my PhD. - thesis a couple of years ago , I took some time to look at auto - parallelizing compilers and research .
After all , I wanted to work on making parallel programming easier , and the best way to do that would surely be to let compilers do all the work .
Unfortunately , the field appeared to be quite dead at that time .
There has been a huge amount of research done in the eighties and nineties , yet it all appeared to have settled down .
And the compilers I tried could not parallelize more than the simplest loops .
I have always been asking myself why this was the case , and when I had the chance to talk to Dr. Jay Hoeflinger , he had some very interesting answers for me .
He agreed to let me re-ask these questions in an email interview and this is the result .
Thanks ,
Jay , for sharing your knowledge !
Michael : First of all , please share a little bit about your biography and background on automatic parallelization with us !
Jay : I have a BS ( 1974 ) , MS ( 1977 ) and PhD ( 1998 ) from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
I filled in the large gap between the MS and the PhD with various things .
I did some scientific programming , some business programming , and then in 1985 I joined the I have a BS ( 1974 ) , MS ( 1977 ) and PhD ( 1998 ) from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign .
I filled in the large gap between the MS and the PhD with various things .
I did some scientific programming , some business programming , and then in 1985 I joined the Center for Supercomputing Research and Development ( CSRD ) at the University of Illinois .
I worked on the Cedar Fortran parallelizing compiler , which was being built to drive the Cedar supercomputer being built at CSRD .
We had high hopes that a parallelizing compiler would be the “ silver bullet ” that would allow an easy way to program parallel machines , which we viewed as being inevitable .
We made some big strides in understanding the challenges facing parallelizing compilers , but by the time CSRD lost its funding , we were far from solving the problems .
After CSRD , I stayed at the University of Illinois and worked on the Polaris parallelizing compiler .
Many talented students contributed to Polaris , and it had good success over the years .
I contributed to the compiler and was involved in many papers about the work .
Finally I decided to work on a PhD degree , attacking the problem of helping the compiler represent the complex data access patterns of programs .
I thought that the only way to really solve the automatic parallelization problem was to give the compiler a richer data structure for representing data accesses in a program .
I finally got the PhD degree in 1998 , but it was obvious at that time that automatic parallelization by the compiler alone was not near a solution .
A richer data structure for the compiler helped , but still the compiler had too little information about the program .
The only hope was to do something at runtime .
Of course , giving the compiler a richer way to represent complex data accesses forms a basis for that , and that work is finding some success , but a general solution of the problem remains out of reach .
In 1998 I went to work for the Center for Simulation of Advanced Rockets as a Senior Research Scientist .
I studied various aspects of parallelizing the rocket simulation codes being developed at the Center .
In 2000 , I joined Intel and have worked on the OpenMP runtime library and the Cluster OpenMP runtime library .
While working for Intel I also have been involved in the OpenMP 2.0 , 2.5 and 3.0 language committees .
I ’m a Senior Staff Software Engineer and the team lead of the Cluster OpenMP project .
Michael : Wow , now I know why you are the man ( TM ) to talk to about automatic parallelization 🙂 .
Let us start the actual interview with the current state of automatically parallelizing compilers :
What are they able to do today ?
Jay : Vectorization technology and simple parallelization has moved into mainstream commercial compilers .
This is because the students that worked on parallelization in the 1980s and 90s now form the core of various commercial compiler teams .
Many of the techniques used to attack parallelization have moved into commercial compilers and are supporting both parallel and serial optimization .

Many of the techniques used to attack parallelization have moved into commercial compilers and are supporting both parallel and serial optimization .
Today , parallelizing compilers can be fairly successful with Fortran 77 programs .
The language is simple , making it more possible to represent what the program is doing in the compiler ’s internal data structures .
Success with C has been more limited .
In the 90s a lot of work was done on parallelizing Java programs , with some success .
In the last 10 years work has been done on parallelizing domain - specific languages , like Matlab .
As people realized how hard the parallelization of programs at compile time was , they started turning to parallelizing at runtime .
Many projects have studied this problem and there has been some success .
Parallelization at runtime has the distinct advantage that all the information about variable values is available .
Some of the complicated mechanisms that were developed to symbolically simulate execution in the compiler and propagate data and program attributes throughout the program are n’t needed at runtime .
Now , research compilers can work together with the runtime system to parallelize a code .
For instance , if a compiler is trying to prove a certain relation in order to parallelize a given program loop , and is unable to prove it , the compiler could compile a runtime test into the program that can determine whether the relation is true .
Parallelization decisions can then be based on the result of the test .
Michael :
Ok , now that we know what they can do let ’s talk about the more important part : what are they not able do ?
And what are the reasons for that ?
Jay :
The key to parallelization is finding a way to divide up the work of the code such that a write to a memory location by one thread is always separated from another thread ’s access to the memory location by a synchronization .
So , uncertainty about which data is being accessed by which threads really hampers parallelization .

So , uncertainty about which data is being accessed by which threads really hampers parallelization .
This uncertainty can result from data values not being available to the compiler , for instance , if they are read from an input file at runtime or simply calculated at runtime based on a complex formula .
This means that compilers have difficulty with adaptive codes that adjust the way they access data , based on complicated functions or external information .
Some very clever techniques have been devised to allow the compiler to parallelize even in these complex situations , but typically such techniques require long compile times .
In the commercial world , compile time is much more important than it is in the research world .
So , complicated techniques that can parallelize loops in a research compiler by causing compilation to take a long time , may not be implemented in a commercial compiler â€ “ at least they would not be used by default .
So , commercial compilers are usually limited to rather simple parallelization techniques .
Achieving the same success in C or C++ as we see in Fortran77 is much more difficult because of the presence of pointers .
Pointers create a big problem for compilers because they obscure what data is actually being accessed , making the problem of understanding data access even harder than it would be otherwise .
Michael :
Is there hope ?
Compiler writers are some of the smartest people in computer science and parallel programming is a huge problem to attack , what kind of help can we hope for from our compilers in the near future ?
Jay : I think there is some hope in limited domains .
There is some hope for parallelizing domain - specific languages , for instance .
Matlab would be an example of a language that is great for linear algebra , but not so much for other things .
A Matlab compiler doesnâ€™t have to consider all the things that a C++ compiler has to consider .

Matlab would be an example of a language that is great for linear algebra , but not so much for other things .
A Matlab compiler doesnâ€™t have to consider all the things that a C++ compiler has to consider .
The thing you have to understand is that compilers are enormous programs , typically written by a large group of experts .
Even without automatic parallelization , the modern commercial compiler is extremely complex , and has a very large amount of source code .
The software engineering challenges of design and testing for such a large program are already daunting .
Adding the large amount of source code that would be required to do a really good job of parallelization would only exacerbate this problem .
So , I think it is unlikely that compilers in the near future will do a significantly better job of parallelization .
This is especially true due to the rising popularity of explicitly parallel languages and the increasing willingness of universities to teach people about parallel algorithms and how to design their codes for parallelism from the start .
I believe that compiler vendors are more interested in increasing support for the explicitly parallel languages than they are in trying to do automatic parallelization .
Michael : Could a change in languages help ?
You mentioned earlier that Fortran 77 code is easier to optimize / parallelize for compilers than e.g. C/C++ code .
Could a switch to a more restricted / more regular or just different language ( maybe even a new one ) change the situation and allow our compilers to help us more ?
Jay :
There is a tension between the expressibility of a language and the ability of compilers to properly optimize it .
A language with a high degree of expressibility may be easier for humans to use , yet at the same time it almost certainly is more complex and therefore more difficult for a compiler to understand , making it harder to parallelize .

A program written in a language with limited expressibility ( e.g. Fortran77 ) is therefore easier to parallelize , yet harder for a person to write programs with .
Defining a new language that ’s sufficiently rich in expressibility , yet simple enough to be routinely successfully parallelized is a difficult challenge .
It seems possible , but no good solution yet .
This is why OpenMP has become popular .
OpenMP has the serial program embedded in it , but allows the programmer to tell the compiler where the parallel parts are .
The programmer ’s knowledge of the code is put to its best use .
The programmer typically knows that conceptually , a given region of the program consists of independent computation , and can just say so in a very simple way to the compiler .
Michael :
Where do you see automatically parallelizing compilers in 5 years from now ?
Will some of the problems you have already sketched be solved by then ?
Any silver bullets on the horizon ?
Please take a look into your crystal ball 😉 !
Jay : I think there ’s hope for domain - specific compilers as I explained above .
There may be some hope for runtime parallelization using virtual machines or maybe just runtime tests compiled into the code .
I think there ’s hope for domain - specific compilers as I explained above .
There may be some hope for runtime parallelization using virtual machines or maybe just runtime tests compiled into the code .
But , for the most part , parallel code will still need to be designed and written by experts .
Along these lines , I think parallel libraries will be much more prominent in 5 years .
These libraries allow people to write serial programs that call the library routines to solve various problems in parallel , in which the library routines themselves have been optimized by experts .
So , the emphasis has to shift to people writing their own parallel code , not relying on compilers .
Universities will need to do a better job of producing parallel experts .
For the most part , I think automatic parallelization will remain an unfulfilled dream .
So , unfortunately , I do n’t see any silver bullets .
Automatic parallelization remains an extremely interesting research problem , though .
Maybe one day , when someone much smarter than I has a great idea â€ ¦
Michael :
Thank you , Jay , that was very enlightening !
And although the outlook at the end may sound pessimistic , I am looking forward to interviewing the smart guy you have mentioned .
You never know – he may be right around the corner implementing his revolutionary idea in a compiler as we speak …
Soon we 'll have special gloves and shoes that allow us to climb smooth , vertical surfaces — and even walk across ceilings .
A team of researchers at UC Berkeley has created a plastic microfiber that imitates the " stickiness " of gecko feet , which are covered in tiny hairs that attach to smooth surfaces .
Already , the researchers are predicting they 'll be able to walk robots across the ceiling using their microfibers , and humans could be next .
A release describing the new microfiber explains :
Taking a cue from the millions of hairs covering a gecko's toes , researchers squeezed 42 million hard plastic microfibers onto each square centimeter of material and loaded it with various weights .
They found that on a smooth , clean , vertical surface , two square centimeters of the synthetic adhesive could hold 400 grams ( 0.88 pounds ) .
At the same time , the adhesive easily lifts off with minimal force and no residue . . .
Previous research on gecko - like adhesives has focused on the strength of the adhesion . . .
However , that the ease of attachment and detachment are equally important when developing a material that can practically be used for scaling vertical walls and ceilings .
What sets this new gecko - inspired adhesive apart from the others created thus far is that it is directional , only " sticking " when it slides along a smooth surface , not when it is pressed down .
" This difference is critical because if you 're climbing up vertical surfaces , you can't afford to use a lot of energy pressing down into the surface to stick , " said [ UC Berkeley EECS professor Ron ] Fearing .
" Using force to attach also requires force to detach .
A gecko running uphill may be attaching and detaching its feet 20 times a second , so it'd get very tired if it had to work hard to pull its feet off at every step . "
The microfibers , made of polypropylene , are 20 microns long , or one - fifth the thickness of a sheet of paper , with a diameter of 0.6 microns , or one - hundredth the diameter of a human hair .
Being an ardent follower of Digg 's tech section , I 've noticed that the number of tech stories has rapidly diminished in the last year .
I 'm not talking , of course , about the switch Digg made from being a purely tech site to covering other topics , which occurred in June , 2006 .
As expected , the number of tech - related stories on the front page of Digg was reduced at the time .
But this number kept falling steadily , and it has come down so low that I can't consider Digg a good source for tech news anymore , simply because it 's too selective .
I 've decided to put my hypothesis to the test .
I 've counted the number of front page stories in Technology in a week 's period ( I did it by simply counting the stories within 24 - hour periods in this view ) now , and in early 2007 , where I used the Wayback Machine , deducing the approximate number of stories from the number of pages on the Top in 24 hours sections ( perhaps there is a better way to do this , but I could n't think of it ) .
Of course , the results are n't clinically precise because of this and some other minor factors ( I have n't counted the stories that were popular , then buried , for example ) , but the difference between the two sets of results is so obvious that these imprecisions are n't important .
Here are the results :
Number of stories on the front page of Digg ( popular ) from the Technology section from 30th of January to the 05th of February , 2008 .
Tuesday , Feb 5 , 2008 : 22
Monday , Feb 4 , 2008 : 11
Sunday , Feb 3 , 2008 : 13
Saturday , Feb , 2 2008 : 12
Friday , Feb 1 , 2008 2008 : 14
Thursday , Jan 31 , 2008 : 16
Wednesday , Jan 30 , 2008 : 18
Number of stories on the front page of Digg ( popular ) from the Technology section on seven days in February , March and April in 2007 ( my choice of days was limited to the pages Wayback Machine has in its database ) :
Saturday , Mar 3 , 2007 : 30 +
Friday , Feb 2 , 2007 : 30 +
Friday , Feb 23 , 2007 : 40 +
Friday , Apr 6 , 2007 : 20 +
Thursday , May 3 , 2007 : 20 +
Tuesday , Feb 13 , 2007 : 30 +
Tuesday , Mar 20 , 2007 : 30 +
As you can see , even though almost a full year has passed since Digg introduced additional categories , in February and March of 2007 .
there was a solid number of technology stories on the front page , somewhere between 21 and 50 .
One year later , and the number of stories ranges from 11 to 22 , with the average being 15 .
While some might argue that this is a good thing , many of us old school Digg users still think of Digg as a technology site ; or , at the very least , as a site with a very strong tech news section .
Hell , that 's what it was for nearly 2 years .
But , from today 's perspective , Digg simply does n't carry enough daily tech stories to cover all important technology news .
Am I complaining about change ( not this particular change , but change in general ) here ?
Not at all .
Digg 's community has obviously changed , and whether it's for better or for worse , diggers still choose what they want to read on Digg .
However , it 's undeniable that letting a community govern a site can have certain undesirable outcomes ; and losing focus is definitely one of them .
Some laughed at Slashdot when Digg surpassed its rankings on sites like Alexa , saying that Digg is going to stomp all over it ; however , today Slashdot still delivers technology stories , while Digg simply is n't tech - oriented at all anymore .
Perhaps Digg is now bigger than Slashdot , but Slashdot is now a significantly more focused site than Digg ; in a way , it is again the biggest wisdom - of - crowds tech site out there .
It beat Digg at its own game by doing next to nothing .
But , I now have a burning desire to learn it from the ground - up .
What are the ' canonical ' sources for math , both online and offline ?
I am lost as to where I should start .
I want to have a fundamental , intuitive understanding of it .
To clarify , I would not consider it shameful to start at whatever level necessary ( even the lowest , if required ) .
Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani clearly shares a particular personality trait with President Bush : the kind of unassailable certainty that even evidence to the contrary ca n’t uproot .
Take his position on the Iraq war , for example , which he still believes — even more so , now — was the right move for the U.S. to have made .
Union Leader via Huffington Post :
“ I actually believe that Democrats are going to agree with me on that by the time we get to the general election , ” the Republican former New York City mayor said .
Giuliani addressed a wide range of issues in an hour - long meeting with editors of the New Hampshire Union Leader .
Giuliani said that if Saddam Hussein were alive and in power , he would be trying to build a nuclear arsenal to meet a growing nuclear threat from Iran .
“ We ’d have two — instead of one — irresponsible , terrorist - supporting regimes that have enormous amounts of wealth available to them wanting to become nuclear powers in Middle East , ” he said .
Libya would also be “ a terrorist - supporting state with nuclear ambitions , ” he said .
History will show that “ it will turn out to have been the correct decision to have removed him , ” Giuliani said .

I hate my cat .
A cynic would observe that I hate all cats and that ’s fair .
From toxoplasma gondii to their scratchy little claws , cats piss me right off .
But I ’m not here today to talk about cats in general , I ’m here to talk about my cat ; Tangeray .
And that ’s a perfect place to start , cat .
I hate your name .
What kind of white - trash drunken child names their cat after a brand of gin ?
Even worse , who misspells said brand of gin in the naming ?
I guess you and Oprah could hang out but misspelled names do n’t cut it with me .
If your name was at least spelled right I could call you Tanq , that would be fine .
Instead I have to call you Tang , T - ray or “ that cat ” .
But that ’s not your fault .
While your name is a minor annoyance and embarrassment that ’s not what I really hate about you .
Most of my hatred towards you comes from you being such an awesome and friendly cat .
I ’ve never known a cat that wants to be pet , get belly rubs or craves human affection as much as you .
Unfortunately that is the heart of our problem , your cuddliness keeps me from sleeping and I ’m straight up ornery when I do n’t get enough sleep .
I understand that I sleep later than you like and you feel the need to meow at me or lay on my chest until I wake up .
I understand that you do n’t understand why I ’m so tired all the time .
Since you ’re a cat , I ’ll lay it out for you ; I ’m tired because of you .
Here ’s you on the bed , sweet , cuddly and seemingly taking up hardly any room .
In reality this is how much space you take up , since I sleep lengthwise .
I do n’t just share the bed with you , but also with my girlfriend .
Although quite fit , she takes up roughly half the bed .
Between the two of you , this is how much bed is taken up before I even get there .
Thusly , I am left with the green portion shown .
Hardly enough space for a grown man .
Sometimes , I can make it work if I sleep on my side and can somehow prevent myself from falling over the edge .
Sometimes .
But usually I just do n’t sleep , or do n’t sleep very well until my girlfriend gets out of bed at 5 and I can finally sleep like a real person . …. Until 6 am when you sit on my chest and meow until I wake up .
Granted , it ’s not all your fault , as my girlfriend takes up much more space than you do , and I do indeed have enough room to sleep on my side .
Or , I would have room to sleep on my side , were it not for your partner in crime ; the dog .
You ’re on notice Tangeray , T-ray , Tang or whatever it is you ’re calling yourself these days .
Something has to give .
I realize you have 4 years seniority on my dog and I respect that but frankly , I just like the dog more than you .
It ’s not really your fault , I ’m a dog person .
As far as cats go , you ’re the greatest cat I ’ve ever met but if you wake me up at 6:00 am tomorrow I ’m going to start locking you in the bathroom at night .
I ’m sorry it ’s come to this , you ’ve been warned .
Last week , I got a question from one of the readers of My Two Dollars :
“ Can you write more about your health insurance plan and the company that you got it from and how you went about choosing it and the alternatives you considered ? ”
I sure can Pam !
When I left my job about 13 months ago , I gave up our company paid health insurance plan and had to go about finding a new affordable plan for my wife and I .
Even though she is a full - time teacher , her school does not offer health insurance so we had to go get it on our own .
After researching different plans for a while , I decided on a Blue Cross PPO plan with a high deductible and we have been happy with it so far .
The reason I stuck with Blue Cross is that I have had them for every plan since I moved to California 12 years ago and have never had any major issues .
Of course , every insurance company has it ’s share of complaints , but some of the other ones available here in Southern California get really bad reviews , so I figured I should stay with what I know .
And the reason I chose the PPO is because I have had the same doctor since I moved here and I did not want to start over with another doctor – mine does not take HMO patients so I had to sign up for the PPO .
My wife now goes to my doctor as well and we both really like him , so I wanted to be sure I could stay with him .
Another thing I had to look out for was to make sure that whatever plan I picked out covered maternity costs .
A lot of them do n’t , and sometimes you really have to dig deep in order to find that info .
Since my wife and I are on the verge of having children , we wanted to make sure we had some coverage for the costs .
Births can cost a ton of money , and if there are complications it can get even more expensive !
The plan we have is the Blue Cross of California PPO Share 5000 plan .
This gives us a deductible of $ 5,000 per year for anything above and beyond regular doctor visits and lab tests ordered by our doctor .
Our annual out of pocket maximum is $ 7,500 , our co-payment is $ 40 , and generic drugs are $ 10 .
We also get free annual exams .
Our monthly cost for both of us is around $ 275 .
Since we are both healthy ( I think ! ) , we decided to get the higher deductible plan so our monthly outlay would be a lot less .
And just in case anything bad does happen , we are still covered for anything above and beyond $ 7500 … which is one reason we have an emergency fund .
If we needed to pay that giant bill , we could pay it off right away .
I hope that helps answer your question , and please feel free to let me know if it does n’t !

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

TRENTON , NJ - The American Civil Liberties Union today applauded a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court dismissing a medical malpractice lawsuit that could have improperly forced physicians to give a non-medical , value - laden speech to their patients before performing an abortion .
The ACLU called the decision a victory for reproductive rights and free speech in New Jersey .
" We are pleased that the court dismissed this frivolous lawsuit , which had no basis in law or medicine , " said Brigitte Amiri , a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project .
" This case was nothing more than an underhanded attempt to turn doctors into ideological mouthpieces and subject women to non-medical moral judgments . "
In 1998 , Rosa Acuna brought a medical malpractice lawsuit against a doctor in New Jersey , claiming that he had failed to properly inform her at the time of her abortion that the embryo was a " complete , separate , unique and irreplaceable human being " with whom she had " an existing relationship , " and his failure to do so caused her emotional distress .
According to court papers , Acuna , who had two children prior to her abortion , stated that at the time of her abortion she understood that she was pregnant and signed a form consenting to the procedure .
" Today 's victory sends a message that New Jersey will not tolerate backdoor efforts to curtail reproductive rights or free speech , " said Ed Barocas , Legal Director of the ACLU of New Jersey .
" We will not allow the anti-choice lobby to force its moral or theological beliefs upon others and to intimidate doctors or women with lawsuits that are without merit . "
In its unanimous decision , the court noted , " we know of no common law duty requiring a physician to instruct the woman that the embryo is an ' existing human being , ' and suggesting that an abortion is tantamount to murder .
There is not even remotely a consensus among New Jersey 's medical community or citizenry that plaintiff 's assertions are medical facts , as opposed to firmly held , moral philosophical , and religious beliefs . "
Acuna 's lawsuit is one of three instances where anti-choice foes have insisted that doctors must read a similar script to their patients prior to performing an abortion .
A class-action medical malpractice lawsuit with similar claims was recently brought in Illinois , and in South Dakota , reproductive rights advocates are currently challenging a law that may require doctors to read language identical to that found in this case .
Today 's decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court only reaches the issue of whether Acuna 's malpractice case should go to a jury trial .
Later this month , the U.S. Supreme Court will decide if it will consider a separate issue in the case regarding the legitimacy of a federal equal protection challenge involving New Jersey 's wrongful death statute .
Today 's case is Acuna v. Turkish ( Docket No. 59 , 525 ) .
Lawyers on the ACLU 's friend - of - the - court brief include Amiri and Talcott Camp of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project and Barocas of the ACLU of New Jersey .

Advertising is the business of telling stories .
TV commercials tell us a story – the latest Nike Mercurial Vapor IV ad tells us how the new Nike boots help make professional footballers faster .
Print ads – and online ads – are no different .
Direct mail sales letters have perfected the art of story - telling in ad copy , although they have the advantage of printed paper which tends to get more attention ( and thus a greater chance to build interest and keep attention through the story - telling format ) .
Online ads have less time and space compared to commercials or print ads ( who looks at the AdWords listings or your regular sidebar graphic ads for more than a few seconds ? ) and they ’ve adapted to the format , using word play and visual clues to tell their story .
These narratives are geared to present options in black and white , right and wrong , good and evil , desirable and undesirable , pain and the absence of pain , joy and the absence of joy , and so on .
Things are ( usually ) simple in advertising – no gray areas , no doubts , no complex scenarios .
It ’s easier to convey ( and understand ) the idea that driving fast can kill you than it is to explain that it ’s taking unnecessary risks that will kill you , not driving fast ( drunk driving is as risky as an inexperienced driver going 120 miles per hour which in turn is as risky as going 100 miles per hour in a car with poor brakes straight into a crowded intersection ) .
People find it easier to relate fast driving to danger as opposed to relating their own risk - taking ability ( or lack thereof ) to danger .
Most advertising relies on the above principle to externalise complex problems , simplify them and then offer equally simple solutions .
It ’s not reality , but it works and if you can get enough people thinking like that , then it IS the truth for them , and that ’s all that matters – to them and to the advertisers selling to them .
Sometimes the message is less clear – the Nokia 6233 ad portrays the phone as being an all - round powerhouse , but it neither does a good job of conveying that power nor does it do justice to the phone ’s all - round ability ( I ’ve had a 6233 for over an year now and it ’s an excellent phone , albeit a ‘ jack - of - all - trades ’ ) .
With the above mind , here are 5 keys to telling effective stories – narratives that get the audience to think / do what the creators want them to do :
1. Keep it Simple , Dumbass
You have a few seconds , at best , to catch your prospect ’s attention .
Stick to a single , clear , concise message .
Cut through the chaff .
Omit needless words .
2. Vivid and Visual
Colors , powerful language and visual content – apart from conveying subconscious cues about your core message , these elements also help in attracting and keeping attention .
Another example is the Zheng Zhi ad for the 2008 Olympics which uses emotional cues to get its method across .
3. Establish Relevance
Why is this important to me / why should I care ?
Make your story relevant to the largest possible audience .
For more , read this excellent article on establishing ‘ relevance ’ .
4. Prove Credibility
The other day I saw a Mobilink Indigo commercial – their methodology for this sub - brand is simple : push the ‘ exclusivity ’ factor , and use celebrity endorsements to convert prospects .
We tend to laugh off celebrity endorsements but the truth is that they work on an emotional , subconscious level and as such they can never be totally discounted ( especially when they are used in context ) .
Credibility comes in different sizes – social proof is one strategy , another is to use authentic research the way Nike did for their Vapor IV ads .
5. Action !
Advertisers often fail to capitalise on their hard work by NOT including any actionable steps at the end of each ad .
Even a mediocre ad that gets little traction can bring in a new stream of customers by simply adding a url at the end of the ad which points to a landing page for a mailing list .
Another option ( as discussed earlier ) is to invite the audience to take action through their mobile phones .
Whatever you do , get people to take some sort of action at the end of the advertisement .
Offer some reason to take action , such as a discount voucher or free offer .

On his way to winning Iowa , Mike Huckabee overtly traded on his evangelical culture war credentials .
Besides marketing himself as a " Christian leader " and appearing beside a crucifix - shaped object while urging viewers to " celebrate the birth of Christ , " Huckabee has rallied Christian right audiences against the " holocaust of liberalized abortion . "
He has called for quarantining homosexuals , compared homosexuality to necrophilia , and cozied up to rapture ready fanatics from Tim LaHaye to Pastor John Hagee to huckster televangelist Kenneth Copeland , whose corrupt fundraising practices have earned him a subpoena from Republican Senator Charles Grassley .
Huckabee , an ordained minister , is not simply a Christian leader .
He is a radical cleric .
In the eyes of the mainstream media , however , Huckabee is the sunny Republican counterpart to Barack Obama .
The New York Times ' Adam Nagourney praised Huckabee 's " easy - going , self - effacing , jaunty style " as his chief political asset .
Nagourney 's colleague at the Times , liberal commentator Frank Rich , explained Huckabee 's ascent in similar terms , comparing the sudden swell of support for his campaign to the phenomenon surrounding Democratic senator and presidential frontrunner Barack Obama .
" Both men [ Obama and Huckabee ] have a history of speaking across party and racial lines , " Rich wrote .
" Both men possess that rarest of commodities in American public life : wit .
Most important , both men aspire ( not always successfully ) to avoid the hyper - partisanship of the Clinton - Bush era . "
Rich , who weeks earlier had predicted the imminent self - destruction of the religious right ( wishful thinking , to the extent that Rich was thinking at all ) , seemed to view Huckabee as a departure from the divisive Republican candidates of the past .
Huckabee has explicitly rejected the idea that his affable style has anything to do with his sudden success , however .
" There 's only one explanation for [ my surge in the polls ] and it's not a human one , " Huckabee told an audience at the late Rev. Jerry Falwell 's Liberty University in November .
" It 's the same power that helped a little boy with two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of five thousand people and that 's the only way that our campaign could be doing what it 's doing . "
On issues like women 's reproductive rights , immigration , and religious liberties , Huckabee is arguably more radical than George W. Bush .
Yet just as the mainstream press bought into Bush 's portrayal of himself as a uniter during the 2000 campaign , they have fallen for Huckabee 's pose as a " vertical " politician who lifts voters up , rather than pushing them horizontally to the left or right .
If Huckabee somehow wins the presidency -- an unlikely event , but one worth considering -- the pundits and reporters who projected their own desires for post - partisanship on him will realize how dangerously wrong they were .
Because the mainstream media 's leading lights have generally overlooked Huckabee 's radical sectarian tendencies , videographer Thomas Shomaker and I have created a sequel to his " Christian Leader " ad that might provoke them to look behind his sunny veneer .
Relying entirely on factual information and Huckabee 's own public statements , we have painted a picture of the candidate that starkly contrasts with his misleading pose as a uniter .
See it for yourself .

1 World ’s Smallest Baby : 21 weeks and six days
On October 24th 2006 , Amillia Taylor was born at 21 weeks and six days .
No baby born at less than 23 weeks gestation had ever survived , but 10 ounce Amillia was able to pull through ( and even was trying to breath and cry on her own at birth ) .
Hospitals had initially hoped to release her yesterday , but decided to keep the now healthy baby a few extra days for observation .
Her mother does n’t mind the wait , she ’s just proud and happy that Amillia is healthy : “ Even though she ’s only four pounds ( 1.8 kilos ) now , she ’s plump to me . ”
2 44 pound Baby
This baby born in Iran six months ago , currently weighs an enormous 20 kilos ( 44 pounds ) !
The parents say the baby was born a normal weight close to 8 pounds when he was born , but he keeps eating every hour .
The Iranian doctors do not know what this eating disorder is or where it came from .
3 Cyclop Baby
4 Frog - like Baby
On 2006 , this baby was born with a only one eye in India .
Medical staff who helped deliver the child believe that the child ’s condition was caused by an experimental anti-cancer drug .
Another cause written in the report by the hospital was that it could also be the result of a chromosomal disorder .
The child was diagnosed with a rare chromosomal disorder , known as cyclopia .
She was born with a single eye in the center of her forehead , no nose and her brain fused into a single hemisphere .
With such severe deformities , it was a miracle that the girl survived even a few minutes after delivery .
The baby died days later .
On 2006 , this bizarre - looking baby was born in Charikot , the headquarters of Dolakha district , attracting a huge number of onlookers to witness the astonishing sight .
The neck - less baby with its head almost totally sunk into the upper part of the body and with extraordinarily large eyeballs literally popping out of the eye - sockets , was born to Nir Bahadur Karki and Suntali Karki at the Gaurishnkar Hospital in Charikot .
The Karki couple is a permanent resident of Dolakha ’s Bhirkot VDC .
The bizarre baby , however , died after half an hour of its birth , Suntali , the mother , informed .
It was taken to the hospital after its death .
The news about such a baby being brought to the hospital spread like wildfire and there were hundreds gathered at the hospital to have a look .
The police had to be deployed to control the crowd .
The baby weighed 2 kg at birth and was born after the normal nine - month gestation period .
Suntali , already a mother of two normal daughters , was not suffering from any illness during the pregnancy .
Nir Bahadur , the father , says he does not feel any remorse for the newly - born baby ’s death .
“ I am happy that nothing happened to my wife , ” he said .
NOTE : Our readers , Becca and Andrew , report us that “ the baby has a condition called anencephaly , a neural tube defect ( like the cyclops baby ) , with no proper brain formation .
The baby would have died a few days later .
That ’s why women are advised to take folate in early pregnancy . ”
– Thank you !
5 Baby with Three Arms
This 2 - month - old baby named Liu Junjie from Anhui Province , China , was born with a third arm on 2006 .
Doctors successfully removed the extremely rare and well - developed third arm , but the baby required long - term physical therapy to gain function in his remaining hand , which has no palm and flexes in either direction .
“ We ’re hoping to exchange information with doctors who ’ve dealt with similar cases anywhere in the world , ” said Chen , head of the orthopedics department at Shanghai Children ’s Medical Center .
“ This is so rare that we have virtually no information to go on . ”
6 Born with 17 pounds
A Siberian woman who gave birth on 2007 to her 12th child was stunned to find that little Nadia weighed in at a massive 17.1 lb ( 7.75kg ) .
” We were all simply in shock , ” said Nadia ’s mother , Tatyana Barabanova , 43 .
“ What did the father say ?
He could n’t say a thing – he just stood there blinking .
” ” I ate everything , we do n’t have the money for special foods so I just ate potatoes , noodles and tomatoes , ” she told the reporter , adding that all her previous babies had weighed more than 5 kg .
The right of faiths to run their own affairs and regulate their adherents ' lives has recently become controversial — because of fear of Islam
AMONG family - law buffs , the case is seen as a key example of the messy ways in which religious and civil law can get entangled .
It concerns an Italian couple who wed in a Catholic church in 1962 .
After 25 years of less - than - blissful union , she got a legal separation from a civil court , which told him to make monthly maintenance payments .
But he had other ideas : he convinced an ecclesiastical court that their union had never been valid , because they were close blood relations .
After vain appeals to various civil and religious courts in Italy ( to which she complained that she never got a chance to tell her story ) , she turned to the European Court of Human Rights , which in 2001 ruled in her favour and made a modest compensation award .
The European judges in Strasbourg had no jurisdiction over church courts — but they did find that Italy 's civil judges failed to assess the religious courts ' work or note the deficiencies .
In every democratic and more - or - less secular country , similar questions arise about the precise extent to which religious sub-cultures should be allowed to live by their own rules and “ laws ” .
One set of questions emerges when believers demand , and often get , an opt - out from the law of the land .
Sikhs in British Columbia can ride motorcycles without helmets ; some are campaigning for the right not to wear hard hats on building sites .
Muslims and Jews slaughter animals in ways that others might consider cruel ; Catholic doctors and nurses refuse to have anything to do with abortion or euthanasia .
Even in determinedly secular states like France and the United States , the political authorities often find that they are obliged , in various ways , to cope with the social reality of religious belief .
America 's Amish community , fundamentalists who eschew technology , has generally managed to get around the law with respect to social security , child labour and education .
In France , town halls serving large Muslim populations ignore secular principles as they get involved in the ritual slaughter of sheep .
Apart from exceptions to existing laws , another sort of problem arises when religious ( and other ) communities establish bodies that work very much like courts — and may be called courts — that enforce ancient rules that are often called laws .
All these questions , but especially the last of them , have been on the mind of Rowan Williams , the Archbishop of Canterbury .
The Anglican leader caused a furore when he suggested , on February 7th , that some accommodation between British law and sharia , or the Muslim legal tradition , was inevitable and should perhaps be made official .

America 's oldest exception : the Amish
At first , there seems not to be any huge problem about the existence of institutions whose members freely choose to respect a set of norms — so long as participation really is voluntary , and the rules do not horrify the rest of society .
( Intuitively , most Western societies accept the circumcision , on religious grounds , of baby boys , but they would not tolerate the genital mutilation of baby girls . )
But in almost every democracy which aspires at the same time to be fair , secular and tolerant of religious diversity , it is getting harder to mark out and preserve the boundary .
Until recently , religions with deep local roots — like Anglicanism in Britain or Lutheranism in Scandinavia — could rely on well - honed survival instincts ; clerics had developed a keen sense of how much “ soft theocracy ” society could accept , and when to beat a tactical retreat .
Even the existence of court - like institutions , dealing in particular with marital and property issues , caused little fuss as long as everybody involved recognised the absolute primacy of the law of land .
In Britain , for example , religious courts or beth din used by Orthodox Jews have been recognised by statute — and in 2002 , divorce law was adjusted in a way that acknowledged the role of these bodies .
( If a Jewish husband refuses to seek a religious divorce — thus denying his wife the chance to remarry in a synagogue — a civil judge can now delay the secular divorce . )
The Church of England uses ancient canon laws to govern the use of church property and its internal workings .
But like the monarchy , it knows that the way to retain some vestigial authority is to give up most powers that could be controversial .
What has upset the old equilibrium , say law pundits in several countries , is the emergence all over the world of Muslim minorities who , regardless of what they actually want , are suspected by the rest of society of preparing to establish a “ state within a state ” in which the writ of secular legislation hardly runs at all .
The very word sharia — which at its broadest can imply a sort of divine ideal about how society should be organised , but can also refer to specific forms of corporal and capital punishment — is now political dynamite .
That has rendered controversial some things that were once well accepted , like the existence of arbitration services which lighten the burden of the state by providing an alternative arena in which disputes can be settled .
As Maurits Berger , a Dutch specialist on Islam and the law , points out , most English - speaking countries have a tradition of dealing with family law through arbitration — voluntary procedures to whose outcome the parties are bound .
( Things are different in continental Europe , where the nearest equivalent is non-binding mediation services . )
The Canadian province of Ontario is the clearest case of an English - speaking place where fear of Islam made religious arbitration untenable .
An uproar began in 2003 when Syed Mumtaz Ali , a retired Ontario lawyer , said he was setting up a sharia court to settle family law disputes for Muslims .
Such arrangements were allowed by the province 's 1991 Arbitration Act and could carry the force of law .
The proposal caused an instant backlash , right across the religious and political spectrum ; many Muslim groups were opposed too .
Marion Boyd , a retired attorney - general , investigated the matter and initially recommended that the Arbitration
Act should continue to allow disputes to be adjudicated by religious bodies — subject to stricter regulation by the state .
But that turned out not to be good enough for Ontarians who were nervous of sharia .
In September 2005 the province 's premier , Dalton McGuinty , decided to prohibit all settlement of family matters based on religious principles under the Arbitration Act .
Religious arbitrators could still offer services in the settlement of disputes , but their rulings would not have legal effect or be enforceable by the courts .
The province 's laws were duly changed .
The political background to these moves is no secret : a general wariness of Islam prompted not only by the September 2001 terrorist attacks , but also by NATO 's war against the Taliban in Afghanistan , in which scores of Canadian soldiers have died .
Moves to establish sharia tribunals , be they ever so voluntary , aroused “ quite a lot of anti-Muslim feelings ” , says Alia Hogben of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women ( which opposed the tribunals ) .
“ It allowed people to say , here they come , they are going to ask for more and more . ”
Apart from a general fear of theocracy , says Jeffrey Reitz , a professor at the University of Toronto , Canadians were nervous that “ some of the progress that 's been made with gender equality might be lost if we begin to accommodate various group that have less concern ... ”
As anxiety over ( real or imaginary ) Muslim demands for sharia turns into a broader worry about theocracy and religious exceptionalism , many democracies are seeing bizarre multi-polar disputes between secularists , Christians , Muslims and other faiths .
In southern Europe , says Marco Ventura , a religious - law professor at the University of Siena , Catholics are now more worried about the perceived advance of Islam than about maintaining old entitlements for their faith .
“ Their dilemma is whether the rights which their faith enjoys can be justified when new ones , like Islam , are appearing in Europe . ”
Some of Italy 's Muslims , meanwhile , have been demanding “ secularism ” in the sense of diluting the Roman Catholic culture of the state , which is epitomised by crucifixes in court rooms , classrooms and hospitals .
A Muslim convert , Adel Smith , has been fighting a long battle to get such symbols removed .
In France , President Nicolas Sarkozy has dismayed secularists by stressing the country 's Catholic heritage in some recent speeches .
But the late ( Jewish - born ) Archbishop of Paris , Cardinal Jean - Marie Lustiger , was a staunch defender of the secular state as a bulwark against all forms of fundamentalism .
Defining the relationship between religion and the state was certainly easier when it could be assumed that religion 's hold over people 's lives and behaviour was in long - term decline .
But with Islam on the rise , and many Christians — even those with the vaguest of personal beliefs — becoming more defensive of their cultural heritage , the line is getting harder and harder to draw .
On that point at least , Archbishop Williams was quite correct .
An online columnist who discovered a year ago that the police department would not renew his press pass is suing the city over its refusal to provide him with documents that describe its policy for issuing press passes .
" This is strictly retaliatory , " Leonard Levitt , who is widely read within the police department and is frequently critical of its top officials , said in a video posted on the Web site of the New York Civil Liberties Union , which is helping him with the case .
" There 's no question about it . "
Mr. Levitt's Web site , nypdconfidential.com , bills itself as " an insider 's view of the department that the public rarely sees . "
In a column this year , Mr. Levitt reported that Commissioner Raymond Kelly 's security detail routinely drove his wife on personal errands , a claim the police department denies .
In an affidavit filed in court , Mr. Levitt claims that , in 2003 , Mr. Kelly visited editors at Newsday on Long Island to " complain about the critical coverage of the NYPD in my column . "
Mr. Levitt left Newsday in 2005 after a decade there .
The department extended his press pass through 2006 but did not renew the pass for 2007 or this year .
All press passes in New York City , regardless of a reporter 's area of coverage , are issued by the police department .
CHANTILLY , Va. ( AP )  Investigators are trying to determine why two United Airlines jet airplanes touched wings at Dulles International Airport outside Washington .
United Airlines spokesman Jeff Kovick says there were no injuries during the incident Sunday night .
Officials say the Airbus 319 and the Embraer 170 were preparing for departure when their wings touched on a taxiway .
The Airbus was scheduled to take off for Albuquerque , and the Embraer was slated for a flight to Dallas - Fort Worth .
The 92 passengers aboard the Airbus were placed on a twin - engine Airbus 320 and flown to Albuquerque .
The 66 passengers on the Embraer were taken off the airplane and were to complete their journey Monday morning .

Dr. Stuart Meloy never set out to study orgasms .
It was an accident .
He was in the operating room one day in 1998 , implanting electrodes into a patient ’s spine to treat her chronic leg pain .
( The electrodes are connected to a device that fires impulses to the brain to block pain signals . )
But when he turned on the power , “ the patient suddenly let out something between a shriek and moan , ” says Meloy , an anesthesiologist and pain specialist in North Carolina .
Asked what was wrong , she replied , “ You ’ll have to teach my husband how to do that . ”
Meloy moved the electrodes until he found the correct , pain - numbing position on the spine .
“ I went home , had a funny story to tell my wife , ” he says .
He almost left it at that .
But the next day , he told the story to some colleagues , and a gynecologist commented that one - third of his patients complain of orgasm dysfunction .
Might this , Meloy mused , potentially help such people ?
He started a formal pilot study of the device , which is approved for use in treating bladder and pain problems , implanting it in the spines of 11 women , some of whom had never had an orgasm .
The women , who were instructed to keep a record of all their sexual experiences , were allowed to use the device for nine days adlibitum .
Meloy ’s study , published in 2006 in the journal Neuromodulation , reported that 10 out of 11 of the patients felt pleasurable stimulation from the device , including increased vaginal lubrication .
Five of the women had previously lost their ability to have orgasms ; four regained it with the device .
( The fifth never used her device during the nine - day trial because of work stress , she said . )
None of the five women who had never had an orgasm was able to experience one with the device , however .
“ They said it was pleasurable , but it was n’t sending them over the edge , ” Meloy says .
The experimental implant -- now trademarked by Meloy as the Orgasmatron after the orgasm - inducing cylinder in Woody Allen ’s 1973 movie “ Sleeper ” -- rests on the skin just above the belt line .
Two electrodes snake into the space between the vertebrae and the spinal cord .
A video - game - like remote control allows women ( or their partners ) to turn electrical pulses on and off and fiddle with timing and intensity .
Electrodes in the right place ( determined partly by trial and error ) seem to interact with various nerve networks , Meloy says , including nerves from the pelvis that enter the spinal highway near the tailbone .
Stimulating those nerves shoots pleasure signals straight up to the part of the brain that processes information coming from the genitalia .
Women who have used the device say they feel as if their clitoris and vagina are actually being stimulated , to quite realistic effect .
( “ One woman asked me , ‘ Would it be considered adultery if I gave the remote control to someone other than my husband ? ’ ” Meloy says . )
Some volunteers also report fleeting episodes of clenched foot muscles , Meloy says , probably a result of electrical pulses leaving the spine and stimulating nearby motor nerves .
( He wonders if the phenomenon might somehow be related to a common orgasm description : “ My toes curled . ” )
And when the device ’s pulse intensity is cranked up to maximum , Meloy says , some women find their vaginal and rectal muscles squeezing rhythmically in time with the pulses , even before the orgasmic finale .
Meloy thinks that practice , or at least past experience , is key to success with the device .
Without prior orgasm experiences , crucial neural pathways may never have been laid down , possibly explaining why women who ’d never had orgasms did not experience one during the nine - day trial .
Even with extra stimulation from the device , Meloy says , nine days may not have been enough time to build pathways up to full orgasmic strength .
And even the successful women in the trial lost their recovered orgasmic ability when the devices were removed .
Meloy hopes that longer access to the device would let women practice their newfound skills and fortify neural pathways -- a sort of orgasmic neural rehabilitation .
Meloy says he has also implanted two impotent men with the device .
Both volunteers were able to achieve an erection , he says , and reportedly had powerful ejaculations .
Meloy sees two potential male markets for the device .
One includes men with erectile dysfunction who take nitrates for heart disease and therefore cannot take Viagra or similar medications , like Jack Nicholson ’s character in the film “ Something ’s Gotta Give . ”
The other might be recreational users , men interested in boosting their existing erections and ejaculations -- and willing to pay for elective surgery .
Design work is underway to get the cost of the procedure down to about $ 12,000 -- roughly the price of breast implants , Meloy says .
He plans to shrink the size of the internal processor to the size of two sticks of gum and the external processor to roughly the size of a belt pager , all while ensuring that the system is durable enough to withstand shear forces of typical use .
Before Food and Drug Administration approval could be granted and the device sent to market -- Meloy estimates that ’s probably still two or three years away -- the new design will need to be tested in another study , he says .
But there will be no animal testing phase .
“ I do n’t know how to ask animals , ‘ Where do you feel the tingling ? ’ or ‘ Do you want a cigarette ? ’ ”

This is no game .
You might think this is a game , but , trust me , this is no game .
This is not something where rock beats scissors or paper covers rock or rock wraps itself up in paper and gives itself as a present to scissors .
This is n’t anything like that .
Or where paper types something on itself and sues scissors .
This is n’t something where you yell “ Bingo ! ” and then it turns out you do n’t have bingo after all , and what are the rules again ?
This is n’t that , my friend .
This is n’t something where you roll the dice and move your battleship around a board and land on a hotel and act like your battleship is having sex with the hotel .
This is n’t tiddlywinks , where you flip your tiddly over another player ’s tiddly and an old man winks at you because he thought it was a good move .
This is n’t that at all .
This is n’t something where you sink a birdie or hit a badminton birdie or do anything at all with birdies .
Look , just forget birdies , O.K. ?
Maybe you think this is all one big joke , like the farmer with the beautiful but promiscuous daughter .
But what they do n’t tell you is the farmer became so depressed that he eventually took his own life .
This is not some brightly colored , sugarcoated piece of candy that you can brush the ants off of and pop in your mouth .
This is not playtime or make - believe .
This is real .
It ’s as real as a beggar squatting by the side of the road , begging , and then you realize , Uh - oh , he ’s not begging .
This is as real as a baby deer calling out for his mother .
But his mother wo n’t be coming home anytime soon , because she is drunk in a bar somewhere .
It ’s as real as a mummy who still thinks he ’s inside a pyramid , but he ’s actually in a museum in Ohio .
This is not something where you can dress your kid up like a hobo and send him out trick - or - treating , because , first of all , your kid ’s twenty - three , and , secondly , he really is a hobo .
All of this probably sounds oldfashioned and “ square ” to you .
But if loving your wife , your country , your cats , your girlfriend , your girlfriend ’s sister , and your girlfriend ’s sister ’s cat is “ square , ” then so be it .
You go skipping and prancing through life , skipping through a field of dandelions .
But what you do n’t see is that on each dandelion is a bee , and on each bee is an ant , and the ant is biting the bee and the bee is biting the flower , and if that shocks you then I ’m sorry .
You have never had to struggle to put food on the table , let alone put food on a plate and try to balance it on a spoon until it gets to your mouth .
You will never know what it ’s like to work on a farm until your hands are raw , just so people can have fresh marijuana .
Or what it ’s like to go to a factory and put in eight long hours and then go home and realize that you went to the wrong factory .
I do n’t hate you ; I pity you .
You will never appreciate the magnificent beauty of a double rainbow , or the plainness of a regular rainbow .
You will never grasp the quiet joy of holding your own baby , or the quiet comedy of handing him back to his “ father . ”
I used to be like you .
I would put my napkin in my lap , instead of folding it into a little tent over my plate , like I do now , with a door for the fork to go in .
I would go to parties and laugh — and laugh and laugh — every time somebody said something , in case it was supposed to be funny .
I would walk in someplace and slap down a five - dollar bill and say , “ Give me all you got , ” and not even know what they had there .
And whenever I found two of anything I would hold them up to my head like antlers , and then pretend that one “ antler ” fell off .
I went waltzing along , not caring where I stepped or if the other person even wanted to waltz .
Food seemed to taste better back then .
Potatoes were more potatoey , and turnips less turnippy .
But then something happened , something that would make me understand that this is no game .
I was walking past a building and I saw a man standing high up on a ledge .
“ Jump ! Jump ! ” I started yelling .
What happened next would haunt me for the rest of my days : the man came down from the building and beat the living daylights out of me .
Ever since then , I ’ve realized that this is no game .
Maybe one day it will be a game again .
Maybe you ’ll be able to run up and kick a pumpkin without people asking why you did that and if you ’re going to pay for it .
Perhaps one day the Indian will put down his tomahawk and the white man will put down his gun , and the white man will pick up his gun again because , Ha-ha , sucker .
One day we ’ll just sit by the fire , chew some tobacky , toast some marshmackies , and maybe strum a tune on the ole guitacky .
And maybe one day we ’ll tip our hats to the mockingbird , not out of fear but out of friendliness .
If there ’s one single idea I ’d like you to take away from this , it is :
This is no game .
The other thing I ’d like you to think about is , could I borrow five hundred dollars ?
( Author ’s Note : Since finishing this article , I have been informed that this is , in fact , a game .
I would like to apologize for everything I said above .
But please think about the five hundred dollars . ) ♦
Researchers reported today that women who perceive their lives to be stressful are less able to fight off the most common subtype of the HPV virus , which can cause cervical cancer .
The idea that stress plays a role in how the immune system fights off infections and cancer has its roots in the broader study of the links between mental and physical health .
Can our emotions and thoughts affect how our body responds to foreign invaders , or even to our own mutated cells growing unchecked ?
For the latest thinking , U.S. News talked with Anne Harrington , chair of the department of the History of Science at Harvard University and author of The Cure Within : A History of Mind - Body Medicine ( W. W. Norton ) .
When did this idea arise that stress might make us more susceptible to cancer and affect the progress of the disease ?
You do n't really see that specific idea until the late 1970s or early 1980s , though there 's a much older tradition of supposing that negative emotions — if you do n't manage them properly — put you at risk of cancer .
In the heyday of the psychoanalytic era , there was a view that repressing strong aggressive and sexual feelings might represent a " cancer - prone personality . "
When Norman Mailer stabbed his wife at a party [ in 1960 ] , his defense was going to be that he was afraid if he'd repressed the rage that made him do this , he would succumb to cancer .
In the end , his wife did n't press charges .
What happened scientifically to make a stress - cancer link plausible ?
There was the discovery that the nervous system might be able to communicate with the immune system .
First these questions were around AIDS , not cancer .
AIDS undermined immunity , and people wondered whether receiving a diagnosis might actually cause a worse outcome because of the stress of it .
It was really then , on the back of that , that people began to ask about cancer .
What did early studies show ?
Epidemiological studies suggested that women who had a " fighting spirit " when they received a diagnosis of cancer seemed to have a better outcome — they appeared to live longer and responded better than women who received the news with hopelessness and depression .
[ More recent studies do n't show that . ]
The idea is n't completely dead , but it 's controversial .
What about infections , which can directly or indirectly cause some cancers , like cervical cancer ?
The question of whether stress affects how we fight off infection is open .
One study looked at the caregivers of Alzheimer 's patients , who are understood to really live under chronic stress .
They looked at the response of these people to the flu vaccine , and found that the caregivers '' immune systems were n't able to mount as robust a response as the control group .
If there is a link between stress and infection , or stress and cancer , is it necessarily biological ?
When people are under stress , there are behavioral consequences .
Go back to the idea of a cancer patient .
One who is extremely stressed by her diagnosis or by other things going on in her life may not be sleeping well , she may not be adhering to treatment as well ; it may be in indirect ways that stress leads to poor outcomes .
What 's the downside of believing that stress and emotions have an effect on cancer ?
We went through an era where cancer patients were put under enormous pressure to stay positive , to harness the power of positive visualization to fight off their tumors , to avoid any stress .
By that , many thought they were n't allowed to worry .
But there 's something enormously stressful about having to stay resolutely positive !
I talked to some women with cancer who were involved in this research during the positive - thinking era .
In support groups , they were encouraged to confront their deepest fears and talk about death , but some worried it would make them sicker .
It can be harmful if it turns into this thing where you are afraid of your own emotions and think that if you let an anxious thought into your mind your immune system is going to poop out .
Any evidence that talking about the bad as well as the good is actually better for you ?
Leaders say former ABC consultant faked interviews Jason Rhyne

This A former consultant for ABC News , Alexis Debat , is under fire for publishing an array of allegedly faked interviews with US and world leaders under his byline in a French magazine .
ABC 's blog , The Blotter reports that spokespeople for the subjects of the fabricated interview pieces , which include " Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , Microsoft founder Bill Gates and former U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan , " all say the sit - downs never happened .
The interviews were published in the French foreign affairs journal Politique Internationale .
Earlier today in the Washington Post , Howard Kurtz reported that Debat , who worked for ABC until this past June , had admitted to signing off on a fake interview with Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama , which appeared in the Summer 2007 edition of the same magazine .
" Today , spokespeople for Pelosi , Bloomberg , Gates , Greenspan and Annan told the Blotter on ABCNews.com that interviews of them under Debat 's name in the magazine also never took place , " said chief ABC investigative reporter Brian Ross .
" In fact , " he added , " Stephane Dujarric , the deputy communications director for the U.N. secretary - general , said he called the fabricated interview to the attention of the editor of the magazine , Patrick Wajsman , in June 2005 . "
" Despite that , " Ross writes , " Debat continued for the next two years to be cited as the author of interviews with a range of prominent U.S. public officials in [ Politique Internationale ] . "
Debat previously told the Washington Post his faux Obama piece was written in March by a freelance reporter , who produced a dummy transcript of Obama 's " responses " to Debat 's questions , which included quotes from the senator saying Iraq was " already a defeat for America " and had " wasted thousands of lives . "
" I was scammed , " Debat said .
" I was very , very stupid .
I made a huge mistake in signing that article and not checking [ the freelancer 's ] credentials . "
The Blotter reported yesterday that the Obama campaign denied the interview ever took place .
Rue 89 , another French publication , was the first to question the veracity of the piece .
" ABC News officials say they asked for and received Debat 's resignation after French government officials raised questions in May about a Ph.D. he claimed to have received from the Sorbonne , " the Blotter reports , adding that ABC had employed Debat as a counterterrorism analyst .
" I was angry with him because it called into question , of course , everything he had done , " Brian Ross , who worked with Debat at ABC , told Howard Kurtz in the Post .
" He could never satisfy us that he had the [ Ph.D. ] ... I was very upset . "
Debat , however , maintains he resigned from ABC voluntarily , and said that an " administrative issue " prevented his Sorbonne degree from being registered correctly with the university , which he is suing .
Regarding the faked Obama interview , he told Kurtz that he will make every effort to clear his name .
" My entire career is at stake , " he said .
Iran Focus : Tehran , Iran , Jan. 07  An Iranian court has sentenced a teenage rape victim to death by hanging after she weepingly confessed that she had unintentionally killed a man who had tried to rape both her and her niece .
Iran Focus
Tehran , Iran , Jan. 07  An Iranian court has sentenced a teenage rape victim to death by hanging after she weepingly confessed that she had unintentionally killed a man who had tried to rape both her and her niece .
The state - run daily Etemaad reported on Saturday that 18 - year - old Nazanin confessed to stabbing one of three men who had attacked the pair along with their boyfriends while they were spending some time in a park west of the Iranian capital in March 2005 .
Nazanin , who was 17 years old at the time of the incident , said that after the three men started to throw stones at them , the two girls  boyfriends quickly escaped on their motorbikes leaving the pair helpless .
She described how the three men pushed her and her 16 - year - old niece Somayeh onto the ground and tried to rape them , and said that she took out a knife from her pocket and stabbed one of the men in the hand .
As the girls tried to escape , the men once again attacked them , and at this point , Nazanin said , she stabbed one of the men in the chest .
The teenage girl , however , broke down in tears in court as she explained that she had no intention of killing the man but was merely defending herself and her younger niece from rape , the report said .
The court , however , issued on Tuesday a sentence for Nazanin to be hanged to death .
Last week , a court in the city of Rasht , northern Iran , sentenced Delara Darabi to death by hanging charged with murder when she was 17 years old .
Darabi has denied the charges .
In August 2004 , Irans Islamic penal system sentenced a 16 - year - old girl , Atefeh Rajabi , to death after a sham trial , in which she was accused of committing acts incompatible with chastity  .
The teenage victim had no access to a lawyer at any stage and efforts by her family to retain one were to no avail .
Atefeh personally defended herself and told the religious judge that he should punish those who force women into adultery , not the victims .
She was eventually hanged in public in the northern town of Neka .

Three Digital Pigs A story based on the Three Little Pigs fairy tale has been turned down by a government agency 's awards panel as the subject matter could offend Muslims .
The digital book , re-telling the classic story , was rejected by judges who warned that " the use of pigs raises cultural issues " .
Becta , the government 's educational technology agency , is a leading partner in the annual Bett Award for schools .
The judges also attacked Three Little Cowboy Builders for offending builders .
The book 's creative director , Anne Curtis , said the idea that including pigs in a story could be interpreted as racism was " like a slap in the face " .
' Cultural issues '
The CD - Rom digital version of the traditional story of the three little pigs , called Three Little Cowboy Builders , is aimed at primary school children .
But judges at this year 's Bett Award said that they had " concerns about the Asian community and the use of pigs raises cultural issues " .
The Three Little Cowboy Builders has already been a prize winner at the recent Education Resource Award - but its Newcastle - based publishers , Shoo - fly , were turned down by the Bett Award panel .
The feedback from the judges explaining why they had rejected the CD - Rom highlighted that they " could not recommend this product to the Muslim community " .
They also warned that the story might " alienate parts of the workforce ( building trade ) " .
The judges criticised the stereotyping in the story of the unfortunate pigs : " Is it true that all builders are cowboys , builders get their work blown down , and builders are like pigs ? "
Animal Farm ?
Ms Curtis said that rather than preventing the spread of racism , such an attitude was likely to inflame ill - feeling .
As another example , she says would that mean that secondary schools could not teach Animal Farm because it features pigs ?
Her company is committed to an ethical approach to business and its products promote a message of mutual respect , she says - and banning such traditional stories will " close minds rather than open them " .
Becta , the government funded agency responsible for technology in schools and colleges , says that it is standing by the judges ' verdict .
" Becta with its partners is responsible for the judging criteria against which the 70 independent judges , mostly practising teachers , comment .
All the partners stick by the judging criteria , " said a Becta spokesman .
The reason that this product was not shortlisted was because " it failed to reach the required standard across a number of criteria " , said the spokesman .
Becta runs the awards with the Besa trade association and show organisers , Emap Education .
Merlin John , author of an educational technology website which highlighted the story , warns that such rulings can undermine the credibility of the awards .
" When benchmarks are undermined by pedestrian and pedantic tick lists , and by inflexible , unhelpful processes , it can tarnish the achievements of even the most worthy winners .
" It 's time for a rethink , and for Becta to listen to the criticisms that have been ignored for a number of years , " said Mr John .

I ’m ready at last to support gun control .
I believe every police agency in the United States — local , state and federal — should be disarmed .
After all , the gun-control people have been saying for years that we private citizens have no need for firearms .
Well , if that ’s true for us , it ’s true for the police .
We are the inhabitants of the country .
We live in the neighborhoods , we are the victims of crime , and if we do n’t need guns , then who does ?
I ’ve yet to hear of a police officer being mugged or raped , and certainly not an FBI agent , as the feds spend most of their time in offices , except on weekends and holidays .
The Secret Service does n’t need guns .
Look at the bad record it has .
Even with guns , we ’ve lost more heads of state than any industrial nation I can think of .
If somebody tries to shoot the president , the agents can stand in front of him .
Whether they do so promptly or with slow deliberation will probably depend on the personality of the president .
It ’s safer that way for everyone concerned .
We will still need tough penalties for those who use guns to commit a crime , but as soon as criminals realize they ’re not going to be shot by the cops , many of them will ditch their guns .
Why risk an extra - heavy prison sentence when all you really want to do is steal something ?
Naturally , police could still carry pepper spray and clubs .
I would n’t even object if they wanted to carry a pocketful of rocks for throwing .
If you practice , you can get to be a pretty accurate rock thrower .
I believe this effort is necessary to stop the militarization of our police .
Some police departments these days will turn out a crew of people who look like Darth Vader , with bulletproof vests , masks , helmets , submachine guns , sniper rifles , hand grenades , etc. , even if the call is for some little old lady who had too much to drink or a mouse heard in a gun store .
There is a fundamental problem with Special Weapons and Tactics teams ( SWAT ) .
They train more than they are ever needed , and therefore they begin to show up when they really are n’t needed .
For example , if there is a rowdy drunk in one apartment , you do n’t have to empty out the whole apartment building .
In saner days , a policeman , usually wearing a plaid jacket and rayon slacks , would go to make an arrest with only a snub - nosed .38 in his coat pocket .
If he had to , he ’d shoot you , but he did n’t show up yelling and cursing .
He came on reasonable and friendly , and tried to talk you into surrender .
Most of the time it worked .
Nowadays , if one guy wants to off himself , a whole SWAT team will show up , block off the street , tie up traffic and diddle around for hours .
I ’ve never understood why police wish to interfere in somebody ’s suicide in the first place .
Naturally , I know that we once had a better class of criminals in this country .
Even in the heyday of gangsters like Bonnie and Clyde , they were generally careful not to shoot civilians , and there was practically no crime against ordinary people .
My cousins and I , even when we were not long past the toddler stage , often went to downtown Atlanta on the trolley and spent a pleasant and safe day .
I suppose , with our society growing increasingly authoritarian , there is no hope for disarming the police .
Well , then , leave the guns for private citizens alone .
If the sorry , no - good criminals are going to act without restraint , then let ’s make sure the few remaining good people can defend themselves .
Charley Reese [ send him mail ] has been a journalist for 49 years .
The Best of Charley Reese
If the two - state solution collapsed , he said , Israel would " face a South African - style struggle for equal voting rights , and as soon as that happens , the state of Israel is finished " .
Israel 's supporters abroad would quickly turn against such a state , he said .
" The Jewish organisations , which were our power base in America , will be the first to come out against us because they will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents , " he said .
The Israeli government is usually bitterly resentful of any comparison to the apartheid regime but Olmert 's remarks looked like an effort to galvanise support from a sceptical Israeli public for a return to peace negotiations with the Palestinians in the days after the Annapolis conference .
Israel has a 20 % Arab minority who are citizens and can vote , although they are frequently discriminated against and are described by some as a " demographic threat " .
Within a few years the number of Arabs in Israel and the Palestinian territories is expected to equal , and then exceed , the number of Jews in Israel and the settlements .
Some Palestinians argue that they should campaign for a so - called one - state solution : equal voting and citizenship rights within a larger country that includes Israel and the occupied territories and in which Palestinians will soon have a majority .
It is not the first time that Olmert has risked the South African comparison .
Four years ago , in another interview with Ha'aretz , he gave a similar warning .
But that was a time when , as deputy to the then prime minister Ariel Sharon , he argued that Israel should unilaterally draw up a border with the Palestinians , withdrawing from Gaza and holding on to the major Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank .
He bluntly described his goal then as being " to maximise the number of Jews ; to minimise the number of Palestinians ; not to withdraw to the 1967 border and not to divide Jerusalem " .
But in the wake of Hamas 's domination of Gaza and last year 's war in Lebanon , unilateralism is discredited among Israelis , at least for now .
Olmert 's warning yesterday came on the anniversary of the 1947 UN partition plan that would have divided British mandate Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state .
His words resonated across the political spectrum .
Israeli historian Tom Segev wrote in yesterday 's Ha'aretz : " It is not easy to understand why so many Israelis still believe that a large Israel without peace is better than a small Israel with peace . "
Israel had most to lose , he said .
" With every settler who moves to the territories and with every Palestinian child who is killed by Israel Defence Forces fire , Israel loses some of the moral justification that led to the decision on the November 29 60 years ago .
The Palestinians have already lost almost everything they had . "
Gerald Steinberg , chairman of the political science department at Israel 's Bar - Ilan University , said Olmert 's comments reflected a long - held belief .
" The logic is precisely the same as the logic pursued by all Israeli governments since 1967 : the realisation that you can't have a Jewish , democratic state and still control the lives of millions of Palestinians , " he said .
He said it was still open to question whether the Annapolis negotiations would succeed .
If they failed , the Israeli government might return to the idea of a unilateral withdrawal from most of the West Bank , but one that left the Israeli military deployed .
Somebody noticed that Lucene does n’t use Lucene to index its own site ; it presents a Google site search like everybody else .
And not just that but their sub- project Nutch , which is specifically for web searching , does n’t use itself .
Natch .
We ’ve heard this story before , and the defendants have a common response : we would love to use our wonderful web software for our own web site , but — damn thee , cruel fates !
— it ’s not the right tool for this highly particular job .
How is it that some fancy - pants framework is always the right tool for an abstract job and PHP is the right tool for a real job ?
It seems like someone ’s selling a load of crap .
But in this case , no : Lucene is not a load of crap .
It ’s a very down to earth project that does something people need and does it well enough to be respected — even outside the Java community .
Lucene is just fine , thank you .
So if the project produces a free product that is worth using for individual sites , why do n’t they use it for their own site again ?
Whatever things a personal site search engine is good for ( triggered updates , customized results display , not feeding daddy Googlebucks ) apply as well to Lucene ’s home site .
Are n’t they a little enthusiastic about sending their own software out to the world ?
Probably they are , but the culture of large scale Java projects , and Apache specifically , is against it .
Random comment :
Apache.org runs the Apache httpd server and serves static pages .
Allowing every sub -project to run its own software on that server would be pretty insane .
Look at how many there are .
If it ’s “ insane ” to let programmers of Apache projects run their own software on Apache servers , that does n’t say much for their revered vetting process for projects and programmers .
Yes , system administration is n’t the same as programming — got it — but any project for the web ought to have someone competent in that as well .
It matters .
Java deployment is treated as some kind of Apollo mission , to be undertaken only with careful planning and a healthy budget .
Open source projects generally have neither of those , so Java projects are left writing code for a void .
Good projects get hooked up with a patron company that pays for practical , internal applications to develop alongside the public framework .
Bad projects build elaborately useless public frameworks and scoff at wasting their precious brains on mere applications programming .
That everyone is scared of Java deployment plays right into their lazy , conceited plans .
And it ’s not the case that every project with a complicated deployment reverts to static HTML or PHP for its own webfront .
The Hibernate blog runs on Seam .
This weblog is rendered using various technologies it hyperventilates over .
And freaking Smalltalk programmers — what could possibly be harder to deploy ?— host their own site , their “ CMS ” if you must , for the Seaside web framework .
The site is n’t always fast , it ’s probably not always running , but at least the framework has the courage to show itself .
This is n’t 1999 .
You do n’t need a server dedicated to one Java application ; a virtualized server is perfectly adequate .
Take one meaty server and create virtuals for every project to use , or not use , as suits its disposition .
Certainly the exposed site should be an Apache Web Server , but there ’s this little thing called mod_proxy_ajp — perhaps the Apache project has heard about it ?
( If not , it ’s discussed in the updated Databinder deployment tutorial . )
You can isolate software .
Anyway , eating other people ’s dog food is disgusting .
Davos is in a state of shock .
Regulars at the talkfest in the snow in Switzerland are accustomed to turning up for a few days of mutual back - slapping , congratulating themselves on the robust state of the global economy and its potential for limitless expansion .
This year the talk is of falling asset prices , of murky financial instruments that have burrowed their way deep into the system , and of the possibility - horror of horrors - that the global economy might be on the brink of a full - scale crisis .
In truth , the sense of surprise is hard to credit , since everything that has happened was entirely predictable .
For 25 years or more , the great and the good of the financial markets have been chipping away at the constraints that were put on them the last time they brought the global economy to its knees , ably aided and abetted by politicians , the international institutions and a battery of thinktanks supported by corporate interests .
Get the government off our backs , they said .
Let the markets work , they said .
Regulation is the enemy of innovation and efficiency , they said .
Politicians duly obliged and now , according to George Soros , there is a systemic problem the like of which we have not seen for 60 years .
And now what do we find ?
Those self - same financial institutions , having made a colossal mess of things , are relying on the forces of darkness to bail them out .
We 're hurting , they say .
Our losses are enormous , they say .
We 're too big to fail , they say .
Sadly , the latter point is absolutely true .
The reason the Federal Reserve announced an emergency cut in interest rates this week was that it feared a global crash in stock markets would clobber Wall Street just at the moment the dire financial consequences of the sub - prime fiasco were becoming evident .
The Fed is Wall Street 's poodle , but - as the US central bank saw it - the choice was between taking a risk with inflation or having collapsing banks deflating asset prices and rocketing unemployment .
But make no mistake , the policy of slashing rates to rescue big finance is both flawed and fraught with risk .
The big flaw in the cheap money approach is that it was too much cheap money that got the US ( and Britain , for that matter ) into difficulties in the first place .
If the policy response to the collapse of one bubble is to blow up another one , then that 's an indication of intellectual bankruptcy .
To that extent , the more cautious approach to monetary easing adopted by the European Central Bank is rather more coherent .
The ECB is concerned about inflation , perhaps obsessively so , but its refusal to be dragooned into cutting rates is at least coherent .
The Fed 's strategy - that a problem deferred is a problem solved - is not .
Under Alan Greenspan , the Fed left rates too low for too long .
Under Ben Bernanke it left them too high for too long .
It takes a mighty leap of faith to assume that it will get it just right this time .
The big risk is that the impact of lower interest rates will make little difference to consumers up to their eyeballs in debt , but will instead lead to a collapse in the dollar which in turn will lead to higher imported inflation .
The Fed cut interest rates with the headline rate of inflation above 4 % ; in the event that price pressure intensifies and the dollar 's decline accelerates , its freedom of action will be seriously compromised .
But the really central issue is the one known as moral hazard .
The reason Mervyn King has been taking a tough line with the City is that he does n't want to be seen to be rewarding those who have taken dumb decisions .
Doing so , the Bank of England 's governor believes , simply encourages them to carry on doing dumb things , resulting in a still bigger crisis at some point in the future .
King is absolutely right .
By cutting rates to bail out Wall Street , the Fed has created a colossal moral hazard problem .
If - and it's an extremely big if - the financial markets ride out the current crisis , and anxiety about recession proves ill - founded , then it does n't take a genius to see what will happen next .
The big financial institutions will be back taking the same reckless gambles and insisting that they should be entirely free to do so .
This , though , is an entirely unsustainable position .
Either the banks and the hedge funds accept that the flipside to deregulation is that they take their losses stoically when times get rough , or they accept that the price of government bailouts is that their activities are more closely monitored and regulated .
They really can't have it both ways .
Faced with that choice , it 's not hard to see which way Wall Street and the City would jump .
These institutions think free markets are a great idea - but only for other people , not themselves .
This is a chance , perhaps a once in a lifetime chance , to break the dependency culture by forcing big finance to be more transparent , having a clearly defined separation between commercial and investment banking , and by banning some of the more toxic products .
Over the past few years , there has been much talk about how poor welfare claimants have responsibilities as well as rights .
Now is the time to apply the same tough love principle to rich bankers .

I recently wrote a post praising Lawrence Lessig , and it looks as though he is taking the idea of running for Congress very seriously .
He took a courtly , gentlemanly , and utterly devastating shot against Jackie Speier , the leading candidate , that strongly suggests to me he's in the race .
Or , as a friend tells me , this could all be an elaborate scheme to raise money for Creative Commons , a worthy cause if there ever was one .
But anyway , while watching Lessig 's video , a couple of things leapt out at me and gave me pause .
The first is Lessig 's apparent conviction that public financing of political campaigns will help ameliorate the worst aspects of what he calls " the economy of influence . "
So what exactly does Lessig mean by public financing ?
I 'm not sure .
I imagine his detailed policy proposals will actually be pretty sophisticated and smart .
Right now , his Change Congress platform is summarized in three planks .
Candidates would pledge to
( 1 ) refuse money from lobbyists and PACs ;
( 2 ) ban " earmarks " ;
(3 ) and " support public financing of campaigns . "
The wording suggests that Lessig favors tough limits on private contributions or at the very least a very large - scale expansion of public funds .
This , in Lessig 's view , will drive change .
Might it instead protect incumbents , or entrenched ideas ?
Mark Schmitt , who has been closely involved in efforts to regulate campaign finance for well over a decade , wrote a terrific , insightful reassessment of the campaign finance reform movement for Democracy last year .
He ended the essay on a chastened yet optimistic note .
Do n’t build complex systems that put government in the position of trying to equalize all resources or ban all contributions .
Instead , let voters shape the process through their own preferences , through organizing to enhance their power , and by using public funds to echo and enhance the preferences of ordinary citizens .
Avenues by which large contributions influence politics will remain , whether they take the form of PACs , 527 committees , other nonprofits , or blogs .
The best we can do is to offset their influence by broadening the range of voices that can be heard , as opposed to enhancing their influence by closing off other channels of money .
And fortunately ,
Today we have the makings of a virtuous circle voters are more engaged , small donors have returned , and the most corrupt members of Congress have been held accountable .
Reformers should ask :
What are the modest , non-restrictive interventions that would help push this virtuous cycle in the right direction ?
If they begin to approach the question in that way , the next decade of reform might be more productive than the last .
One wonders if Lessig has spoken to Schmitt and others who 've been in the trenches .
If he has n't yet , I hope he does .
The New York Times recently examined several public universities
charging higher tuition for certain majors , such as business ,
science / engineering , and journalism .
According to the article by Jonathan D. Glater , " Such moves are being
driven by the high salaries commanded by professors in certain fields ,
the expense of specialized equipment and the difficulties of getting
state legislatures to approve general tuition increases , university
officials say .
‘ It is something of a trend , ’ said Barmak Nassirian ,
associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate
Registrars and Admissions Officers . "
Differential pricing draws mixed reviews from experts , bloggers and
others , and some say it ’s not a new phenomenon .
The bigger
question , mentioned by a source in the Times story , is whether such trends are pushing public higher education toward
becoming a private good .
Education for Its Own Sake–and for a Good Job
According to the NYT story , Mark J. Kushner , dean of the College of Engineering at Iowa State University ,
Do You Know What You 're Worth ?
GET A FREE PAY REPORT
said he thought society was no longer looking at higher education as a common good but rather as a way for individuals to increase their earning power .
There was a time , not that long ago , 10 to 15 years ago , that the vast majority of the cost of education at public universities was borne by the state , and that was why tuition was so low , he said .
That was based on the premise that the education of an individual is a public good , that individuals go out and become schoolteachers and businessmen and doctors and lawyers , that makes society better .
That ’s no longer the perception .
Dr. Richard Vedder , director of The Center for College Affordability , said in a recent blog , " The notion that higher education prices should be low because education is a public good takes another hit with differential pricing , I suspect .
As I have indicated elsewhere , however , I think higher education is primarily a private investment good , as well as a consumer good , not something with massive positive externalities as the higher ed apologists and romantics would like you to believe . "
Kushner gets it right–studies , statistics and experts suggest higher education is increasingly the way to jobs with better salaries ( see my related story here , from PayScale ’s August 2007 newsletter ) .
There ’s nothing wrong with this ; students are essentially buying knowledge ( and in some majors , skill - sets ) , which they know will help them advance in the job market .
But college is about more than just getting a good job .
For students fortunate enough to leave home and experience college in their late teens and early 20s , it offers them a chance to learn how to : think , be independent , deal with peers just as smart or smarter than they are , approach professors , manage time and money , and more .
College is a unique , four - year chance to learn about yourself , an invaluable time when you can steep yourself in education for its own sake .
At the end of the day , society benefits from well - rounded individuals who ’ve had such experiences .
The Big , Expensive Picture
According to the NYT story :
Starting this fall , juniors and seniors pursuing an undergraduate major in the business school at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , will pay $ 500 more each semester than classmates .
The University of Nebraska last year began charging engineering students a $ 40 premium for each hour of class credit .
And Arizona State University this fall will phase in for upperclassmen in the journalism school a $ 250 per semester charge above the basic $ 2,411 tuition for in - state students .
To give context to differential pricing , it ’s worth considering how much higher - education costs are climbing overall .
According to the College Board ’s Trends in College Pricing 2006 report :
The data in this report confirm the widespread perception that college prices are rising much more rapidly than the prices of other goods and services .
Like last year ’s increases , the 2006 - 07 increases in tuition and fees are smaller than those of many recent years .
That said , the 35 percent jump in inflation - adjusted average tuition and fees for in - state students at public four - year colleges since 2001 - 02 is the largest for any five - year period over the 30 years covered by this report .
Cuts in state and local funding are a major cause of skyrocketing tuition costs at public colleges , the report says .
When it comes to differential pricing , the concept is n’t new , some say .
John V. Lombardi writes in the Reality Check blog at Inside Higher Ed :
How much money buys happiness ?
A wide body of research suggests the number is approximately forty thousand dollars a year .
Daniel Gilbert , professor of psychology at Harvard University , says once you have enough money to meet basic needs — food , shelter , but not necessarily cable “ ? incremental increases have little effect on your happiness .
Aaron Karo , comedian and author of the forthcoming book , Ruminations on Twentysomething Life , responds to the number with , “ If you want to draw a line in the sand , happiness is having enough money so you do n’t have to move back in with your parents . ”
To someone who just spent four years in college living off nine - thousand - dollar loan stipends , an increase to forty thousand means a lot — moving from poverty to middle class .
But it ’s a one - time rush .
After you hit the forty - thousand - dollar - range money never gives you that surge in happiness again .
Twentysomethings who are looking for happiness from their careers will benefit from research about their parents ’ choices .
Richard Easterlin , professor of economics at University of Southern California says previous generations have proven that our desires adjust to our income .
“ At all levels of income , the typical response is that one needs 20 % more to be happy . ”
Once you have basic needs met , the axiom is true : more money does not make more happiness .
So then one asks , what does matter ?
The big factors in determining happiness levels are satisfaction with your job and social relationships .
And in case you found yourself slipping back to thoughts of salary , according to Easterlin , “ How much pleasure people get from their job is independent of how much it pays . ”
Unfortunately , people are not good at picking a job that will make them happy .
Gilbert found that people are ill equipped to imagine what their life would be like in a given job , and the advice they get from other people is bad , ( typified by some version of “ You should do what I did . ” )
Gilbert recommends going into a career where people are happy .
But do n’t ask them if their career makes them happy , because most people will say yes ; they have a vested interest in convincing themselves they are happy .
Instead , try out a few different professions before you settle on one .
For college students , Gilbert envisions this happening with part - time jobs and internships at the cost of “ giving up a few keggers and a trip to Florida over spring break . ”
But even if you wait until you enter the workforce , it makes sense to switch from one entry - level job to another ; no seniority and scant experience means you have little to lose .
So it ’s an ideal time to figure out what will make you happy :
Use a series of jobs to observe different professions at close range to see if YOU think they make people happy .
It ’s simple , proven advice , but few people take it because they think they are unique and their experience in a career will be different .
Get over that .
You are not unique , you are basically just like everyone else .
Gilbert can , in the course of five minutes , rattle off ten reasons why people think they are unique but they are not .
For example :
We spend our lives finding differences between people to choose teachers , band mates and spouses , so our perception of peoples ’ differences is exaggerated …
And then Gilbert gets to grapes : “ If you spend seven years studying the differences between grapes , no two will look the same to you , but really a grape is a grape . ”
So your first step is to stop thinking you ’re a special case .
Take Gilbert ’s advice and choose a career based on your assessment of other people in that career .
You next step is to focus on social relationships , because in terms of happiness , job satisfaction is very important but social relationships are most important .
And by social relations , most researchers mean sex — with one , consistent partner .
So consider giving your career aspirations a little less weight than you give your aspirations for sex .
For those of you who like a tangible goal , David Blanchflower , professor of economics at Dartmouth College says , “ Going from sex once a month to sex once a week creates a big jump in happiness .
And then the diminishing returns begin to set in . ”
He adds , to the joy of all who are underemployed , “ It ’s true that money impacts which person you marry , but money does n’t impact the amount of sex you have . ”
Maybe all this research simply justifies the twentysomething tendency to hold a series of entry - level jobs and put off having children .

Following is a guest post by Daniel R. Brooks , FRSC .
Brooks is a professor in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto .
In June 2007 he attended an apparently secret conference organized by ID advocates and entitled the “ Wistar Retrospective Symposium . ”
This is a reference to an obscure 1966 Wistar Institute symposium which became famous in creationist circles ( just read the 2000 + google hits on “ wistar creationism ” ) for allegedly being the place where mathematicians demonstrated the unworkability of evolution by natural selection .
If one actually reads the conference transcript , one realizes that what really happened was that approximately two befuddled math / computer science people , Murray Eden and Marcel - Paul Schützenberger ( who was later a longtime friend / collaborator of David Berlinski , by the way ) , were schooled in basic population genetics & evolutionary theory by the likes of Ernst Mayr and Sewall Wright .
It makes hilarious reading , along the lines of “ we biologists worked out this math 40 years ago , why have n’t you read up on it ” and “ I ca n’t get my particular evolution simulation to work on my 1960s - era computer , therefore something is wrong with evolutionary theory ! ”
The central misunderstandings from the mathematician side involved , as always , the same old dumb “ but it ’s impossible / extremely improbable for these sequences to come together all at once by random chance ! ” argument , which ignores ( as always ) the elemental point that evolutionary theory is the exact opposite of all - at - once - by - chance assembly .
Anyway , intelligent design , being creationism relabeled , inherited creation science ’s fascination with the 1966 Wistar Symposium , and for years IDists passed around the same old creationist talking points about it .
Apparently they liked it so much that they decided to organize a 40 - year retrospective meeting , and although it was n’t sponsored by Wistar or the Gordon Foundation , somehow or other they got a number of serious scientists – not many with serious experience with the ID movement , though , as far as I can tell – to attend and spend a few days listening to ID propaganda .
It appears that they had the help of Bruce Weber and maybe Scott Turner , about the only two biologists I know of who have the saintlike patience required to remain uncynical about ID advocates and their claims to be ( a ) doing science , ( b ) not creationists , etc .
Anyway , it is evident that the mainstream scientists at the meeting were less than impressed , which perhaps is why we ’ve heard nothing about this meeting until now .
The reaction of Gunter Wagner , in particular , is interesting , since for years he has been quoted out of context by the ID movement to make it seem like he thinks evolution is on its last legs and going to expire real - soon - now .
Brooks was one of these attendees and has written an entertaining account of the meeting and of the ID presentations , along with his thoughts on the meeting .
I post his text with original formatting ; I have added a few headings in [ brackets ] to increase readability in blog format .
I have suggested to Brooks that he might prefer to respond to questions in the blog comments , rather than having a bunch of people send him email , but it is his call on whether or not he wants to do this .

ID : Intelligent Design as Imitatio Dei
Wistar Retrospective Symposium
Boston , MA
June 3 - 6 , 2007
by Daniel R. Brooks
On November 18 , 2006 , I received an email invitation from a long - time friend and colleague , Bruce Weber .
He was excited about the fact that he had been asked to co-organize a conference to mark the 40th anniversary of a Wistar Institute symposium , sponsored by the famous Gordon Foundation , called “ Mathematical Challenges to the Neo- Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution . ”
The 2007 conference was to be a retrospective on that conference , called “ Emergence vs. Design . ”
That final bit did not bode well , but Gordon Foundation conferences are prestigious events and Bruce felt it was necessary to engage Intelligent Design advocates , mostly in an effort to try to clarify which concerns were truly objections to Darwinian Evolution and which were objections to the version of neo -Darwinism Stephen J. Gould called the “ hardened synthesis ” and Niles Eldredge has called “ hyper - Darwinism . ”
Bruce was inviting leading theoreticians who had been involved in efforts to bring concepts of systems theory , complexity theory , hierarchy theory , information theory and self - organization into mainstream evolutionary biology .
I suggested a number of people , including Niles Eldredge .
I was a little perplexed to see he had not been invited .
On January 12 , 2007 , I received an email from Niles , inviting me to be a member of the editorial board of Evolution : Education and Outreach .
Only at an editorial board meeting in New Orleans the first weekend in March did I begin to understand the potential significance of a Gordon Conference that took ID seriously .
Like most university - based evolutionary biologists , I had taken very little notice of the ID phenomenon , and once the appropriate verdict was made in the Dover trial , I tuned out .
As I learned more about the upcoming meeting , I became aware that we were trapped in a no -win situation .
If we did not appear , the ID advocates would declare unilateral victory .
If we did appear , they would claim that they were on equal footing with us , and would claim victory as well .
How had this become a sponsored event by the Gordon Foundation ?
Despite some trepidation , I decided to attend .
I am glad I did .
First , the good news .
I learned upon arriving that the only connection between this conference and a real Gordon Conference was that is was being held in Boston , the ID co-organizer is named Bruce Gordon ( no relation so far as I know ) and the conference was being called a retrospective on the 1966 meeting .
This was reassuring – the real Gordon Foundation was spending its money on relevant scientific issues rather than this .
Now the bad news .
A few days after the meeting ended , we all received an email stating that the ID people considered the conference a private meeting , and did not want any of us to discuss it , blog it , or publish anything about it .
They said they had no intention of posting anything from the conference on the Discovery Institute ’s web site ( the entire proceedings were recorded ) .
They claimed they would have some announcement at the time of the publication of the edited volume of presentations , in about a year , and wanted all of us to wait until then to say anything .
These actions made me aware of the extent to which the ID movement was willing to bear false witness in order to achieve its goals , and that kept me from falling prey to my empathy for the underdog .
The conference had given me a chance to listen to the top guns of the ID movement expound their views .
That helped me organize my understanding of their program and formulate my reactions , which I summarize below .
Finally , I am most appreciative of the fact that Bruce Weber ’s invitees were so interesting .
They formed a second symposium discussing intriguing glimpses into the cutting edge of current evolutionary theory .
What I present below is not a transcript of the proceedings , and if I report something that is factually incorrect , I am happy to stand corrected by an unedited recorded version of events .
At the same time , many of us said things entre nous that we did not voice in public , so the recorded transcript is by no means the entire text of the proceedings .
What I report herein is a distillation of notes I took during the presentations , and thus records my impressions of what seemed most important at the time .
I have tried to give people the benefit of the doubt , mostly because I do not want to appear to demonize the ID presenters to the same extent as they tended to demonize evolutionists .
But demonizing evolutionists , as opposed to disagreeing with them , is such a common aspect of ID that it seems to be a necessary part of the program .
So , when I was most offended by mindless aggression , I wrote it down .
I also warn the reader that I am still angry about being lied to , and no doubt that anger creeps into this report .
[ First session : Theoretical Perspectives ( Framework ) ]
The first session was entitled Theoretical Perspectives ( Framework ) .
The IDer presentation by Stephen Meyer was entitled , “ The Theory of Intelligent Design as an Inference to the Best Explanation for the Origin of Biological Information . ”
Meyer began with a quotation from Richard Dawkins
“ Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose . ”
claiming this meant Dawkins believes biological systems are designed .
Therefore , the only argument between Dawkins and ID is the source of the designer .
Meyer then stated that Francisco Ayala expressed the belief that biological systems are designed in a recent article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
From this he concluded that all neo -Darwinists believe this to be true , and therefore all Darwinists believe this to be true .
This is factually incorrect .
Dawkins ’s statement does not state that there is design in nature , only the appearance of design , the position taken by evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin .
[ Parenthetically , my presentation at the conference was based on the notion that there is no evidence of intelligent design because there is no evidence of any design .
What many people , ID and evolutionists alike , take as evidence of design is actually historical correlation .
More than 250 years ago , Hume noted that all historical sequences , when viewed retrospectively , look determined , but this was not evidence of any design , natural or supernatural . ]
Meyer stated early in his talk that ID is the idea that certain features of biological systems are best or better explained by an intelligent cause rather than random processes .
Certain features of biological systems are diagnostic of intelligence guiding the process .
One of these is the concept of irreducible complexity .
Another is what he called specified complexity , which he equated with information .
At this point , I was tempted to ask why the intelligence was so preoccupied with beetle information , but that would have been flippant and the ID people were very preoccupied with being taken seriously .
Meyer next stated that Darwin laid down the practical rules for historical inference , but that historical inferences are not real science .
This is because they involve abduction , or reasoning from effects to causes .
By real science , Meyer meant deductive reasoning , from causes to effects .
He then claimed that scientists and philosophers all agree about the causal inadequacy of historical inference .
Therefore , historical explanations can only illuminate arguments based on plausibility , they cannot provide causal explanations .
Meyer then admitted that ID reasons from the existence of present - day design to a Designer .
However , he claimed that they should be required only to satisfy a burden of plausibility , not a burden of proof , since that is all Darwinian reasoning can produce .
He stated parenthetically that they are not necessarily against evolution , they just think it ’s not the whole story .
This position is based on a misunderstanding of how historical inference is used in scientific research , which I will discuss later .
For the moment , I will just point out that Dr. Meyer has a published record of misrepresenting historical inference in evolution ( see Statement from the Council of the Biological Society of Washington at www.biolsocwash.org).
Next , Meyer claimed that ID relies on the principle of uniformitarianism , but his version of uniformitarianism is that causes operating today comprise the realm of those causes operating in the past .
He then got to a core issue of ID , stating that the origin of biological information is perhaps the greatest issue to be resolved .
He asserted that new information is needed to build new forms .
I would point out that Meyers defines information as improbability and the kind of information he speaks about is sequence specific information , defined as being so improbable that intelligent agents must have produced it .
He uses this argument to claim that the Cambrian explosion requires ID because it happened too fast for Darwinian processes .
The only support for this view is his article in the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington , based on his definition of Darwinian processes , one used uniformly and exclusively by the ID speakers at the conference .
For them , Darwinian / neo - Darwinian processes involve the following elements : ( 1 ) mathematically randomly produced variation in the smallest elements of biological systems , ( 2 ) such variation produced in an incremental manner ( their version of gradualism ) , ( 3 ) each incremental variant necessarily being functional and also functionally superior to the previous version , ( 4 ) environmental selection ( which they equated with natural selection ) being the only organizing force in the process .
Simply put , the ID take on this caricature is that there has not been enough time for random variation on such a small scale to be designed by natural selection into the well - designed , machine - like perfection they claim we see today .
Meyer then set out the major premises of ID as a sort of complex syllogism that is meant to lead inevitably to the conclusion that ID is the best explanation for the existence of biological systems and their properties :
1. Conscious intelligent agents exist in the world .
2 . These agents have causal and discernible powers .
3 . These agents use their powers to have discernible effects - including irreducible or integrated complexity , complex digital and sequence information .
At this point , science demands that these agents be identified so they can be studied empirically .
Unfortunately for the IDers , the only such agents identified by Meyer and the other ID speakers were humans .
Using their own brand of uniformitarianism , we must conclude that only humans are such agents , and yet ID proponents do not conclude that humans produced the worlds ’ biodiversity .
4 . The creation of new information is habitually associated with conscious activity .
In making this statement , Meyer did not specifically state that only conscious activity could create new information , in a manner similar to Dawkins ’ statement in which Dawkins did not actually say that there is design in nature .
He also did not point out that DNA is a digital information molecule .
This is critical , because they do not say that all DNA is designed , even though all DNA is a digital replicator .
By their own admission , not all information is designed ; therefore information per sé cannot be defined as improbability of a magnitude so great that only design could account for it .
Meyer claimed that “ conscious and intelligent ” means what it is about ourselves that we understand to be true – we are conscious and intelligent causal agents , ergo we have been made by a conscious and intelligent causal agent .
Using self - understanding as the basis of your theory for a Designer of the entire world sounded to some as if God were being made in human image , a key form of hubris in many religious traditions .
Furthermore , Meyer claimed that the Designer works through evolutionary processes .
So , their Designer has the same properties as evolution , except the Designer ’s causal powers are more similar to ours than to those of natural processes .
If the Designer is God , that sounds like a demotion to me .
In addition , I see nothing in the argument that requires mutations to be guided by an intelligence that knows where it ’s going ahead of time .
5 . Some of the same effects are found in biological systems .
6. Top -down causation ( Design ) provides a possible explanation for these effects .
Similar effects do not necessarily imply a common origin ; that is only one possibility , but it is a possibility .
7. Bottom - up ( natural , or evolutionary ) processes cannot explain the biological phenomena that ID explains .
The fact that one may find alternative explanations unpleasant does not make them untrue .
In his landmark book , Science as a Process ( Chicago , 1988 ) , David Hull pointed out that one characteristic of academic disputes is that your side can always know what it needs to know while your opponent ’s side can never know what it needs to know .
This leads to pointless name - calling , straw man-building and personal conflict .
Many scientists would say that top - down causation does not provide an explanation of the phenomena that ID claims to explain .
Impasse .
This point does nothing to illuminate either side .
Science has to be more than an endless cycle of verbal jabs .
8. ID is the best explanation .
This would be a valid inference if propositions 1 - 4 and 6 - 7 were not all fatally flawed .
But they are .
Therefore , these conclusions that Meyer presented at the end of his talk are equally flawed :
1. Uniform experience shows that only intelligent agents generate large infusions of new info .
This statement is factually untrue .
2 - Successful evolutionary models require intelligent input from humans .
This is trivially true .
In fact , unsuccessful evolutionary models require intelligent input from humans .
This represents a profound misunderstanding , deliberate or ignorant , of the role of models in science .
Scientific models are powerful in direct proportion to how easily they can be overturned by material evidence .
Modellers expect their models to require modification based on empirical data .
In science , a model that cannot fail is useless .
3 - Successful models for origin of life experiments require intelligent input from humans .
See “ 2 . ”
4 - Ribozyme engineering requires engineers .
Note that conclusions 2 - 4 are three more statements about humans attempting to mimic biological processes .
They are not relevant to any discussion of how non-human agents ( natural or supernatural ) might have produced those same processes .
5 - Layered informational hierarchies arise only from intelligent agents .
This statement is factually untrue .
Darwin wrote that he felt that phylogeny ( the Tree of Life ) was the relationship taxonomists had been unconsciously documenting in their ( pre-Darwinian ) classifications .
Likewise , I think it is possible that human engineers , especially those working with machines that mimic organic functions , are trying to engineer in a very short time what evolution has produced over 4 billion years .
So , rather than suggesting that God creates new information in the same way humans do , why do we not say that humans produce new information the way living systems produce it .
Then we can ask how the natural production of information and the human production of information might differ .
If I were a devout believer in a true Deity , I would expect that our efforts to engineer biological information and biological systems would pale by comparison with the evolutionary panorama .
If we are matching or exceeding the Designer , it would be difficult to believe in his / her / its omnipotence ( depending on the size of one ’s ego , of course ) .
John Collier asked , since Meyer stated several times that IDers do not question neo-Darwinism and believe ID could function through natural processes , what causes from ID could cause evolution .
Meyer ’s response was that IDers do n’t necessarily think evolution happened .
And finally , it is time for them to retire the assertion that ID wins over evolution on the basis that “ There is not enough information in any given microbe right now to generate all the rest of the species on the planet . ”
This is silly , and does not help their cause .
It is trivially true that no contemporary microbe frozen in time and space contains all the genetic diversity of all the species on this planet .
But evolution is about descent with modification and neither descent nor modification play any role in the ID discussions .
Using their reasoning , I have no daughter because there ’s not enough information in me to generate her .
That does not mean she was produced by the intervention of a supernatural designer .
It is true that during the mechanical process that produced her , I may have invoked the name of the Deity at the height of ecstasy .
But I know who was in the room at the time of conception , and my daughter is a wonderful combination of the material traits of both of those people , in addition to having many wonderful traits of her own , some of which appear in her children .
I personally do not want ID to take away that strong sense of personal connection among the generations .
[ Second session : Are There Limits to Macroevolution ? ]
The second section in the conference was entitled Are There Limits to Macroevolution ?
I was never able to understand the title , even though my presentation was assigned to that section .
The session led off with Doug Axe ’s presentation , “ The Language of Proteins – Revisiting a Classic Metaphor with the Benefit of New Technology . ”
After the requisite testifying ( I used to be an evolutionist until I saw the light ) ,
Axe gave a talk focusing primarily on a computer program for proteomics that his company has produced , and presumably is trying to market .
The only connection between ID and this presentation were some statements meant to show that because lots of mutations do not destroy whole genomes , genomes have been designed to withstand mutations .
If you look at molecular functions outside of their organic context , they appear so improbable that they must have been designed .
He stated that laboratory studies can degrade enzymes and still get 25 % functional neutrality .
To him , this means that you need 25 % change at every sequence position to get this effect naturally , and ( once again , so boring ) there has not been enough time for the slow , slow Darwinian processes to have produced these results .
Here ’s the problem with this view .
Axe likened mutations to typos in a sentence , treating them as additive .
And , if that were the whole story , then there might not have been enough time for what we see to occur by natural processes .
But Axe makes two factual errors .
The first is that proteins do not exist or function on their own , so they are not additive .
Rather , they function in a complex living environment made up of hierarchically organized structure and function .
With few exceptions , sequence alignments have shown that there is minimal conservation at the level of individual sites and increasing conservation at higher levels .
The second factual error is that neither Darwinism nor neo-Darwinism requires rates of protein change to be slow , consistent , gradual or additive .
Darwin ’s wrote , in Origin of Species , that overall evolutionary changes would likely be incremental because they are the net outcome of a multitude of selection vectors affecting different aspects of the structure and function of organisms in different ways .
This does not require incremental , slow change in the origin of novelty at any level .
At this point I was asking myself what this presentation had to do with how proteins were produced in the first place , and thus the conference question of design vs. emergence ?
Proteomics researchers mimic the macro-mutational process of protein evolution in the lab at an accelerated rate , produce novel proteins , and search for functional differences that have some economic value .
Axe ’s company has an online program producing analogies with primary and secondary structure and super - secondary structure , trying to link primary structure - based sequences to structural components of Chinese characters , using some sort of numerical assessment of the geometric correctness of the gene for the best - fitting Han character , then assessing the extent to which this points to novel functional proteins .
This is based on the notion that similarity in structure means similarity in function .
The program requires no input from theories of origins , either evolutionary or design .
Axe attempted to make a connection with ID by stating that changes in protein design are meaningful if : 1 . they do n’t make the sequence meaningless ; 2 . they do n’t diminish the meaning ; 3 . they enhance the meaning ; 4 . they construct an important new meaning .
This attempt fails : replace “ design ” with “ structure ” and “ meaningful ” with “ functional , ” and we have standard proteomics .
In the context of design vs. emergence , I thought an important proteomics question would be , “ Why did the Designer not give us more than a relative handful of all possible proteins ? ”
If they are simple enough compounds that we can synthesize them in our laboratories , then they certainly were not beyond the Designer ’s capabilities .
Were they withheld from us for a reason known to the Designer alone ?
Should IDers probe into secrets not revealed by the Designer ?
And what if some of these novel proteins are inserted into other living species , or even humans .
Is this not the height of hubris , tinkering with the Designer ’s Design ?
None of the ID advocates at this meeting saw any conflict between belief in a Designer and the idea of engineering life , including human life .
There must be a reason why so few proteins occur naturally .
Perhaps the Designer used only those necessary to produce life on this planet , and left the others for us to discover and play with , a sort of Easter egg hunt for humanity .
As a scientist , I also see no problems with searching out novel proteins in an effort to enhance the human condition .
But protein engineering does not address issues related to design , creation , emergence or evolution , so Axe ’s presentation was irrelevant to the topic of the conference .
One questioner pointed out that character order in Chinese is very important , so there is more redundancy and hierarchical structure in Chinese than in English .
Axe responded by denouncing Mao ’s efforts to simplify Chinese rather than answering the real question about redundancy .
Another questioner asked about the possibility that his models are not independent of his assumptions .
Axe responded by denouncing unnamed people who get the right answers before they produce their model and says he has no results because he did not do what these unnamed others do ; he built his model before he had any results .
Privately , some of us wondered who was the target marketing audience for a proteomics computer program based on Han ideographs .
Some felt it was simply good capitalism , going after a large market .
Others , noting
Axe ’s attack on Mao , wondered if there was as evangelical agenda hidden in the marketing .
The next presentation in this section was by Michael Behe , entitled “ Observational Data that Strongly Circumscribe the Role of Randomness in Molecular Evolution . ”
Behe is a biochemist at Lehigh University , whose department has put a formal disclaimer on its home page about his activities .
He is the primary reference for the ID concept of irreducible complexity ( which is rebranding the argument from design better articulated by Enlightenment philosophers ) , equated at this conference with irreducible integration .
Irreducible complexity seems to be the principle that , “ if I ca n’t figure it out how natural processes operate , it must have been designed in a manner I can understand . ”
Behe ’s speaking style was highly polemical , consisting mostly of small snippets , almost sound bites .
He began with the mandatory caricature of Darwinism , saying that random mutation is the key to Darwinism .
He opined that common descent is interesting but trivial ( this itself is an interesting assertion , as most IDers do n’t accept common descent as an explanation for shared traits ) , and natural selection is interesting but quite modest , and trivial as well .
He stated that Darwinism has no way of traversing evolutionary landscapes ; Darwinian evolution is swell if you need one or two steps , but if you need more , you run into trouble .
He stated that when “ people ” [ not named ] talk about evolution they always speak in terms of things getting more and more fit , but he takes “ fit ” in this sense to mean functional design and efficiency .
He stated that the goal [ of biology ] is not just to find out if something is possible but whether it is biologically reasonable .
He claimed that he was not saying Darwinian processes could not do these things , just that they do not do them .
Darwinism is not reasonable , because it does not make things better .
Behe ’s dismissal of phylogeny and selection as trivial does not mean that he does not believe in them .
Behe did not sound like a creationist when he accepted an evolutionary origin of humans ; despite what he has written , he spoke of “ the line of organisms leading to humans ” and “ the line of primates leading to humans . ”
As well , his introducer pointed out that Behe has 9 children ( 1 fewer than Darwin , but 1 more than Thomas Huxley , Darwin ’s bulldog ) .
If they were produced by the same mechanism as my daughter , it would seem that , whatever his religious beliefs , Behe has been hedging his bets by increasing his Darwinian fitness as much as possible .
Nonetheless , given Behe ’s dismissal of studies of phylogeny and selection as trivial , what does he thinks is interesting and important about biology ?
Well , he disparaged Darwin and his 19th century colleagues for not knowing very much about biology and especially about the foundations of life .
He also stated that Darwin thought everything was simple and now we know it is complex .
Behe said if it looks complex , it is complex .
He then said that if it is complex , it must be designed .
But that is not the only possible conclusion from the observation that living systems are complex .
Anyone who has read Origin of Species knows that Darwin ’s formal theoretical framework was complex in proportion to the complexity of the process and products of life .
In fact , the complexity of Darwinism raised objections from traditional philosophers of science of the 19th and early 20th century , leading to several attempts to simplify evolutionary theory , including neo-Lamarckism , orthogenesis and the hardened synthesis .
There is ample literature on this topic ( for a recent readable summary and some key references about the complex formal structure of Darwinism , see Brooks and McLennan , 2002 , The Nature of Diversity , University of Chicago Press , and Brooks and Hoberg , 2007 , Evo. Edu. Outreach 1 : 2 - 9 ) , so there is no reason for Behe to make these claims other than poor basic scholarship .
The crux of Behe ’s perspective is that Darwinian processes are negative , degenerative and destructive .
He claimed that Darwinian evolution takes place by degrading genes , because disabling a specific gene is > 100 times easier than making a new one ( a classic non-sequitur ) .
He equated Darwinian evolution with Colombian drug lords blowing up bridges to keep government troops from coming in to clean them out , and with terrorists in Iraq .
He equated Darwinism with an evolutionary arms race , which he likened to “ trench warfare like in Iraq ” ( there has been no trench warfare in Iraq since the Iran - Iraq conflict , in which the US supported the Iraqis , even providing them with the chemical weapons of mass destruction that they eventually used on their own people ) .
This was the first time we saw the bared fangs behind the smiles .
Behe proceeded to parody two areas of evolutionary research .
The first is a long - term set of experiments on selection and drift in E. coli supervised by Richard Lenski , a MacArthur Fellow , member of the US National Academy of Science and professor at Michigan State University .
Behe decried the experiments for not doing something they were not designed to do .
That is , he noted that none of the E. coli isolates in the experiments have evolved any new structures .
He stated his opinion that Lenski ’s experiments had shown evidence of parallel gene changes in various populations , but that none of those mutations / deletions occurred in order to benefit the population .
Thus , Behe claimed that Lenski ’s experiments provide empirical support for the notion that Darwinian processes are destructive , degenerative and degrading .
Interestingly , Behe did not mention Lenski et al . ’s simulations using AVIDA , which do produce complexity .
The major problem with this is that Behe thinks Darwinians believe that any environmental stressor should produce lots of mutations in an effort to adapt to it .
But this is more a Lamarckian than a Darwinian view , Darwin having been of the belief that , in the face of extreme environmental stressors , most things go extinct .
It is true that some evolutionary biologists write and speak as if they believe environmental stressors will produce lots of mutations ( some of which are bound to be beneficial ) when they really mean that such stressors will produce lots of selection .
Behe then moved on to chloroquine resistance in one of the species of human malaria , Plasmodium falciparum .
Behe has written that the immune system is an example of irreducible complexity .
It is possible he believes Darwinian processes have undermined the original design , so that we are no longer protected from , e.g. falciparum malaria , but he did not comment on that point .
In that case , development of chloroquine would be a case of human agents attempting to repair the design punctured by Darwinian processes — implying a kind of evolutionary arms race , because now those nasty Darwinian processes have produced chloroquine resistance .
How does the trivial thing called natural selection consistently override the design in the case of parasitic disease ?
Why did we have to develop chloroquine ; why did the Designer not fix the designed apparatus ?
A skeptic might wonder if the designer cannot or will not counter all these Darwinian influences .
Since something like 50 % or more of the species on this planet are parasites , this is a question that would seem to require an answer on the part of IDers .
Alternatively , one might ask IDers about the morality of humans trying to destroy one of the Designer ’s species .
How are we to know if falciparum malaria and the public health problems it causes are not part of a larger Design of which we are largely ignorant ?
Gunter Wagner characterized parasites as simple organisms living in simple and permissive environments , in which the loss of genetic structure should not be considered degenerative .
The problem with this perspective is that parasites are more often more complex than their free - living relatives , and they live in some of the most complex and least permissive environments imaginable ( for a good summary , see Brooks and McLennan , Parascript , Smithsonian Press , 1993 ) .
During one generation , a member of the trematode genus Haematoloechus will live in a mollusk , dealing with its immune system , will then spend some time free swimming in fresh water as a potential hors d’oeuvre for any planktivore , will then spend time encysted in a dragonfly naiad , dealing with its immune system , before being eaten by a frog , migrating to its lungs , and dealing with its immune system .
So , what IS going on ?
Chloroquine is a highly toxic substance , so dosages for humans must be strong enough to kill the parasites but not the host ; this means that in many cases the dosage will be sub-lethal for malaria .
Chloroquine accumulates in the lipid storage vacuoles in cells , including red blood cells .
When a malaria merozoite enters a red blood cell and begins digesting it , its activities release the stored chloroquine , which then accumulates in the merozoite ’s excretory vacuole until it achieves a lethal level , and the organism dies .
Chloroquine - resistant falciparum malaria merozoites have unusually high pumping rates in their excretory vacuoles .
This suggests that they are simply mechanically better at de-toxifying themselves .
Chloroquine has acted as a natural selector , filtering out those merozoites with a low pumping rate , and today we are left with a perfect example of natural selection in action .
Selection has rapidly changed the frequencies of alleles because of pre-existing variation and a strong directional selection vector .
The net result of our development of chloroquine has been that both humans and Plasmodium falciparum still survive .
No matter how intelligently designed our efforts to destroy P. falciparum , evolution stays ahead of the game .
We may be smarter but evolution has a 4 billion year head start .
The final IDer presentation in this session was by Richard von Sternberg entitled , “ Genomes , Formal Causes and Taxa . ”
He described himself a neo -Platonist and a Catholic , but professed to be uncertain as to whether or not he was a creationist .
Sternberg is the former editor of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington , fired for scientific misconduct after publishing Meyer ’s unfortunate article .
Sternberg discussed his belief that the nested sets in the phylogeny of life are not trivial , but also are not the result of evolution .
Rather , he believes they are the result of the influence of highly self - stable ontogenies , producing morphotypes specified into what he called equivalence classes , which he believes characterize the major taxonomic groups .
How these unique ontogenetic pathways emerge or are inserted into biology is uncertain to Sternberg , given that he rules out the historical accumulation of attributes ( which he called frozen accidents and frozen accretions ) as an explanation .
[ Third session : The origins of biological information ]
The third session was entitled , “ The origins of biological information . ”
The first ID presentation was by Robert Marks , entitled “ The Need for Active Information in Evolutionary Search . ”
He began with blanket statements about “ things from the evolutionary literature that have been pointed out to me by Bill [ Dembski ] … ”
That turned out to be mostly ad hominem attacks on Richard Dawkins .
Marks described his approach as evolutionary computing , defined as searching through space looking for a known ( also called targeted or pre-determined ) conclusion .
He presented a thought experiment , involving the Genesis creation myth , designed to show that if you know what you ’re looking for , a random search for the solution is not very efficient ( with the usual argumentation about tiny probabilities of anything happening at all and not enough time since the beginning of the universe for any outcome to have occurred randomly ) , but a search with additional information added is efficient .
This was a blinding glimpse of the obvious , but it was also irrelevant , because biological evolution is not a process in which the system searches randomly for a pre-determined endpoint .
As well , the search space is not static through time , with some of the changes in that space being the result of evolution itself .
There is no hierarchical or contextual organization or function of the information in his program , which is based on a deterministic algorithm , despite the fact that evolution itself is indeterministic .
Questions of search efficiency are the preoccupation of human agents called bio-engineers , preoccupied with mimicking natural processes and speeding them up to achieve human - time results .
Engineers do not want anything to evolve , they want to make it now .
They do not care how it came into existence , they only want to know if they can improve it .
As with the case of Axe ’s program for examining protein structure , there is no necessary connection between the research activities of this approach and the issue of design or evolution .
So , how does evolutionary computing claim a link to ID ?
By treating organisms ( or particular traits ) as characters in something like a computer video game , where instructions from the player determine completely the activities of the characters .
Marks spoke about his program ’s target - motivated search world .
He suggested that by keeping only “ the fittest ” at each step , his program could find the pre-determined endpoint quickly .
He suggested that if this were done by natural means , it would be like having two children , killing one and keeping the other , then iterating the process .
The program does not keep intermediate results , so historical accumulation of partial solutions is ruled out .
That means you have only two choices - large numbers and randomness , which is inefficient , or large numbers and design , which requires external information .
Marks called that “ active information , ” hence the “ need ” for active information in evolutionary searches .
The astute reader will recognize that these are just Dawkinsian biomorphs , which Dawkins was careful to point out were only interactive toys to illustrate one aspect of selection , not actual evolutionary models .
Marks then switched his ad hominem attack to Tom Schneider , an information theorist at the National Cancer Institute working on genomics screening for cancer .
“ Without going into the details … ” Marks dismissed all of Schneider ’s work by saying he introduces information into his models and claims he does not .
What Marks did not say was that the “ introduced information ” in Schneider ’s program is basic data , known genetic sequences .
This is not the same as Marks ’ active information .
Marks then stated that once his group knew what Schneider had found after 40,000 iterations with his program , Marks ’ program got the same answer in only 400 iterations .
That would seem to make Schneider an agent of active information sensu Marks .
For the IDers , this is not a problem , because they stipulate that the designing intelligence is human - like , which is the reason we can comprehend it .
But in the case of criticizing Schneider , Marks ’ position is tantamount to saying that a student can finish an exam faster if he has a copy of the answers beforehand .
True , but not relevant .
Gunter Wagner questioned Marks ’ notion that evolution involves a target .
Reacting to the obvious reductio ad absurdum , Marks became very belligerent and talked over Wagner , claiming that all artificial life simulations have a target .
Before Wagner could respond , Behe piped up apparently on cue about Lenski ’s work , and Marks replied , “ Well correct if I ’m wrong , but Lenski ’s work did not work , right ? ”
Wagner then stated that this criticism of Lenski ’s work is unwarranted because prokaryotic microbes and the experimental environments that does not demand much of them – therefore , we should not be surprised that the evolutionary changes were small .
Marks then asked Prof .
Wagner if he believed that active information comes from the environment .
Wagner agreed with this , and Marks seemed pleased , because he also believes active information comes from outside the living system .
Wagner ’s agreement would seem to make neo-Darwinism another argument from design .
The problem is that Marks and Wagner were talking at cross purposes .
“ Active information ” for Marks is whatever information is needed to make each embryo develop .
“ Active information ” for Wagner is the influence of the filtering process that determines the kinds of organisms we see at any point in time .
Wagner would agree that the active information sensu
Marks does not come from the environment , but from the parents .
This exchange kept Wagner from being able to respond to the ID claim that all artificial life simulations have a target , which is simply not true ; anyone even vaguely familiar with artificial life research would know of the work by Alvaro Moreno and his group at the University of the Basque Country , and would know that they are focused on emergence , not design .
Having a set run-time for simulations is not the same as having a pre-set target .
Marks ’s presentation was followed by one given by William Dembski entitled , “ Conservation of Active Information in Evolutionary Search . ”
He began by demonizing David Sloan Wilson , author of Evolution for Everyone .
Dembski claimed that the “ no free lunch theorem , ” should be adopted as a guiding principle for evolutionary computing as defined by Marks .
He neglected to mention that the theorem was formulated by Wolpert and Macready , two evolutionists .
Dembski interpreted NFLT to mean that if your algorithm is deterministic , you cannot generate new information and therefore if new information is needed , it must come from outside .
NFL , according to Wolpert and Macready , says that no search strategy is better than random chance , when averaged over all possible fitness landscapes .
Dembski did not elaborate the line of reasoning from Wolpert and Macready to his view .
Rather , he illustrated his version of NFLT using a parable of a saint playing dice , in which one die came up 6 and the other split in two , one coming up 1 and the other coming up 6 for a total of 13 , allowing the saint to win .
Dembski claimed that this showed that the sacred must be included in a material way in producing new information , but I do n’t think many Christians would consider cheating at dice , or any other material process , to be a solid basis for the sacred .
He called evolutionary searches a form of the “ needle in the haystack problem , ” and claimed that the “ Information Problem ” in biology is one of trying to account for the successful searches .
Claiming that “ most biologists ” believe it is a random process , and that random or blind searches for needle in the haystack problems cannot produce the life we see , Dembski concludes that life must be the result of an assisted search .
He suggested that we can model the assisted search properly because the targets are implicit in our ability to understand the signs of design in the natural world .
That is , the scope of the Designer ’s work is the same as the scope of human understanding .
Dembski ruled out inheritance as a source of the active information by claiming that this was simply a search for the search , which would lead to an infinite regress .
Therefore , we should not look to inheritance as having played any part in the design .
Thus , he concluded that we know a source of new , external , active information and it is intelligence .
Furthermore , he concluded that God put the information into the system and challenged anyone to find a material alternative .
He called this the theory of evolutionary informatics .
I ’m not sure it ’s a theory , but I am sure it ’s not science .
John Collier observed that evolutionary informatics is based on the Aristotelian notion of a Prime Mover and assumes that information can only come from other information .
How do you test this ?
If the information exists prior to the origin of life , it ought to be in the non-biotic realm and you should be looking for it .
Have you or anyone else looked for this , and is there any evidence of it ?
For a world class philosopher , Collier was being quite gentle , so this must have been a critical point , because it provoked a decidedly ad hominem attack by Marks urging Collier to “ Try to be more nimble in your thinking . ” and …” I hope you were listening when I made a very convincing argument earlier in my talk … ”
Dembski then asserted that you ca n’t find empirical evidence of the Designer ’s actions .
Axe joined in , stating that the principle of Divine Simplicity is well entrenched in theology , and suggested , oxymoronically , that this means we cannot place any limits on God ’s complexity .
My recollection is that we broke for coffee almost immediately after that statement .
Only one other time , in a roundtable discussion the last day , did I hear such direct invocation of supernatural principles .
Gunter Wagner reiterated that John was only posing the problem and suggesting a test .
The issue is where does the additional information come from ; if , as IDers claim , the source of that information leaves no empirical trace , the issue cannot be investigated scientifically - ID is not science by the very words of its advocates .
Bob Ulanowicz pointed out a mathematical inequality in Dembski ’s model , implying non-conservation , and asked where the conservation comes from .
Dembski answered that he just inserts that into the program himself .
Bob followed up by asking if that meant Dembski was open to the idea of information being created and destroyed .
Dembski replied that it ’s like “ a thermodynamic thing ” but it ’s also not “ a second law thing . ”
With Bob Ulanowicz , me , John Collier and Jonathan Smith in the audience , Dembski may have been trying to change the subject .
The difference between biology and engineering is that Life “ makes it up as it goes along . ”
Organisms look like they know where they are going mostly because they “ know ” so much about where they have been as a result of inheritance from their parents – this is the sense in which common descent is the explanation for the mistaken appearance of design in living systems .
There is no preset endpoint , so organisms and populations follow the line of least resistance in the environment through time .
And if it does not know where it is going , it can get there much more efficiently in that manner than by being directed to a preset endpoint regardless of the environment .
And finally , inheritance is not an infinite regress – it goes back only as far as the origin of life .
Another parenthetical digression .
The invited scientists included some of the real cutting edge information theorists , including Gregory Chaitin , whose formulation of algorithmic information theory cleared up the confusion surrounding the relationship between information and entropy , John Collier , whose foundational philosophical work on information theory is the leading edge , Jonathan Smith , the mathematician who provided the initial proof of the Brooks - Wiley dynamic proposing that information and entropy could increase simultaneously in evolution , and Robert Ulanowicz , whose work on the dynamics of ecosystems produced similar results .
None of us exerted much effort to try to educate the IDers about the current state of information theory , beyond our own presentations , which were polar opposites of the IDers views .
Nonetheless , it is true that many evolutionists are naïve about these issues , and some mainstream evolutionist accounts of information are so seriously flawed that a naïve IDer could get the wrong impression .
[ Fourth session : The Problem of Integrated Complexity ]
The fourth session was entitled The Problem of Integrated Complexity .
First scheduled in this session for the IDers was Scott Minnich , scheduled to give a talk entitled “ Testing Competing Hypotheses for the Origin of the Bacterial Flagellar Motor and the Type III Secretory System : Co-option , Co-evolution or Aboriginal Design ? ”
Minnich , however , did not appear at the conference , so Doug Axe read his paper .
This began with the parody that natural selection was Darwin ’s argument against design , that natural selection works on random variation in the smallest increments possible over the longest time intervals possible , and thus could not produce the finely - tuned machinelike , irreducibly complex parts of organisms we see today , and therefore Design is preferable to evolution .
He clearly meant to parody natural selection , but in fact the parody is in the assertion that biological entities are finely - tuned , irreducibly complex machines .
He also repeated Behe ’s claim that all Darwinian processes are destructive .
Thus , when portions of the flagellar apparatus occur by themselves in otherwise fully functional microbes , it is the result of degenerative evolution .
The presentation included machine - like cartoons of the flagellar apparatus , but did not say they were cartoon representations .
Here I was flabbergasted – I assumed this was a rhetorical stance , but some of these folks actually believe the machine metaphor to be the literal truth .
News flash – flagella are not actually little machines ( and sperm do not contain little homunculi ) .
The talk concluded by trying to use a phylogenetic test to argue against one particular hypothesis , but displayed a marked lack of understanding of the way in which scientists use phylogenetic comparisons in testing evolutionary hypotheses .
Specifically , phylogenetic comparisons can be powerful tools for falsifying some hypotheses , but are rarely sufficient , by themselves , for verifying any particular explanation ( see Brooks & McLennan , 2002 , The Nature of Diversity , University of Chicago Press ) .
Thus , the fact that one hypothesis about the evolution of the flagellum is falsified by phylogenetic criteria does not mean that ID is the explanation .
For example , Minnich did not even bring up the new study , recently published in PNAS , concerning the discovery of specific gene duplications that accounted for the cellular components necessary to make the flagellum .
Nonetheless , when John Collier spoke about that study in his presentation the following day , none of the ID participants expressed any surprise ( or interest ) in the publication , which falsifies one of the icons of irreducible complexity .
In fact , the IDers could have jumped on that study , which had serious flaws ( see : / archives / 2007/04/flagellum-evolu-3.html ) .
Nonetheless , another study provides a natural explanation ( see : / archives / 2006/09/flagellum-evolu.html ) , so Collier ’s point remains relevant , and unanswered .
The next presentation in this session was by Ann Gauger , a microbiologist and employee of the Biologic Institute , whose presentation was entitled , “ Assessing the difficulty of pathway evolution : an experimental test . ”
Her presentation was remarkable in part because she performed experiments and reported original data .
She began with the repetitive attempt at a reductio ad absurdum , stating that the current complexity of metabolic pathways within cells could not have been created by gene duplication or gene recruitment ( another name for co-option ) , and therefore they were designed .
She suggested that contemporary evolutionists believe if there is not a payoff in terms of adaptive value within a few generations , any duplicated gene will be lost , and that for recruitment / co - option to work , function must change within a very few mutations .
It is factually untrue that these assertions are an essential part of Darwinian theory .
At most , they were initial starting points for investigations into protein evolution long ago , but today ’s evolutionary biology does not adhere to any of them .
Gene duplication is considered an integral part of evolutionary dynamics and one major source of the co-option that is so ubiquitous in evolution .
She suggested that when similar proteins are “ arranged by hierarchy , ” the evidence suggests they arose from a common ancestor that predates the eukaryote / prokaryote split and perhaps even the Archaea .
Gauger thus , like Behe , accepted not only a phylogeny of life but an ancient singular origin of life .
Then she embarked on a series of experiments designed to emulate 2 billion years of microbial evolution in Petri dishes over a few bacterial generations .
Specifically , she wanted to see if either of two forms of a protein would mutate directly into the other under those experimental conditions .
They did not .
Gunther Wagner congratulated Dr. Gauger on doing some great experimental work , but noted some logical inconsistencies in inference .
The first is a phylogenetic comparative issue ; it is necessary to know the ancestral state of the two proteins .
If you are dealing with two proteins each derived separately from a common ancestor , then the experiment involves a minimum of two steps , backwards to the ancestral condition and then forwards to the alternative derived condition .
It seems unlikely that you would be able to do that experimentally , especially if you have no idea of the environmental conditions under which the evolutionary diversification took place , and no idea if there were any intermediate forms that no longer survive .
In response , Gauger admitted that the two proteins she studied are quite old and that studies of enzymes that are more recently diverged from each other report a lot of functional co-option , but only on a small scale .
She was then prompted by one of her colleagues to regale us with some new experimental finds .
She gave what amounted to a second presentation , during which she discussed “ leaky growth , ” in microbial colonies at high densities , leading to horizontal transfer of genetic information , and announced that under such conditions she had actually found a novel variant that seemed to lead to enhanced colony growth .
Gunther Wagner said , “ So , a beneficial mutation happened right in your lab ? ” at which point the moderator halted questioning .
We shuffled off for a coffee break with the admission hanging in the air that natural processes could not only produce new information , they could produce beneficial new information .
[ Fifth session : Novel Evolutionary Mechanisms ]
The fifth session was entitled Novel Evolutionary Mechanisms .
Scott Turner , a professor in the Forestry department at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry , Syracuse led off with , “ Agents of Biological Design : Why Are Living Things Well - Crafted for the Things They Do ? ” Turner began with a statement from E.D. Cope ’s 1887 collection of essays , Origin of the Fittest : Essays on Evolution and the Primary Factors of Organic Evolution , which was reviewed in American Naturalist the same year ( Amer. Nat. 21 : 465-467 ) .
Turner did not mention that Cope was a Lamarckian , instead emphasizing Cope ’s statement that if Darwinism was survival of the fittest , it had failed to provide an answer to the question of the origin of the fittest .
So by 1887 , Spencer ’s catchy but misleading characterization of Darwinism as “ survival of the fittest ” had already become a flash point for critics .
And those critics included Darwinians as well , who deridingly called Spencerians such as August Weissmann , “ neo - Darwinians ” ( for an excellent discussion , see Peter Bowler ’s 1983 classic , The Eclipse of Darwinism ) .
Turner ’s presentation provided an excellent example of what Niles Eldredge has called the hyper -Darwinian mode , in which the distinction between Lamarckian and Darwinian processes is blurred .
Turner described himself as a skeptical neo-Darwinist , saying neo-Darwinism is not wrong , just presumptuous .
Like other speakers , he used blanket statements like , “ The classical way of thinking about this is … ” and “ The neo - D view of this is …. ” without ever citing a source .
He believes strongly in design and the machinelike nature of living systems ; thus , he unapologetically used teleological language in his explanations .
His perspective is that a gene sits in a machine , and requires a well - designed organism in order to replicate itself .
At the same time , he did not accept the ID version of design , claiming that by claiming intelligence and consciousness as the source of design , ID is a form of Platonic essentialism .
Nonetheless , he followed IDers such as Behe in ascribing anomalies and deficiencies to natural processes , and all positive functions to design .
Turner made a Lamarckian - sounding statement when he claimed that hereditary memory is an illusion , yet did not claim that the design we observe results from an inner drive to adapt to local conditions , regardless of hereditary .
Turner specializes in the study of social insects , particularly tropical mound - building termites .
He defined Macrotermes mounds as designed organs of extended physiology ( sort of colony - level lungs ) .
He played a short piece of video about the structure and function of the mounds from one of David Attenborough ’s documentaries , in which Attenborough consistently used assertions about the purpose of each thing in nature .
Turner then asserted that natural functions , in particular homeostasis , are ipso facto evidence of design .
Thus , if you find evidence of homeostasis , you may assume design and move directly to a search for the agent of that design .
A wonderful metaphor , Dawkinsesque .
But vacuous as a scientific explanation .
A simpler explanation for the termites ’ nest ventilation function is as the metabolic activities of the termites heat the air in the nests , that air rises , drawing cool air in from the surrounding soil , cooling the nest and refreshing the air .
A questioner asked Turner in what way he could test or propose a test .
Turner responded that one should stress the system to see the limits of its functions .
The questioner replied that testing the limits of the function is not a test about the cause of the function .
Turner clearly believes that there is a close functional “ fit ” of organisms to their surroundings , which he takes as de facto evidence that all members of each species have been designed for one particular environment .
He did not discuss the Darwinian notion that the fit is contextual ( i.e. , there is often a difference between fundamental and realized niches ) , and is the result of organisms imposing themselves on their surroundings , i.e. that they create their own niches ( suggested in the late 1980s by Brooks and Wiley in Evolution as Entropy , and more recently formalized as the Niche Construction Hypothesis by Odling - Schmee and colleagues ) .
A reasonable test of these two possibilities would be to find out how often species are capable of surviving , even flourishing , in habitats other than the ones in which they arose ( for which they were designed ) .
If Turner ’s view were correct , we would have no invasive species , nor would species be able to survive when their habitats of origin experienced dramatic climate changes .
In simple terms , the ID version of global ecology is “ a place for everything and everything it is place , ” whereas the Darwinian view is “ everything that can make a place for itself survives . ”
What about testing Turner ’s notion that hereditary memory is an illusion ?
Turner sees replicators as different from and opposed to persistors , with replication an illusion and persistence due to design .
It seems to me that there is a large amount of evidence of a causal relation between parental and offspring structural and functional phenotypes .
If the same parents have one child in the desert and then another in the city , they will still resemble each other and their parents ; the first will not be a desert organism and the second a city organism .
[ Sixth session : Epigenetics , Embryology , and Developmental Biology ]
The sixth session was entitled Epigenetics , Embryology , and Developmental Biology .
The first ID presentation was by Paul Nelson , entitled , “ Why Building Animals is Hard . ”
Nelson is a young earth creationist .
His introductory ad hominem attacks were directed mostly at a shadowy group characterized as “ academics . “ He claimed , for example , that you cannot find a university bookstore whose section on evolution does not include a majority of books that begin with a complaint about the inadequacies of neo -Darwinism , and yet the academics running the show at those universities teach only the orthodoxy .
In this case , I know he was intentionally misrepresenting the truth , because when he introduced himself to me the first day of the conference , he told me that when he was a student at Northwestern in one of David Hull ’s classes , he had to read Evolution as Entropy , not commonly thought of as an orthodox tract .
He gave Francis Crick a partial pat on the back , saying that when he thought like a design theorist he did okay but when he thought about evolution , he went wrong .
As a creationist , Nelson objected to both of Darwin ’s theories , phylogeny and natural selection .
He asserted that in order to “ build an animal , ” you have to have a developmental process pointing to ( pre-targeted for ) that animal beforehand .
Once again , organisms are viewed as machines , with pre-targeted endpoints determining their origins , functions and outcomes .
Clearly , the Designer is not interested in anything like Free Will – no creativity , no adaptability , no flexibility , just automaton - like behaviour .
Ontogeny is a linear program of instructions like a machine assembly manual .
Nelson used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as his exemplar .
He began with a news report in Science about the first complete cell fate map for C. elegans .
The title of the report was , “ Why is development so illogical ? ” Nelson took this as a scientific assessment rather than dramatic license by the journalist and editor in an effort produce a catchy title that would pull readers into the story .
What the journalist meant was , “ Why is development in this nematode not simple and linear . ”
The answer was that development is highly non-linear , hierarchical and historical , and gives all appearances of having been assembled piecemeal over time rather than having been designed as a unit .
Nelson only discussed the title of the piece , and certainly did not mention the primary research literature on which the item was based .
He next set up another of the IDers improbability arguments .
He claimed that we do not know much about cellular differentiation , and what we do know about it does not support evolution .
He then said , do n’t think about what is controlling this , do n’t think about DNA or anything , just assume there are instruction rules ; no hierarchy , no feedback , no context .
Just assume there is a linear sequence of instructions , and assume that every metazoan begins as a single cell in an undifferentiated state .
Then he went through a laborious description of each event in C. elegans ontogeny , claiming that the odds of getting any one of them is very low , so the odds of getting all of them together in one functioning ontogenetic program at random is even less likely , and so when you then consider all the kinds of ontogenetic programs , it must have all been designed .
An irrelevant argument , since all the premises are factually incorrect .
As a creationist , Nelson did not need to apologize for using teleological language , and his use of teleology helped illuminate his view of the Designer .
He never spoke about organisms wanting to do things they were designed to do ; rather , he spoke about “ us ” wanting things to happen , as in , “ Now , if we want this kind of cell to occur , we need a rule for … ”
“ Animals ‘ need ’ a germ line to keep track of the instruction set while the rest of the organism is following the instructions .
Once again , we find human - like agents projected onto the organisms as the Designer .
Nelson closed with an attempt to make it appear that Rupert Riedel , a pioneer in the use of systems theory in evolution , actually believed in design because he used teleological language .
But Riedl clearly had the same view of the source of apparent design as did Darwin ; in the same 1978 text , Riedel referred to evolution as a series of doors closing behind you .
And the portion of the passage Nelson referred to was taken out of context .
I guess this is not surprising for someone with no understanding of the importance of context in ontogeny , and Nelson admitted it was a bit of a cheap shot , saying he put that in specifically for Gunter Wagner , who had been a student of Riedl’s .
( The shot was wasted , as Wagner had already left the conference . )
The real action in this presentation emerged from a question by Murray Eden , emeritus professor at MIT and one of the participants in the 1966 ( real ) Wistar Conference .
Murray asked why the current view , that communication between cells at each time interval , each of which changes the conditions in which the developing embryo finds itself , which then prompts the next step , which then leads to new communications , and so on , could not explain all this .
Nelson reiterated his position that the instruction set has to be a priori and complete , and ontogeny is a designed linear program of instructions producing a pre-determined outcome .
This was followed by additional observations that Nelson ’s view assumes that only the DNA is involved in development .
This neglects what is going on inside the cell but outside the nucleus , as well as what is going on outside the cell .
And that means you cannot address the issue of whether the instructions are conditional or determinate .
And since each kind of extra-nuclear influence represents an environmental context for development , you cannot say that there is not enough natural dimensionality for ontogeny to occur without externally designed information being inserted in some manner .
Nelson replied that you ‘ cannot presuppose Mom ’ in order to provide an evolutionary explanation for ontogeny .
What does that mean , and why is it wrong ?
Let ’s take a short detour through what we actually know about C. elegans reproduction and development .
Fertilization in C. elegans is internal , meaning that the male ’s sperm is transferred to the reproductive tract of the female , and finds its way to near the ovary where ripe unfertilized eggs have been released .
Each of those unfertilized eggs is a complexly organized living system produced by the female ( hereafter referred to as MOM , the shorthand acronym for “ mother ” ) .
That system contains a haploid complement of genes organized into chromosomes , so that each gene is associated with other genes and each chromosome with other chromosomes , forming a genomic environment .
That haploid genome is surrounded by a nuclear membrane which forms a boundary between the genome and the cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg and which acts as the immediate environment for the haploid genome .
The cytoplasm of the unfertilized egg , itself a very complex system of organelles , some of which have their own genomes , constitutes the third environmental layer surrounding the haploid genome .
This is all surrounded by a lipid bi-layer cell membrane , a fourth environmental layer that provides a boundary between the unfertilized egg and its surroundings .
Those surroundings , the fifth layer of environment , is the lining of the oviduct .
All five layers of environment are a priori to the development of the egg , and all are provided by MOM .
After copulation , sperm interact with all five layers of environment , changing each one and thus the very conditions of life for the unfertilized egg .
Fertilization itself produces a marked change in the innermost environment , where two haploid genomes , one produced by MOM and the other by the external agent we will call DAD ( you figure that one out ) , fuse to form a new and unique diploid genome .
This event affects each of the outer layers of environment , all of which were produced by MOM , and changes in those environments then provoke changes in the activities of the genome .
At the same time , MOM responds to these changes by secreting yet another environmental layer , this time between the embryo and the lining of the maternal reproductive tract , called an egg shell .
Mitosis and cell adhesion are among the built - in instructions , ensuring that once cell division begins , the new embryo itself will produce additional layers of environment .
Once the embryo attains a certain number of cells , it will no longer be possible for all cells to be in physical contact , so the complex layers of environment become spatially partitioned and different , provoking different cellular responses in different parts of the embryo .
Even the same genomic response can produce markedly different outcomes depending on spatial and temporal context .
This is what Murray Eden was talking about – we know this happens , and we know that the multiple layers of environment were initially provided by MOM .
At the risk of belaboring an earlier point , developing organisms look like they know where they are going mostly because they “ know ” so much about where they have been as a result of inheritance from their parents , especially MOM .
There is no preset endpoint , organisms just follow the line of least resistance in their environments , the final outcome constrained but not determined fully by their inherited genomic and extragenomic information .
So , it is true that information essential for proper development is not all contained in the DNA of the developing organism .
But almost all of that extragenomic information comes from MOM .
The information provided by MOM is historical and it is layered hierarchical information .
In the first ID presentation of the conference , Meyer claimed that layered hierarchical information could only come from design , so for metazoans at least , we have identified the Designer , and it is MOM .
If you do n’t presuppose MOM , development not only looks impossible , it is impossible .
Nelson also claimed that natural selection is not capable of creating nematodes , which is true but irrelevant .
In Darwinism , natural selection is not called upon to create , but to select .
And yes , that does beg the question of where the entities acted upon by selection come from .
Darwin suggested that the major mechanism was the then - unknown laws of inheritance , coupled with what he called the mysterious laws of growth , the mysterious law of the correlation of parts , and the cohesion of homologies .
Today , those phenomena are less mysterious , but still fascinating and incompletely understood .
And they still exhibit no evidence of design ; they are complex , “ illogical ” and they do not function with machine - like efficiency , but they manage to produce an amazing variety of organisms .
As a colleague recently put it , “ No big mystery , but a neat trick . ”
The final ID presentation was by Jonathan Wells , “ Designing an Embryo : Beyond Neo- Darwinism and Self - Organization . ”
Wells persisted in much the same vein as Nelson , claiming that the problem of ontogeny was getting a 3 - dimensional organism from a 1 - dimensional program , and that ontogeny is a process of sending an organism ahead to a pre-determined endpoint .
His position is that the organism is contained in some way in the embryo in a way that is best explained as the result of conscious intent .
He noted that in the 1966 ( real ) Wistar Conference , Lewontin said it would be possible to generate 3 - dimensional organism from a 1 - dimensional program , and that as recently as 1987 , Watson et al. ( 1987 ) stated that ontogeny is written linearly in the base pairs .
Real developmental biologists , the authors of the primary literature that none of the IDers ever cited , know this is not true ; DNA is not 1 - dimensional , and ontogeny is not just DNA .
Not everything instructional is in the DNA of the nucleus because that is the same in all differentiated cells of an organism .
He attributed the fact that the nuclear DNA is the same in each cell of the body to the Principle of Genomic Equivalence .
Let ’s not over - think this ; the reason all my cells have the same DNA is because they are all descended from a single fertilized cell , not because some extra-biological agent placed the same DNA in each of my cells at each point in development .
Again , as Darwin noted , simple inheritance is the primary explanation for similarities among organisms .
Extragenomic information does not come from extra-biological sources .
Having dismissed efforts to explain development from a purely genomic perspective , Wells then claimed that epigenetics is a neo -Darwinian concept because it is genic , and rejected that as well .
From Waddington to Jablonka , however , developmental biologists have wondered if neo -Darwinism has become too reductionistic to encompass development fully , and have proposed ways to recapture the priority of the nature of the organism as emphasized by Darwin .
A few facts notwithstanding , Wells then concluded that ID allows you to consider explanations in developmental biology that do not assume it is all in the DNA .
Once again , correct inference except that the initial assumption that standard science assumes DNA exclusivity is false .
Wells then discussed a number of interesting epigenetic phenomena that are well known : in vitro production of parthenogenic Xenopus using sperm with centrosomes but no nuclear DNA , the role of cortex ( cytoplasm ) structure in Drosophila embryogenesis ; Homeotic genes .
Wells would like all of these phenomena to be evidence of pre-targeted design elements , but they are not .
The Xenopus and Drosophila experiments demonstrate the importance of the historical and purely biological environmental context provided by agent MOM , while homeobox genes are responsible for unlocking stored history .
All of this research underscores the recognition that the “ targets ” are abductive , set by historical events in the inherited flow of intrinsic information .
The notion of pre-targeted endpoints sensu Nelson and Wells ( and Marks and Dembski ) has relatively recent roots in Gnostic ( Manichaean ) concepts of Pre-destination , introduced into Protestant Christianity by John Calvin , and has long since been dropped by mainstream Calvinist denominations , such the Scottish Presbyterianism that I was brought up with .
Conclusions
ID dooms itself .
In their own words at this conference , IDers espouse a program in which the scope and power of the Designer is restricted to purely human dimensions , in which the effects of the Designer on biological diversity have left no discernible trace that can be detected scientifically , in which the effects of Darwinian processes are the only biological phenomena that can be studied scientifically , and in which Darwinian processes are overwhelmingly more powerful than those of the Designer ( because they inevitably cause the Designer ’s creations to degenerate ) .
For example , it must be evil Darwinian processes that produce emerging infectious diseases , otherwise each pathogen would remain associated only with the host for which it was designed .
This is all just too silly .
So , there is no question that ID is not science , even though many adherents are , or at least were trained as , scientists .
In addition , ID does not represent a real challenge between science and religion .
I was prepared for all of this , because we ’ve seen this movie before .
Among enlightenment philosophers , Gottfried Leibniz ( 1646 –1716 ) was instrumental in making the point that the explanation for any part of the universe that leaves no empirical mark is beyond reason and thus beyond the scope of science .
Anything that is not beyond reason has to leave evidence of its existence - the designer must have left signs of design if we wish to consider ID science .
Leibniz suggested , however , that asking for scientific evidence in matters of faith re-made God in our own image , thereby reducing His power and scope .
Immanuel Kant ( 1724-1804 ) attempted to explain why humans consistently try to circumvent Leibniz ’s dictum .
He placed the blame on Imitatio Dei ( ID ) , the desire to be God .
Kant considered ID the source of all human discontent because it inevitably led to the diminution and disappearance of God , followed by complete loss of faith and utter hopelessness .
Kant ’s prescription that science and faith maintain themselves in separate spheres was based on his desire to preserve faith , not destroy it .
Modern science educators have an explicit mandate to pass on the marvels of scientific discovery to each new generation while being neutral with respect to the faith - based beliefs of their students .
Presenting ID in science classrooms , much less taking it seriously at all , violates that mandate .
Officials have decided !
According to a report , Indonesian commuters riding on the roofs of trains will be sprayed with colored liquid so that security officers can identify and arrest them .
Rush hours are the most stressful .
Electric trains that link Indonesian capital to the towns nearby are full of passengers during rush hours , with many sitting on the roofs due to a lack of space inside or to avoid paying .

They have tried several methods to discourage them from doing so but all have failed .
They have to resort to extreme measures .
The railway company PT Kereta Api will from next week douse them with a colored liquid so that officers can identify them when they get off the train , the Jakarta Post said .
“ We will confiscate their IDs and give them a ticket , ” Kereta Api regional spokesman Akhmad Sujadi was quoted as saying .
“ We will send a copy of the ticket to their family , their local neighborhood unit head , their employer , or , if they ’re students , their headmasters , ” added Sujadi , who described the move as “ unique . ”

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Gold slipped further away from record highs after a choppy session on Thursday , extending the previous session ’s steep losses and hit by chart - based weakness and falling energy prices .
The yellow metal could decline further in the near term , largely due to a possible recovery of the dollar , but losses should be limited by flight - to - quality demand amid credit worries and inflation concerns , market watchers said .
“ The failure of gold to take out Monday ’s high at $ 914 was seen as a negative by a lot of traders .
I just do n’t see this market turning around unless there is a news item coming out that takes people by surprise ” said Adam Hewison , president of INO.com .
Spot gold XAU= fell as low as $ 876.90 an ounce , and was last quoted at $ 876.70/877.40 by New York 's close at 2:15 p.m. EST , against $ 885.60 /886.30 late in New York on Wednesday , when it dropped 2 percent .
It hit a record high of $ 914 on Monday .
The most - active gold contract for February delivery at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange GCG8 settled down $ 1.50 at $ 880.50 an ounce .
“ $ 900 level is going to be a fairly important level for the market just to digest for the moment .
I think we have to get more consolidation in the market to push it to the $ 950 , $ 1,000 levels , ” Hewison said .
Weaker crude oil prices dented gold 's appeal as a hedge against inflation .
U.S. crude futures CLc1 ended 71 cents lower at $ 90.13 a barrel on Thursday .
“ Given the recent volatility , wide intra-day price swings seem set to continue , ” said James Moore , precious metals analyst at TheBullionDesk.com .
The dollar slipped versus the euro on Thursday after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke repeated in a speech to the U.S. Congress ’ House Budget Committee that more easing may be necessary .
Bernanke also said he will support efforts to craft a fiscal stimulus package and repeated the U.S. central bank was ready to act aggressively to counter recession risks .
Investors have priced in at least a half - percentage - point cut in the benchmark U.S. rate this month , with some saying the Federal Reserve could cut rates by three - quarters of a point .
The Fed is scheduled to render its interest rate decision at the end of a two - day meeting from January 29 to 30 .
CONSOLIDATION SEEN
Zachary Oxman , senior trader with Wisdom Financial in Newport , California , said gold should consolidate in the near term , moving in a trading range between $ 870 and $ 900 .
“ Any big corrections here are going to be met with some long - side accumulation buying , ” Oxman said .
In research news , consultancy firm GFMS said on Thursday that the price of gold is expected to correct lower in the near term , but then surge as high as $ 1,000 an ounce later this year , as a weak U.S. dollar and lingering credit turmoil burnish the metal ’s investment appeal .

Meanwhile , industry - sponsored World Gold Council ( WGC ) said on Thursday that higher gold prices and increased volatility hurt the consumption of gold jewelry in India , the world ’s top gold buyer , in the fourth quarter of 2007 .
In 2006 , India imported about 715 tons of gold .
London - based ETF securities expected to more than double the money managed in its listed exchange traded commodity funds , including precious metals , to about $ 7 billion by the end of 2008 .
In other bullion markets , the key gold futures contract for December 2008 delivery < 0 # JAU :> on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange ( TOCOM ) ended 26 yen per gram higher at 3,074 yen in a technical rebound after falling by the daily 120 yen limit on Wednesday .
In industry news , Highland Gold Mining Ltd HGM.L plans to raise gold output by at least 10 percent this year and is on track to hit 200,000 ounces of production by 2009 , managing director Henry Horne said .
Silver XAG= rose to $ 15.86/15.91 an ounce , versus $ 15.84/15.89 late Wednesday , supported by news that BHP Billiton Ltd / Plc BHP.
AXBLT.L had stopped operations at its Cannington silver mine in Australia after a fatality earlier in the day .
Platinum XPT= slipped to $ 1,555/1,560 from $ 1,559/1,564 an ounce late in New York on Wednesday , while palladium XPD= was down $ 5 to $ 366/371 an ounce .
They might not build $ 150 - million F - 22 stealth fighters , but in other ways insurgents and terrorists are amazingly tech savvy .
For one , they 're hip to using grungy , bare - bones websites to spread tactics and ideology across the planet on the cheap , transforming once - isolated local and regional conflicts into genuine threats to global stability .
Author John Robb calls this " open - source warfare , " and believes it 's the most important force shaping the 21st century .
If so , we 're screwed .
Seven years after the launch of Wikipedia – the user - edited online encyclopedia that brought the " open source " concept to the masses – the U.S.
Army is still playing catch - up .
The Army 's idea of harnessing the ' net is to launch isolated websites , put generals in charge and lock everything behind passwords , while banning popular open - source civilian websites .
Colonel James Galvin , head of the Army 's " Battle Command Knowledge System , " openly admits that when it comes to the collaborative internet , the bad guys have a " niche advantage . "
It did n't have to be this way .
Around four years ago there was a grass - roots explosion of informal web - based tools for soldiers .
Four captains at West Point founded companycommand.com as a forum for junior officers to swap battlefield lessons .
And the 1st Cavalry Division launched CAVNET to sponge up and spread patrol tactics in Iraq .
Both were victims of their own successes .
Galvin 's office , located at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas , was set up to institutionalize these forums and others .
To the Army , that meant hiding them all behind the password - protected Army Knowledge Online web portal , and assigning trained moderators and high - ranking " sponsors " to each site .
The result is forums that are less accessible , less nimble , less innovative and less effective than their counterparts in the shadowy world of terrorists and insurgents .
Oh , and there still are n't any official Army wikis .
[ For what it 's worth , the intelligence community is a little slicker at this .
– ed. ]
Besides adhering to strict security standards , Galvin stresses that the Army must also balance " both hierarchy and networking . "
" If you 've got hierarchy , you 've got direction – and if you bring in networking , you 've got direction and collaboration . "
But limiting collaboration to AKO password - holders artificially shrinks the network , and makes the whole process perhaps too insular to be truly innovative .
[ Ironically , Army officials would actually make the opposite argument – that AKO is n't secure enough to share truly - sensitive information .
– ed. ]
I 'm not saying that Army forums should be totally unprotected from insurgent snoopers .
But they should be expanded , and loosened , to allow students , academics , journalists and , yes , even members of the general public to participate on some level .
That 's risky , sure , but worth it .
Galvin advises patience .
" Our leaders are getting comfortable working in that [ collaborative ] environment , " he says .
And that means Army wikis are n't far off .
But even if they arrived tomorrow , they 'd still be seven years late .
Let 's see if I 've got this straight : an out - of - control French Cityboy has accidentally lost the Société Générale bank the grand sum of £ 3.7bn - a large amount by anyone 's standards .
And how did he do it ?
By betting the wrong way , then trying to dig himself out of the hole by continuing to bet the wrong way , covering up the mess he made along the way using some cunning ninja - style inside knowledge of how the system 's " warning lights " worked , which meant he was pissing money away undetected until the losses grew so huge they were visible from space .
Some analysts say the actions of this one poor panicking sod may have helped cause the stock market hoo - hah that kicked off last week : nice to know that even in today 's world of faceless global corporations , the little guy can still make a difference .
If it 's hard to imagine what £ 3.7 bn looks like , it 's even harder to picture an absence of £ 3.7 bn .
Presumably it resembles a dark , swirling vortex , like a portal to another dimension in a supernatural thriller .
All the money got sucked into it , and emerged ... um ... where ?
Where 's it gone ?
Is it lodged away somewhere to the side of the stock market , slightly to the left of the screen , where computers can't get to it ?
As you may have gathered , I do n't understand the stock market , because it 's so boring my brain refuses to get to grips with it .
Say the word " economics " and I reach for my pillow .
But even I know enough to realise it 's largely an imaginary construct : abstract numbers given shape by wishful thinking .
If the traders suddenly stop believing it's healthy , millions of people lose their jobs .
Maybe one day they 'll stop believing in it altogether ; they 'll collectively blink and rub their eyes , and the entire global economy will vanish , like a monster under the bed that turns out never to have existed in the first place , or an optical illusion you 've suddenly seen through .
And on News at Ten that night they 'll say , " Business news now ... and , er , there is no business news .
It 's gone . "
At which point we 'd better come up with some kind of replacement barter system , pronto .
Let 's hope it's not based on sexual favours , or a simple trip to the supermarket 's going to be downright harrowing .
In order to maintain their mad conviction that the economy is real , City traders adopt all manner of belief - bolstering strategies , such as awarding themselves vast bonuses when they " do well " in the " stock market " .
This reinforces the notion that it 's possible to play the market with a modicum of skill , which it is n't , because a ) it is n't there in the first place and b ) it 's random .
They 're like pub gamblers convincing themselves they 've developed a " system " for beating the fruit machine , except they get paid in Ferraris rather than tokens .
In his excellent book Irrationality , the late Stuart Sutherland cited several surveys in which the advice of financial experts has consistently been proven to be markedly less reliable than random guesswork .
Professor of psychology Len Wiseman went one further in his book Quirkology , conducting an experiment in which a professional investment analyst , a financial astrologist and a four - year - old girl all chose stocks to invest in .
The four - year - old could n't even read , so her choices were made by writing the names of 100 stocks on pieces of paper , throwing them in the air and grabbing a few off the floor .
No prizes for guessing who consistently came out on top , by an impressive margin , even when the value of the stocks was tracked for a full year .
In other words , the French rogue trader is only really guilty of dreaming that little bit harder than everyone else .
Rather than punish him , perhaps they should simply wish him out of existence .
After all , it 's been done before : a Chinese metals trader called Liu Qibing racked up immense losses in 2005 by betting the wrong way on the price of copper at the London Metal Exchange .
In the immediate aftermath , despite fellow traders claiming to know him as China 's main copper trader , the Chinese State Reserve Bureau simply denied he'd ever existed in the first place .
· Last week 's piece on remote controls and technofear prompted a healthy response : it 's heartening to discover I 'm not the only one who becomes enraged when people insist on watching TV in the wrong aspect ratio .
Many of you recounted tales illustrating just how exasperating it can be to cajole a reluctant technophobe to operate a computer , which reminded me of something that happened to a friend of mine : he was sitting at work , when his mum rang up out of the blue .
" It 's your father , " she said .
" He 's had an accident . "
My friend froze , steeled himself for the worst , and asked what had happened .
" Well , he 's deleted the printer icon from the desktop ... and wants to know if there 's any way of making it come back again . "
· This week Charlie woke up to discover his tongue had turned black : " For two days I put off looking it up on the net , knowing it'd only convince me I was dying .
A friend said it sounded serious .
I begged her not to look it up either , but she did , and it turned out to be a well - known , harmless side - effect of eating chewable Pepto - Bismol indigestion pills .
So the internet is n't all bad . "
Too late .
The Bush legacy as a 21st century torturer is already cemented , but we ’ve got a flip flop on waterboarding :
A senior Justice Department official says laws and other limits enacted since three terrorism suspects were waterboarded have eliminated the technique from what is now legally allowed .
“ The set of interrogation methods authorized for current use is narrower than before , and it does not today include waterboarding , ” Steven G. Bradbury , acting head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , says in remarks prepared for his appearance Thursday before the House Judiciary Constitution subcommittee .
“ There has been no determination by the Justice Department that the use of waterboarding , under any circumstances , would be lawful under current law , ” he said .
More after the jump …
It is the first time the department has expressed such an opinion publicly .
CIA Director Michael Hayden stopped short of making a similar statement in testimony about waterboarding before Congress last week .
Bradbury in 2005 signed two secret legal memos that authorized the CIA to use head slaps , freezing temperatures and waterboarding when questioning terror detainees .
Because of that , Senate Democrats have opposed his nomination by President Bush to formally head the legal counsel ’s office .
So three years ago , this guy allowed torture , now he says it is n’t legal .
What changed ?
The law they claim but in reality it ’s because they got busted , that ’s what changed .
Vintage Bush administration double speak .
And , as we all know well , just because anyone in the Bush administration says something , it does n’t mean it ’s true .
How many times did Bush tell us the U.S. does n’t torture ?
He lied .
Workers will be trained in customer service
It will offer a " basic shift manager " course , training staff in skills such as human resources and marketing .
The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority said the company had been approved to develop courses up to the equivalent of A - level standard .
The QCA will also allow Network Rail and Flybe to award qualifications based on their workplace training schemes .
' Exciting step '
David Fairhurst , senior vice - president and chief people officer from McDonald 's , said it was " an important and exciting step " for the company .
" We want to ensure that our approach to recruitment , training , and development continues to create real opportunities for social mobility , " he said .
Last year the company launched a campaign against the dictionary definition of a " McJob " .
It said the definition as " an unstimulating low - paid job with few prospects " was insulting and out of date .
Network Rail will pilot its first qualification this year in " track engineering " .
It has been given permission to develop courses equivalent to GCSEs and A - levels .
Training commitment
Airline Flybe will develop its " airline trainer programme " later this year and courses will cover everything from engineering to cabin crew training .
Skills Secretary John Denham said : " It is right that we recognise and accredit employers that have shown a commitment to training and developing their staff .
" This is an important step towards ending the old divisions between company training schemes and national qualifications , something that will benefit employees , employers and the country as a whole . "
Ken Boston , chief executive of the QCA , said the move recognised " employers ' commitment to training " .
He said : " We look forward to considering further applications from employers to have their valuable work - related learning programmes validated . "

型推論： 「 コンピュータ以前」からML，Java 7まで
OCamlをはじめ，MLやHaskellなど，多くの型付き関数型言語には型推論という機能がある。この連載でも，暗に陽に，OCamlの型推論機能を利用してきた。
例えば，以下のような関数say_hello_toを定義してみよう。文字列引数nameを受け取り，nameの前に定数文字列" hello " を付け加えて返す，という関数だ。
# let say_hello_to name = " hello " ^ name ; ; val say_hello_to : string -> string = < fun >
このように，引数や返り値の型を指定しなくても，say_hello_toはstring ->string型（文字列を受け取り，文字列を返す関数）であると自動推論される。
ただし，（例えばプログラムを読みやすくするために）もし型を書きたければ，次のように書くこともできる。
# let say_hello_to ( name : string ) : string = " hello " ^ name ; ; val say_hello_to : string -> string = < fun >
一般 にOCamlでは，( 式 : 型)のような構文により，式や引数，返り値などの型を指定することができる。
また，第6回でも触れたように，モジュールのインタフェースでは，公開する関数の型を書かなくてはならない（ocamlc
-iというオプションで自動生成することもできるが）。そのような型は，プログラムの間違いを防いだり実行効率を向上するだけでなく，いわば仕様の一種としても役に立つためだ。
さて，上のような「型推論」の仕組みは，実はコンピュータやプログラミング言語ができる前から，論理学の分野で研究されていた（参考リンクの" By the way " 以降など） 。MLやLispといった関数型言語の基礎になった「λ計算」も，元は論理学の体系の一つだ。
しかし，今や型推論はλ計算や関数型言語だけでなく，C#，C++，Javaといったメジャー言語にも（限られた形ではあるが）取り入れられつつあるという（関連記事，参考リンク1，参考リンク2）。これはジェネリックスやクロージャなど，最近の拡張によって，従来よりも複雑な型が現われてきたためだろう。intやdoubleといった通常の型は良いとしても，多相型（総称型）や高階関数（クロージャ）の型を書くのは本当に面倒だからだ。
今回は，第10回で考えた単純な関数型言語「MyFun」に対して，もっとも基本的な型推論の一種を実装してみることにしよう。
関数型言 語「 MyFun」の復習
第 10回で考えたMyFun言語は，多くの関数型言語と同じく，「式」がプログラムであり，式の値を計算すること（評価）がプログラムの実行にあたるのだった。具体的には，MyFunには下のような6種類の式があった（この表でのiやxは，特定の整数や変数ではなく，1，2，-3やx，y，abcなど，一般の整数や変数を表す）。
式の構文 直観的な意味 i 整数定数 x 変数参照 ( 式 1 + 式 2 ) 整数加算 ( let x = 式 1 in 式 2 ) 式1の値を変数xにおき，式2の値を計算する ( fun x -> 式 ) 変 数xを引数とし， 「 式」の値を返す関数 ( 式 1 式 2 ) 式1の値を関数として式2の値に適用する
例えば，下のようなMyFunのプログラム（式）を実行（評価）すると，10という値が得られる。なぜなら，整数3を変数xにおいてから，「yを受け取るとx+yを返す関数」をfとおき，関数fを整数7に適用するからだ。
( let x = 3 in ( let f = ( fun y -> ( x + y ) ) in ( f 7 ) ) )
実際に，第10回で作ったMyFunインタプリタ（interpret）に上のプログラムを与えてみると，確かに値は10になる。
> ./ interpret ( let x = 3 in ( let f = ( fun y -> ( x + y ) ) in ( f 7 ) ) ) 10
ちなみに，MyFun言語の構文は（余計な括弧がついているが）OCamlのサブセットになっているので，上述のプログラムはOCamlで実行することもできる。
> ocaml Objective Caml version 3.10.0 # ( let x = 3 in ( let f = ( fun y -> ( x + y ) ) in ( f 7 ) ) ) ;; - : int = 10
さて，上のようなMyFunプログラムは，OCamlLexとOCamlYaccを利用して生成した字句・構文解析器により，下のように定義されるOCamlのデータ型の値に変換できるのだった。
type var = string type exp = (* 「 式 」を表すデータ型 *) |
Const of int (* 整数定数 *) |
Var of var (* 変数参照 *) |
Add of exp * exp (* 整数加算 *) |
Let of var * exp * exp (* let式 *) |
Fun of var * exp (* 関数式 *) |
App of exp * exp (* 関数適用 *)
この字句・構文解析の方法を確認しておこう。まず，第10回に出てきたsyntax.ml，parser.mly，lexer.mllという三つのファイルをocamlcでコンパイルする。
> ocamlyacc parser.mly > ocamllex lexer.mll 18 states , 957 transitions , table size 3936 bytes > ocamlc -c syntax.ml parser.mli parser.ml lexer.ml
すると，次のように，OCamlの対話環境からSyntax，Parser，Lexerの各モジュールを使うことができる。
> ls syntax.cmo parser.cmi parser.cmo lexer.cmo lexer.cmo parser.cmi parser.cmo syntax.cmo > ocaml Objective Caml version 3.10.0 # #load " syntax.cmo " ;; (* Syntaxモジュールをロード *) # #load " parser.cmo " ;; (* Parserモジュールをロード *) # #load " lexer.cmo " ;; (* Lexerモジュールをロード *) # (* 以下で「 Syntax.」の表示を省略するため，Syntaxモジュールをopen *) open Syntax ;; # (* 標準入力から入力されたプログラムを字句・構文解析
*) (* MyFunプログラムの部 分( let x = 3 in ... ) は自分で入力する *) let e = Parser.exp Lexer.token ( Lexing.from_channel stdin ) ;; ( let x = 3 in ( let f = ( fun y -> ( x + y ) ) in ( f 7 ) ) ) val e : Syntax.exp = Let ( " x " , Const 3 , Let ( " f " , Fun ( " y " , Add ( Var " x " , Var " y " ) ) , App ( Var " f " , Const 7 ) ) )
型を表すデータ型の定義
さて， 「式を表すデータ型」は上のように定義できたので，次に「型を表すデータ型」を定義しよう。MyFun言語には，整数と関数の2種類の値がある。それに合わせて，型も整数型「int」と関数型「t1 -> t2」の2種類が必要になる。ただし，t1 -> t2のt1は引数の型，t2は返値の型だ。また，後で述べる「まだ決まっていない型」を表す「型変数」も含めておく。
以上をまとめると， 「型を表すデータ型」の定義は以下のようになる。
type typ = (* 型を表すデータ型 *) | TInt (* 整数型int *) |
TFun of typ * typ (* 関数型t1 -> t2 *) | TVar of typ option ref (* 型変数 *)
例えば，先のMyFunプログラムの変数xは，値が整数3だから，int型を持つはずだ。また，変数yは「x + y」と整数加算に使われているから，やはりint型を持つことになる。すると，fは整数を受け取って整数を返す関数だから，「int -> int」という型を持つことになる。
このような考え方を一般化すれば型推論が可能になるはずだ。次は，実際の推論アルゴリズムを見てみよう。
In Stephen KIng 's 1980 novel , Firestarter , the book ended with the heroine going into the counter - culture offices of Rolling Stone magazine to tell her story of government gone mad to reporters who would presumably be brave and uncorrupt enough to publish the story .
In the 1984 film version , the offices were those of The New York Times .
These days , Stephen King is a loud member of the privileged socialist caste we call Democrats , and would therefore undoubtedly not change the ending one whit if writing the book today .
However , if I were writing such an ending , I 'd take Edward Snowden 's lead and Glenn Greenwald 's Intercept would be the plot device of choice .
Here 's Greenwald 's latest aggressive takedown of the Washington Post 's " Fake News " list and the anonymous people who published it .
It 's brutally wonderful and spot - on accurate .
Titled Washington Post Disgracefully Promotes a McCarthyite Blacklist From a New , Hidden , and Very Shady Group , he simultaneously ridicules and shames the reporter and editors who cite shady anonymous sources while calling for a government investigation into other journalists they 're accusing of spreading Russian propaganda .
So according the Washington Post , Ron Paul and Justin Raimondo are Russian propagandists .
As is David Stockman , the former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan .
Yes , it 's that bizarre .
Truth be told , I find the whole political environment scenario to be quite beyond bizarre at the moment , and that 's not even including the fact that we as a nation elected Donald freaking Trump as president .
Here 's what I mean : 10 years ago , the liberals mocked Romney 's anti-Russia position with snarky comments like " The 80's called .
They want their foreign policy back ! " while Barack Obama promised he was going to hit the reset button on the US / Russia relationship .
Heck , some say he won the election with talk like that .
But once elected , he apparently decided he preferred to stay within his community organizer comfort zone and essentially turned foreign policy over to Hillary Clinton 's State Department .
Fast forward to Syria , suddenly we 're at loggerheads with Russia again , and the left - leaning Democrats are simultaneously accusing the far left Russian government of tampering with our elections and the right wing Republicans of being in bed with those filthy Communists .
Wait - what ?
There is a propaganda technique called the Big Lie , which is usually stated along the lines of , " If you repeat a lie often enough , it becomes the truth . "
Saul Alinsky is attributed with telling people to repeatedly accuse enemies of doing what they oppose , while doing that very thing .
That seems to be what this is - a chess move in the game of psychological warfare .
Conspiracies involving fake news and Russian propaganda is a way liberals who were blind - sided by the election results can explain away their stunning electoral losses .
Calling Donald Trump and his supporters deplorable Nazis during the election cycle did n't stop him , so now they 're faced with either believing that the majority of their countrymen are in fact Nazi supporters , or they need to explain the election win another way .
Blaming Russia is a tool the leaders of their movement can use to drum up more hate and division without admitting that perhaps the core of their very philosophy is unpalatable to the masses .
I mean , everybody hates the Communists , right ?
**************
If you like Glenn Greenwald , you might like to follow me on Twitter .
Long time readers of my blog will know that I 'm a huge fan of design patterns .
Patterns wrap complex architectures with simplistic descriptions .
They create wonderful buzzwords that we can use instead of resorting to actual human language descriptions .
And they help enforce that feeling that we 're all a part of an elite clique shunned by society not by their choice , but by ours .
So it is with much happiness and joy ( refer to the Joyous Configuration pattern for more background on this emotion ) that I hereby announce more patterns to help the software community in the tedious and underappreciated lives that we lead .
Refactory
The Refactory pattern , a spin -off of the earlier Factory pattern , is useful for engineering teams that enjoy the infinite redesign cycle of software .
While the code may work perfectly well in some configuration , chances are great that the entire code base can be completely refactored to have the same functionality , but with different class hierarchies , indenting styles , and naming conventions .
This pattern provides for such standard refactoring methods as arbitrary Rename ( ) , codeRestyler ( ) , classHierarchyFlattener ( ) , and classHierarchyExpander ( ) .
This single pattern is often credited with being the cornerstone of our entire industry .
Delicate
The Delicate pattern , like the traditional Delegate pattern , is signified by its extreme use of indirection and object layering , where a successful implementation will be comprised of so many layers of API and object wrappers that the final result is apt to break easily and nondeterministically .
As Chris Campbell pointed out to me , the Delicate pattern is a critical part of the trendy Fragile Programming methodology .
Obliterator
The Obliterator pattern is a combination of the Iterator pattern , which is useful for walking through a list of objects , and deletion functionality .
When applied to any list of objects , it automatically walks the list and deletes all members , then removes the list , the calling function , and the application itself .
Variations of the pattern have been known to also destroy the operating system , the computers running the system , the networks on which the pattern is deployed , and the universe in which the pattern exists .
Use with care , or at least ask your users to test it for you before declaring the product final .
Veneer
The Veneer pattern is a thin , attractive wrapper on top of a rat 's nest of spaghetti code .
The pattern is similar to its forerunner , the Façade pattern , except that it avoids the use of special internationalized letters that make correct spelling difficult for English programmers .
Disfunctional
Contrary to the related Functional Design pattern , the Disfunctional pattern requires every component of a system to know about and perform every possible operation .
Variants of the pattern exist , such as the Gossip and Nosey Parker patterns .
Lethargic Initialization
Like the Lazy Initialization pattern , the Lethargic Initialization pattern delays creation and calculation until such time as it is needed .
However , the Lethargic pattern adds the additional requirement that operations be carried out slowly , if at all , and may not actually complete when the information is needed by the system .
This approach has distinct advantages over the Lazy pattern .
Systems using the Lethargic approach can never suffer the performance hit that is possible with the Lazy pattern , because at no time is the system actually doing much , if any , work .
Single
Like the Singleton pattern , the Single represents objects of which there is only one instance in the system .
However , the Single pattern has the important distinction that its objects are constantly on the search for other objects to combine with , in a desperate attempt to avoid being stuck on their own .
A Single object will print any line , tell any recursion tail , or go into any foo bar as it tries to pair off with other Singles .
Cunning Plan
Like the earlier Strategy pattern , the Cunning Plan pattern cleverly selects the implementation of an algorithm on the fly .
However , this more radical approach automatically selects the most devious and subversive methodology , designed to undermine the entire system from within .
It 's clear that there are many more patterns that we can invent if we just set our minds to the task and find appropriately obscure words with which to name them .
But hopefully the selection above will invigorate the community to begin implementing brave new architectures based on proven , robust buzzwords .

THE INVENTION : Cruise control 's that ( wonderful , wonderful ) thing that helps you avoid speeding tickets .
Yup , everybody loves cruise control .
Unlike many of the other ignored inventions , this handy accessory does get some acknowledgement .
Unfortunately , that 's only when it 's either impossible to find on that little stick that turns on the blinkers , or when it 's broken .
WHO TO THANK : a blind man .
No , seriously !
His name 's Ralph Teetor , and he spent his whole life inventing things to make cars better .
Teetor was blinded in a shop accident at age five , but apparently harbored no resentment for sharp tools .
He went on to attend college and became one of the most respected mechanical engineers of his era .
Although he was responsible for a lot of vehicular improvements , including automatic transmission , he 's best known for making it possible for even lead - foots to stick to one speed .
Inspiration struck during World War II , when the government set a 35 mph speed limit to conserve gas and tires — which is great and all , but some people just can't drive 35 .
Like , for instance , Teetor 's lawyer .
After a particularly bad trip during which the lawyer 's jerky driving made Teetor carsick , the inventor came up with a device that could regulate car speed without the driver touching the gas pedal .
A few tweaks and many dubious names ( including " controlomatic "  and " speedostat "  ) later , cruise control premiered in selected 1958 Chrysler models .
It was then an $ 86 option known as " Auto - Pilot . " 
BUT THE TRULY AMAZING THING IS THAT : Teetor 's blindness actually improved his ability to invent new things .
In the process of learning how to function in a world he could n't see , he developed an exceptional ability to visualize objects and guide himself via touch .
In 1902 , he built an automobile that let him tool around town at up to 25 mph .
A neat feat by itself , but he was only 12 at the time .
Later , he applied his skills to engineering and was able to solve problems sighted engineers could n't .
During World War I , he developed a new technique for balancing steam turbines on torpedo boat destroyers .
Other engineers had tried for years to solve the problem , but Teetor 's heightened sense of touch gave him the advantage .
His expertise was so well known that he later became president of the Society of Automotive Engineers .

As time goes by there seems to be a growing trend amongst those people lucky enough to afford it / mental enough to spend all available cash on it : home cinemas .
Huge screens , incredible sound systems and luxurious seats are popping up in seemingly spare rooms and basements larger than my entire flat .
However this is also giving a few movie geeks a real chance to shine and it seems they ’re not content with a simple in - home movie theater decent enough to hold a premiere in – they clearly want to be fully immersed in the worlds created by their favourite films .
So , in no particular order , here are 10 of the best themed home cinemas on earth …
1. Indiana Jones Cinema
This amazing indy - themed room was designed by home theatre expert doug charrois for larry and colleen halliday in canada .
The room even features replicas of the holy grail , a jacket , hat , whips , torches and more — including the idol from the opening of the original movie .
2. The Batcave
Above is possibly the sleekest home theatre i’ve ever seen .
It was created by canadian - based experts “ elite home theater seating ” , who , as the name suggests , specialize in hand - made , custom home theater furniture for “ high - end ” clientele .
And Bruce Wayne .
3. The Enterprise ncc-1701d Cinema
Based on starship enterprise ncc-1701d , this stunner consists of a cinema , bar area and apparently ‘ one of the largest kaleidoscope hard - drive based storage systems in a residential installation .
At last count , there were eight servers with 3,816 DVD’s .
There ’s even a red alert button which brings on red flashing lights and appropriately tense music .
4. The Bridge
Trekkie gary reighn decided to cut out the middle man and design & build his home cinema himself on a relatively small budget of $ 15?000 .
His basement was cleared to make way for the creation and from start to finish took 2 years .
5. Evergreen Ultimate Theater
Apparently one of the most technically and structurally advanced private theaters in the united states , this phenomenal star trek home cinema even contains motorised sliding doors , as requested by the unbelievably rich client who paid around $ 3?000?000 in total for the transformation .
6. Titanic
The ceiling dome in this titanic themed set - up contains 1?230 fiber optic light strands in order to provide the artificial night sky and entry to the luxurious bar next door can be found behind a motorised bookcase .
The whole project was designed by donny hackett of casa cinema design .
7. The Death Star
It does n’t get much cooler than this .
the 10 - seat death star home cinema was designed for vic wertz and lisa stevens and includes , amongst other things : automatic doors , a twinkling fiber optic star field and a thx sound system .
The best fact ?
The room was designed by doug chiang , lead designer on episodes I & II .
8. The Nautilus
This beauty was built as a result of film geek randy moran ’s love of the nautilus submarine from the film 20?000 leagues under the sea .
He hired Dillon Works inc to build and fabricate all the trusses , wall panels , screen frames , and portholes and ‘ acoustic innovations ’ to supply the plush red seating .
9 . The Pirate Cove
The pirate cove was created as a result of avs forum user pkonold ’s love of the pirates of the carribean disney ride and movies .
To make the atmosphere as authentic as possible he and his wife ensured that when seated “ you feel like you are floating down “ the bayou ” at night .
to accomplish this we have built a star field in the ceiling , complete with real constellations and shooting stars ! ” .
10 . The Sci-Fi Cinema
OK , so the screen is n’t the biggest and the seats are slightly lacking but inside Dr. David Winn ’s home cinema can be found : a hydraulic alien bursting through the wall , a talking Robbie the robot and both the predator and the creature from the black lagoon behind bars .
the cinema , including all collectibles , cost approximately $ 100?000 .
Low - fat foods are often disappointing to consumers since removing the fat changes the desirable taste , texture and aroma of the original product .
Now , a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst are developing a new technology that could lead to low - calorie foods that taste like the real thing .
“ Our goal is to keep the fat in the food , but stop it from being digested by surrounding it with layers of dietary fiber , ” says Julian McClements , UMass Amherst professor of food science .
“ Foods produced with these encapsulated fats should have the same qualities as conventional high - fat foods . ”
The research team includes McClements and UMass Amherst food science professors Eric Decker and Yeonhwa Park .
To make the encapsulated fats , small oil droplets are formed by mixing oil , water and a surfactant in a process similar to making salad dressing .
The surfactant coats the droplets and keeps them separate from the water until fiber is added to the mix in the final step .
Controlling the electrical charges of the surfactant and the fiber molecules allows the oil to attract the fiber like a magnet .
Droplets are usually coated with two to three layers of fiber , and other substances such as proteins can be incorporated to hold the fiber layers together or to provide additional benefits .
The process is suitable for encapsulating a wide range of fats and oils , everything from orange oil to olive oil , and uses fiber obtained from apples , oranges , seaweed or shellfish .
All the ingredients are food - grade , so this technology requires no FDA approval to use .
Encapsulated fats can be used in emulsion - based foods such as beverages , sauces , desserts , yoghurt and salad dressings .
They remain stable in acidic foods and during freezing , thawing and cooking , and can also handle large amounts of salt .
How much of the fat can be digested is controlled by the number of layers and the types of fiber used .
The team is currently experimenting with ways to chemically link the fiber layers to enhance their ability to stay intact around the fat droplets .
Layers of fiber could also be used to encapsulate vitamins and antioxidants , enabling them to survive a trip through the stomach and be released in the small intestine for absorption by the body , and this process could allow ingredients with proven health benefits but unpleasant taste , like Omega - 3 fatty acids , to be included in a wide variety of foods .
Future research by the team will focus on customizing the layers of fiber to respond to different environments , and testing to determine whether this method can be used as a delivery system for therapeutic drugs that can dissolve in fats .
“ It should be possible to develop coatings that release drugs at specific sites within the human body , ” says McClements .
McClements and Decker are currently seeking a patent , and the technology is available for licensing and research collaboration .

In - depth : Clinton news , videos , photos , timeline , more ... Hillary Clinton on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights USA TODAY INTERACTIVE QUIZ USA TODAY INTERACTIVE QUIZ WASHINGTON  National support for Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Rudy Giuliani significantly eroded during the past month , a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll finds .
The sign of volatility in both parties comes a month before the Iowa caucuses open the presidential primary season .
Clinton 's standing among Democrats dropped by 11 percentage points from early November , and Giuliani 's standing among Republicans fell by 9 points , though both continue to lead their fields .
POLL RESULTS : Huckabee now in second
The big winner : Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee , who jumped from fifth place among Republicans in early November to second place , 1 point ahead of Arizona Sen .
John McCain and former Tennessee senator Fred Thompson .
Giuliani leads Huckabee 25 % - 16 % .
Clinton leads Illinois Sen. Barack Obama 39 % - 24 % .
The phone surveys of 425 Republicans and Republican - leaning independents and 494 Democrats and Democratic - leaning independents have margins of error of +/— 5 percentage points .
Clinton and Giuliani , who have topped each of 21 USA TODAY
Polls taken this year , had never suffered such steep month - to - month drops before .
And no contender in either party had scored as sharp a month - to - month boost as Huckabee .
" You can't argue that this is an Iowa - only event ; it clearly has gone nationwide , " Republican strategist Alex Vogel says of Huckabee 's rise .
A Des Moines Register poll published Sunday showed him leading in Iowa .
" The real question is not ' Is it real ? '
It 's ' Can the campaign organization catch up fast enough ? ' " ( The Des Moines Register and USA TODAY are owned by Gannett . )
Huckabee still has room to grow .
Nearly half of those polled have either not heard of him or not formed an opinion about him .
Giuliani spokeswoman Maria Comella notes that the former New York City mayor has led the GOP field in every major media poll since February .
" It 's clear he has real staying power , " she says .
Among Democrats , Clinton 's fall was n't matched by a rise for Obama , whose standing rose 2 points from early November .
Former North Carolina senator John Edwards was steady at 15 % .
The New York senator , under increasing criticism by her rivals and the Republican National Committee , also suffered a deterioration in views of her personally .
Her favorable rating dropped 5 points to 47 % ; her unfavorable rating rose 5 points to 50 % .
" If they all gang up and attack her , she goes down some , but it does n't change the strong and wide lead she has , " says Mark Penn , Clinton 's chief strategist .
He acknowledges that her efforts to fight back are likely to fuel her negative ratings .
" There are also risks to letting attacks go unanswered , " he says .
Clinton 's lead over Obama has been cut almost in half since early November , from 28 points to 15 .
Democratic strategist Anita Dunn says Clinton has hit " a rough patch " but adds , " There are a few things about her that are absolutely true , and one is that she has a base — and , I think , a pretty strong one . "
Clinton leads Obama by 26 points among Democratic partisans and 22 points among women .
Enlarge Giuliani by Hans Deryk , Reuters ; Clinton by Tom Gannam , AP Rudy Giuliani , left , and Hillary Rodham Clinton had never suffered such steep month - to - month drops before .

Lawyer and award winning author , Wesley J. Smith , is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute ’s Center on Human Exceptionalism .
He is also a consultant to the Patients Rights Council .
In May 2004 , because of his work in bioethics , Smith was named one of the nation ’s premier expert thinkers in bioengineering by the National Journal .
In 2008 , the Human Life Foundation named him a Great Defender of Life for his work against assisted suicide and euthanasia .
Smith left the full - time practice of law in 1985 to pursue a career in writing and public advocacy .
He is the author or co-author of thirteen books .
His Human Exceptionalism blog , hosted by National Review , is one of the premier blogs dealing with human life and dignity .
Smith ’s latest book is The War on Humans ( Discovery Institute Press , 2014 ) in which he investigates the views of anti-human activists who want to grant legal rights to animals , plants , and “ Mother Earth , ” and who want to reduce the human population by up to 90 percent .
His previous book was A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy : The Human Cost of the Animal Rights Movement , a searing critique of the ideology and tactics of the animal liberation movement and a rousing defense of the unique importance of human exceptionalism .
Smith ’s book Forced Exit : Euthanasia , Assisted Suicide and the New Duty to Die ( 1997 , Times Books ) , a broad - based criticism of the assisted suicide / euthanasia movement , has become a classic in anti-euthanasia advocacy and is now in its third edition , published by Encounter Books in 2006 .
Smith ’s Culture of Death : The Assault on Medical Ethics in America , a warning about the dangers of the modern bioethics movement , was named one of the Ten Outstanding Books of the Year and Best Health Book of the Year for 2001 ( Independent Publisher Book Awards ) .
Smith also wrote Consumer ’s Guide to a Brave New World , in which he explored the morality , science , and business aspects of human cloning , stem cell research , and genetic engineering .
Smith is also a member of the editorial advisory board of Christian Bioethics , published by Oxford University Press .
He formerly collaborated with Ralph Nader , co-authoring four books with the consumer advocate .
In addition , Smith co-authored ( with Eric M. Chevlen , M.D. ) , Power Over Pain : How to Get the Pain Control You Need .
Smith has published hundreds of articles and opinion columns on issues such as the importance of being human ( human exceptionalism ) , assisted suicide , bioethics , the morality of human cloning , the dangers of the animal - rights movement , anti-humanism within radical environmentalist advocacy , legal ethics , medical ethics , and public affairs .
His writing has appeared nationally and internationally in Newsweek , the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , USA Today , Forbes , the Weekly Standard , National Review , The Age ( Australia ) , The Telegraph ( United Kingdom ) , Western Journal of Medicine , and the American Journal of Bioethics .
He has also been published in regional publications throughout the U.S. and internationally in newspapers in the U.K. , Italy , Australia , and Canada .
Throughout his career in public advocacy , Smith has appeared on thousands of television and radio talk / interview programs , including such national shows as ABC Nightline , Good Morning America , Larry King Live , CNN ’s Anderson Cooper 360 , CNN ’s World Report , the CBS Evening News , EWTN , C - SPAN , and Fox News Network , as well as nationally syndicated radio programs , including Coast to Coast and shows hosted by Dennis Miller , Dennis Prager , Michael Medved , and Al Kresta .
He has appeared internationally on Voice of America , CNN International , and programs originating in Great Britain ( BBC ) , Australia ( ABC ) , Canada ( CBC ) , Ireland , Mexico , New Zealand , Germany , China , and Mexico .
Smith is often called upon by members of legislative and executive branches of government to advise on issues within his fields of expertise .
He has testified as an expert witness in front of federal and state legislative committees , and has counseled government leaders internationally about matters of mutual concern .
Smith is an international lecturer and public speaker , appearing frequently at political , university , medical , legal , disability - rights , bioethics , religious , industry , and community gatherings across the U.S. , Europe , Mexico , Canada , South Africa , and Australia and at the United Nations .
THE number of Britons logging on to Facebook has fallen for the first time , according to Nielsen Online , an internet - metrics firm .
In January , 8.5 m unique users caught up with friends and colleagues , down by 5 % from December .
Facebook has added 712 % more users in Britain since January 2007 and it appears that a natural plateau has been reached : Bebo and MySpace hit their user peaks in mid-2007 .
People may also be turning to more specialised sites , such as Linked In , a professional - networking site .
America has already seen growth slacken .

Hmm , here ’s a spam on the Free Our Data blog , which Spam Karma allowed through : about sharetips .
( It ’s always flipping share tips these days .
A letter from a reader to the Gdn explained why – basically , that you ca n’t touch the companies involved because their assets are offshore . )
But why did this spam get through SK , which effortlessly swats away thousands of spams pretty much any given day ?
Here Spam Karma ’s report on the characteristics of how the spam got through .
Bad things about it are in red ; good ones , in green .

Oh , you exist .
You ’re not a computer .
A human , it seems , took the trouble to key in some letters when Spam Karma metaphorically rubbed its chin and said “ Hmm … can you do this , then ? ”
A captcha is one of those annoying forms you have to fill in on Blogger etc – the wavy letters and so on .
It ’s meant to ensure you ’ve got a human at the screen .
And we did , here .
Where did that come from , then ?

Well , now we got trouble .
Folk in India being paid by sharepumpers to fill in comment forms on out - of - the - way blogs ?
That ’s really worrying .
First that it ’s profitable enough ; second that they can pay people that little ( it ’s going to be fractions of pennies per site , yet they have to buy computers and give them internet connections ..) and still profit .
What ’s the betting for the first uses that the $ 100 computer will get put to ?
A few thoughts on Ezra 's post at Pandagon , Movie review : The Corporation .
Ezra writes :
The thesis of the movie , which is inexplicably dropped as the film progresses , is that the corporation , since it 's legally defined as an individual , can be psychologically understood as a psychopath .
The methodology used to achieve this outcome , examples of the worst in corporate excess and evil - doing , is pretty flawed .
It 'd be like diagnosing the human race based on the horrors inflicted by our worst members .
Many astute viewers have voiced similar complaints , including A.O. Scott of the New York Times .
There 's a misunderstanding here .
The Corporation is using " psychopath " in a narrow technical sense without explaining the difference between medical / psychiatric construct and the layman 's understanding of the term .
" Psychopath " has entered our language as a quasi-clinical epithet .
To a layman , psychopath means something like " sicko " , " bastard " , " villain " , or " monster . "
Psychologists and psychiatrists apply the term much more narrowly .
Here is an example of the professional use of the term " psychopath " taken from a recent issue of Psychiatric Times ( fascinating article , BTW ) :
The killers ' characteristics referred to as antisocial personality in the FBI report were as follows : sense of entitlement , unremorseful , apathetic to others , unconscionable , blameful of others , manipulative and conning , affectively cold , disparate understanding of behavior and socially acceptable behavior , disregardful of social obligations , nonconforming to social norms , irresponsible .
These killers were not simply persistently antisocial individuals who met DSM - IV criteria for ASPD ; they were psychopaths - remorseless predators who use charm , intimidation and , if necessary , impulsive and cold - blooded violence to attain their ends .
[ Emphasis added . ]
The Corporation 's thesis that corporations are psychopaths is neither a slur nor a conceit .
It 's a fact .
Corporations are legal persons .
Unfortunately , they are persons with " no souls to save , and no bodies to imprison . "
A corporation exists to dissolve the responsibilities of the human beings who run it .
Say the board of Acme Inc decides to pollute a river .
If anyone has a problem with that , they 'll have to sue Acme , not the 12 members of the board or the investors .
Most individuals would be ashamed to be named in a pollution suit , a fact which might deter them from committing such a crime .
Acme has no shame , though .
Jail is a great equalizer .
The richer you are , the less a fine will harm you -- but a year is still worth as much to a rich person as to a poor one .
Unfortunately , you can't lock up an abstraction and the directors have little or no criminal liability .
Fines become another cost of doing business .
Of course , when pollution turns a profit , individuals divide the money .
Corporations are also legally required to put profit above every other good .
A small business owner might decide that , on the whole , a 5 % rate of return is plenty , even though she knows she could get 10 % by raising prices and cutting jobs .
It 's her business , so she gets to decide how to balance profits against other values .
By contrast , the Acme Board is required to make as big a profit is it possibly can , no matter what .
For all its power , the directors are n't allowed to place jobs over profit , or sustainability over quarterly return .
For that , they could be fired .
Normal human beings are enmeshed in a network of obligations and competing goods .
We 'd all like to make money , but we recognize that other people 's rights and feelings matter , unlike psychopaths who feel entitled to do whatever they want ..
If empathy and ethics are n't enough to keep us normals on the straight and narrow , we can be deterred by punishments ranging from social ostracism to death .
Even human psychopaths can be deterred by the threat of punishment .
Corporations have the same rights as people , plus more lawyers , guns and money .
Terrifyingly , they are also designed to be amoral , immortal , and insatiable .
For example , corporations enjoy free speech , and property rights including the right to own own other corporations ( ironic , that , considering the 14th Amendment established corporate personhood ) .
The Corporation 's message is not simply that corporations do bad things .
Nor is the movie about what terrible people corporate executives are .
On the contrary , the movie goes out of its way to show how sympathetic and thoughtful corporate leaders can be .
The point of the movie is that a legal fiction has unleashed a dangerous self - perpetuating entity which is designed to slip the bonds of individual human decency and personal responsibility .
That 's why corporations are literally psychopaths .

The A2 would be twice the size of the biggest current jumbo jets
The A2 aeroplane , designed by Reaction Engines in Oxfordshire , would carry 300 passengers at a top speed of 4,000 mph .
The company said the aircraft , which is still at the concept stage , could be operating within 25 years .
It said the A2 would be able to keep a sustained speed of 3,800 mph , more than twice the speed of Concorde .
At 143 m ( 156yds ) long , the A2 is roughly twice the size of the biggest current jumbo jets .
It would run on a liquid hydrogen engine being developed by Reaction Engines , based at Culham near Abingdon .
The first man-made object to reach hypersonic speeds was the two - stage US " Bumper " rocket , assembled from a captured German V - 2 rocket in 1949 .
Astronauts and cosmonauts have all reached hypersonic speeds while passing through the atmosphere on their way to and from orbit .
Current research , however , focuses on sustained hypersonic manned flight within the Earth 's atmosphere , which has not yet been achieved .
Is There No Juris ?
James
Love is an information activist ; he is devoted to liberating data .
By last summer , Love was well aware of the problems with electronic access to the law .
In July of 1993 , Love submitted a petition to Attorney General Janet Reno asking her to allow the general public entry into a little - known Department of Justice database called Juris .
Love , the director of a Ralph Nadarite public interest group called the Taxpayer Assets Project , knew that the obscure database at the Department of Justice could be the key to unlocking the case law monopoly .
Juris was publicly owned , and it contained a complete collection of federal case law going back , in some areas , to 1900 .
If Love could convince the Department of Justice to open the Juris system to users outside the government , it would be a milestone on the road toward information equality .
Through Westlaw and its only licensed competitor , Lexis , users pay $ 200 to $ 250 for this sort of information .
Public access to Juris would make it almost free .
Love 's effort did not succeed .
Six months into his campaign , it was clear that the public would not get cheap access to Juris .
On the other hand , the locked - out citizens were in good company .
By December 31 , the Department of Justice did n't have access , either .
The two dozen or so employees of Juris had been fired or reassigned .
The disk drives were silent .
The database was dead .
The story of how a campaign for access to the law resulted in the destruction of the country 's most important publicly owned legal database offers a few clues about the balance of power in the coming information age .
Juris was created in 1971 , two years before Lexis and four years before Westlaw .
It inherited the electronic records of an experimental Air Force program called FLITE ( Finding Legal Information Through Electronics ) , whose history goes back to the early ' 60s .
During the months before it was shut down , Juris was used by about 15,000 government employees .
Unfortunately , back in 1983 the Department of Justice had grown tired of handling the bothersome data entry and data management tasks for the case law portion of Juris .
In a move consistent with the Reagan - era emphasis of privatization , a leading database vendor was hired to take over the job .
The vendor was West Publishing .
Displaying a remarkable lack of foresight , the Department of Justice neglected to secure the right to reclaim their database should West ever decide not to renew the contract .
Rebecca Finch , the director of Linguistic Data Consortium , a broadly based group of 65 corporations , universities , and government agencies , frequently enters into contracts with large private data vendors .
Finch looks back on the Department of Justice 's agreement with scorn .
" It was a pretty stupid move to negotiate that kind of contract , " she says .
" We have contracts with news wires and other vendors and sometimes we hear that we have to give the data back when the contract is over .
We just say no .
Once we pay for it it is ours .
Usually when we take this stance we get what we are after . "
The Justice Department lawyers were not so tough .
Starting in 1983 , the case law portion of the Juris database was leased from West with the understanding that if the data vendor ever withdrew it could take the case law with it .
A decade later , when Love pressed his argument for open access , West did exactly that .
Soon after the department 's budget for the next two years was finalized in Congress , West announced it was pulling out of Juris .
This left the department with a gap in its legal records that stretched over ten years .
But West did n't just take the data .
They also took their proprietary page - numbering system .
Without a budgetary appropriation to reenter the missing data , and without confidence that the data , even if reentered , would be usable to its attorneys , the Department of Justice had no choice but to shut the system down .
Love says the conflict over legal information is the toughest public access battle he has ever seen .
The details of the controversy are too complicated for the evening news , and West is probably the most politically influential data vendor in the country .
" I think we will win , " Love predicts , " but it is a question of when .
They 've been able to delay this for a long time . "
Today , the focus of the public access effort has shifted from lobbying the Department of Justice to suing it .
Although the Juris system is dead , the case law has not yet been literally erased , and several Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests have been filed asking for parts of the database .
A well - known FOIA attorney , William Debrovir , is seeking a court injunction forbidding the Department of Justice from deleting the valuable records until the FOIA requests are resolved .
" There is now no question that machine - readable data are agency records and are subject to FOIA , " argues Debrovir .
Still , the attorney , who represents not Love 's group but another database publisher called Tax Analysts , was probably not surprised to learn recently that his FOIA request had been rejected on a number different grounds , including the unashamed acknowledgement that making the legal data public would hurt West 's private market .
Harming
West 's market is clearly not something the Department of Justice is prepared to do .
Debrovir 's FOIA is on appeal .
All the legal back and forth between West , William Debrovir , James Love , and the Department of Justice has left a few people hoping that Juris , in one form or another , will be revived .
But even if the data is saved , the page numbers will still belong to West .
Unless
West is moved by a fit of altruism to give up its lucrative copyright , the well - guarded barrier at the entrance to the law will remain in place .
West's Role
A fit of altruism may not be entirely out of the question .
West 's copyright of the page numbers of federal case law has brought small sudden squall of hostile publicity upon the company , which is not used to being cast in the role of corporate evil - doer .
Last year , Congress undertook hearings on the page - number issue , and during the latter part of 1993 , legal librarians , computer researchers , and small publishers jumped at the chance to attack West 's monopoly .
Rebecca
Finch points out that a whole generation of computer - assisted legal research has been stymied by a lack of available data .
Under Finch 's guidance , the Linguistic Data Consortium helps computer scientists gain access to large databases in order to developed advanced electronic search techniques .
" We 're getting multilingual text , news wire text , medical text ; but the problem with legal data is that it is copyrighted , " she says .
One of the seminal researchers in the area of computerized database tools , Carole Hafner , was forced to give up her work on case law because she could not get any of the raw material .
Hafner , whose highly technical 1981 book , An Information Retrieval System Based on a Computer Model of Legal Knowledge , helped define the field , now studies biological and medical data .
" All this research has been stalled all over the world because nobody can get any legal text , " Hafner complains .
" The research effort , the fundamental research on case law and databases has been brought to a standstill because of the fact that these companies will not share their data with researchers .
They will not sell their data .
They will not sell a tape .
You can forget it . "
Hafner 's characterization is not entirely correct ; there is highly advanced database research going on in at least one location : West Publishing .
One of West 's in - house computer scientists , James Olson , has designed a natural language search tool called West Is Natural ( WIN ) , which even Hafner admires .
" WIN is great , everything about it is great , " she says , " but the problem is there 's no competition . "
Hafner points out that there is tremendous debate today over the best way to access a database ; semantic nets , formal logic , and neural net approaches all have their advocates .
" All these people should have a chance to work on legal text , " Hafner argues .
" Legal text may have some unique characteristics , but nobody knows because we 've never been able to study it . "
Despite the vociferous criticism from West 's rivals and competitors , Congress declined to pass a law disallowing the copyright on page numbers .
While West 's formidable political influence may have played a role in the decision , a more important factor was the ambivalence of other data vendors on the page - numbering issue .
Competing publishers would enjoy being able to undermine the West monopoly , but at the same time the largest players in the information industry realize that all sorts of copyrighted compilations of public data could be at risk if Congress passes a law stating that page numbers cannot be protected .
After all , when you choose a particular portion of the public record and put it into electronic format , what keeps the next guy from coming along and ripping it off ?
West argues that it selects and edits the cases it publishes , and points to its page numbers as the unique signposts of the way it has decided to arrange the data .
Get rid of the signposts , says West , and the information landscape becomes the site of a bloody free - for - all .
Interestingly ,
West 's copyright of the page numbers of federal case law has never received a full airing in court .
In 1985 , Mead Data Central , West 's main electronic competitor attempted to use the West page numbers in its own legal database , Lexis .
In a preliminary injunction , the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld West 's copyright , and West and Mead eventually signed a secret agreement that granted Mead a limited license to use the numbers .
Widespread speculation holds that this agreement forbids Lexis to include the page numbers in CD - ROMs and other electronic formats .
Meanwhile , West 's provisional victory has kept other electronic publishers at bay .
The apparent disinclination in Congress to outlaw copyrighted page numbers has led West critics to mount a slightly different attack .
Many US courts offer electronic copies of their decisions via local bulletin board systems ; the decisions are not organized into a database , but they are inexpensive and available to everyone .
Why not just stick official , publicly owned page numbers on them ?
If there were a consistent page - numbering system acceptable in all jurisdictions , any publishing company could pull the decisions into a database and compete with West on the bases of who provided the easiest and cheapest way to access the law .
Various proposals for a page - numbering system have been wandering around the Administrative Offices of the US Court of Appeals for more than a year , but for one reason or another none of them have " stuck . "
To the anti-Westites , the court system 's failure to promulgate a simple , standard , public - domain citation system for US case law indicates a condition of advanced backbone - enfeeblement .
" The courts have lost their moral compass , " says Alan Sugarman , whose company , Hyperlaw , produces CD - ROMs of legal data .
Sugarman points out that the US Courts have only two jobs :
They resolve individual disputes and they publish their decisions as guidance for everybody else to follow .
The fact that these decisions lack citable page numbers puts Sugarman into a state of voluble outrage .
" We are talking about the law , here ! " he says .
" We 're not talking about a by - product .
Publishing cases for people to cite is one of their primary jobs .
So , why do n't they take some of their budget and spend it to get their materials into an authoritative form ? "
As for West , it holds that the page - number issue is a tempest in a teapot .
Gerry Sikorski , West 's spokesperson on the Juris and page - numbering issues , says that West would not oppose the idea of a standard , nonproprietary electronic - numbering system .
" We have never asked a court to embrace our citation system , " he insists .
Still , Sikorski is quick to point out what he perceives as the inevitable problems with public - domain page numbers .
" The question you have to ask is , what 's broken ? " he suggests .
If the government were to try to put standard page numbers on court decisions , Sikorski believes that " there would be a lot of expense , a lot of disruption , and it wo n't lead to anything more than a lot of taxpayers , citizens , and legal writers and readers going through a lot of gymnastics . "
Still ,
West 's spokesperson shrugs , " If somebody proposes something good , then what the heck ? "
West 's problem - and , of course , it 's palladium - is that the privately held company is intimately entangled with the federal judiciary .
Bad publicity could be deadly for a firm that depends on the goodwill of courts and judges to maintain its position as the bearer of the standard text of the law .
West goes to great lengths to enhance this relationship .
The company sponsors yearly cash gifts of $ 15,000 to federal judges ( an independent judicial panel , not West , decides who shall receive the prizes ) , and West has been known to work closely with judges in order to insure accuracy in published decisions .
The judges are reluctant to lose the help of a good friend , and West 's role is explicitly acknowledged in a number of jurisdictions .
At the same time , West needs to aggressively resist the implication that it has any special or unfair relationship with the judiciary .
When West 's president defended his company before Congress last year , he went through various jurisdictions one by one , arguing out that " there is no problem with access . "
Other publishers , he said , " are as free as we are to publish their own compilations " of legal material .
In its attempt to publicly downplay its position , West resembles a company that wants to have its cake and eat it too .
West insists that it is the best and most popular legal publisher , and it is constantly assuring its customers that it can provide them with the standard text .
On the other hand , it is also being forced to argue that it does n't do anything any other publisher could n't do .
West 's motto is " Forever Associated with the Practice of Law . "
This seems true ; there is no other publisher whose copyrighted arrangements are as essential to attorneys as are West's .
But maintaining this role for eternity - or even for another decade - has begun , paradoxically , to require certain efforts to protect and even to conceal it .
West 's involvement in government does not begin and end with giving cash prizes to judges .
Vance Opperman , West 's president , is a leading Democratic party fund - raiser who has what a Minnesota newspaper called " hard - wired connections " to Vice President Al Gore .
He is also finance chairman for the 1994 re-election bid of California Senator Dianne Feinstein .
West may be standing on an ever - narrowing border between private enterprise and public service , but this border coincides with the territory occupied by the current administration .
A politically progressive baby boomer , Opperman once told an interviewer that he listens to Bob Dylan 's " Blowin ' In the Wind " nearly every day .
Gerry Sikorski , West 's spokesperson , is a retired Democratic member of Congress from Minnesota .
Sikorski insists that West 's role in the US judicial system is a benevolent and democratizing one .
" West provided legal documents that were n't provided elsewhere , that were n't preserved or collected or put together , " Sikorski says .
" These documents are an important part of our democratic legal structure . "
Again , though , West finds itself on ever narrowing ground .
The company believes access to these documents is important , but it does n't believe it is important enough for the government to put them online with public - domain page numbers .
" Nobody is standing in the way of that , " says Sikorski , " but are you willing to pay the money that will cost ?
Is it a better use than keeping criminals off the street or having more judges ? "
In defending West 's decision to sabotage Juris , Sikorski points to the growing need to " clarify " the conflict between public data in its raw form and public data that has been transformed by editing into private property .
As the online resources grow more common , this conflict will intensify .
Even James
Love agrees that Juris was a bad mix ; the case law was in the public domain , but the page numbers and headnotes belonged to West .
" We feel very strongly that in this day of information superhighways , the concept of intellectual property is critical to success , " says Sikorski .
" This mixture of data complicates things . "
By turning off the main publicly owned database of case law , West found an effective way to eliminate the source of confusion .
As for the Department of Justice employees , they are now free to purchase their case law from what Sikorski calls a " better , more useful , more advanced system . "
In other words , they can access Westlaw .
Sikorski asserts that the chorus of complaints aimed at West by Juris advocates is simply the carping of jealous rivals .
After all , he says , it was West who more than a hundred years ago won the important legal battles that earned private companies the right to reprint court decisions , thus opening up the world of legal publishing to private enterprise .
Today , he says , West 's preeminent position is based almost entirely on its high - quality editing and its detailed headnotes that summarize and catalog the decisions .
James Love and Alan Sugarman and other public access advocates " want West to do the work and then strip off the book covers and the spines and republish it . "
In conversations with attorneys with no ties either to West or to the Taxpayers Assets Project , however , few agreed that West 's great virtue was its editing or its notes .
Most said that West 's value lay in its completeness and its citability .
Mike Rushford , president of the Criminal Justice Foundation , a conservative group that regularly files briefs with the Supreme Court , had one of the more explicit responses .
" That 's bullshit , " he said .
" It is not editing or the headnotes , it is the page numbering . "
As head of a public interest law firm , Rushford is constantly looking for ways to save money .
He regularly asks his attorneys if they could substitute legal data on CD - ROM for West 's high - priced database and law books .
" My legal staff says we can't cite to them , " Rushford reports , " so we are going to have to buy the West books , too .
It is just a matter of practical concern .
We have to make a judgement about what the courts will want . "
When you are filing a brief before the Supreme Court , Rushford points out , the last thing you want to worry about is whether your citation is acceptable .
In a sense , the West monopoly represents a classic economic logjam :
Old property relations interfere with new technologies .
Just as feudal relationships in the early modern era restrained , for better or worse , the development of a capitalist economy , so the outdated notion of copyrightable data monopolies obstructs new forms of commerce built upon widespread electronic access to basic information .
If the text of the law were free , or nearly free , companies would be dueling with each other to see who could add the most value to the data .
The competition would then genuinely be over search tools , interfaces , and commentary rather than over page numbers and citability .
All West 's opponents have a slightly different vision of the what this future will look like .
James
Love looks forward to a day when any citizen can access a legal database for free at a local library .
Alan Sugarman hopes to be one of the publishers selling inexpensive and highly - focused CD - ROMs to specialty law firms .
And Carole Hafner believes that if the legal text was available to computer scientists , in ten or fifteen years the need for headnotes and indexes might be eliminated altogether ; lawyers and non-lawyers could query the law in a vast number of user - friendly and technologically distinct ways .
Still , it 's impossible not to sympathize at least a little with West 's uncomfortable situation .
The company 's importance is indisputable ; its history is impressive .
" West has performed a democratic role since the 19th century , " says Sikorski , truthfully .
Ironically , like the old AT&T / Bell Telephone system , West may simply have been too successful at making itself indispensable .
Bonus Offer : Build Your Own Legal Database
Many courts today offer their decisions via modem .
The Administrative Office of the US Court of Appeals in Washington , DC offers a list of these bulletin boards .
A few key strokes in your communications software and you can have a script that dials these boards nightly and loads the decisions onto your hard drive .
Then , when the government finally decides to establish a nonproprietary citation standard , you can get into the law - keeping business yourself .
A few warnings , however .
The text of decisions on court bulletin boards are often not the final corrected text as it appears in the bound volumes published by West and others .
Unfortunately , until the government takes better control of its online data , you could be stocking your system with incomplete or incorrect case law .
Also , not all jurisdictions are equally conscientious about posting decisions and corrections .
So , you 'll have to call the clerk and make sure you 've got them all .
Finally , many courts have decided to charge money for access to electronic decisions .
The going rate seems to be about US $ 1 per minute .
The US Circuit Court boards are free , however .

Another aspect of systemic risk is the close ties of the financial system to the rest of the economy .
One example is the higher oil and food prices mentioned above that lead to a systematic bias toward higher defaults .
Another is the fact that the lack of oil can be expected to impede economic growth , making the infinite growth model underlying the current economic system less sustainable , based on the economic model of Robert Ayres and Benjamin Warr .
Another linkage is that of oil with ethanol .
Higher oil prices leads to increased pressure to produce more ethanol , which further raises food prices , as demonstrated by Stuart Staniford in Fermenting the Food Supply .
Besides the systematic bias , there is also a systemic risk , arising from the interconnectedness of all of the parts of the economy .
This was well described in a post a few days ago called The Failure of Networked Systems .
One of the issues in systemic risk relates to the financial system itself .
If one party in the financial system fails , it increases the likelihood that other parties in the economic system will fail as well .
I think this filter is fundamentally in error , and leads to a mistaken impression with respect to where the world is headed .
The world is changing in a very major way .
Oil is in short supply , and this shortage is likely to get larger in the future .
The pressure of short supply and rising prices adds a systematic bias that the financial community is not recognizing .
This bias has as its basis the fact that it is becoming more and more difficult for both people and businesses to pay back loans , because of the rising costs of oil and food .
This situation cannot be expected to go away .
In fact , it is certain to get worse in years ahead , as oil supplies become tighter .
At this time of year , we read many financial forecasts for the year ahead .
Nearly all of these are written with the " filter " assumption of infinite growth .
" Oil production problems are a temporary issue ; after a short dip , the economy is likely to continue growing rapidly again .
We may have a short recession , but we will soon be back to business as usual . "
Etc .
First , some definitions to go with the introduction , above .
Systematic bias occurs in a system when a process favors a particular outcome .
Instead of errors being random , they are consistent and repeatable .
One example might be a thermometer that consistently reads high .
In the economy , systematic bias occurs when loans experience a greater and greater tendency toward defaults , because of changes in the system ( rising oil prices ) since the time when the probability of default was originally estimated .
As another example , rising oil prices can also cause profits of individual companies to grow more slowly than expected ( relative to base period experience ) because of a contraction in general economic growth .
Systemic risk is risk relating to the interconnectedness of the system .
A push on one part of the system will lead to a pull on another part of the system , leading to unanticipated failures .
As an example , the failure of one bank may lead to other banks failing , because of counter party risk .
There is significant reason to believe that the interconnectedness of the system is increasing over time , as food becomes used as a fuel , and as financial products become more complex .
See The Failure of Networked Systems .
The financial community has designed many models .
Some of these are used by " quants " in pricing the newer sliced and diced financial products .
Others are used by insurance companies in pricing the risk of defaults on bonds and on mortgages .
The assumption that is made in these models is that historic experience can be used , with only minor adjustments , as a guide for pricing current products .
This approach fails to recognize the greater risk now entering the system , due to systematic bias because of rising oil prices , and due to greater systemic risk , because of greater interconnectedness .
One way of describing these models is to say that they assume that defaults are " independent events " -- that is , there is no systemwide bias that would cause more and more defaults .
This assumption of independence keeps insurance prices low , and makes the slicing and dicing of packaged securities work .
Clearly , with the systematic bias and systemic risk that is now infecting the financial system , these assumptions are no longer valid .
Closely related to the assumption that events are independent is the assumption that distributions are " normal " - that is that they follow the Gaussian distribution .
Benoit Mandelbrot has shown in The ( Mis ) Behavior of Markets that the actual tails of distributions are much " fatter " than implied by the Gaussian distribution .
The bias introduced by the oil situation makes the normal distribution even less appropriate .
For example , with higher oil prices , the number of defaults on bonds will be much greater than would be predicted , if one simply assumes that a normal distribution applied to past experience will be predictive of future experience .
If one looks at financial theories like the Capital Asset Pricing Model and the Black and Scholes Option Pricing Model , one discovers that they assume normal distributions and statistical independence .
These models were not quite right before , because the underlying distributions are not really normal , as shown by Mandelbrot .
Now that systematic bias and systemic risk are playing greater roles , the predictive value they had previously can be expected to further decline .
What 's ahead ?
I do n't think we can know precisely .
In the material that follows , I give my views as to how the financial situation may unfold in the year ahead , taking into account the issues discussed above .
1 . Many monoline bond insurers will be downgraded in 2008 , and some may fail .
Bond and mortgage insurers are likely to have difficulty because these coverages are written with the assumption that past default experience can be used as a guide to needed prices .
If there is a systematic bias toward higher defaults , as there is today , prices will be too low .
Once bond insurers lose their AAA ratings , their coverage will be of little value .
Rating agencies will rate the bonds based on the financial standing of the organization issuing the bond , instead of imputing the insurer 's credit rating to the bond .
This could mean widespread downgrades of bonds .
Warren Buffet is starting a new bond insurer .
Even if this insurer stays strictly with municipal bonds and charges higher rates , I question the long - term viability of the company .
It will be difficult to charge a price in 2008 that will reflect the real risk of default five or ten years from now , when oil supply will be much tighter than today .
2 . More and more people influential in financial markets will begin to recognize peak oil .
We have already seen how oil markets act differently , once the sellers of oil realize that peak oil is not far away .
Sellers of oil become more aggressive and demand more favorable terms .
They realize that they have leverage , and begin to use it .
In 2008 , it seems likely to me that financial markets will begin to recognize peak oil as well .
Leading economists are now speaking openly about peak oil .
On December 15 , 2007 , the WSJ quoted Alan Greenspan as saying that oil supply peaked lower and sooner than had been contemplated earlier .
The Toronto Star quoted Jeff Rubin , chief economist of CIBC World Markets , as saying , " I just do n't think we 're going to see increases in conventional oil production any more .
I think ( peak oil ) is here . "
With economists like Greenspan and Rubin talking openly about peak oil , it seems likely that some financial decision - makers will start thinking about the implications of peak oil for loans and other financial products .
This seems especially likely if oil production remains relatively flat or declines in 2008 .
3 . Long term loans , including those for energy companies , are likely to become less available as awareness of peak oil rises .
Once financial markets begin to recognize peak oil , I expect lenders will be more wary of long - term loans , because of uncertainty that these loans will be repaid once world oil production has begun to decline .
Interest rates are likely to rise .
Marginal borrowers may not be able to find credit at all .
All of these effects are likely to make the gridlock in loans progressively greater over time .
The Fed may attempt to lower interest rates , but as defaults grow and lenders become more aware of peak oil , the risk margin for defaults included in interest rates will tend to rise .
Thus , the actual interest rates charged to consumers and businesses may not decline , even when the Fed lowers target interest rates .
I do n't expect the recognition of peak oil in financial markets to be complete in 2008 , especially if a credit crisis causes oil prices to drop .
Once peak oil is fully recognized though ( most likely when its effects are very apparent , and mitigation is clearly not working ) , long - term debt may become unavailable , even for governments .
4 . There is likely to be a serious recession in 2008 , deepening as the year goes on .
Oil and food prices are likely to continue to rise , leaving consumers with less to spend on loan payments and consumer purchases .
Interest rate resets will further exacerbate mortgage problems .
Defaults on mortgages will increase , and there will be increasing problems on loans of all types -- including student loans , credit card debt , auto loans , commercial mortgages , and other commercial loans .
Eventually , problems will even spread to state and municipal bonds .
More and more businesses will encounter financial difficulties , leading to defaults on loans .
The failing businesses will lay off workers .
With declining home values , tax revenues for municipalities are likely to fall .
This may lead to cutbacks in spending , furthering the economic contraction .
It also increases the likelihood of defaults on municipal bonds .
5 . At least several large banks will fail .
With bond and mortgage insurance downgrades and failures , and more and more defaults on loans of all types , it seems likely that many banks will get into financial difficulty .
The FDIC and other government agencies will attempt to solve these problems , but it is not clear that they will be successful .
One approach may be to relax capital requirements .
Another may be to find a temporary way of valuing loans that does not fully reflect the extent of their problems .
At some point , the FDIC is likely to have to make good on its promised insurance coverage ( $ 100,000 on most accounts , $ 250,000 on IRA accounts ) .
The FDIC collects insurance premiums from the banks it insures , but if many banks fail , the FDIC does not have enough funds in its account to reimburse bank depositors at the guaranteed level .
I expect that some way around this difficulty will be found -- for example , the FDIC may be allowed to borrow an unlimited amount with US government backing .
This approach requires willing buyers for the new debt .
Another approach might be to use monetary policy to make certain that banks have enough funds to cover withdrawals , even though they appear bankrupt .
Either approach would likely be inflationary .
6 . The amount of debt available to consumers is likely to decline .
To date , most of the decline in the availability of consumer debt has been in the area of mortgage loans .
I expect that during 2008 , the availability of other consumer debt will shrink as well .
Part of the decline in debt availability is likely to be the direct result of rising default rates .
The weakened financial condition of banks is also likely to reduce credit availability .
With falling capital , banks will be less able to make loans and may tighten standards on loans they do make .
Consumers with credit cards may find their debt limits rolled back .
Home equity loan limits may also be lowered .
There is also a possibility that a large bank that issues many credit cards will get into financial difficulty .
If this happens , it is not clear that a new lender will be found to issue credit cards to all of the previous card holders .
FDIC insurance relates to deposits , not to credit availability , so there is no guarantee of a new credit card .
Some individuals , particularly those with poor credit ratings , may find themselves being required to pay off old credit card debt , without any new source of credit .
7. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may need government assistance .
With rising default rates , the troubles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are likely to continue .
Both are likely to find it difficult to maintain adequate capital , and may need some sort of government intervention , if only to allow them to operate with less capital .
8 . A new class of homes -- those " never to be sold " -- will emerge .
In 2008 , the pool of buyers for homes is likely to become smaller , in part because of the shift away from the lax lending standards of the recent past .
If prospective homeowners are required to prove adequate income to afford the homes they are purchasing , many people will qualify for a much smaller home , or none at all .
As peak oil becomes more apparent , this will further reduce the number of prospective homeowners .
One reason is that people will be less able to travel to a summer or winter home , so will need only a single residence , instead of both a summer and winter residence .
Another reason is with the high cost of heating oil , gasoline and food , there will be a greater incentive for extended families to live together .
The problem with selling the current number of homes to a progressively smaller number of prospective buyers is that some homes will not find buyers in any reasonable time frame .
Some will eventually be torn down , often after being vandalized .
As long as mortgages remain readily available , there is a fairly easy way around this difficulty .
A prospective seller can take out the maximum mortgage available on a property , before putting it up for sale .
Then , if no buyer can be found , the seller can cut his / her losses by mailing the keys to the mortgage company .
I expect that in the next year or two , mortgage companies will begin to realize that homeowners can use mortgages to cut their losses when selling a home .
Because of this , I expect that mortgage companies will begin requiring at least a 20 % down payment that on home purchases .
Those refinancing homes will be limited to a total loan of 80 % of the home 's value .
These practices are likely to further reduce the pool of prospective homeowners , making the sale of homes even more difficult .
9 . Politicians will continue to make attempts to help homeowners , and perhaps other types of borrowers .
With rising interest rates , a declining economy , and tighter lending standards , it is unlikely that all the homes that have been built can remain occupied unless the government somehow allows people to remain in homes they cannot afford .
If homes are remain unoccupied , there is of course the chance that they will be vandalized , and high - value materials removed .
Government " help " may even spread to other types of loans , such as college loans that cannot be repaid , due to unemployment .
All of this government intervention is likely to make purchasers of debt securities very unhappy .
10 .
The amount of structured ( sliced and diced ) debt issued is likely to drop to close to zero .
During 2008 , it will become increasingly clear that structured debt has too many problems to be a viable method for transferring debt from the issuer to multiple buyers .
The mis-pricing noted at the beginning of this article is likely to become more apparent during 2008 .
This will add to the structured debt's other problems , including lack of front - end underwriting , optimistic bond ratings , high system costs , and reduced yields due to government intervention to help borrowers .
11 . Besides banks , many other players in financial markets are likely to find themselves in financial difficulty in 2008 .
Besides banks , financial markets include hedge funds , money market funds , insurance companies , pension funds and many special - purpose funds .
I would expect difficulties to spread to many of these organizations , for a variety of reasons :
• The value of bonds and of structured debt held by these organizations is likely to decline , as more businesses and individuals have financial difficulty .
Also , sales of securities during 2008 will help clarify the true value of some securities .
Organizations will be forced to reflect market value , as it becomes clear .
• Credit ratings of many securities are likely to decline , because of financial difficulties of the companies issuing bond insurance .
( See Point 1 above . )
Insurance companies in particular are likely to find that some bonds no longer meets regulatory requirements .
These will need to be sold , often at fire sale prices .
• Sellers of Credit Default Swaps ( CDS ) are likely to experience large losses .
CDSs act like insurance policies against bond defaults .
Organizations issuing CDSs have not charged enough to cover the type of systemic increase in risk that is now occurring .
Organizations issuing CDSs are likely to find themselves with large losses .
Purchasers of CDSs will often find that sellers are not able to make good on their promises .
• Debt is likely to be less available , or available at higher interest rates .
Organizations using leverage , such as hedge funds , may find it difficult to maintain the same level of debt , and may even be forced to sell some of their assets , because of the lower availability of credit .
If some of these organizations fail , the extent to which government intervention can be expected is not clear .
There is no particular reason to expect government intervention for hedge funds or money market funds .
Pension funds and insurance companies have some types of guarantees , but the programs are not set up to handle multiple large failures .
12 . The value of the dollar will fall relative to some currencies , causing the relative price of oil to rise .
I expect that Saudi Arabia and other oil - producing Middle Eastern countries will revalue their currencies relative to the dollar , causing the value of the dollar to decline .
Because of this revaluation , the cost of oil will rise , despite the sharp economic downturn .
It is not as clear to me how the US dollar will fare relative to other currencies .
Europe , Japan , and Canada are likely to have economic difficulties of their own relating to peak oil and to the falling value of homes .
The shift among these currencies may be relatively smaller .
I would expect the value of the dollar to fall relative to Chinese currency , given China 's ability to use coal to produce exports .
13 .
The stock market probably will decline during 2008 .
The combination of a recession and higher interest rates on corporate debt seems likely to result in a serious downturn in stock market values .
Financial services companies particularly are likely to do poorly .
There is still some possibility of an increase in stock market values , however , because of the large amount of " recycled oil " payments and the inflationary impact of additional governmental debt and lax monetary policy .
14 . Prices are likely to rise in 2008 for food and energy products .
Prices may decline for homes and non-essential goods and services .
Americans will find that more and more of their income is devoted to food and energy , leaving less for non-essential goods and services and debt payments .
This same situation will exist in many countries around the world .
15 .
There is a chance that some type of discontinuity will make financial conditions suddenly take a turn for the worse .
Will the " wheels come off the economy " ?
I really do n't know .
I think that there are a few things that may help prevent a major disruption during 2008 .
First , things tend to happen fairly slowly .
The economy has a fairly large amount of momentum , and this will tend to keep things at the current level .
It will take a period of months for bond ratings to be lowered , and for this information to filter back to the balance sheets of banks and insurance companies .
If some of the bond and mortgage insurers are actually insolvent , this will take even longer to sort out .
Some of the potential problems I have alluded to may not appear until 2009 or later .
Second , regulators of various types have the power to change the rules as they go along .
Regulators have the ability to overlook non-performing loans , and to lower capital requirements .
They can lend money to banks , using as collateral securities most people would consider to be junk .
They can create at least a certain amount of new money .
In some cases , congressional approval may be required for these approaches , but if the alternative is banks and other businesses failing , congress is likely to go along with any proposed bailout plan .
Third , in order to keep things going , what is needed is to keep cash inputs and outputs working .
To a significant extent , the problems we are having are balance sheet problems -- values of assets and values of liabilities .
I expect to see more of what the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is currently doing - paying benefits , even though liabilities are greater than assets .
It may be possible to delay facing the truth a bit longer by optimistically valuing assets , using high discount rates on liabilities , and focusing on cash needed for today 's transactions .
Eventually , it seems like something will happen to stop the parade .
One possibility is that the United States will no longer find buyers for all the debt it issues .
This will probably not happen until there is a general recognition of peak oil .
Another is that financial system failures cascade in such a way that it is not possible to continue propping up the system .
Another is that hyperinflation will take over .
While one of these , or something else adverse may happen , I do n't know that such an event will necessarily happen very soon .
Why is information about the financial system important to oil companies , and other companies in the energy field ?
Having a functioning financial system is very important from the point of view of our oil production and distribution system .
Oil companies need to be able to pay their workers .
They need to be able to borrow money to start new projects .
They need be able to make contracts with other companies for necessary services , like hiring drilling rigs .
They need to be able to purchase oil from overseas , and to be able to pay for it using transaction methods that are not too disrupted .
All of these may be problems , if there are too many bank failures , or other serious issues with the financial system .
This has the potential to create a negative feedback mechanism which will further limit oil supply .
ARMONK , NY - 08 Nov 2007 : IBM ( NYSE : IBM ( IBM ) Global Business Services unveiled its new report , " The End of Advertising as We Know It , " forecasting greater disruption for the advertising industry in the next five years than occurred in the previous 50 .
To examine the factors influencing advertising and explore future scenarios , IBM surveyed more than 2,400 consumers and 80 advertising executives globally .
The IBM report shows increasingly empowered consumers , more self - reliant advertisers and ever - evolving technologies are redefining how advertising is sold , created , consumed and tracked .
Traditional advertising players risk major revenue declines as budgets shift rapidly to new , interactive formats , which are expected to grow at nearly five times that of traditional advertising .
To survive in this new reality , broadcasters must change their mass audience mind - set to cater to niche consumer segments , and distributors need to deliver targeted , interactive advertising for a range of multimedia devices .
Advertising agencies must experiment creatively , become brokers of consumer insights , and guide allocation of advertising dollars amid exploding choices .
All players must adapt to a world where advertising inventory is increasingly bought and sold in open exchanges vs. traditional channels .
" Digital entertainment is experiencing faster adoption than anyone had previously anticipated .
The advertising community needs to dramatically re-orient its business to serve consumers who increasingly access content in non-linear formats , " said Bill Battino , Communications Sector managing partner , IBM Global Business Services .
" Companies must re-look at how they serve content to consumers with business models based much more on engaging consumers in a relationship . "
The report observes four change drivers tipping the advertising industry balance of power : control of attention , creativity , measurement , and advertising inventories .
As shown in IBM 's global digital media and entertainment consumer survey released in August , consumers ' attention has shifted , with personal Internet time rivaling TV time .
Consumers have tired of interruption advertising , and are increasingly in control of how they interact , filter , distribute , and consume their content , and associated advertising messages .
IBM 's survey findings demonstrated that half of DVR owners watch 50 percent or more of programming on re-play , and that traditional video advertising does n't translate online : 40 percent of respondents found ads during an online video segment more annoying than any other format .
Amateurs and semi- professionals are increasingly creating low cost advertising content that threatens to bypass creative agencies , while publishers and broadcasters are broadening their own creative roles .
Advertisers are demanding accountability and more specific individual consumer measurements across advertising platforms .
Self - service advertising exchanges are attracting revenues that were once exclusively sold through proprietary channels or transactions .
Advertising Experts ' Expectations in Line with Global Consumer Trends
IBM 's research found that advertising experts recognize the changing nature of consumers and also anticipate dramatic changes on the horizon .
More than half of ad professionals polled by IBM expect that in the next five years open advertising exchanges ( currently led by companies like Google , Yahoo , AOL ) will take 30 percent of current revenues now commanded by traditional broadcasters and media .
Nearly half of the advertising survey respondents anticipate a significant ( greater than 10 % ) revenue shift away from the 30 - second spot within the next five years , and almost 10 percent of respondents thought there would be a dramatic ( greater than 25 percent ) shift .
Two - thirds of advertising experts surveyed by IBM expect 20 percent of advertising revenue to move from impression - based to impact - based formats within three years .
Saul Berman , IBM Media & Entertainment Strategy and Change practice leader , said , " Advertising remains integral to pop culture and continues to fund a significant portion of entertainment around the world .
But it needs to morph into new formats and offer more intrinsic value to consumers , who will have more choices .
The wealth of new advertising outlets means consumer analytics will have a more prominent role than ever regardless of where you reside in the value chain .
Young people in particular have grown accustomed to not paying for content .
Despite greater consumer control over content and advertising , we envision a world where consumers will continue to prefer to view advertising rather than pay for content directly . "
The report indicates by 2012 , the landscape of the industry will change so profoundly that to survive , advertising industry players need to take aggressive steps to innovate in three key areas :
IBM believes that all players will need to invest heavily in consumer analytics and automation to gain more insights about the consumer and how to reach them .
For example , interactive advertising paired with consumer analytics provides compelling knowledge of who viewed and acted on an ad rather than estimates of impressions , allowing advertisers to maximize revenue and yield management .
Industry players will also need to examine if they have right resources and capacity to handle increased marketing promotions and integrated advertising sales .
Finally , IBM observes that the dramatic increase in both the number and variety of promotions is leading to greater investment in tools to digitally transform and reduce the cost of companies ' workflows including content management , creative development , production and sign - off processes .

I 'm working on a new parser combinator library for Factor based on Parsing Expression Grammars and Packrat parsers .
This is based on what I learnt from writing a packrat parser in Javascript .
It 's progressing quite well and already fixes some problems in the existing parser combinator library I wrote .
The main issue with that one is it 's not tail recursive and some combinations of parsers can run out of call stack .
The new library is in the ' peg ' vocabulary .
I have n't yet implemented the packrat side of things though so it is slow on large grammars and inputs .
I 've also done a proof of concept of something I 've been meaning to do for awhile .
That is writing a parser for EBNF ( or similar ) that produces Factor code in the form of parser combinators to implement the described grammar .
The code for this is in the ' peg.ebnf ' vocabulary .
It allows you to embed an EBNF - like language and have Factor words generated for each rule :
< EBNF digit = ' 1 ' | ' 2 ' | ' 3 ' | ' 4 ' .
number = digit { digit } .
expr = number {( '+' | '-' ) number } .
EBNF >
This example would create three Factor words .
' digit ' , ' number ' and ' expr ' .
These words return parsers that can be used as normal :
" 123 " number parse " 1 " digit parse " 1+243+342 " expr parse
The EBNF accepted allows for choice , zero or more repetition , optional ( exactly 0 or 1 ) , and grouping .
The generated AST is pretty ugly so by default it works best as a syntax checker .
You can modify the generated AST with action productions :
< EBNF digit = ' 1 ' | ' 2 ' | ' 3 ' | ' 4 ' => convert - to - digit .
number = digit { digit } => convert - to - number .
expr = number '+' number => convert - to - expr .
EBNF >
An action is a factor word after the '= > ' .
The word receives the AST produced from the rule on the stack and it can replace that with a new value that will be used in the AST .
So ' convert - to - expr ' above might produce a tuple holding the expression values ( by default , a sequence of terms in the rule are stored in a vector ) :
TUPLE : ast - expr lhs operator rhs ; C : < ast - expr > ast - expr : convert - to - expr ( old -- new ) first3 < ast - expr > ;
The generated code is currently pretty ugly , mainly due to it being a quick proof of concept .
I 'll try doing a few grammars and tidy it up , changing the interface if needed , as I go along .
As an experiment I did a grammar for the PL/0 programming language .
It 's in ' peg.pl0 ' .
The grammar from the wikipedia article is :
program = block " . " . block = [ " const " ident " = " number { " , " ident " = " number} " ; " ] [ " var " ident { " , " ident} " ; " ] { " procedure " ident " ; " block " ; " } statement .
statement = [ ident " := " expression | " call " ident | " begin " statement { " ; " statement } " end " | " if " condition " then " statement | " while " condition " do " statement ]. condition = " odd " expression | expression ( " = " | " # " | " < " | " < = " | " > " | " >= " ) expression .
expression = [ " + " | " - " ] term { ( " + " | " - " ) term}. term = factor { ( " * " | " / " ) factor} .
factor = ident | number | " ( " expression " ) " .</ pre>The Factor grammar is very similar : < pre > : ident ( -- parser ) CHAR : a CHAR : z range CHAR : A CHAR : Z range 2 array choice repeat1 [ > string ] action ; : number ( -- parser ) CHAR : 0 CHAR : 9 range repeat1 [ string > number ] action ; < EBNF program = block '.' . block = [ ' const ' ident ' = ' number { ' , ' ident ' = ' number } ' ;' ] [ ' var ' ident { ' , ' ident } ' ;' ] { ' procedure ' ident ' ;' [ block ' ;' ] } statement .
statement = [ ident ':=' expression | ' call ' ident | ' begin ' statement {' ; ' statement } ' end ' | ' if ' condition ' then ' statement | ' while ' condition ' do ' statement ] . condition = ' odd ' expression | expression ( ' = ' | ' # ' | '< =' | ' <' | '> =' | '>') expression .
expression = [ '+ ' | '-'] term {('+' | '-') term } . term = factor {('*' | '/' ) factor } . factor = ident | number | ' (' expression ' ) '
EBNF >
This grammar as defined works and can parse PL/0 programs .
I 'll extend this as I improve the EBNF routines , adding actions , etc to generated a decent AST .
Copernicus , Kepler , Galileo , Newton — these are familiar names .
During a 150 - year span in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , they led the scientific revolution that placed the sun , rather than the earth , at the center of things astronomical .
But have you ever heard of Carl Woese ?
He set in motion a scientific revolution in biology that , in its repudiation of anthropocentric views of life , is proving no less profound .
In 1977 , Woese ( pronounced “ woes ” ) , a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , drew a terrestrial family tree that showed the genetic relatedness of all living things on this planet .
Using modern tools of molecular biology , he sampled the known single - celled , microscopic organisms we call microbes , and also the denizens of the human - scale world with which we are familiar : the flowers , trees , and shrubs ; the animals ; and the fungi .
His map of all this new information revealed that taxonomists of ages past had been looking at the world through the wrong end of a telescope .
The formerly great “ kingdoms ” of Plantae , Animalia , and Fungi almost disappeared , shrinking to fit on a small , trifurcating branch of his tree .
In their place were three vast “ domains ” : Bacteria ( single - celled microorganisms that lack a distinct nucleus and organelles ) ; Archaea , or Archaebacteria ( similar in appearance and simplicity to bacteria , but with notably different molecular organization ) ; and Eukarya ( all organisms whose cells have a distinct nucleus — or , simply put , everything else ) .
Life on Earth , Woese ’s model showed , is overwhelmingly microbial .
In fact , the extent of microbial diversity is so great that scientists have difficulties estimating its actual size .
Some estimates place the number of microbial species in the range of billions , exceeding the number of species of “ large ” organisms by several orders of magnitude .
In light of this new understanding of life , scientists with advanced research tools are focusing anew on microbes , which , following the great discoveries of penicillin and other antibiotics in the mid twentieth century , had largely been consigned to the confines of pharmaceutical research .
“ Our planet has been shaped by an invisible world , ” says Roberto Kolter , a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School ( HMS ) .
He and Jeffrey professor of biology Colleen Cavanaugh of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences ( FAS ) together co-direct Harvard ’s Microbial Sciences Initiative , which serves as a focal point for researchers in the field from all over the University .
“ Microbes mediate all the important element cycles on Earth , and have played a defining role in the development of the planet , ” says Kolter .
They form clouds , break down rocks , deposit minerals , fertilize plants , condition soils , and clean up toxic waste .
Among their ranks , explains Cavanaugh , are the photosynthetic “ primary producers ” that use sunlight , water , and carbon dioxide to form the broad base of the food chain , and together with plants make up the earth ’s largest source of biomass .
The earliest life on our planet was entirely microbial , and if life exists on other planets , it is surely microbial there as well .
In the realm of human health , microbes help us digest food and produce vitamins , protect us against infection , and are the main source of antibiotic medicines .
The human cells in your body number 10 trillion , but that pales by comparison to the estimated 100 trillion microbial cells that live in and on you .
“ Without them , you would be in trouble , ” Kolter says : animals experience abnormal growth and become sick if deprived of their microflora during development .
Although a few microbes are known to cause disease , the precise role played by the vast majority is essentially unknown .
The same could be said for microbes around the planet .
There are a billion of them in a gram of soil , and a billion per liter of seawater , but we know neither what they are nor what they do .
In the poetic conclusion to his 1994 autobiography , Naturalist , the great sociobiologist and Pellegrino University Professor emeritus E.O. Wilson mused on what he would do , “ [ i ] f I could do it all over again and relive my vision in the twenty - first century .
I would be a microbial ecologist ... , ” he wrote .
“ Into that world I would go with the aid of modern microscopy and molecular analysis .
I would cut my way through clonal forests sprawled across grains of sand , travel in an imagined submarine through drops of water proportionately the size of lakes , and track predators and prey in order to discover new life ways and alien food webs .
All this , and I need venture no farther than ten paces outside my laboratory building .
The jaguars , ants , and orchids would still occupy distant forests in all their splendor , but now they would be joined by an even stranger and vastly more complex living world virtually without end . ”
The Limits of Cultures
As a practical matter , the Microbial Sciences Initiative ( MSI ) began in 2002 as a grass - roots effort among faculty members who recognized the unexplored ecology and potential of these organisms and wanted to share information about microbial research across diverse disciplines : biology , medicine , chemistry , engineering , geology , astronomy , and evolutionary and planetary history .
The group held informal “ chalk - talks ” weekly , and in 2004 staged a day - long symposium with speakers from around the world .
When President Lawrence H. Summers issued a call that year for initiatives that would bring people together from across the science and engineering disciplines , MSI was a perfect candidate , says Cabot professor of biology Richard Losick , a member of its steering committee .
“ I think there are few disciplines that lend themselves better to cross - disciplinary approaches , ” he says , “ and few subjects that have implications across a wider spectrum of sciences than is true for microbiology . ”
As a result , in 2006 MSI received four years of support , totaling $ 2.7 million , from the provost ’s office .
“ It kills me that people think only that bacteria are disease - causing , ” says Cavanaugh , who studies the chemosynthetic symbiotic bacteria that make life possible for giant clams and tubeworms dwelling near deep ocean hydrothermal vents .
Far from sunlight , they operate by mechanisms both similar to and much different from the photosynthetic organisms we see every day .
“ Although intracellular , these bacteria are helpful to their animal hosts , ” she adds .
“ Like chloroplasts in plants [ which evolved from symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria ] , the chemosynthetic symbionts turn carbon dioxide into sugars and proteins , feed - ing their hosts internally . ”
But most people do associate microbes with disease .
“ Antibacterials ” have been incorporated into all kinds of consumer products : soaps , sponges , toilet paper , towels , and cutting boards — even clothing .
Kolter traces the origins of this “ ludicrous ” antimicrobial “ scorched - earth policy ” to the time of Louis Pasteur , who formulated germ theory , and Robert Koch , who developed methods for culturing bacteria .
“ Medical microbiology for almost 150 years has been driven by the idea that germs are the causative agents of disease .
And there is no doubt that Koch and Pasteur were right , that Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes tuberculosis and Vibrio cholerae causes cholera , ” says Kolter .
But microbes have also led to most of our antibiotics , a development that Kolter calls “ the most important advance in medical history . ”
Scientists had known that there are more microbes in an ounce of soil than humans alive on Earth , but that was just a measure of abundance .
Pace ’s discovery demonstrated something new , a previously unfathomed repository of biodiversity .
Scientists began sequencing DNA from all sorts of environments .
After looking at human gut microflora , they learned that each individual has his or her own characteristic set of a thousand species .
“ These represent three million genes that you carry , ” points out Kolter , “ as compared to the estimated 18,000 genes of the human genome .
So you are living and exchanging [ metabolites ] constantly with a diverse pool of some three million genes . ”
Microbiologists continue to find new taxonomic divisions of microbes far faster than they can figure out how to culture them .
The formerly limited view of the microbial world arose from what has turned out to be an inherently constrained approach to the study of bacteria : the practice of culturing them .
For more than a hundred years , scientists had been mystified by what was called the “ plate count paradox . ”
Whenever they tried to grow a sample of bacteria from the environment on a nutrient medium in a petri dish ( an agar plate ) , only a few microorganisms grew and multiplied to form colonies , when there should have been at a minimum thousands of such colonies ( based on the number of different species discernible just by looking through a microscope ) .
Various explanations were offered — that 99.9 percent of the bacteria in the sample were dead , or that they must all be the same bacterium because they looked similar .
“ But then in 1990 , ” says Kolter , “ scientists showed that the DNA complexity in a typical soil sample meant that there had to be thousands of times more diversity than was being plated . ”
Norman Pace , a professor at the University of Colorado , began to wonder if scientists simply lacked the basic knowledge needed to grow most of the bacteria on the planet — if perhaps we were so ignorant of these bacteria that we could not culture them .
He hit on the idea that he could instead analyze a sample of soil or water for its DNA content in order to ascertain how many species it contained .
“ Pace went to Yellowstone National Park , to some of its famous hot springs , where the water was nearly boiling , and collected a sample of sediment , ” Kolter explains .
“ He extracted the DNA , cloned it , and put it into a little bacterium that he knew how to grow . ”
Then he sequenced the genes .
“ In that one little gram of sediment , ” Kolter notes , “ Pace discovered more diversity than we ever knew existed before , when using our traditional , century - old techniques for cultivating bacteria . ”
The world of animals — from elephants to ants — is divided into 13 phyla ( vertebrates are one phylum , insects another ) .
In the microbial world , their equivalents are called , for the time being , “ deep - rooting branches . ”
In 1987 , 13 of these big divisions were known in the bacterial domain : Woese sampled these to create his tree of life .
But by 1997 , there were almost three times as many : 36 in all .
“ Twelve of them we had never cultivated , and the others we began to learn how to cultivate , ” Kolter explains .
“ By 2003 , there were 53 divisions , but the more we discovered , the more we found representative microbes that we could not cultivate .
We learned how to cultivate microbes from only two of these in six years and by 2004 we had found 80 such divisions from which we could n’t cultivate even a single representative . ”
Each of these deep - branching divisions is thought to represent millions , if not hundreds of millions , of species .
“ That means there are lots of genes out there , and we have no clue what they are doing , ” Kolter says .
“ So when you think about biodiversity , and the extent of diversity on the planet , you really get a sense of how little we know about this undiscovered world .
We are at the stage of discovery where , everywhere we look , we see new species .
“ The reason we are so excited about preserving diversity , ” he continues , “ is because that is how we preserve the richness of the planet . ”
Where does that richness lie ?
Traditionally , taxonomists classified life according to morphology ( by appearance , form , or pattern ) : one finch ’s beak resembles that of another , but is nothing like that of hummingbird .
Bats fly , but are more like mice with wings than like birds .
Microbes , on the other hand , often appear similar to one another to the human eye .
Plants , animals , and fungi may seem wildly diverse from a morphological perspective , but in fact , Kolter explains , there is “ far less genetic difference between [ a human being ] and a potato ” than there is between , say , “ the bacterium that causes tuberculosis and the one that causes cholera .
So as magnificent as is the diversity of the tropical rainforest , it pales by comparison to the microbial world . ”
Microbial Medicines
In the interests of human health , researchers have begun to hunt among all this newfound microbial diversity for new antibiotics .
Says Richard Losick , “ I have many wonderful colleagues in the chemistry department , but without question the champion synthetic organic chemists on the planet are the microbes . ”
“ The majority of our antibiotics and many anticancer compounds come from soil - dwelling bacteria , ” notes Jon Clardy , a professor of biological chemistry and molecular pharmacology at HMS .
Unfortunately , he says , due to the spread of antibiotic resistance , “ we are running out of effective antibiotics . ”
For economic reasons , pharmaceutical companies are not investing as much as they used to in the development of new ones , which has left physicians looking for an antibiotic of last resort to be held in reserve for the one patient once a year who has a resistant strain of tuberculosis or pneumonia , explains Kolter .
“ That drug would be the billion - dollar blockbuster that nobody buys , because doctors should n’t be prescribing it widely .
Nobody in the corporate world will develop it . ”
He believes that “ there may be a role for the University in research that is not going to be as profitable for corporations to pursue : the development of targeted , ecologically sound antibiotics . ”
Whole - genome studies of microbes suggest that only a small fraction of the natural products that come from even well - known bacteria have been discovered .
A prime example is Streptomyces avermitilis , the bacterium from which researchers derived a drug called Ivermectin .
“ Ivermectin , ” says Clardy , “ is grown on the ton scale because it is used against river blindness in Africa , for treating almond trees in California , and for getting rid of all kinds of parasites ” ( equine worms , for example ) .
“ Here you have a ‘ bug ’ that is producing a useful molecule grown on a huge scale , and intensively so . ”
Once the genome was sequenced , he says , “ Just looking at it casually , you could see where Ivermectin is made , but you could also see [ other gene sequences ] — over 30 of these clusters — that it seems should each make a small molecule .
We know only three molecules that come from that bug , ” he adds — one of them the source of Ivermectin .
“ That means we know only 10 percent of what it can potentially make . ”
But probing those secrets is far from easy .
When grown in a lab in pure culture , microbes apparently do n’t need to activate all their genetic machinery to survive .
In their natural setting , by contrast , microbes live in a complex ecology : they interact with their environment and with other microbes by using a vast array of virtually unknown small - molecule products .
These organic compounds often play multiple roles : a small molecule used for signaling among bacteria engaged in mutually beneficial metabolite exchange ( one microbe ’s metabolic waste is another ’s meal ) might also be used to kill competitors trying to gain a foothold in the same ecological niche .
Such compounds , if researchers could identify them , produce them , and figure out how they work , might form the next generation of medical antibiotics .
At Harvard , an MSI - facilitated collaboration between Kolter and Clardy uses creative methods for prompting even unculturable microbes to yield such genetic secrets .
Clardy was among the earliest researchers to use “ metagenomics , ” which involves sampling the environment — your gut , a lake , or in his case , the soil — and collecting the “ metagenome , ” or composite genome , of all the individual organisms dwelling there .
After extracting the many strands of DNA , Clardy screens for sequences that make compounds .
He can isolate these sequences and transfer them into E. coli ( or another “ tame ” bacterium that he knows how to cultivate ) in order to get them to express the target compounds .
Kolter , meanwhile , has been creating controlled ecological settings , exploring whether certain bacteria behave differently in the context of other species , as they do in their natural environment .
He has given Clardy a tool that indicates when a bug responds to a microbial signal , and Clardy has developed other tools for figuring out what that signaling compound is .
These organic molecules , often antibiotic , frequently “ turn out to be something new that nobody has ever seen before , ” says Kolter , “ often with properties that are chemically very interesting . ”

To show that their method works in principle , the team in 2006 published an early discovery using the bacterium Bacillus subtilis , which has been studied for more than 100 years .
The compound they identified , bacillaene , may or may not turn out to be useful in medicine , they caution .
But it is a highly complex , resource - intensive structure for any single - celled organism to make , and that suggests that it plays an important biological role .
Two new MSI postdoctoral fellows arriving at the medical school this year will use the collaborative techniques Kolter and Clardy have developed to facilitate further discoveries .
They will enter a universe of seemingly endless therapeutic possibility , between the small - molecule products of bacteria yet undiscovered , and the 90 percent of untapped coding sequences from the bugs we thought we knew .
Bacterial Biomarkers of Ancient Earth
Within FAS , Ann Pearson , Cabot associate professor of earth and planetary sciences , also became interested in bacteria for what they might reveal about Earth ’s early history .
Pearson , a biogeochemist , has collaborated with Richard Losick , who during the last 35 years has elucidated in great detail the molecular mechanisms that control life cycle and differentiation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis .
She “ does wonderful research , ” Losick says , “ on [ the origins of ] biological molecules that can be recovered from hundreds of millions , if not billions , of years ago , reflecting the earliest evidence for life on Earth . ”
“ If you have very highly preserved , organic - rich , sedimentary rocks that have n’t been deeply buried and heated in their geologic history , ” Pearson says , “ you can extract measurable amounts of lipids or fats that make up some cell membranes .
We call these ‘ molecular fossils ’ because they have structure , they can be identified , and occasionally you can tell what type of organism they might have come from — for example , there are certain molecules that are produced only by archaea . ”
“ Ann had the idea , ” Losick explains , “ that maybe we could learn something from similar molecules found in contemporary microbes . ”
It turned out that the bacterium that Losick ’s lab studies has genes similar to those known to produce a certain type of these molecular fossils .
Their shared MSI - sponsored postdoctoral fellow , Tanja Bosak ( now an assistant professor at MIT ) , learned the microbial genetics techniques Losick ’s lab uses and obtained evidence that in the contemporary bacterium , these molecules help to protect its spores from damage by oxygen .
( Although many life forms need oxygen , it can also cause a lot of damage . )
Bacillus subtilis , Losick explains , creates a “ particularly macho type of spore , maybe the most sturdy kind of dormant cell on the planet .
It can survive extremes of time and temperature and radiation . ”
What might this molecule have been doing two billion years ago ?
“ The exciting implication , ” Losick replies , “ is that these molecules may have appeared as a response to the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere , so the timing of their appearance in the rock record may bear on the issue of when oxygen levels first rose . ”
“ The planet is about 4.5 billion years old , ” elaborates another of Pearson ’s collaborators , paleontologist Andrew Knoll , Fisher professor of natural history and professor of earth and planetary sciences .
“ The oldest rocks we can look at are 3.8 billion years old . ”
Chemical evidence suggests that life was already present then , but certainly “ by 3.5 billion years ago there were active microbial communities on the earth ’s surface . ”
These microbes were a little different from those we know today because there was still no oxygen .
( Even today , he says , oxygen is just a “ veneer on the surface of the planet .
If you put your shovel in the mud of a marsh and dig a centimeter beneath the surface you are down to anaerobic microbial ecosystems , which remain critical for most of the biologically important element cycles on the earth ’s surface . ” )
By 2.4 billion years ago , the chemistry of sedimentary rocks suggests that there was “ at least a little bit of oxygen in the atmosphere and surface ocean . ”
Then , “ for a period of about eighteen hundred million years , oxygen levels hovered at maybe a couple of percent of today ’s levels .
Only in the last 600 million years or so do we have environments with enough oxygen to support the biology of large animals , and only in that interval do large animals actually appear , ” Knoll says .
That is also when the algae first become ecologically important , joining and eventually displacing photosynthetic bacteria as the basis of early food chains in the world ’s oceans .
“ So there is a time coincidence , ” he says , “ between major events in the history of life and major events in the history of the planet . ”
Following those threads might also suggest how life could arise , and what it might look like , elsewhere in the universe .
“ Everybody is interested in finding the perfect molecule to trace cyanobacteria , ” Pearson reports , in order to trace the origins of oxygenic primary production ( cyanobacteria use a type of photosynthesis that releases oxygen , and this process is responsible for our oxygen - rich atmosphere ) .
More broadly , she hopes to “ figure out how to relate the incredible diversity of microbes that are out there to the kinds of preservable organic molecules — or biomarkers — that they make ... and that we can find in the sedimentary record . ”
Because individual species of microbes are mutable ( “ They evolve quickly and we have no idea if there is phylogenetic integrity over billions of years ” ) , she is trying to relate particular preserved molecules to their functions in the environment , rather than to species , in order to try to get an idea of what the ecosystem looked like as life evolved on Earth and , in turn , shaped Earth ’s environment — oxygenating the atmosphere , detoxifying the oceans , breaking down rock and organic matter to form soils .
“ MSI has been absolutely essential to building the bridges that I have needed to other research groups , ” Pearson says .
“ Although my questions are geology - and earth - history - driven , the work that I do in order to answer those questions is all biology and chemistry .
I do n’t practice field geology , ” she says , “ so building bridges with other parts of the University has been critical . ”
Historically , says Knoll , “ there have been a few of us in FAS who have been interested in microorganisms , but there was n’t anything as tangible as a Museum of Comparative Zoology , which has provided a focal point for people interested in animals for 150 years , [ or ] the Herbarium , which has done the same thing for people interested in plants ” ( which Knoll calls , half - joking , “ green algae with a graduate degree ” ) .
He continues , “ Because of Harvard ’s good fortune in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , we built up these really quite remarkable facilities for studying plants and animals ... and , not surprisingly , we then populated our faculty with people who study [ them ] .
These areas are not unimportant now , ” he explains , “ but so many horizons have opened up for studying microorganisms that the simple identification through the MSI of a community of people concerned about microbiology has been tremendously important .
Many of the basic biological processes that underlie the nature of changes in the environment are microbial , so in a world where the environment may be changing faster than our ability to understand it , having a better process - oriented idea of what microbial communities are actually doing in nature has practical importance as well . ”
For his part , geochemist Daniel Schrag , professor of earth and planetary sciences and a member of the MSI steering committee , emphasizes that “ almost all the reactions on the earth ’s surface are catalyzed by microbes — in soils , in waters , in swamps .
If you do n’t know what microbes are doing , you do n’t really know what is going on . ”

“ It is clear that this field will not reach its maturity , in the sense that it becomes less exciting , during my research lifetime or probably the research lifetimes of my students , ” Knoll says .
“ We have whole new horizons in the nature and treatment of disease ; whole new horizons in simply understanding the diversity of life as it actually exists — not what we thought existed because we could see it ; whole new horizons in the nature of the relationship between organisms and the environment both today and in the future , and on the timescale of the whole development of the planet .
These are wonderfully large , exciting questions and MSI gives us a forum to discuss them .
You do find , every once in a while , someone who has actually thought about the same problem in a very different way ” — and that can be the most important sort of catalyst : the kind that leads to new discoveries .

Bear Stearns had to bail out two hedge funds earlier in the summer
It made a net loss of $ 854 m ( £ 429 m ) in the three months to the end of November from a profit of $ 536 m a year earlier .
The investment bank was one of the first banks to admit problems linked to sub - prime mortgages , after two of its hedge funds had to be bailed out .
It revealed it had written down $ 1.9bn in the period due to these woes .
This was more than the $ 1.2 bn it had earlier suggested , and reflected the reduced value of its sub - prime mortgage - related securities .
Job cuts
Top executives will not receive bonuses as a result of the unprecedented losses , Bear Stearns said .
The company had already seen profits between June and August fall by 61 % .
It has also cut about 1,500 jobs from its 15,000 workforce since the two hedge funds were forced to close .
Sub - prime lenders focus on people with poor or non-existent credit histories .
Higher interest rates in the US led to an increase in the number of mortgage defaults , with the sub - prime sector especially hard hit .
Over the past few weeks , a string of global banks have indicated how much they have lost as a result of exposure to investment products linked to US sub - prime mortgages .
So far announced losses have totalled about $ 80bn , but the final toll might be much higher .
On Wednesday , Morgan Stanley revealed a bigger - than - expected write - down of assets and sold a $ 5 bn stake to a Chinese sovereign wealth fund .
In nearly every newspaper or magazine these days you can find evolutionary explanations for a variety of human behaviors — for what we seek in mates , why we are sometimes unfaithful , why we love our children ( but not our stepchildren ) , why men and women differ , and even why husbands kill their wives .
All of these explanations are offered in the name of evolutionary psychology .
But what is evolutionary psychology ?
There are actually two different answers to this question , and it is useful to clearly distinguish them .
On the one hand , many behavioral scientists define evolutionary psychology simply as “ the evolutionary study of mind and behavior . ”
1
So conceived , evolutionary psychology is a field of inquiry , akin to mechanics , which is defined not by any specific theories about human psychology , but by the questions it investigates .
And these questions cover a broad spectrum .
Why do males in some hunter - gatherer populations hunt , which offers highly variable caloric returns , when they could reliably provide their families with equivalent calories by gathering ?
Why do women in some hunter - gatherer populations wait an average of four years between pregnancies ?
What evolutionary forces drove cortical expansion in humans ?
How and why did altruism , or language , evolve ?
On the other hand , several prominent and influential behavioral scientists — led on the popular front by Steven Pinker ( The Blank Slate ) and David Buss ( The Evolution of Desire and The Murderer Next Door ) and on the academic front by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby ( The Adapted Mind ) — define evolutionary psychology as a specific set of doctrines concerning the evolutionary history and current nature of the human mind .
In this sense , evolutionary psychology as a field of inquiry has been elevated by its practitioners to an all encompassing paradigm of Evolutionary Psychology ( EP ) .
A defining doctrine of EP is that the human mind is massively modular , containing “ hundreds or thousands ” of “ special - purpose minicomputers ” called “ modules , ” each of which evolved during the Pleistocene to solve a problem of survival or reproduction faced by our hunter - gatherer ancestors .
2
Endowed with substantial innate knowledge , yet a very narrow range of expertise , each module is dedicated exclusively to solving a single problem — for example , detecting cheaters in social exchanges .
A second defining doctrine of EP is that our minds remain adapted to a Pleistocene hunter - gatherer lifestyle — that , psychologically , we are living fossils of our Stone Age ancestors .
3
Accordingly , the evolved nature of the human mind is allegedly discoverable by “ reverse engineering ” the mind from the vantage of our Pleistocene past — figuring out the adaptive problems our ancestors faced and then hypothesizing the modules that evolved to solve them .
4
Despite being an ardent fan of evolutionary psychology , I ’m deeply skeptical about the Evolutionary Psychology paradigm .
One problem concerns EP ’s claim that the human mind is massively modular .
Our best evidence indicates , instead , that the human mind is adapted to adapt to highly variable and often rapidly changing environments .
5
Our species ’ great cognitive achievement was not the evolution of a legion of idiot savants , but the evolution of cortical plasticity , which enables the brain to reorganize itself in response to changing epistemic demands .
In this respect , the brain is very similar to the immune system , which manufactures antibodies as needed in response to changing pathogenic demands .
6
A second problem concerns the doctrine that our minds are adapted to the Stone Age .
First , this idea greatly underestimates the rate at which natural and sexual selection can drive evolutionary change .
Recent studies have demonstrated that selection can overhaul a species ’ adaptations in as few as eighteen generations ( for humans , roughly 450 years ) .
Second , the principal driving forces in human psychological evolution have been the demands of competition and cooperation with fellow humans .
This created an arms race in human psychological evolution , in which every bit of evolution in human psychology changed the competitive and cooperative environments to which human psychology needed to adapt .
And this arms race accelerated the rate of human psychological evolution .
So there has undoubtedly been significant human psychological evolution since the Pleistocene .
We ’re not simply Pleistocene hunter - gatherers , like Fred and Wilma Flintstone , struggling to survive and reproduce in evolutionarily novel suburban habitats .
7
But this is all highly theoretical stuff .
Nothing persuades quite like sound empirical results .
And on this score EP has appeared very persuasive .
Indeed , EPists boast a number of impressive discoveries , including a sex difference in mate preferences ( that males prefer nubility , while females prefer nobility ) , evolved strategies of infidelity , a sex difference in jealousy , and the reason why stepchildren suffer a high risk of maltreatment .
All of these claims have received tremendous media attention , and the coverage has made it appear that these “ discoveries ” have unassailable evidence in their favor .
But a closer look at the evidence reveals ample grounds for skepticism regarding EP ’s claims about the nature of the mind .
Indeed , there is n’t unequivocal evidence to support EP ’s most highly publicized “ discoveries . ”
In what follows , I will focus on three of the most widely cited claims ( presented in much greater detail in my recently published book , Adapting Minds ) .
Her Cheating Mind
In Alfred Kinsey ’s classic sex surveys , 50 % of married men , and 26 % of married women , reported having had extramarital sex .8
Why ?
According to EP , since a man ’s maximum potential lifetime reproductive output is limited only by the number of pregnancies he can cause , every extramarital encounter represents another potential offspring .
But a woman ’s maximum potential lifetime reproductive output is limited by the number of pregnancies she can carry to term , and a single mate can provide a woman with all the sperm she needs for those pregnancies .
So , EPists ask , what reproductive benefits do women gain from infidelity ?
David Buss claims to have the answer : while women can’t increase the quantity of their offspring through extramarital affairs , as men can , they can increase the quality of their offspring .
A woman can harvest “ good genes ” from an extramarital sex partner , and those good genes can provide her offspring with better health , superior disease resistance , and greater attractiveness to the opposite sex .
Moreover , as long as she keeps the affair concealed , a woman who has an extramarital affair with a male with good genes gets the reproductive benefits of both worlds :
She obtains superior genes for a child who can then be reared on the resources provided by her cuckolded long - term mate with inferior genes .
“ Some women pursue a ‘ mixed ’ mating strategy , ” says Buss , “ ensuring devotion and investment from one man while acquiring good genes from another . ”
9
Because of the reproductive payoffs of this “ mixed ” mating strategy , women evolved a “ psychology of infidelity , ” 10 or “ a psychological mechanism in women specifically designed to promote short - term mating ” when resources have already been secured from a long - term mate , the short - term extrapair sex is likely to go undetected , and the extrapair partner has better genes than the long - term mate .
11
The mechanism that promotes extrapair sex under these conditions is , according to Buss , a female psychological adaptation .
Three findings provide the core evidence for Buss ’s claim that female short - term infidelity is an adaptation .
First , an interesting study found that , on average , the more symmetrical a male , the higher his attractiveness rating by female panelists .
12
This is significant because many biologists believe symmetry ( in which the two sides of the body are mirror images of one another ) is a sign of developmental stability , an ability to resist the harmful effects of pathogens and minor mutations .
The study also found that highly symmetrical men , on average , reported having been chosen by women as an extrapair sexual partner more often than less symmetrical men .
And this , Buss claims , shows that women prefer extrapair partners with good genes .
In another experiment , T - shirts were washed in unscented laundry detergent and issued to male participants who were required to sleep in them for two consecutive nights .
13
During the two - day period , the males were to refrain from using scented soaps , eating spicy foods , drinking alcohol , smoking , and having sex .
After the two days , female subjects smelled the T - shirts both during ovulation and during the infertile phase of their menstrual cycles , and they rated each T - shirt for “ pleasantness ” and “ sexiness ” of smell .
The scents of the T - shirts of highly symmetrical men were rated highest — but only by women who were ovulating .
Buss concludes that “ women detect the scent of symmetry , prefer that scent when ovulating , and choose more symmetrical men as affair partners .
” 14
Third , in a British study , women who reported extrapair involvements also reported that approximately 60 % of their copulations during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycles took place with their extrapair partners , whereas about 60 % of their copulations during the infertile phase of their cycles took place with their in - pair partners .
15
So , when women have affairs , the majority of their sexual activity when they are fertile occurs with their affair partners , which tips the odds of paternity in favor of the extrapair partner .
Buss argues that these findings provide rather definitive support for the following picture : women have a long - term mating psychology , which leads them to seek a long - term mate who will provide resources .
But , once they ’ve landed such a mate , women can become motivated by a psychological mechanism that is “ specifically designed to promote short - term mating , ” and this will motivate extramarital affairs with males with good genes .
However , the claim that women have a psychological adaptation “ specifically designed to promote short - term ” infidelity goes well beyond the evidence .
In fact , the pattern of female short - term infidelity described by Buss is best explained as a byproduct of other psychological and physiological adaptations , rather than as a direct result of an adaptation specifically for short - term infidelity .
Let ’s begin with the question of why women cheat at all .
A number of studies , conducted over decades , have consistently found that sexual dissatisfaction in marriage is the leading factor in causing women to engage in short - term extramarital sexual affairs , 16 and these results have recently been corroborated by EPists .
17 Indeed , although women who are emotionally dissatisfied in marriage seek extramarital emotional involvements , they are not more likely than satisfied women to have extramarital sexual affairs ; only sexually dissatisfied women are more likely to have extramarital sexual involvements .
18 Moreover , women who are sexually dissatisfied in marriage have been found to be over twice as likely as sexually satisfied women to have extramarital sex.19
Accordingly , the fact that women engage in short - term extramarital affairs can be explained simply as resulting from a frustrated “ sex drive ” ( for lack of a better term ) .
When the “ sex drive ” is going unsatisfied in marriage , women sometimes seek sexual satisfaction outside marriage .
This may have reproductive benefits , but it is explicable without appeal to a mechanism specifically designed to harvest “ good genes ” from an extrapair partner .
Of course , while this may explain why women take extramarital sex partners , it does n’t explain why their sexual activity with their extrapair partners increases during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycles .
But several studies have consistently found a peak in the levels of female desire for sex , fantasy about sex , masturbation , and initiation of sex during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle .20
The rise in female desire and female - initiated sexual activity during the fertile phase is probably an adaptation , since it is too well designed for reproduction to be an accident or byproduct of something else .
So , the increase in sexual activity with extrapair partners during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle is really just a byproduct of a generalized increase in female - initiated sexual activity during that period .
Buss is aware of this research , but argues that it ca n’t explain the facts about female short - term infidelity , since it was only sexual activity with extrapair partners , not sexual activity in general , that was found to increase during the fertile phase .
But the reason for this extrapair bias is relatively mundane .
First , the large majority of women who have extramarital sexual affairs are sexually dissatisfied in their marriages .
Second , if a sexually dissatisfied married woman is seeking sexual satisfaction through an extrapair involvement , she will be unlikely to repeat extrapair sexual encounters with men who fail to satisfy , since there are potential costs to getting caught in an infidelity .
So , any male who is a regular extrapair partner of a married woman is very likely a man with whom sex is gratifying in a way it is not with her husband .
Therefore , when a woman experiences an increased desire for sex during the fertile phase of her cycle , she is far more likely to arrange to have satisfying sex with her extrapair partner than to have unsatisfying sex with her husband .
Still , EPists will argue , none of this explains why women tend to choose symmetrical men as their extrapair partners .
But , again , this is merely a byproduct of more general mate preferences .
By Buss ’s theory , symmetry is one of the things that women seek in a long - term mate because it supposedly signals “ good genes . ”
Even if women have an evolved preference for symmetrical men , this preference may be part of a single set of mate preferences , which is operative in choosing both long - term and short - term mates .
To illustrate , suppose that women seek long - term mates who have only two qualities — symmetry and a willingness to provide resources .
When a woman seeks a partner for a short - term infidelity , the same preference structure could be operative , but resources become irrelevant .
When resources drop out of the equation , only the preference for symmetry remains .
Here , then , is the byproduct explanation of female short - term infidelity .
Suppose that women possess the following three adaptations , among others : the “ sex drive ” ( the desire for a regular and fulfilling sex life , together with the patterns of planning and acting so as to ensure the satisfaction of that desire ) , a peak in sexual desire during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle ( with its attendant increase in female - initiated sexual activity ) , and a preference for symmetrical males ( which is one of several mate preferences ) .
When a woman is sexually dissatisfied in her marriage , she is more likely to begin an extramarital sexual involvement ( because of the “ sex drive ” ) .
In selecting an extrapair partner , the same preferences that were operative in choosing a long - term mate will also be operative , but some of them ( for example , a willingness to provide resources ) will be irrelevant to the specifically sexual role for which the extrapair partner is being selected .
As irrelevant preferences drop out of the selection process , the preference for symmetry comes to loom large , so women will tend to choose symmetrical men as extrapair partners .
Then , once a woman begins an extramarital affair , her peaking desire for sex during the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle causes an increase in the number of sexual encounters that she initiates .
And , because sex with her husband is less gratifying than sex with her affair partner , the sexual encounters she initiates will be almost exclusively with her extrapair partner , so that sex with her highly symmetrical affair partner will be concentrated during the fertile phase of her menstrual cycle .
In this way , the above three adaptations can conspire under circumstances of sexual dissatisfaction in marriage to produce a pattern of behavior that appears to be the direct result of an adaptation specifically for short - term infidelity .
So the available evidence does n’t provide convincing support for the claim that women have an evolved psychological mechanism specifically for strategic infidelity .
His Sexual Jealousy
According to Buss , jealousy is a psychological adaptation , an emotional alarm that is designed to go off whenever we detect signs of a partner ’s potential infidelity and to mobilize us to avoid or minimize our reproductive losses .
I believe that this hypothesis is one of EP ’s significant contributions to our understanding of the human mind .
But Buss does n’t stop here .
He further argues that , since men and women faced different threats to reproductive interests throughout human evolutionary history , the sexes have evolved distinct jealousy mechanisms , which “ contain dedicated design features , each corresponding to the specific sex - linked adaptive problems that have recurred over thousands of generations of human evolutionary history ” ( Buss et al. , 1999 , p. 126 ) .
It is a woman ’s sexual infidelity , Buss argues , that threatens a man ’s reproductive interests by undermining his confidence in paternity and putting him at risk of investing his resources in another man ’s offspring .
A woman ’s reproductive interests , in contrast , are threatened by a male ’s emotional involvement with another woman , since that potentially entails a loss of his resources .
Thus , Buss hypothesizes , women ’s jealousy “ is triggered by cues to the possible diversion of their mate ’s investment to another woman , whereas men ’s jealousy is triggered primarily by cues to the possible diversions of their mate ’s sexual favors to another man . ” 21
box 1
To test for a sex difference in jealousy , Buss and his colleagues ( 1992 ) designed the following questionnaire .
This questionnaire , or a minor variant of it , was then administered to subjects in six societies .
Instructions :
Please think of a serious committed romantic relationship that you have had in the past , that you currently have , or that you would like to have .
Imagine that you discover that the person with whom you ’ve been seriously involved became interested in someone else .
What would distress or upset you more ( please circle only one ) : Dilemma 1
(A) Imagining your partner forming a deep emotional attachment to that person [ emotional infidelity ] .
( B) Imagining your partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with that other person [ sexual infidelity ] .
Dilemma 2
(A) Imagining your partner trying different sexual positions with that other person [ sexual infidelity ] .
( B) Imagining your partner falling in love with that other person [ emotional infidelity ] .
The principal data that Buss cites in support of this theory are responses to forced - choice questionnaires that have been administered in six cultures ( Box 1 ) .
These data show that significantly more men than women report that the thought of a partner ’s sexual infidelity is more distressing than the thought of a partner ’s extrapair emotional involvement .
In no study did more women than men report sexual infidelity to be more upsetting than emotional infidelity .
Indeed , on average , across all studies , many more men than women reported sexual infidelity to be more upsetting than emotional infidelity — 51 % of the men versus 22 % of the women in response to Dilemma 1 ( Table 1 ) , and 38 % of the men versus 13 % of the women in response to Dilemma 2 ( Table 2 ) .
table 1 : percentage choosing ( B ) sexual infidelity as more upsetting in Dilemma 1 ( by survey sample ) Survey sample USA USA USA USA USA USA ( Buss et al. 1992 ) 28 ( Buss et al. 1999 ) 22 ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( DeSteno & Salovey 1996a ) 29 ( Geary et al. 1995 ) 54 ( Pietrzak et al. 2002 ) 55 Male 60 76 61 55 53 73 Female 17 32 18 32 23 4 Survey sample China Netherlands Germany Korea Japan Average ( Geary et al. 1995 ) 54 ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( Buss et al. 1999 ) 22 ( Buss et al .
1999 ) 22 Male 21 51 28 59 38 51 Female 5 31 16 18 13 22
But these results do n’t actually confirm Buss ’s theory .
Buss claims that male jealousy will “ focus on cues to sexual infidelity because a long - term partner ’s sexual infidelity jeopardizes his certainty of paternity , ” whereas female jealousy will focus on cues to emotional infidelity because of potential loss of parental resources .
22
To confirm Buss ’s theory , it ’s necessary to confirm these predictions — to confirm , for example , that males care more about sexual infidelity than they do about emotional infidelity , not simply that they care more about sexual infidelity than females do .
But the data do not show this .
Indeed , on average , only half of male subjects chose sexual infidelity as more distressing than emotional infidelity in response to Dilemma 1 ( Table 1 ) , and a full 62 % chose emotional infidelity over sexual infidelity in response to Dilemma 2 ( Table 2 ) .
table 2 : percentage choosing ( A ) sexual infidelity as more upsetting in Dilemma 2 ( by survey sample ) Survey sample USA USA USA USA ( Buss et al. 1992 ) 28 ( Buss et al. 1999 ) 22 ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( Harris & Christenfeld 1996a ) 29 Male 44 43 44 47 Female 12 11 12 12 Survey sample Netherlands Germany Korea Japan Average ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( Buunk et al. 1996 ) 31 ( Buss et al. 1999 ) 22 ( Buss et al .
1999 ) 22 Male 23 30 53 32 38 Female 12 8 22 15 13
Moreover , there are some anomalous data for which Buss ’s theory can’t easily account .
First , there is significant cultural variation in the questionnaire results .
While the percentages of males reporting sexual infidelity to be more upsetting than emotional infidelity in response to Dilemma 1 are as high as 76 % in a U.S. sample and 59 % in the Korean sample , they are as low as 21 % in the Chinese sample and 28 % in the German sample ( Table 1 ) .
Similarly , although the percentages of males selecting sexual infidelity in response to Dilemma 2 are as high as 47 % in a U.S. sample and 53 % in the Korean sample , they are as low as 23 % in the Dutch sample and 30 % in the German sample ( Table 2 ) .
These low - side outliers hardly support Buss ’ claim that male jealousy is focused on cues of sexual infidelity and that this is true “ across cultures . ”
23
Second , the results of three studies in which the infidelity dilemmas were administered to homosexual men are difficult to reconcile with Buss ’s claim that there is a sex difference in the evolved “ design features ” of the psychological mechanisms of jealousy .
In one study , only 24 % of homosexual men chose sexual infidelity as more upsetting than emotional infidelity in Dilemma 1 , and only 5 % chose sexual infidelity as more upsetting in Dilemma 2.24
Another study administered only Dilemma 2 to a sample of homosexual men , of whom only 13 % chose sexual infidelity as more upsetting than emotional infidelity .
25 Finally , when both dilemmas were administered to both homosexual and heterosexual men and women , it was found that homosexual men were even less upset by sexual infidelity than were heterosexual women .
26
Third , the psychologist Christine Harris found that , although heterosexual males who were asked to imagine their partners ’ having sex with another male showed greater physiological arousal than those who were asked to imagine their partners ’ forming an emotional attachment to another man , males who were asked to imagine having sex with their own partners showed just as great a physiological arousal as those imagining being cuckolded .
27 Indeed , Harris found that there was no significant difference between the one group ’s physiological arousal in response to imagined sexual infidelity and the other group ’s physiological arousal in response to imagined sexual intercourse .
This indicates that the results obtained by Buss and his colleagues are confounded by the fact that males become more aroused by imagining events with sexual content , in general , than by imagining events with emotional content .
And this is something that Buss himself has admitted would undermine his theory .
28
I believe that a more minimal hypothesis concerning the nature of our evolved jealousy mechanism can better account for the data .
I call it the relationship jeopardy hypothesis , according to which both sexes have the same evolved capacity to learn to distinguish threatening from nonthreatening extrapair involvements and to experience jealousy to a degree that is proportional to the perceived threat to a relationship in which one has invested mating effort .
This same capacity leads to a common sex difference in how infidelities are viewed , however , because the sexes acquire different beliefs about opposite - sex sexual strategies .
So the standard sex difference is a product of typical differences in the information believed by the sexes , not of a sex difference in the design of the mechanisms that process that information .
Consider how the relationship jeopardy hypothesis accounts for the data .
According to the relationship jeopardy hypothesis , the sexes differ in their acquired beliefs about infidelity , and a series of studies found precisely that .
29
These studies found that men believe that , for women , sex implies love more than love implies sex and that women believe that , for men , love implies sex more than sex implies love .
The most dramatic finding was that women believe that it is not that likely that a man ’s having sex with a woman implies any kind of emotional involvement with her .
Given these beliefs , men should find sexual infidelities more distressing than women because a female ’s sexual infidelity signals a potential threat to a relationship ( via the likely combination with an emotional involvement ) that is greater than the potential threat signaled by a male ’s sexual infidelity ( which is likely not accompanied by an emotional involvement ) .
Moreover , as we saw earlier , women having extramarital sex are far more likely to be dissatisfied in their marriages than unfaithful men.30
So , even in the absence of an accompanying emotional involvement , a woman ’s sexual infidelity is threatening because it signals dissatisfaction in the relationship in a way that a man ’s sexual infidelity does not .
Thus , if both sexes have the same evolved capacity to distinguish threatening from nonthreatening infidelities and respond accordingly , we should expect men to find emotional infidelities very threatening , but we should also expect men to find sexual infidelities more threatening to a relationship than women find them .
And Buss ’s questionnaire results show both effects .
In addition , if the relationship jeopardy hypothesis is correct , if there are cultural differences in the degree to which sexual infidelity is correlated with desertion , then the members of a culture in which there is a weaker correlation between sexual infidelity and desertion should be less bothered by sexual infidelity than the members of a culture in which the correlation is stronger .
Interestingly , Buss and his colleagues noted that the German and Dutch “ cultures have more relaxed attitudes about sexuality , including extramarital sex , than does the American culture , ” and that in the Netherlands “ a majority feels extramarital sexual relationships are acceptable under certain circumstances .
” 31 Accordingly , German and Dutch males should be less likely than American males to assume that a female partner ’s sexual infidelity portends desertion , and consequently they should be less distressed by sexual infidelity than American males .
And , on average , 61 % of American males chose sexual infidelity as more distressing than emotional infidelity in response to Dilemma 1 ( Table 1 ) , and 44 % chose sexual infidelity in Dilemma 2 ( Table 2 ) .
In contrast , on average , only 40 % of German and Dutch males chose sexual infidelity in Dilemma 1 ( Table 1 ) , and only 26 % chose sexual infidelity in Dilemma 2 ( Table 2 ) .
Finally , when homosexual and heterosexual men and women were asked their beliefs about relationships and infidelity , the only significant correlation that emerged was between degree of distress over sexual infidelity and the belief that sexual infidelity indicated likely abandonment .
32
All subjects — whether men or women , whether homosexual or heterosexual — were far more likely to be distressed by an imagined sexual infidelity if they believed that sexual infidelity portends the end of a relationship .
Further , heterosexual males were by far the most likely to believe that a sexual infidelity is a likely precursor to abandonment .
Women , both homosexual and heterosexual , were far more likely than heterosexual men to “ discount ” a sexual infidelity as nonthreatening to a relationship , and homosexual men were even more likely than women to discount a sexual infidelity as nonthreatening .
If these beliefs were processed by the mechanism postulated by the relationship jeopardy hypothesis , it would generate precisely the pattern of questionnaire responses from heterosexual men and women Buss found , but also the responses of homosexual men discussed earlier .
Thus , not only is there not good evidence of Buss ’s hypothesized sex difference in the “ design features ” of the jealous mind , but Buss ’s hypothesis does n’t easily account for a variety of data .
In contrast , a simpler hypothesis , according to which there is no sex difference in the “ design features ” of the mind , but only in the beliefs typically acquired by the sexes , better explains all the data .
His Abuse of Her Children
One of the “ discoveries ” that Pinker and Buss frequently tout as a signature achievement of EP is the finding , by Martin Daly and Margo Wilson , that children who live with stepparents are at a greater risk of maltreatment than children who live with both genetic parents .
33
An evolutionary perspective on human psychology should lead us to expect this , Daly and Wilson argue , because “ parental investment is a precious resource , and selection must favor those parental psyches that do not squander it on nonrelatives . ”
34
Daly and Wilson hypothesize that motivational mechanisms of parental love have evolved to be triggered by ( genetic ) offspring during a “ critical period . ”
Once triggered , parental love serves as “ inhibition against the use of dangerous tactics in conflict with the child .
” 35 Since these evolved mechanisms of parental love , which inhibit violence , are n’t triggered in substitute ( nongenetic ) parents , “ angry lapses of parental solicitude ” in conflictual situations more frequently elicit “ the use of dangerous tactics ” from substitute parents than from genetic parents .
36 This leads Daly and Wilson to what they call “ the most obvious prediction from a Darwinian view of parental motives ” : “ Substitute parents will generally tend to care less profoundly for children than natural parents , with the result that children reared by people other than their natural parents will be more often exploited and otherwise at risk .
” 37
In particular , since stepparenthood is the most common form of substitute parenthood , Daly and Wilson expect stepchildren to be at greater risk than genetic children .
Even more particularly , since at least 80 % of children living in stepfamilies live with a stepfather and a genetic mother ,38 Daly and Wilson expect that this elevated risk to stepchildren is due to maltreatment at the hands of stepfathers .
39
Daly and Wilson cite several studies as confirmation of this prediction , but most provide only indirect evidence , since they lacked important controls .
The best direct evidence for this prediction is Daly and Wilson ’s landmark 1985 study of 99 cases of child maltreatment in the municipality of Hamilton - Wentworth in Ontario , Canada , during a one - year period from 1982 to 1983.40 Daly and Wilson found that children under the age of five who lived with a genetic parent and a stepparent were 40.1 times more likely to be victims of maltreatment than same - aged children who lived with both genetic parents ( Table 3 ) .
The relative risk to stepchildren aged five and up dropped sharply , and even sharper for stepchildren aged eleven and up , but in all age groups children living with a genetic parent and a stepparent were at a significantly greater risk of becoming victims of maltreatment than children living with both genetic parents .
table 3 : maltreatment risk for children living with a stepparent and a genetic parent , relative to children living with both genetic parents , by child ’s age ( Hamilton - Wentworth , 1982 – 1983 ) .
Child ’s age when maltreated 0 – 4 yrs. 5 –10 yrs. 11 –17 yrs .
Times a child with one stepparent is more likely to be maltreated compared to those with both genetic parents 40.1 19.4 9.8
There are , however , three shortcomings of Daly and Wilson ’s study .
First , Daly and Wilson ’s sample consisted of 99 cases of maltreatment , which included not only physical abuse ( inflicted injury ) , but 21 cases of sexual abuse and an unreported number of “ unintentional omissions ” considered neglect by a child welfare professional .
But sexual abuse and physical abuse appear to be distinct phenomena with distinct etiologies .
Indeed , intrafamilial child sexual abuse is rarely accompanied by physical abuse , 41 so it does n’t consist in “ the use of dangerous tactics in conflict with the child . ”
Moreover , in the U.S. , the class of “ unintentional omissions ” often includes allowing truancy and failing to secure a child with a seat belt .

These also do n’t involve “ the use of dangerous tactics in conflict ” situations .
Since Daly and Wilson claim that stepchildren are at greater risk because the “ inhibition against the use of dangerous tactics in conflict ” is not triggered in stepparents , cases of maltreatment that do n’t involve the use of dangerous tactics in conflict do n’t belong in the sample against which to test their prediction .
If we want to understand the “ lapses of parental love ” that result in “ the use of dangerous tactics in conflict with the child , ” as Daly and Wilson claim , we should explore data regarding physical abuse , rather than the amorphous category of maltreatment , to test whether substitute parents are more physically abusive than genetic parents .
In order to test Daly and Wilson ’s prediction against a much larger and far more representative sample of cases of physical abuse , Elliott Smith , the Associate Director of the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect , and I analyzed child abuse data compiled in the Third National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect ( NIS - 3 ) .
We found that children under the age of five living in a stepfamily were 8.2 times more likely to be physically abused than same - aged children living with both genetic parents ( Table 4 ) , which is drastically lower than the 40 - times - greater risk of maltreatment that Daly and Wilson found .
And children aged five and above who lived in a stepfamily were only 3.3 times more likely to be physically abused than same - aged children living with both genetic parents .
table 4 : rates of physical abuse ( per thousand children ) by household composition , NIS - 3 ( United States , 1993 ) Child ’s age when maltreated 0 – 4 yrs.
5 –10 yrs. 11 –17 yrs .
Overall Rate of abuse per 1,000 for two genetic parents 1.7 3.2 3.1 2.7
Rate of abuse per 1,000 for one genetic parent plus one stepparent 13.9 10.2 10.5 10.7
While not as dramatic as Daly and Wilson ’s findings , these results nonetheless appear to confirm Daly and Wilson ’s prediction .
But this brings us to the second methodological shortcoming of Daly and Wilson ’s study .
Daly and Wilson ’s data concern the risk of maltreatment to children living in households of varying parental composition , rather than a child ’s risk of being maltreated by a stepparent or genetic parent .
That is , Daly and Wilson ’s data do n’t identify the perpetrators of maltreatment , even though their hypothesis predicts that stepfathers will be disproportionately represented among perpetrators .
Since the NIS - 3 data identified perpetrators , they allow a more direct test of Daly and Wilson ’s prediction , and those data yield two surprises .
First , in a clear anomaly for Daly and Wilson ’s hypothesis , single genetic fathers were actually 1.7 times more likely than stepfathers to physically abuse their children ( Table 5 ) .
Second , the data on physical abuse of children living with a genetic mother and a stepfather show that genetic mothers are involved in a significant portion of that abuse , either acting alone or in concert with the stepfather ( Table 6 ) .
table 5 : rates of physical abuse ( per thousand children ) by a father acting alone , NIS - 3 ( United States , 1993 ) Child ’s age when maltreated 0 – 4 yrs.
5 –10 yrs. 11 –17 yrs .
Overall Parents in household genetic father only 19.8 9.8 10.1 11.4 Parents in household genetic mother plus stepfather 11.1 7.1 6.1 6.8
table 6 : rates of physical abuse ( per thousand children ) in genetic mother - stepfather households , NIS - 3 ( United States , 1993 ) Child ’s age when maltreated 0 – 4 yrs.
5 –10 yrs. 11 –17 yrs .
Overall Perpetrator : genetic mother acting alone 1.6 0.8 1.9 1.5 Perpetrator : stepfather acting alone 11.1 7.1 6.1 6.8 Perpetrator : both parents 4.8 1.9 3.8 3.2
Nonetheless , children who were abused by a parent acting alone were 4.5 times more likely to be abused by their stepfather than by their genetic mother ( Table 6 ) , and this does appear to confirm Daly and Wilson ’s prediction .
But this brings us to the third of the methodological shortcomings of Daly and Wilson ’s study , which is a shortcoming of our NIS - 3 study as well .
Daly and Wilson ’s sample and the NIS - 3 sample consisted entirely of officially reported cases of child maltreatment — that is , cases of maltreatment that were brought to the attention of a professional who worked in a capacity concerned with child welfare , were investigated in some way by that professional or others to whom the cases were referred , and were determined to be genuine cases of child maltreatment by the investigators .
But some family violence researchers have pointed out that child welfare professionals sometimes take the presence of a stepparent in the household into consideration in deciding whether a bruise or broken bone resulted from an accident or abuse .
43
That is , many child welfare professionals take the presence of a stepparent in a household to be partly diagnostic of maltreatment .
So , Gelles and Harrop argue , “ injuries to children with non-genetic parents are more likely to be diagnosed and reported as abuse . ” 44 As a result , official case reports of child maltreatment may contain a bias against stepparents , which distorts the facts concerning the relative rates of maltreatment by stepparents and genetic parents .
Daly and Wilson are fully aware of the potentially confounding effects of diagnostic bias on their studies , but they dismiss it with the following single argument : “ If reporting or detection biases were responsible for the overrepresentation of stepparents among child abusers , then we would expect the bias , and hence the overrepresentation , to diminish as we focused upon increasingly severe and unequivocal maltreatment up to the extreme of fatal batterings . ” 45 “ At the limit , ” they argue , “ we can be reasonably confident that child murders are usually detected and recorded .
” 46 When Daly and Wilson examined “ validated ” cases of child homicide in America47 and cases of child homicide in Canada that were “ known to Canadian police , ” 48 they found that stepchildren were far more likely to be victims of fatal maltreatment than children living with both genetic parents .
Thus , Daly and Wilson conclude that comparable findings regarding non-fatal maltreatment are not confounded by a reporting bias against stepparents .
There is substantial evidence , however , that “ validated ” child homicides and those “ known to police ” are but a partial record of child maltreatment fatalities in the United States , and there is little reason for doubting that Canada is similar in this regard .
Indeed , when review boards undertook comprehensive studies of up to nine sources of information about each child fatality in four U.S. states , they consistently found that only 40 – 50 % of all identifiable child maltreatment fatalities , including inflicted injury fatalities , were coded as maltreatment fatalities on death certificates or in police records .
49
The remainder were coded as accidental deaths or , more commonly , deaths due to an “ undetermined manner . ”
More importantly , analysis of Colorado records revealed direct evidence of a potential diagnostic bias against “ stepfathers .
” 50 For maltreatment fatalities at the hands of “ other relatives , ” which included legally married stepfathers , were 1.37 times more likely to be recorded as maltreatment fatalities on death certificates than were maltreatment fatalities perpetrated by genetic parents .
Moreover , maltreatment fatalities at the hands of “ other unrelated ” individuals , which included “ live - in boyfriends ” of victims ’ mothers , were 8.71 times more likely to be recorded as such on death certificates than maltreatment fatalities at the hands of genetic parents .
This last fact is particularly important for two reasons .
First , Daly and Wilson classified “ live - in boyfriends ” as stepfathers ( as did Smith and I ) .51 Second , in the Canadian filicide data mentioned above , Daly and Wilson found that “ common -law ” stepfathers accounted for a full 89 % of the filicides that were attributed to stepfathers in police records .
52 Thus , “ common - law ” stepfathers , who almost single - handedly accounted for the higher rate of filicide among stepfathers in Daly and Wilson ’s study , were in a group that is 8.71 times more likely than genetic parents to have a perpetrated child maltreatment fatality actually identified as a maltreatment fatality in official records .
If , as Daly and Wilson argue , the effects of any reporting bias should be less in cases of fatal maltreatment than in cases of non-fatal abuse , this degree of reporting bias in U.S. cases of fatal maltreatment implies a higher degree of reporting bias in cases of non-fatal abuse , which is then more than sufficient to account for the overrepresentation of stepchildren in the NIS - 3 data ( Table 4 ) .
So , available evidence indicates that American physical abuse data are sufficiently confounded by reporting bias that they ca n’t confirm Daly and Wilson ’s hypothesis , and there is little reason to think that the Canadian records are immune to this problem .
Since all of our evidence to date concerning stepparental abuse derives from official case reports , we simply do n’t know whether stepparents are more likely than genetic parents to abuse their children .
Daly and Wilson ’s claim that stepparents are more likely than genetic parents to abuse their children goes beyond the available reliable evidence .
Conclusion
I ’ve argued that some of the principal pieces of evidence cited in support of three of Evolutionary Psychology ’s highly publicized “ discoveries ” in fact fail to establish EP ’s claims .
And I argue in Adapting Minds that other evidence cited in support of these “ discoveries ” suffers similar evidentiary problems .
EP ’s other “ discoveries ” enjoy no better empirical support .
For example , I argue in Adapting Minds that the evidence fails to establish Buss ’s claims about evolved mate preferences ( that males are fixated on nubility , while females are fixated on nobility ) and Cosmides ’ claim that we have an evolved module for detecting cheaters in social exchanges .
53 Although EP is a bold and innovative explanatory paradigm , it has not provided convincing evidence for its claims about the nature and evolution of human psychology .
We really do n’t yet know how to understand human psychology from an evolutionary perspective .
Perhaps some day we will achieve that understanding , but that day is not at hand .
Coming to terms with the shortcomings of Evolutionary Psychology , however , may help us eventually achieve a new and improved evolutionary psychology .

If there is a creature more fickle than your typical four - year - old , it ’s hard to think of one offhand .
One day they ’re buttoning their own shirts and uttering words of ancient wisdom , and the next they ’re pooping on the living room floor because monsters have invaded the bathroom .
They are immune to logic and can barely sit still long enough to nibble a chicken nugget .
In a nutshell , “ standardized ” and “ preschooler ” are not words you ’d normally use in the same sentence .
President George W. Bush seemed to agree when , in July 2003 , he took a field trip to a Head Start program in Landover , Maryland , to publicize an initiative aimed at reshaping the popular federal preschool program for poor kids .
“ We want Head Start to set higher ambitions , ” Bush told the assembled children .
He stressed the need for “ accountability , ” while noting , “ I fully understand a four - year - old child is not going to take a standardized test .
That would be absurd . ”
But not too absurd for the administration to roll out precisely such a test a few months later .
Known as the National Reporting System ( nrs ) , it was to be given twice a year to 450,000 four - and five - year - olds in 1,700 Head Start programs around the country .
Much as with Bush ’s broader education reform , the No Child Left Behind Act , the goal was to compare programs and intervene in those that did poorly , possibly by cutting off their federal funding .
And as with nclb , the initiative set off alarm bells in many quarters .
“ You ca n’t test four - year - old kids — it ’s unreliable , ” says Dr. Edward Zigler , a.k.a. “ the father of Head Start , ” a psychology professor and codirector of the Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University .
“ Some of the kids ’ response was to pee their pants . ”
Four years and $ 100 million later , the nrs is on the chopping block , the data it produced are unusable , according to government investigators , and the official in charge of implementing Bush ’s accountability agenda has left amid charges that she defrauded her own Head Start program in Texas .
One of the best - known remnants of Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society , Head Start is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( hhs ) , and thus has a social - service bent as much as an education agenda ; at one stage , the program actually discouraged the teaching of literacy skills .
That ’s why , despite its many purported public benefits — everything from reduced crime rates to lower Medicaid spending —
Head Start has long drawn fire from conservative critics .
People such as former Assistant Secretary of Education Diane Ravitch argue that it does little more than provide government jobs for welfare mothers .
( Many of the teachers are Head Start parents . )
Still , Republican and Democratic presidents alike have expanded the program .
Not so George W. Bush .
Billed as a major component of the administration ’s domestic agenda , his Head Start plan involved slashing the budget and shifting its administration to the states , which would be free to eliminate most of the program ’s social - service elements .
Zigler says conservative thinkers told him , “ ‘ If we could bring Head Start down , we could bring down any government program . ’
It ’s symbolic for them . ”
Overseeing Bush ’s changes was Wade Horn , the assistant secretary for children and families ( and the former head of the conservative National Fatherhood Initiative who had once suggested that federal benefits such as Head Start should only be available to children of married couples ) .
To run Head Start itself , the White House picked Windy Hill , a Texas woman who had been tangentially involved with Laura Bush ’s literacy - promotion efforts in Texas .
A Head Start graduate whose child has also been in the program , Hill spent much of her three - year tenure publicly railing against mismanagement in local preschools , and her office looked for any reason to penalize a Head Start program , citing them for such infractions as “ leaving unraked leaves on a playground . ”
As it turned out , Hill knew a thing or two about mismanagement : Federal investigators eventually discovered that the Head Start program Hill ran in Texas had doled out thousands of dollars in contracts to her family members and dubious reimbursements to Hill herself .
She ’d even written herself a $ 7,000 bonus from the Texas program ’s coffers after she took the helm of Head Start in Washington .
( Hill , now working at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission , did not return a call for comment ; hhs officials also did not respond to calls and emails . )
The test Hill and Horn rushed into the field in 2003 was hardly a masterpiece of scientific assessment .
Shay Gurry , an education coordinator for St. Jerome ’s Head Start in Baltimore , remembers a kid who was asked over and over to pick out a picture of a knight ; finally she erupted , “ There ’s no moon , so there ’s no night ! ”
Another , asked how many books would be left if you had three and gave one to a friend , explained , “ I do n’t have any friends . ”
Forced to sit still for 20 to 45 minutes at a stretch , kids would start giving random answers just so they could go out and play .
Teachers were also not allowed to give feedback , no matter how often a child asked if she ’d gotten an answer right .
Though nearly two - thirds of Head Start ’s students are black or Hispanic , most of the human figures in the test were white ; Latino kids , who make up more than one - third of the program ’s student body , could not take the test in Spanish unless they ’d first flunked an English screening version .
And according to a 2006 study by Mathematica Policy Research , a contractor hired by the federal government to evaluate the test administration , many of the people testing kids in Spanish either did n’t know the language particularly well or could n’t read it .
Nicholas Zill , vice president at Westat , the contractor that designed the test , says such criticisms have been overblown .
Parts of the assessment , he notes , have long been used by child psychologists .
“ This is not a test of individual kids , ” he says .
“ It ’s a test of the program and progress .
The test is working as it was designed to . ”
Wade Horn , who left hhs in April , concedes that the test is “ a work in progress . ”
But he says he never planned to let it be used , as critics suspect , to undermine Head Start .
“ I ’m a big fan of Head Start , ” he says , “ because it embodies the very important idea that no children should be disadvantaged because of their birth . ”
He says administrators needed better data so they could direct extra technical assistance money to the programs that most needed it .
For that purpose , however , the data was essentially useless , according to a 2005 study by the federal Government Accountability Office , which found the test to be flawed and unreliable .
Last fall , Congress voted to kill the testing program ; until the very last minute the administration was proceeding with ( and spending money on ) another round of testing , planned for this spring .
It ’s an ignominious end , says Yale ’s Zigler , for an initiative that in someone else ’s hands might have wrought some good .
“ Head Start spends $ 7 billion a year , ” he notes .
“ Taxpayers and Congress have the right to know whether it ’s working .
But there can be good accountability and lousy accountability . ”

Tomgram : Do We Already Have Our Pentagon Papers ?
Bush 's Pentagon Papers
The Urge to Confess
By Tom Engelhardt
They can't help themselves .
They want to confess .
How else to explain the torture memorandums that continue to flow out of the inner sancta of this administration , the most recent of which were evidently leaked to the New York Times .
Those two , from the Alberto Gonzales Justice Department , were written in 2005 and recommitted the administration to the torture techniques it had been pushing for years .
As the Times noted , the first of those memorandums , from February of that year , was " an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency . "
The second " secret opinion " was issued as Congress moved to outlaw " cruel , inhuman , and degrading " treatment ( not that such acts were n't already against U.S. and international law ) .
It brazenly " declared that none of the C.I.A. interrogation methods violated that standard " ; and , the Times assured us , " the 2005 Justice Department opinions remain in effect , and their legal conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent memorandums . "
All of these memorandums , in turn , were written years after John Yoo 's infamous " torture memo " of August 2002 and a host of other grim documents on detention , torture , and interrogation had already been leaked to the public , along with graphic FBI emailed observations of torture and abuse at Guantanamo , those " screen savers " from Abu Ghraib , and so much other incriminating evidence .
In other words , in early 2005 when that endorsement of " the harshest interrogation techniques " was being written , its authors could hardly have avoided knowing that it , too , would someday become part of the public record .
But , it seems , they could n't help themselves .
Torture , along with repetitious , pretzled " legal " justifications for doing so , were bones that administration officials -- from the President , Vice President , and Secretary of Defense on down -- just could n't resist gnawing on again and again .
So , what we 're dealing with is an obsession , a fantasy of empowerment , utterly irrational in its intensity , that 's gripped this administration .
None of the predictable we 're shocked !
we 're shocked !
editorial responses to the Times latest revelations begin to account for this .
Torture as the Royal Road to Commander - in - Chief Power
So let 's back up a moment and consider the nature of the torture controversy in these last years .
In a sense , the Bush administration has confronted a strange policy conundrum .
Its compulsive urge to possess the power to detain without oversight and to wield torture as a tool of interrogation has led it , however unexpectedly , into what can only be called a confessional stance .
The result has been what it feared most : the creation of an exhausting , if not exhaustive , public record of the criminal inner thinking of the most secretive administration in our history .
Let 's recall that , in the wake of the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the administration 's top officials had an overpowering urge to " take the gloves off " ( instructions sent from Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld 's office directly to the Afghan battlefield ) , to " unshackle " the CIA .
They were in a rush to release a commander - in - chief " unitary executive , " untrammeled by the restrictions they associated with the fall of President Richard Nixon and with the Watergate era .
They wanted to abrogate the Geneva Conventions ( parts of which Alberto Gonzales , then White House Council and companion - in- arms to the President , declared " quaint " and " obsolete " in 2002 ) .
They were eager to develop their own categories of imprisonment that freed them from all legal constraints , as well as their own secret , offshore prison system in which their power would be total .
All of this went to the heart of their sense of entitlement , their belief that such powers were their political birthright .
The last thing they wanted to do was have this all happen in secret and with full deniability .
Thus , Guantanamo .
That prison complex was to be the public face of their right to do anything .
Perched on an American base in Cuba just beyond the reach of The Law -- American - leased but not court - overseen soil -- the new prison was to be the proud symbol of their expansive power .
It was also to be the public face of a new , secret regime of punishment that would quickly spread around the world -- into the torture chambers of despotic regimes in places like Egypt and Syria , onto American bases like the island fastness of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , onto U.S. Navy and other ships floating in who knew which waters , into the former prisons of the old Soviet Empire , and into a growing network of American detention centers in Afghanistan and Iraq .
So , when those first shots of prisoners , in orange jumpsuits , manacled and blindfolded , entering Guantanamo were released , no one officially howled ( though the grim , leaked shots of those prisoners being transported to Guantanamo were another matter ) .
After all , they wanted the world to know just how powerful this administration was -- powerful enough to redefine the terms of detention , imprisonment , and interrogation to the point of committing acts that traditionally were abhorred and ruled illegal by humanity and by U.S. law ( even if sometimes committed anyway ) .
Though certain administration officials undoubtedly believed that " harsh interrogation techniques " would produce reliable information , this can't account for the absolute fascination with torture that gripped them , as well as assorted pundits and talking heads ( and then , through " 24 " and other TV shows and movies , Americans in general ) .
In search of a world where they could do anything , they reached instinctively for torture as a symbol .
After all , was there any more striking way to remove those " gloves " or " unshackle " a presidency ?
If you could stake a claim the right to torture , then you could stake a claim to do just about anything .
Think of it this way :
If Freud believed that dreams were the royal road to the individual unconscious , then the top officials of the Bush administration believed torture to be the royal road to their ultimate dream of unconstrained power , what John Yoo in his " torture memo " referred to as " the Commander - in - Chief Power . "
It was via Guantanamo that they meant to announce the arrival of this power on planet Earth .
They were proud of it .
And that prison complex was to function as their bragging rights .
Their message was clear enough :
In this world of ours , democracy would indeed run rampant and a vote of one would , in every case , be considered a majority .
The Crimes Are in the Definitions
This , then , was one form of confession -- a much desired one .
George W. Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and their subordinates ( with few exceptions ) wished to affirm their position as directors of the planet 's " sole superpower , " intent as they were on creating a Pentagon - led Pax Americana abroad and a Rovian Pax Republicana at home .
But there was another , seldom noted form of confession at work .
As if to fit their expansive sense of their own potential powers , it seems that these officials , and the corps of lawyers that accompanied them , had expansive , gnawing fears .
Given this cast of characters , you can't talk about a collective " guilty conscience , " but there was certainly an ongoing awareness that what they were doing contravened normal American and global standards of legality ; that their acts , when it came to detention and torture , might be judged illegal ; and that those who committed -- or ordered -- such acts might someday , somehow , actually be brought before a court of law to account for them .
These fears , by the way , were usually pinned on low - level operatives and interrogators , who were indeed fearful of the obvious : that they had no legal leg to stand on when it came to kidnapping terror suspects , disappearing them , and subjecting them to a remarkably wide range of acts of torture and abuse , often in deadly combination over long periods of time .
Perhaps Bush 's men ( and women ) feared that even a triumphantly successful commander - in - chief presidency might -- à la the Pinochet regime in Chile -- have its limits in time .
Perhaps they simply sensed an essential contradiction that lay at the very heart of their position :
The urge to take pride in their " accomplishments , " to assert their powers , and to claim bragging rights for redefining what was legal could also be seen as the urge to confess ( if matters took a wrong turn as , in the case of the Bush administration , they always have ) .
And so , along with the pride , along with the kidnappings , the new - style imprisonment , the acts of torture ( and , in some cases , murder ) , the pretzled documents began to pour out of the administration -- each a tortured extremity of bizarre legalisms ( as with Yoo 's August 2002 document , which essentially managed to reposition torture as something that existed mainly in the mind of , and could only be defined by , the torturer himself ) ; each was but another example of legalisms following upon and directed by desire .
( Yoo himself was reportedly known by Attorney General John Ashcroft as Dr. Yes , " for his seeming eagerness to give the White House whatever legal justifications it desired . " )
Each , in the end , might also be read as a confession of wrongdoing .
What made all this so strange was not just the " tortured " nature of the " torture memo " ( just rejected by the new attorney general nominee as " worse than a sin , it was a mistake " ) , but the repetitious nature of these dismantling documents which , with the help of an army of leakers inside the government , have been making their way into public view for years .
Or how about the strange situation of an American president , who has , in so many backhanded ways , admitted to being deeply involved in the issues of detainment and torture -- as , for instance , in a February 7 , 2002 memorandum to his top officials in which he signed off on his power to " suspend [ the ] Geneva [ Conventions ] as between the United States and Afghanistan " ( which he then declined to do " at this time " ) and his right to wipe out the Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War when it came to al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
That document began with the following : " Our recent extensive discussions regarding the status of al Qaeda and Taliban detainees confirm "
" Our recent extensive discussions "
You wo n't find that often in previous presidential documents about the abrogation of international and domestic law .
It was n't , of course , that the U.S. had never imprisoned anyone abroad and certainly not that the U.S. had never used torture abroad .
Water - boarding , for instance , was first employed by U.S. soldiers in the Philippine Insurrection at the dawn of the previous century ; torture was widely used and taught by CIA and other American operatives in Vietnam in the 1960s and 1970s , as well as in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s , and elsewhere .
But American presidents did n't then see the bragging rights in such acts , any more than a previous American president would have sent his vice president to Capitol Hill to lobby openly for torture ( however labeled ) .
Past presidents held on to the considerable benefits of deniability ( and perhaps the psychological benefits of not knowing too much themselves ) .
They did n't regularly and repeatedly commit to paper their " extensive discussions " on distasteful and illegal subjects .
Nor did they get up in public , against all news , all reason ( but based on the fantastic redefinitions of torture created to fulfill a presidential desire to use " harsh interrogation techniques " ) to deny repeatedly that their administrations ever tortured .
Here is an exchange on the subject from Bush 's most recent press conference :
" Q What 's your definition of the word ' torture ' ?
" THE PRESIDENT : Of what ?
" Q
The word ' torture . '
What 's your definition ?
" THE PRESIDENT : That 's defined in U.S. law , and we do n't torture .
" Q Can you give me your version of it , sir ?
" THE PRESIDENT : Whatever the law says . "
After a while , this , too , becomes a form of confession --- that , among other things , the President has never rejected John Yoo 's definition of torture in that 2002 memorandum .
Combine that with the admission of " extensive discussions " on detention matters and , minimally , you have a President , who has proven himself deeply engaged in such subjects .
A President who makes such no - torture claims repeatedly cannot also claim to be in the dark on the subject .
In other words , you 're already moving from the Clintonesque parsing of definitions ( " It depends on what the meaning of the word ' is ' " ) into unfathomable realms of presidential definitional darkness .
On the Record
Of course , plumbing the psychology of a single individual while in office -- of a President or a Vice President -- is a nearly impossible task .
Plumbing the psychology of an administration ?
Who can do it ?
And yet , sometimes officials may essentially do it for you .
They may leave bureaucratic clues everywhere and then , as if seized by an impulsion , return again and again to what can only be termed the scene of the crime .
Documents they just could n't not write .
Acts they just could n't not take .
Think of these as the Freudian slips of officials under pressure .
Think of them as small , repeated confessions granted under the interrogation of reality and history , under the fearful pressure of the future , and granted in the best way possible : willingly , without opposition , and not under torture .
Sometimes , it 's just a matter of refocusing to see the documents , the statements , the acts for what they are .
Such is the case with the torture memos that continue to emerge .
Never has an administration -- and hardly has a torturing regime anywhere -- had so many of its secret documents aired while it was still in the act .
Seldom has a ruling group made such an open case for its own crimes .
We 're talking , of course , about the most secretive administration in American history -- so secretive , in fact , that Congressional representatives considering classified portions of an intelligence bill , have to go to " a secret , secure room in the Capitol , turn in their Blackberrys and cellphones , and read the document without help from any staff members . "
Such briefings are given to Congressional representatives , but under ground rules in which " participants are prohibited from future discussions of the information -- even if it is subsequently revealed in the media "
So representatives who are briefed are also effectively prohibited from discussing what they have learned in Congress .
And yet , none of this mattered when it came to the administration establishing its own record of illegality -- and exhibiting its own outsized fears of future prosecution .
Let 's just take one labor intensive -- and exceedingly strange , if now largely forgotten -- example of these fears in action .
In 2002 , a new tribunal , the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , was established in the Hague to prosecute individuals for genocide , crimes against humanity , and war crimes .
" [ T ] hen - Undersecretary of State John R. Bolton nullified the U.S. signature on the International Criminal Court treaty one month into President Bush 's first term " and Congress subsequently passed the American Servicemembers '
Protection
Act which prohibited " certain types of military aid to countries that have signed on to the International Criminal Court but have not signed a separate accord with the United States , called an Article 98 agreement . "
The Bush administration , opposed to international " fora " of all sorts , then proceeded to go individually , repeatedly , and over years , to more than 100 countries , demanding that the representatives of each sign such an agreement " not to surrender American citizens to the international court without the consent of officials in Washington . "
In other words , they put the sort of effort that might normally have gone into establishing an international agreement into threatening weak countries with the loss of U.S. aid in order to give themselves -- and of course those lower - level soldiers and operatives on whom so much is blamed -- a free pass for crimes yet to be committed ( but which they obviously felt they would commit ) .
We 're talking here about small , impoverished lands like Cambodia , still attempting to bring its own war criminals of the Pol Pot era to justice .
In the process of twisting arms , the administration suspended over $ 47 million in military aid " to 35 countries that ha[d ] not signed deals to grant American soldiers immunity from prosecution for war crimes . "
In this attempt to get every country on the planet aboard the American no - war - crimes - prosecution train before it left the station , you can sense once again the administration 's obsessional intensity on this subject ( especially since experts agreed that the realistic possibility of the ICC bringing Americans up on war crimes was essentially nil ) .
The Bush administration regularly reached for its dictionaries to redefine reality , even before it reached for its guns .
It not only wrote its own rules and its own " law , " but when problems nonetheless emerged from its secret world of detention and pain and would n't go away -- at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and elsewhere -- it proceeded to investigate itself with the expectable results .
For Bush 's officials , this should have seemed like a perfect way to maintain a no - fault system that would never reach up any chain of command .
Indeed , as Mark Danner has commented , such practices plunged us into an age of " frozen scandals " in which , as with the latest torture memos , the shocked - shocked effect repeats itself but nothing follows .
As he has written : " One of the most painful principles of our age is that scandals are doomed to be revealed -- and to remain stinking there before us , unexcised , unpunished , unfinished . "
How true .
And yet , looked at another way , the administration -- with outsized help from outraged government officials who knew crimes when they saw them and were willing to take chances to reveal them -- has already created a remarkable record of its own criminal activity , which can now be purchased in any bookstore in the land .
Back in the early fall of 2004 , when the first collection of such documents arrived in the bookstores , Mark Danner 's Torture and Truth , America , Abu Ghraib , and the War on Terror , it was already more than 600 pages long .
In early 2005 , when Karen J. Greenberg , executive director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law , and Josh Dratel , the civilian defense attorney for Guantanamo detainee David Hicks , released their monumental The Torture Papers , The Road to Abu Ghraib , another collection of secret memoranda , official investigations of Abu Ghraib , and the like , it was already an oversized book of more than 1,200 pages -- a doorstopper large enough to keep a massive prison gate open .
And , of course , even it could n't hold all the documents .
A later Greenberg book , The Torture Debate in America , for instance , has military documents not included in the first volume .
Then , there were the two - years worth of FBI memos and emails about Guantanamo that the ACLU pried loose from the government and released on line , also in 2005 .
This material was damning indeed , including direct reports from FBI agents witnessing -- and protesting as well as pointing fingers at -- military interrogators at the prison , as in an August 2 , 2004 report that said : " On a couple of occasions , I entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor , with no chair , food or waterMost times they had urinated or defecated on themselves , and had been left there for 18 , 24 hours or more . "
Or a Jan. 21 , 2004 email in which an FBI agent complained that the technique of a military interrogator impersonating an FBI agent " and all of those used in these scenarios , was approved by the DepSecDef , " a reference to Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz .
Other paperback volumes have also been published that include selections from these and other documents like Crimes of War : Iraq by Richard Falk , Irene Gendzier , and Robert Jay Lifton and In the Name of Democracy : American War Crimes in Iraq and Beyond by Jeremy Brecher , Jill Cutler , and Brendan Smith .
If all of these documents , including the latest ones evidently in the hands of the New York Times , were collected , you would have a little library of volumes -- all functionally confessional -- for a future prosecutor .
( And there are undoubtedly scads more documents where these came from , including perhaps a John Yoo " torture memo , " rumored to exist , that preceded the August 2002 one . )
What an archive , then , is already available in our world .
It 's as if , to offer a Vietnam comparison , the contents of The Pentagon Papers had simply slipped out into the light of day , one by one , without a Daniel Ellsberg in sight , without anyone quite realizing it had happened .
The urge of any criminal regime -- to ditch , burn , or destroy incriminating documents , or erase emails -- has , in a sense , already been obviated .
So much of the Bush / Cheney " record " is on the record .
As Karen J. Greenberg wrote , back in December 2006 , " What more could a prosecutor want than a trail of implicit confessions , consistent with one another , increasingly brazen over time , and leading right into the Oval Office ? "
Looking back on these last years , it turns out that the President , Vice President , their aides , and the other top officials of this administration were always in the confessional booth .
There 's no exit now .

CHICAGO  A cluster of cramped cubicles , tucked away in a rear corner of Senator Barack Obama ’s campaign headquarters here , serves as the heart of a fund - raising machine that has reshaped the calculus of the 2008 election .
Mr. Obama ’s finance director , Julianna Smoot , who has helped him raise more than $ 150 million so far , does not even have her own office .
A Ping - Pong table is the gathering spot for Friday lunches for her team .
The setting , which has the feel of an Internet start - up , is emblematic of how Mr. Obama , of Illinois , has been able to raise so much money .
On Wednesday , the Obama campaign will report to the Federal Election Commission that it collected $ 36 million in January  $ 4 million more than campaign officials had previously estimated  an unprecedented feat for a single month in American politics that was powered overwhelmingly by small online donations .
That dwarfed the $ 13.5 million in January that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is expected to report Wednesday and the $ 12 million Senator John McCain ’s campaign said he brought in for the month .
Mr. Obama ’s startling success , however , has also now put him on the spot , tempting him to back away from indications he gave last year that he would agree to accept public financing in the general election if the Republican nominee did the same .
The hesitation has given Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee whose advisers concede he would most likely fall far short of Mr. Obama ’s fund - raising for the general election , fodder for a series of attacks .
It ’s about That Language .
All the software fashion slaves will tell you : down on the plantation , Massa ’s new missus is a far - Eastern belle named Ruby .
Herewith Ruby remarks : on the Pickaxe , slickness , language learning , and duckstatic typing .
How I got here was , two recent pieces of writing that made me think heavily were Ruby - centric : Mikael Brockman ’s Continuations on the Web and Sam Ruby ’s Rails Confidence Builder ( there is no truth to the rumor I just made up that either the language or Sam are named for the other ) .
The Book · So I went and bought Programming Ruby ( “ Pickaxe ” in the same sense that Programming Perl is “ the Camel book ” ) and , out on the farm in Saskatchewan , spent some quality time with its first few hundred pages and sketching out some code ( it helps that OS X comes with an up - to - date Ruby ) .
The book is good ; really exceptionally good .
And , since there ’s no way to avoid comparisons with That Other Language : Based on first impressions and light exposure ( a basis that matters a lot ) Ruby seems better - documented and easier to get into than Python .
I ’ve actually written ( a little ) production code in Python , but I always had the feeling that there was lots of stuff going on I did n’t understand ; a couple of days in , I think I have a better grasp on what Ruby ’s up to , even where I ’m not looking .
The Pickaxe ai n’t perfect ; the typesetting automation goes off the rails at least once .
And irritatingly , the book uncritically presents examples of hey - ain ’t - it - cool Ruby features that look to me like terrible programming practice .
For example , in the Exceptions chapter they illustrate the use of retry with trickery from someone ’s net / smtp.rb library .
The effect is just like that of COBOL ’s ALTER , deprecated 40 years ago and now often cited as the worst feature ever to appear in a major programming language .
What ’s Slick ... ·
My early impression is that the whole blocking , looping , and iterating infrastructure that falls out of the yield / {block} construct is the best I ’ve encountered in any language .
Other super - cool things :
The case statement .
The general notion of “ attributes ” , and the ?/!/= method - naming tricks .
=== and ...
As for class engineering , the notion that single - inheritance plus mixins is the Right Way To Go seems pretty plausible , based on the evidence here .
Finally , as an XML guy , I note that REXML , generally accepted as The Way To Do XML On Ruby , comes with a stream - processing mode , and does n’t make the common XML - novice everything - is - a - DOM error .
... and Unslick · Python still leads the pack in pure syntax elegance ; all those end statements littering Ruby code are simply unnecessary ( but I think you ’d still have to keep the {} construct , if only to make the one - liners easy to read ) .
If you disagree , go read Ken Arnold ’s Style is Substance , which to my mind ends this particular debate .
The support for Unicode in regular expressions seems quite a bit behind what you have now in Perl and Java .
I ’ve had access to languages with closures and continuations and suchlike constructs for years and years , and I ’ve never ever written one .
While I ’m impressed by how natural this stuff is in Ruby , I ’m still unconvinced that these are a necessary part of the professional programmer ’s arsenal .
Also , maybe I ’m missing something , but it looks like Ruby ’s current threading mechanism , in the context of parallelism everywhere from silicon to applications , is pretty well a toy .
Language Learning · The Pickaxe frequently calls out to other languages , comparing Ruby ’s idioms to those of Perl , Java , and C ++.
This helped me an awful lot , since I can think in those languages ; for example , to a Java programmer the terms “ instance variable ” and “ class variable ” hardly need further explanation .
[ Side trip :
In my early Java programming days I used to prefix variables with m for class member and s for static .
I eventually decided that if you named them properly that was n’t necessary , but I suppose Ruby ’s @ and @@ syntax sugar ca n’t hurt . ]
I ’m wondering how Ruby would work as a learner ’s first language , and how effective the Pickaxe would be at teaching it that way ; while it calls out to other languages , it does n’t rely on those call - outs in any essential way .
Duck and Static Typing , Again · Excited calls for programmers to break the shackles of static typing are no longer revolutionary or surprising , but there ’s a good one here :
The upshot is that the “ safety ” in “ type safety ” is often illusory and that coding in a more dynamic language such as Ruby is both safe and productive .
But you know , there are two sides to that question , and the Pickaxe tries to be fair : Static typing can be good for optimizing code , and it can help IDEs do clever things with tooltip help , but we have n’t seen much evidence that it promotes more reliable code .
Call me hidebound and conservative , but I think that “ optimizing code ” and “ helping IDEs ” ( and it ’s a whole lot more than just “ tooltip help ” ) are awfully damn important .
In particular , as James Strachan has often argued , the combination of a good modern IDE and a statically typed language mean that you hardly ever have to type out a full method or variable name , and even though you might have to write more lines of Java than you would in Ruby , you might get the code written just as fast .
And unless I ’m missing something , the static typing ought to give the compiler and runtime enough extra information to make the code run faster ; implicit in the notion of duck typing is that you ’re going to spend plenty of cycles executing code like “ Does this thing have a quack method and if not , does its superclass ? ”
So I suspect that both static and dynamic languages are with us for the long haul .
Conclusion ·
It sure looks like more than a fad to me .

World affairs correspondent , BBC News
Vladimir Putin has had a considerable impact
Of 16,000 people questioned , 56 % said he had had a harmful impact on democracy and human rights in Russia and on peace and security in the world .
But in the remainder of the 30 countries covered by the poll , opinions of Mr Putin were more favourable .
And in Russia itself , he was given overwhelmingly positive ratings .
The survey was carried out by polling organisations Globescan and The Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) .
Legacy
There is little doubt that , in his eight years as Russian President , Vladimir Putin has had a considerable impact on the world stage , and inside Russia .
How positively or negatively his legacy is viewed , though , depends on where you are in the world , according to the BBC World Service poll .
But a key imponderable in viewing these results is also the extent to which one is indeed talking about a " legacy " .
Mr Putin is stepping down as president shortly .
Just how much influence he will continue to wield , and in what precise capacity , remains a matter of great speculation .
Against the background of general unease among Western governments over the direction that Moscow has been taking recently under Mr Putin , the poll suggests that 56 % of people in the world 's seven leading industrialised countries think he has had a negative impact on democracy and human rights in Russia .
Nearly half - 47 % - also think his impact on international peace and security has been negative .
Among the six western European countries polled , opinion was on the negative side generally .
What is more , this poll did not include former Warsaw Pact countries in central and eastern Europe , where the attitudes of people towards Moscow are likely to be negative .
Yet , despite a recent series of major diplomatic rows between Moscow and London , 45 % of Britons polled had a positive view of Russia 's world role .
Counterweight ?
In terms of the more broadly positive reactions overall among the 30 countries except Russia that were surveyed , this may be driven in part by a continuing view in many regions of the world that Russia represents a potential counterweight to the United States ,
The US is still widely seen as the dominant superpower , but whose foreign policy under the Bush administration has been especially controversial .
So , beyond the major industrialised countries and the West , there may be less unease about - and perhaps even a welcoming of - a newly - assertive Russia .
The counterweight argument may be reflected in the very different results emerging in this survey from the Middle East - 78 % of Egyptians view Russian influence as positive , only 29 % of Israelis do .
Egypt , of course , has a long history of close ties to Russia , even though the current Egyptian government is close to Washington .
Strikingly , in terms of Russia 's and Mr Putin 's world roles , the Chinese are very positive .
That may be because the Chinese feel a common bond with the Russians as part of a camp that seeks to check US influence , and reassert a multi-polar world .
Still , the scale of some of the results is surprising - 69 % of the Chinese surveyed see Russia playing a positive international role .
Beijing has certainly developed a relationship with Moscow , but only up to a point , and the two are themselves still potential rivals .
Significantly , Russians in this survey give Mr Putin high approval ratings on all the issues raised - including democracy , human rights , and quality of life in the country , as well as on the international stage .
And , for Mr Putin himself , these may be the most telling results .

Law.com Trendspotter : Big Law's Associate Bonus Battle Started Early This Year — but the Casualties May Not Be Worth It
Zack Needles
Despite — or , perhaps more accurately , because of — the pandemic , large law firms are already in the midst of trying to outdo each other with associate bonuses this year .
But there is growing concern that some firms may only be exacerbating the problems they 're trying to solve by attempting to throw money at them .
FORT LEAVENWORTH , KAN . — Generals who have taken a stand in a polarizing war like Iraq at risk of professional peril have made an impression on the group gathered here at the Command and General Staff College .
A case in point : the February 2003 Capitol Hill testimony by then Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki and then Pentagon No. 2 official Paul Wolfowitz .
Shinseki called for a larger Iraq troop deployment than sought by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
" I 'll never forget watching that , " says one major .
" They asked Shinseki directly for his assessment , and it differed so much from what Wolfowitz was saying .
And then Shinseki was gone .
He was gone .
Period . "
It was a shock for junior officers .
" It set a really bad precedent for many of us down at this level , " says the major .
" Personally , I looked at it , " adds another .
" Imagine , you 've been doing this , soldiering , all of your life .
All your life .
And they ask for your input .
Then you 've got this guy who 's never put on a piece of body armor or worn a helmet .
Who do I consider to be more credible ? "
Generals like Shinseki have been " a tremendous example for a whole generation of leaders , " says Lt. Gen.
Peter Chiarelli , the military assistant to Defense Secretary Robert Gates .
He draws a comparison with the blunt - talking Gen. George C. Marshall , who offered up an opinion to Franklin D. Roosevelt that many would have considered career suicide .
" It was Marshall who told FDR that an idea he had was n't necessarily the brightest thing he'd ever heard , " says Chiarelli .
" That impressed FDR so much , and we all know what happens next . "
Marshall was promoted to Army chief of staff on the eve of America 's entry into World War II .
The majors here all know what happened next to Shinseki , too : Following his Hill testimony , he finished out his tenure as a lame duck after Rumsfeld named Shinseki 's successor one year before he was scheduled to take over .
But while the majors say they hope for a great deal more candor from the generals who command them — particularly when briefing political leaders — they debate the extent to which military leaders should stand up to their civilian masters .
After all , they point out , one of democracy 's most fundamental principles is that its military operates under civilian control .
" I have a sense that if it's not illegal or unethical , " says a major , " then it 's our job to make a situation work . "
But ambivalent about motoring offences .
Britons are largely in favour of closed circuit television ( CCTV ) to fight street crime and track stolen cars , according to a survey carried out by YouGov for NTL Telewest Business , but not so keen on its use to catch offending motorists .
Eighty eight per cent of respondents said they are happy for CCTV to be used to reduce crime .
Eighty two percent said that CCTV should be used for tracking stolen cars , but only 58 percent were in favour of using CCTV to monitoring car tax evaders .
Even fewer , 54 percent , supported its use against speeding offenders .
Only 30 percent supported its use in enforcing the Congestion Charge .
A gender gap is in evidence as more women than men are supportive of CCTV use on the roads .
Eighty - two percent of women believed it should be used to help catch drunk drivers , compared with 74 percent of men .
Seventy six percent of respondents believed CCTV should be used to find missing people , while 70 percent were in favour of using it for crowd control .
Around 79 percent would employ CCTV to prevent shoplifting , and 70 percent to track drivers leaving petrol stations without paying .
Britain is one of the most - watched societies in the world with one CCTV camera for every 14 people in the UK .
Britons are caught on camera at least once every five minutes .
North Lanarkshire Council was one of the first in the UK to implement CCTV over the internet ( IP CCTV ) to help combat anti-social behaviour .
" CCTV plays a significant role in ensuring the security and safety of citizens and has proven to be a very successful crime deterrent in our region , " said Councillor Tom Maginnis , convener of the Economic Regeneration Committee at North Lanarkshire .
" We have one of the largest IP CCTV infrastructures in Europe and continuously look at new ways of using it for public welfare , whether to monitor big public events or prevent fly tipping . "
Radio has always had a strange exemption under US law : it does n't need to pay the performers of the music it plays .
Internet radio needs to pay .
Satellite radio needs to pay .
Digital music stations transmitted over cable lines have to pay .
But not radio .
The House and Senate are now considering matching bills that would remove this inconsistency by forcing terrestrial radio to pay up if it wants to keep playing music — and broadcasters are livid .
While radio does pay a fee to songwriters , it pays no performance rights fee , in contrast to just about every other developed country on the planet .
The broadcasters argue that they are providing free advertising to musicians , who then make money from touring and record sales .
Plenty of artists do n't buy this ( especially older artists who do n't tour or sell albums , but whose hits still keep oldies stations in business ) , and they can't see why radio is exempted from paying for the music it uses to rake in ad dollars .
Tom Waits , one of the most innovative singer / songwriters of the last quarter century , helped to found the musicFIRST coalition that advocates for a performance fee .
" It 's just plain wrong for radio to be allowed to build profitable businesses with growing revenues on the backs of artists and musicians without paying them fairly for it , " he said in a statement today .
musicFIRST has the backing of some powerful members of Congress .
Rep. Howard Berman ( D - CA ) and Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) had now introduced a performance rights bill in the House while Sen.
Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) and Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R - UT ) introduced the same bill in the Senate .
The RIAA , of course , supports the plan .
The current draft sets up a scheme where commercial broadcasters pay a flat yearly fee ( set by the government ) to a group like SoundExchange , which would distribute the money to artists and labels .
Small commercial stations would only pay $ 5,000 a year , and nonprofit stations like NPR would pay only $ 1,000 a year .
Talk radio and religious broadcasts would pay nothing .
This has inspired apoplectic press releases from broadcasters and their supporters .
The National Association of Broadcasters ' Dennis Wharton played the xenophobia card .
" After decades of Ebenezer Scrooge - like exploitation of countless artists , RIAA and the foreign - owned record labels are singing a new holiday jingle to offset their failing business model , " he said .
" NAB will aggressively oppose this brazen attempt to force America 's hometown radio stations to subsidize companies that have profited enormously through the free promotion provided by radio airplay . "
The Free Radio Alliance , likewise , calls the move a " transfer tax on local communities . "
Spokesperson Cathy Rought also deplored the fact that the government would " fundamentally meddle with the established business model of one industry . "
( Though without government intervention , a free market would long ago have demanded these fees ; the RIAA has wanted them for years . )
Debate on the bills is likely to be fierce ; the NAB issued a statement today pointing out that the competing Local Radio Freedom Act ( which would keep the current system in place ) currently has the backing of 127 members of the House .
In a sign of just how nasty this could get , the NAB has already retaliated by asking Congress to look into the propriety of major label recording contracts .
The current account measures trade in goods and investments
The deficit fell by 5.5 % to $ 178.5 bn ( £ 88.5 bn ) in the July to September 2007 quarter .
It was the smallest current account deficit since the $ 173.4bn figure recorded in the third quarter of 2005 .
The current account is the broadest measure of trade , covering goods and investment flows between countries .
Airline tickets
The current account deficit had set all - time highs for five years in a row but has fallen for past two quarters , partly thanks to the decline of the dollar against many major currencies .
The weak dollar makes American products cheaper overseas while making foreign goods more expensive for US shoppers .
In the third quarter , the US had a $ 26.5 bn surplus on trade in services , such as airline travel , and a $ 20.5 bn surplus on investment income flows .
This was against the $ 199.7bn deficit on trade in goods , while financial transfers to foreigners - which includes grant aid and payments to foreigners on their US investments - came to $ 25.8bn .
' Big deficit '
Robert Brusca , chief economist at Fact And Opinion Economics in New York said : " This is pretty much what we thought it would look like .
" This is still a big deficit even though we had some modest reduction .
" Some of that progress is due to the fact that imports have been restrained and the economy is weakening .
The good news is in exports .
" Still this underscores how difficult it is to make progress on the deficit . "
Meanwhile other data from the Treasury Department showed international investment flowing into the US stood at $ 97.8bn in October , against an outflow of $ 150.8 bn in August at the height of the credit crunch this summer .
The figures show that the lower value of the dollar has also made the US a more attractive place to invest for many foreign financial institutions and governments .
When AACS was revealed as the encryption format of choice for HD DVD and Blu-ray , bets were placed on how long it would take for it to be cracked .
Since the first HD DVD and Blu-ray discs began shipping , hackers have been hard at work figuring out how to break the encryption ; DVD Jon even registered DeAACS.com .
We 've covered both crackers ' efforts and the attempts by the AACS Licensing Authority to keep those cracks from seeping into the public consciousness .
Yesterday , all of that came to a head .
A submission on Digg which contained the recently uncovered encryption key for HD DVD discs was removed yesterday by the site 's admins after the site was served with a DMCA takedown notice , according to Digg CEO Jay Adelson .
Such takedown notices are not uncommon .
The AACS LA has issued them far and wide in an attempt to give the crack as low a profile as possible — Boing Boing blogger Cory Doctorow was the recent recipient of just such a notice after students of a class on copyright he was teaching at the University of Southern California posted the key and a link to the infamous Doom9 forum where AACS cracks have been openly discussed .
The futility of the AACS ' actions was demonstrated last night when Digg was hit with a barrage of submissions containing the forbidden key .
For a few hours , Digg 's front page consisted of little more than a succession of links to the hexadecimal HD DVD key .
After several hours , Digg cofounder Kevin Rose said that the site had received the message loud and clear , pledging that Digg would no longer kill stories and comments containing the key .
While the shenanigans at Digg were fascinating to watch as they unfolded , in the grand scheme of DRM it serves mostly as a reminder that the Internet holds no secrets .
Like it or not for the AACS LA , DVD Forum ( which backs HD DVD ) , and the Blu-ray Disc Association , Pandora 's Box is opened wide .
Not only is the key out in the open , but perhaps more damagingly to the HD lobby , public awareness of DRM and its cracks has been raised .
How will HD DVD , Blu-ray , and AACS LA respond ?
We do n't know , and chances are that they do n't either .
Last night and this morning , Ars contacted all of them , along with the MPAA , to ask that very question .
We have n't had a single phone call or e-mail returned from any of them .
We 're nearing the point of ready availability of tools like DeCSS for HD DVD and Blu-ray , but Blu-ray has a couple of extra layers of protection ( ROM Mark and BD + ) that have yet to be deployed .
Also , both HD formats have an antipiracy weapon in their arsenal that DVD lacks : the ability to revoke device keys , which has already happened to Corel 's WinDVD .
Unfortunately for both HD DVD and Blu-ray , that looks like it 's going to be as effective as a suit of chain mail against a bazooka shell ; Doom9 forum member arnezami claims that the hack at the center of the latest maelstrom is irrevocable .
Even if arnezami is wrong in his evaluation , the AACS LA 's vigilance in trying to keep the existence of HD DVD cracks out of the public eye has backfired in a truly spectacular manner .
Luggage used to be what it is called .
You had to lug it around because it was big and heavy .
When your coach or car brought you to the train station a uniformed porter would port your luggage to a cart and put it with other bags and trunks to be loaded on the same train .
People that had any intention of ever seeing all of their things again would tip the nice man .
Now , here in the future , things have n’t changed all that much .
Except the whole train thing , those are pretty much gone .
At least as far as effective long distance passenger service is concerned .
And nobody carries bags anymore , we drag them .
Should it should be called rollage ?
Or maybe dragage ?
The bags are still surrendered to a uniformed person that has the success of your entire trip in their personal power .
Tipping might still be a good idea .
Generally mistakes are rare when it comes to checking a bag to the correct destination and having it get there .
What could possibly go wrong ?
I read that about 1 percent of baggage is “ mis-handled ” .
It does n’t sound like much but if there are a hundred bags on a flight on average one of them should probably be somewhere else .
Things That Possibly go Wrong
1 . When you are asked by anyone having anything to do with your bags what your destination is always answer with the “ AIRPORT ” and “ CITY ” .
Many airlines serve multiple airports near the same city .
For example “ Washington , Dulles ” or Intercontinental , Bush , Houston ” could be good answers .
Some airports have several names which are used interchangeably like Hartford - Bradley - Windsor Locks .
A true road warrior will know the three letter identifier for the destination .
IAH , BDL , whatever .
Check to see that your bag is tagged to the place you next want to see it .
2 . If you have a lay - over in say , Dallas , change planes then continue to Seattle on the same airline your destination is still Seattle .
The only exception might be a stroller you need for the baby during a long layover .
Some airlines will bring the stroller up for you to use during a layover but it might not be worth the trouble .
3 . If you have a lay - over in Dallas and you are continuing on a different airline to Seattle be sure to explain in the following language : “ My destination is Seattle on brand X air , I am connecting on Brand A airlines at DFW . ”
Will my bags transfer “ interline ” ?
Or will I need to claim and re-check to the destination .
A brief weird explanation will follow .
Ask questions , get answers .
Look at the claim check .
4. Picture the top of an SUV .
Picture all of your baggage stacked up there .
Picture someone tossing it off to the ground .
Gleefully .
The happy baggage handlers are still hard at work getting your baggage from carts to the airplane and back to the conveyor system where the straps can get caught in the works of the machinery and pulled off .
5 . Never ever have nice luggage .
Those utility totes that the big home improvement stores sell make great travel bags .
They have wheels , are tough and allow for dragging even more stuff along too .
Nice luggage gets damaged , fact ’ o life .
Luggage straps will cause a bag to get mis-routed because it can confound the machinery .
A strap may get tangled in a machine and delay the bag until after the flight has left .
You might even see it again someday .
Click straps are great if they are kept tight .
6 . Never ever have tags or stickers on your bag that are from a previous flight .
When things get weird and somebody sees only the destination , not last years date , your bag may well end up where you were last year .
Or Worse .
7 . Baggage that is common should be personalized with a ribbon , sticker or something .
People actually do confuse bags sometimes .
Make it easy for us to find out who you are and how to contact you right away if this happens .
We usually try to find people at the rental car counter .
A copy of your itinerary in a easy to find packet is a good idea .
8 . Most lost baggage ( the kind you never see again ) is actually stolen .
Never make your baggage look nice .
It should be durable but not attractive .
It should n’t spend any more time alone than necessary at the baggage claim place .
Thieves will usually take bags that are common in appearance so they can say they thought it was theirs .
9 . Locks are not cool , the TSA inspectors will often take them off .
If they wo n’t come off easily the bag will be delayed .
10 . NEVER pack anything hazardous .
the FAA and TSA have really good web resources for what hazardous means .
Some of the less obvious things are matches , mercury , batteries , or any kind of fireworks .
Hazardous stuff presented for air transport creates a violation of Federal law and can get you in a huge amount of trouble .
Carry on bags might always have to be checked in the cargo bin at the last minute so keep a little bag inside the carry - on for medication , cameras , and stuff you ca n’t part with gleefully .
Just say .
“ Sure I can check it if I must , just let me get my medication and diamonds out ” .
Thank you for playing along , Happy Landings

Strong winds brought a roller coaster to a halt at the top of its loop at a fun park in Anhui province in east China , leaving 18 people hanging upside down for about half an hour with six of them falling ill , an official said .
All the six persons were sent to a hospital and were discharged later , the official said .
The equipment was in good condition and the weather was suitable when the coaster began its journey but a sudden gust halted it , which was then locked to the loop by safety devices , with the passengers hanging upside down .
Zhang Shengying , Deputy Director of the Wuhu Municipal Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision , said investigation showed that the accident had been caused by " extreme weather " at the amusement park .
Eighteen people who rode a roller coaster in Anhui , China , got more than they bargained for : they got stuck upside down for half an hour when strong winds caused the roller coaster to stop on its track !

A number of firms are showing off Android - enabled phones
Google mobile boss
About a dozen companies such as ARM , Texas Instruments and Qualcomm showed off prototype handsets at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona .
The free software system was launched in November 2007 and is being developed by an alliance of more than 30 companies including Google .
The first Android - enabled phone is expected to go on sale later this year .
One firm showing off a prototype phone was the UK processor designer ARM .
" It 's really a demonstration vehicle rather than a full phone , " Ian Drew of ARM told BBC News .
However , he said the wireless phone did show off several applications .
" What we are demonstrating on the Android platform is maps , browser , camera applications , multimedia , e-mail , and calendar - basically everything you 'd expect on a mobile phone . "
Open world
The Google Android platform is based on open source Linux software that allows developers access to the underlying code .
This allows programmers much greater flexibility to build applications and features tailored to individual phones .
Other companies also showed off Android prototypes such as Marvell , Texas Instruments , Qualcomm , NEC and ST Microelectronics .
Korean handset manufacturer Samsung has also said it hopes to have a phone based on Android by early next year .
Android was not the only Linux platform making waves in Barcelona .
The Mobile Linux foundation said that 18 phones from seven different firms would be demonstrated at 3GSM using its Limo software .
LG and Samsung were amongst handset manufacturers showing off Limo devices .
Aurora Borealis , as it is called , is set for launch in 2014 and promises to shed light on a host of polar mysteries .
Explore more about the ship 's distinctive features using the links below .
OVERVIEW
TIME LINE Proposed : 2002 Design : 2007 - 2011 Construction : 2012 -2014 Launch : 2014 Lifetime : 40 years
Aurora Borealis project
Aurora Borealis , is the brainchild of the European Science Foundation ( ESF ) and researchers at the Alfred Wegener Institute .
" It 's a unique ship , " said Dr Paul Egerton , Executive Director , European Polar Board .
" It will look at the deep hydrothermal vents , the deep ocean ridges where there is volcanic activity , deep sediments , biological processes in the shallow waters as well as current observations of weather conditions and climate . "
It will be the world 's first ice - breaker that is also a drilling ship and will operate year - round , although it will only drill in the summer months .
Initially it will be used in the Arctic but it is envisaged it will also be used for Antarctic expeditions .
It is currently one of 35 large - scale research infrastructure projects being funded by the European Union .
Norway and Russia have both signalled their interest in helping to build and operate the vessel .
The final design is currently being drawn up by marine architects in Germany and Finland .
ICE BREAKING
This is important to allow the vessel to hold its position in ice - covered waters .
To accomplish this , the vessel has been designed with deliberately steep sides and will use ice strengthened propellers .
" It is able to break the ice which then goes beneath the ship and is washed away by the propeller system , " explained Dr Egerton .
Scale models of the design have already been tested successfully in Germany and Finland .
For conventional ice - breaking , the vessel will have twin steel hulls ( 8 - 10 cm thick at the bow and stern ) .
QUICK FACTS Initial design concept : Length : 180 m Beam : 40 m Max. speed : 15 knots Voyage : up to 60 days Crew : 120
If the outer hull is punctured the inner will hopefully remain intact .
It will also have a flat rather than pointed bow to allow the ship to drive forwards , rise up on the ice and let the weight of the ship break the ice .
Diesel engines will propel the ship along .
SCIENCE CAPABILITY
The ship will house between 50 and 70 scientists onboard .
As well as allowing them to routinely drill the Arctic sea floor , Aurora Borealis will be equipped with a suite of scientific instruments .
Researchers will be able to use boats and a helicopter for direct observations as well as tools for remote surveys of the sea floor .
The ship will also pack echo sounders along with seismic gravity and magnetic systems .
In addition , the ship will be able to launch remotely operated vehicles underneath the ice for direct sampling of the sea floor .
Onboard , the ship will be packed with facilities including clean rooms , deep freeze specimen stores and labs with " floating floors " to protect sensitive equipment against vibrations .
COSTS Design : 12 m euros Construction : 300 m euros Operation : 12 m euros / year
Scientists will also be able to use high - speed internet and fast data transmission systems to and from shore - labs .
DRILLING PLATFORM
Only one drilling expedition has ever been mounted in the central Arctic Ocean because of the expense and difficulty .
Then , three ships were used : one to drill and two to circle the vessel keeping the ice away .
" The piece of ocean crust at the centre of the Central Arctic Ocean is the least known of any crust in the entire ocean , " said Professor Joern Thiede .
But Aurora Borealis should allow scientists to routinely drill the Arctic sea floor through the summer months .
The rig , which will only operate in summer , will be able to bore up to 1,000 m ( 3,300 ft ) into the seafloor in water depths of 5,000 m ( 16,400ft ) .
It will be kept in the same spot using its dynamic positioning system and lateral ice - breaking capability .
MOON POOLS
The ship will contain two 7 m - diameter ( 23ft ) moon pools , openings in the bottom of the hull to allow scientist direct access to the ocean beneath the ice .
One of the pools will be used to give the drilling rig access to ice - free water .
The other will be used for sampling and to launch autonomous unmanned vehicles ( AUV ) and remotely operated vehicles ( ROV ) .
Usually these vehicles are launched by a crane over the side of the vessel .
NAUTICAL EQUIPMENT
Radar for echo location Sonar for water depth Clinometer records ship 's motion Ice forecasting system Speed log
However , as Aurora Borealis will operate surrounded by ice floes this will be impossible .
" [ The moon pools ] guarantee a very safe and protected environment , " explained Professor Joern Thiede of the Alfred Wegener institute , in Germany .
GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM
At the moment the designers of the ship say that it will use either the Russian Glosnass or American GPS system for navigation .
However , it could eventually take advantage of the European Galileo system , which is currently being built and is expected to come on line in 2012 .
As well as being used to accurately pinpoint the vessel for navigation , sample collection and scientific surveys , the designers envisage using one of the systems to control the ship 's dynamic positioning system .
DYNAMIC POSITIONING
This will use satellite - controlled bow thrusters and azipods - electrically driven propellers mounted on a steerable pod - to keep the ship in position whilst drilling .
Azipods , commonly used on a large cruise ship , are able to turn through 360 degrees and use forward - facing propellers to keep the vessel in position .
They will be used in conjunction with the main azimuth steering system at the stern of the vessel to keep it in position to an accuracy of 1m .
PROPULSION
Many Arctic ice - breakers use nuclear reactors Antarctic treaties do not allow nuclear power Diesel engines will be used to produce power Two engines will generate 55MW
Retractable bow thrusters which are positioned at right angles to the length of the ship will increase its manoeuvrability .
One of the challenges of building the ship is designing azipods strong enough to break any ice that is pushed underneath the vessel .
AZIMUTH PROPULSION
The main propulsion for the ship is a so - called azimuth system .
These propellers are mounted on pods which can be rotated in any horizontal direction , doing away with the need for a conventional rudder .
The ice strengthened system will give the ship better manoeuvrability than a standard craft .
The diesel engine driven propeller - pods also play a key role in the ships " dynamic positioning " system which , allows it to maintain an almost constant position whilst drilling .
" I was going to Adelaide so I rang David and said , ' Can I come talk to you because you 're looking for a job and I 'm happy to help with that but I 'd want to get some answers to some questions ' , " Mr Smith told ABC radio in Sydney .
" I believe he is basically a decent Australian like his father , that we know well , and I do n't believe he 's ever been a supporter of terrorism .
" I asked him why he was in Afghanistan and it was quite different to what we 've heard about ... ( it was ) all about trying to help independence movements .
" One of my views has changed completely and that is ... he should n't earn any money from this .
" But I 've changed my view completely now because he 's said he 's never supported terrorism and most journalists I talk to and all lawyers say that the particular plea bargain is just terrible because he would have agreed to anything to get out of there ( Guantanamo ) . "
Mr Hicks is reportedly fielding offers from about 30 media organisations worldwide to tell the story of his capture in Afghanistan and his more than five years in Guantanamo Bay .
A media gag order on Mr Hicks , imposed by the US court , expires at the end of next month .
Mr Smith would not give details about talks the pair had regarding Mr Hicks ' time in Afghanistan or at Guantanamo Bay , but said he did n't have a problem with the 32 - year - old making money from selling his story .
" He 's not even allowed to earn $ 5 an hour because a trumped up , backdated , retrospective court case in Guantanamo Bay where he would have agreed to anything , says he 's a terrorism supporter .
He says he is n't , " Mr Smith said .
" I think we 've got to be very careful of saying he 's a convicted terrorism supporter when the circumstances on the plea bargain were that he had no other option .
" I think he 's very concerned about talking to the media but he knows he will have to one day , but he 's concerned because he 's been treated in such an unfair way and people have made up their minds about him ... he thinks there 's no chance of him ever being fairly heard . "
Mr Smith rejected a suggestion that Mr Hicks had been " pulling the wool over " his eyes during the meeting .
" I 'm quite sure he was completely open , " he said .
" Some of it he admitted ... was a terrible mistake he made .
" It was n't as if he was perfect .
He made some serious errors in his life but he said , `I 've never been a supporter of terrorism , I would never support it , ' and I believe that . "

Sheldon Brown , a beloved iconoclast bicycle tech guru , died Sunday from a heart attack .
He was 68 63 .
Brown championed fixed gear bikes for years before they became essential fashion items for hip kids in New York and San Francisco and had a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of obscure bike parts , odd tire sizes and non-standard gear ratios .
He was known for his generosity in helping DIY bike builders with their projects , for his love of weird old bikes , and his passion for cycling .
Brown had been suffering from multiple sclerosis since 2005 , which kept him from riding any of his dozens of two - wheeled bikes since September 2006 .
Brown is survived by his wife and two adult children .
Brown worked as the technical guru and Webmaster for Harris Cyclery in West Newton , Massachusetts .
In columns for cycling magazines and in essays on his blog , Brown championed bike technology that he loved - internal hubs , fixed gear bikes ( including a fixie tandem ) and homebuilt tandems .
He gently ridiculed the current marketing rages of the cycling world ( carbon fiber , titanium , racing bikes for everyone , etc. ) every April 1 with fake new product announcements such as a titanium credit card with holes drilled in it to reduce weight .
Brown 's decidedly non-fancy website was a vital resource for cyclists , rich with hints on how to break in a Brooks leather saddle , technical explanations of the workings of 60 year - old internal hubs , and instructions on how to build a tandem from two old steel bike frames .
Brown even lauded Shimano 's much maligned Biopace chain rings ( a non-round chain ring once made by Shimano ) .

Scientists have discovered what they think may be another reason why Greenland 's ice is melting : a thin spot in Earth 's crust is enabling underground magma to heat the ice .
They have found at least one “ hotspot ” in the northeast corner of Greenland -- just below a site where an ice stream was recently discovered .
The researchers do n't yet know how warm the hotspot is .
But if it is warm enough to melt the ice above it even a little , it could be lubricating the base of the ice sheet and enabling the ice to slide more rapidly out to sea .
“ The behavior of the great ice sheets is an important barometer of global climate change , ” said Ralph von Frese , leader of the project and a professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University .
“ However , to effectively separate and quantify human impacts on climate change , we must understand the natural impacts , too .
“ Crustal heat flow is still one of the unknowns -- and it's a fairly significant one , according to our preliminary results . ”
Timothy Leftwich , von Frese 's former student and now a postdoctoral engineer at the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets at the University of Kansas , presented the study 's early results on Thursday , December 13 , 2007 , at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco .

von Frese 's team combined gravity measurements of the area taken by a Naval Research Laboratory aircraft with airborne radar measurements taken by research partners at the University of Kansas .
The combined map revealed changes in mass beneath the Earth 's crust , and the topography of the crust where it meets the ice sheet .
Below the crust is the mantle , the partially molten rocky layer that surrounds the Earth 's core .
The crust varies in thickness , but is usually tens of miles thick .
Even so , the mantle is so hot that temperatures just a few miles deep in the crust reach hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit , von Frese explained .
“ Where the crust is thicker , things are cooler , and where it 's thinner , things are warmer .
And under a big place like Greenland or Antarctica , natural variations in the crust will make some parts of the ice sheet warmer than others , ” he said .
The ice thickness , the temperature at the base of the ice , and ground topography all contribute to the forming of an ice stream -- a river of ice that flows within a larger ice sheet .
In recent years , Greenland ice streams have been carrying ice out to sea faster , and ice cover on the island has been diminishing .
Once the ice reaches the sea , it melts , and global sea levels rise .

“ The complete melting of these continental ice sheets would put much of Florida , as well as New Orleans , New York City and other important coastal population centers , under water , ” von Frese said .
The ice sheet in northeast Greenland is especially worrisome to scientists .
It had no known ice streams until 1991 , when satellites spied one for the first time .
Dubbed the Northeastern Greenland Ice Stream , it carries ice nearly 400 miles , from the deepest interior of the island out to the Greenland Sea .
“ Ice streams have to have some reason for being there .
And it 's pretty surprising to suddenly see one in the middle of an ice sheet , ” von Frese said .
The newly discovered hotspot is just below the ice stream , and could have caused it to form , the researchers concluded .
But what caused the hotspot to form ?
“ It could be that there 's a volcano down there , ” he said .
“ But we think it 's probably just the way the heat is being distributed by the rock topography at the base of the ice . ”
Collaborator Kees van der Veen began working on the project when he was a visiting associate professor of geological sciences and research scientist at Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State .
He is now at the University of Kansas .
“ Recent observations indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet is much more active than we ever believed , ” van der Veen said .
“ There have been rapid changes in outlet glaciers , for example .
Such behavior is critically linked to conditions at the ice bed .
Geothermal heat is an important factor , but until now , our models have not included spatial variations in heat , such as this hotspot .
“ Our map is the first attempt at quantifying spatial variations in geo - heat under Greenland -- and it explains why the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream is where it is , ” van der Veen added .
To measure actual temperatures beneath the ice , scientists must drill boreholes down to the base of the ice sheet -- a mile or more below the ice surface .
The effort and expense make such measurements few and far between , especially in remote areas of northeast Greenland .
For now , the researchers are combining theories of how heat flows through the mantle and crust with the gravity and radar data , to understand how the hotspot is influencing the ice .
Once they finish searching the rest of Greenland for other hotspots , they hope to turn their attention to Antarctica .
This research was funded by the National Science Foundation .

The case concerned a 2002 agreement between the United States and Canada on the treatment of people fleeing persecution from other places , and the agreement itself requires compliance with international conventions on refugees and torture .
Under the deal , which became effective three years ago this month , people from other countries entering Canada from the United States by land could no longer ask for asylum , on the theory that they should have done so in the United States .
( The agreement works in reverse , too , but most refugee traffic moves north . )
You get one bite at the asylum apple , the agreement says , because you will get a fair shake in either country .
But the deal , known as the Safe Third Country Agreement , sets conditions based on the international conventions , and Justice Phelan said the United States had in recent years not lived up to them .
He acknowledged that an English court had turned back a similar challenge to American refugee policy in 2000 .
But things have changed since the Bush administration came to power , Justice Phelan said , and the reasons given in the English decision “ clearly relate to a different time . ”
Justice Phelan declared the 2002 agreement invalid .
It is not entirely clear what follows from that decision .
The parties have further briefs to submit , and an appeal is likely .
But it certainly seems possible that many thousands of refugees will again become able to make asylum claims in Canada .
Sweden ( TGW ) – Using warm milk from over 1100 cows , a castle in Sweden heats itself in an environmentally friendly way .
The castle ’s herd produces some 8000 gallons of milk each day .
The milk leaves the cow at about 99 degrees Fahrenheit and is quickly cooled to 37 degrees so it wo n’t spoil .
The herders at the castle have developed a way to capture the lost heat , and use it to heat the building and heat water .

The American dream is founded on the belief that people who work hard and play by the rules will be able to earn a good living , raise a family in comfort and retire with dignity .
But that dream is harder to achieve for millions of Americans because they spend too much of their hard - earned money on fees to cash their paychecks or pay off high - priced loans meant to carry them over until they get paid at work .

1993 : World Trade Center bomb terrorises New York A suspected car bomb has exploded underneath the World Trade Center in New York killing at least five people and injuring scores more .
A suspected car bomb has exploded underneath the World Trade Center in New York killing at least five people and injuring scores more .
The bombing has shocked America which had seemed immune from acts of terrorism that have plagued other parts of the world .
An emotional Mario Cuomo , New York 's state governor , told journalists : " We all have that feeling of being violated .
No foreign people or force has ever done this to us .
Until now we were invulnerable . "
It felt like an airplane hit the building
Bruce Pomper , eyewitness
The immense blast happened at 1218 local time in the Secret Service 's section of the car park underneath and between what are New York 's tallest buildings .
It left a gaping hole in the wall above the Path underground station .
Most of those who died are believed to have been crushed by the station ceiling .
It ripped through three floors of concrete , scattering ash and debris and set off a fire that sent choking smoke and flames up through one of the 110 - story " Twin Towers " .
Total pandemonium
Thousands of office workers were trapped as smoke billowed up through the buildings .
With no working lifts or lighting there was total pandemonium .
People did not know whether to stay in their offices or brave the journey down via the smoke - filled stairwells .
" It felt like an airplane hit the building , " said Bruce Pomper , a 34 - year - old broker .
Desperate for air , some people smashed windows with office furniture .
Hundreds eventually poured out of the building gasping for air and covered in soot .
Rescue workers struggled to get oxygen to those in the upper floors .
About 100,000 people work in and visit the 1,700ft towers every day - the blast happened at their busiest time .
Several people have called New York 's police claiming they were behind the attack but authorities are keeping an open mind about possible suspects .

Images from the World Trade Center bombing
In Context In May 1994 , four men - Mohammed Salameh , Nidal Ayyad , Mahmud Abouhalima and Ahmad Ajaj - were sentenced to life for bombing the World Trade Center , which killed six people and injured 100 .
In October 1995 Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman , a blind cleric who preached at mosques in Brooklyn and Jersey City , was sentenced to life for masterminding the bombing , .
He was also found guilty of the murder of extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane and a scheme to assassinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak during a trip to New York in 1993 .
The bombing of the World Trade Center has been totally eclipsed by the events of 11 September 2001 which saw thousands killed , the collapse of both Twin Towers and an all - out " war on terror " declared by the Western world .
Rahman 's organisation , the Islamic Group , is believed to have links to Osama Bin Laden 's al - Qaeda network , accused of carrying out the 11 September attacks .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Hispanics are returning to the Democratic Party after several years of drifting toward the Republicans , with many saying Bush administration policies have been harmful to their community , a poll showed Thursday .
By 57 % to 23 % , more Hispanic registered voters say they favor Democrats than Republicans , according to a survey by the non-partisan Pew Hispanic Center .
INTERACTIVE : Bush approval through the years POLITICS BLOG : More on voter affiliation shifts
That 34 percentage point Democratic edge — which includes people who said they lean toward either party — has grown since July 2006 , when a Pew poll measured a 21 point difference .
Then , 49 % of registered Hispanic voters said they favored Democrats and 28 % chose Republicans .
In 1999 before President Bush 's election , more Hispanics favored Democrats than Republicans by 58 % to 25 % — about the same margin as in the current poll .
When the former Texas governor became president in 2001 , Republicans saw an opportunity to woo Hispanics to the GOP .
But as the 2008 presidential campaign has heated up , immigration has become a major issue and GOP candidates have competed over who could concoct the toughest plan for cracking down on illegal immigration .
The survey found that among Hispanic registered voters : • Forty - one percent said Bush administration policies have been harmful to Hispanics , 16 % said they have been helpful and 33 % said they have not had much impact .
•
Forty - four percent said Democrats have more concern for Hispanics , 8 % chose Republicans and another 41 % said there is no difference .
•
Forty - one percent said Democrats do a better job of handling illegal immigration , 14 % named the GOP and 26 % said neither .
Younger Hispanics are slightly more inclined than older ones to be Democrats , while those with higher incomes lean more toward the GOP than those with lower earnings , the poll showed .
Using September 2007 Census Bureau data and projecting from 2004 voting behavior , Pew estimated there would be 8.6 million Hispanic voters next year — 1 million more than in 2004 .
While that would be a small portion of the overall expected vote , Pew estimated that Hispanics comprise a large enough share of eligible voters to affect the outcome in four states where Bush prevailed in 2004 by 5 percentage points or fewer : New Mexico , Florida , Colorado and Nevada .
Among Hispanics who are registered Democrats , 59 % said they want Hillary Rodham Clinton to be their party 's presidential candidate , followed by 15 % who prefer Barack Obama .
Among Hispanic Republicans , Rudy Giuliani leads Fred Thompson , 35 % to 13 % .
The survey involved telephone interviews with 2,003 randomly chosen Hispanics conducted from Oct. 3 through Nov. 9 .
It had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points .
It included 843 Hispanic registered voters , for whom the margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4 points .

Insurance companies impose higher premiums on overweight clients
Dr John Tickell believes a " fat tax " would highlight his country 's obesity crisis and make commercial sense , as heavier loads increase fuel costs .
But health groups have warned that to single out people with weight problems could cause them emotional stress .
Recent studies estimate that 67 % of Australian men and over half of women aged over 25 are overweight or obese .
Experts have warned that by 2030 half of the country 's children will be overweight or obese if the problem goes unchecked .
In March , Australian health officials were forced to equip their fleet of ambulances with heavy - duty stretchers to cope with the sharp rise in overweight patients .
' Too precious '
Dr Tickell , a leading nutritionist and author , told the BBC that society should take a more hardline stance against obesity and get tough on fat airline passengers .
He said that Australian airlines should impose charges on their overweight clients , as they do for excess baggage , because heavier loads increase fuel costs .
It 's not fair to single out those people who have a problem , which is already impacting greatly on their life , and make them feel like pariahs
Dr Tim Gill
Australasian Obesity Society
" I fly Sydney to Perth - five hours - and being totally disadvantaged by some huge person next to me literally flopping over into my seat .
Why should I pay the same as them ? " he asked .
Dr Tickell said it was important to start highlighting Australia 's obesity crisis .
" I think we 're a bit too nice , we 're a bit too precious about minority groups .
I think the majority group must have something to say too , " he added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Does this mean thin people get a rebate on their airfare ?

But the chief executive of the Australasian Society for the Study of Obesity , Dr Tim Gill , said penalty charges should not be imposed on overweight passengers .
" It 's not fair to single out those people who have a problem , which is already impacting greatly on their life , and make them feel like pariahs , " he said .
A spokesman for the Australian budget airline , Jetstar , said it had no plans to charge larger passengers more for their seats .
Airlines are , however , monitoring long - term trends in the size and shape of their customers , the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney says .
TiVo appears to have won a decisive victory in its patent infringement lawsuit against satellite TV provider EchoStar .
Today , the US Patent and Trademark Office issued a final and unappealable decision on TiVo 's patent 6,233,389 for a " multimedia time warping system , " ruling that the patent was valid and enforceable .
TiVo sued EchoStar in 2005 over the DVRs the satellite company manufactures and sells for its Dish Network .
In April 2006 , a jury found EchoStar liable for patent infringement and awarded TiVo $ 73 million in damages .
In August of that year , TiVo obtained an injunction against EchoStar , ordering it to stop selling DVRs and disable the DVR functionality on its products within 30 days .
The judge also upped the damage award to $ 90 million .
EchoStar filed a countersuit challenging the validity of the ' 389 patent , but a federal judge put that suit on hold until the USPTO ruled on the patent .
EchoStar was , however , able to win a stay of the injunction allowing it to continue manufacturing and selling DVRs while the patent reexamination process played out .
" We are extremely pleased that the PTO has now found all claims of the Time Warp Patent to be valid after conducting a reexamination of the patent requested by EchoStar , " said TiVo in a statement .
" We are hopeful that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will uphold the district court judgment of patent infringement and reinstate the injunction . "
Now that the USPTO has ruled decisively in TiVo 's favor , the case will go before the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit .
The decision will strengthen TiVo's hand in negotiations with other DVR makers , and makes it more likely that the appeals court will reinstate the injunction , forcing EchoStar to pay damages for the infringement and shut off their customers '
DVRs .
EchoStar may now attempt to settle the case with TiVo to avoid having the permanent injunction reinstated .
First off , I want to say that I mainly have blogged for a blog network , and for the most part , it has worked really great for me over the last two years .
I also have seen many people doing very well in blog networks , but it their success makes me wonder : could n’t they have done it on their own ?
I watch as certain bloggers make a name for themselves and while I do n’t think that any blog should necessarily be one hundred percent a one man show , I do think that selling all your best content to a network might be setting yourself up for failure later on .
A Scenario
Let ’s say you join a network that promises you the world , and you are an amazing writer .
They give you a platform and say they are going to deal with all the advertising revenue , server considerations , and design .
All you have to do is give them your best content , and they swear that you can make some serious money .
Six months later , you have done hundreds of posts , and really put all your time , energy and passion into the site , but you still are n’t reaping many rewards .
The blog network you work for has n’t helped you promote your stories to social networks , nor have they worked on forming advertising relationships with anyone besides just slapping up some Google AdSense .
They begin to complain that the traffic you are bringing in , which is quickly closing in on the fifty thousand uniques a month mark , is n’t even making them enough to keep you on staff and they are going to have to let you go .
Does that really seem fair ?
If you did n’t claim some form of ownership on your content , or have some form of long term agreement about its use once you are no longer with the blog network , they now own your content forever , and while they can continue to put advertising around it and earn some money from it , you now have to find a new site to work on to replace the income you were getting .
Had you worked on your own blog , and committed yourself to learning about search engine optimization , link baiting , advertising , affiliate programs , and made connections , you might have produced less content , but made more revenue in the long run , and kept control over all of your great writing .
Networks Do Have Benefits
For many bloggers , having a network does have benefits .
Maybe you are a great writer , but not good with technology .
Maybe you are a great teacher , but ca n’t wrap your head around domains and hosting ?
Some networks can help you fill in the gaps you have in regards to your expertise online .
However , I think that if you really want to be a success online , you have to take the time to learn things , even if you do n’t like them or do n’t have any natural talents or abilities with them .
It will stand you in good stead , and if your goal is to make a long term living off of your blogging efforts , would n’t you rather your future be in your own hands ?
Why am I in a Blog Network ?
So hopefully by now you are wondering why I work for a blog network if it is so terrible ?
When I first started blogging , I never imagined that I could make a full time income from my work .
I had just lost a job , and was working selling computers at a big box retailer .
I did n’t have any sales talent , and really should have been working in the repairs department , but either way , I was n’t making much over minimum wage .
I scored a spot on Darren Rowse ’s Laptop related blog as a guest writer , and that in conjunction of interviewing Jacob Gower , my best boss ever , I secured a spot as a full time blogger for his network of sites .
Had I known then , all the things that I know now .
I do n’t know if I still would have chosen that route , but what I do know is that sometimes I find it a shame that I have built up the traffic and profile of sites that I will never own .
Other Considerations
Selling – Something that most bloggers do n’t think about when writing for a network is the buying and selling of sites .
The site you write on today could be sold out from under you tomorrow .
I ’ve watched as a whole niche I was working hard to write on was sold from under me .
Thankfully , I had many other projects that needed my attention , and so I shifted my focus , but had that been my only project , my only passion , and thusly , the only blogs for me to write on , then what would have happened ?
Lack of Control – Say you want to build up the number one site dedicated to a specific subject , but the site is part of a network , and thus it will never truly be yours .
The owners can have you talk about websites , services , and other things , telling you to review them in a manner you do n’t agree with .
They pay for your time , and they expect you to deliver .
This can happen on sites because the owners want to make more money , and if your site is strong in its niche , they can capitalize on that and fill their pockets , while reducing your writer ’s integrity .
Other Writers – Nothing can reduce your enjoyment than sharing the spotlight with someone else , long after you have worked hard to build up a name for yourself and since you do n’t own the site , they have every right to add new writers to the mix .
This can be especially difficult if you do n’t see eye to eye on things .
Conclusion
Hopefully , this article helps you see how disadvantageous it can sometimes be to work for a blog network , and as such I hope you will give it much more consideration before jumping towards what might be a short sighted goal that could later leave you having to start over .

MR. RUSSERT : But when you say aberrant or unnatural , do you believe you 're born gay or you choose to be gay ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : I do n't know whether people are born that way .
People who are gay say that they 're born that way .
But one thing I know , that the behavior one practices is a choice .
We may have certain tendencies , but how we behave and how we carry out our behavior -- but the important issue that I want to address , because I think when you bring up the faith question , Tim , I 've been asked more about my faith than any person running for president .
I 'm OK with that .
MR .
RUSSERT : But you said you would ban all abortions .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Well , that 's not just because I'm a Christian , that 's because I 'm an American .
Our founding fathers said that we 're all created equal .
I think every person has intrinsic worth and value ...
MR .
RUSSERT : But many Americans believe that that would be , that would be you imposing your faith belief ...
UPDATE : Jane reports that Huckabee held a press conference today saying :
Huckabee just held a press conference where he announced that he made a negative ad against Romney -- Lord forgive him -- but at the last minute he decided to turn the other cheek and not broadcast it .
But just to show he was n't shittin ' y'all , he decided to show it to a few of his closest friends at a press conference that included Tim Russert , Joe Klein , Barbara Comstock and a few hundred journalists and bloggers of varying degrees of noteriety .
Full transcript :
MR. RUSSERT : Peggy Noonan , a woman of faith who writes for The Wall Street Journal , said that sometimes it appears your philosophy is " This is what God wants , " and that does n't encourage discussion , it squelches it .
And , and this is what you wrote in your book , " Kids Who Kill , " in 1998 : " It is now difficult to keep track of the vast array of publicly endorsed and institutionally supported aberrations -- from homosexuality and pedophilia to sadomasochism and necrophilia . "
Why would you link homosexuality with sadomasochism , pedophilia and necrophilia ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Well , what I was pointing out is all of these are deviations from what has been the traditional concept of sexual behavior and men and women having children , raising those children in the context of a , of a traditional marriage and family .
And , again , taken out of the larger context of that book , speaking about how so many of our social institutions have been broken down .
MR. RUSSERT : But do you think homosexuality is equivalent to pedophilia ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Oh , of course not .
MR. RUSSERT : ... or sadomasochism ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : No , of course not .
I did n't say ...
MR. RUSSERT : But this is what concerns people .
This , this is what you did say about homosexuality : " I feel homosexuality is an aberrant , unnatural and sinful lifestyle . "
That 's millions of Americans .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Tim , understand , when a Christian speaks of sin , a Christian says all of us are sinners .
I 'm a sinner , everybody 's a sinner .
What one 's sin is , means it 's missing the mark .
It 's missing the bull 's eye , the perfect point .
I miss it every day ; we all do .
The perfection of God is seen in a marriage in which one man , one woman live together as a couple committed to each other as life partners .
Now , even married couples do n't do that perfectly , so sin is not some act of equating people with being murderers or rapists ...
MR. RUSSERT : But when you say aberrant or unnatural , do you believe you 're born gay or you choose to be gay ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : I do n't know whether people are born that way .
People who are gay say that they 're born that way .
But one thing I know , that the behavior one practices is a choice .
We may have certain tendencies , but how we behave and how we carry out our behavior -- but the important issue that I want to address , because I think when you bring up the faith question , Tim , I 've been asked more about my faith than any person running for president .
I 'm OK with that .
I hope I 've answered these questions very candidly and very honestly .
I think it 's important for us to talk about it .
But the most important thing is to find out , does our faith influence our public policy and how ?
I 've never tried to rewrite science textbooks .
I 've never tried to come out with some way of imposing a doctrinaire Christian perspective in a way that is really against the Constitution .
I 've never done that .
MR. RUSSERT : But you said you would ban all abortions .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Well , that 's not just because I'm a Christian , that 's because I 'm an American .
Our founding fathers said that we 're all created equal .
I think every person has intrinsic worth and value ...
MR. RUSSERT : But many Americans believe that that would be , that would be you imposing your faith belief ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : But , no .
It 's not a faith belief .
It 's deeper than that .
It 's a human belief .
It goes to the heart of who we are as a civilization .
If I believe that your intrinsic worth is not changed by your ancestry , your last name , by your IQ , by your abilities or disabilities , if I value your life and respect it with dignity and worth because it is human , then that 's what draws me to the inescapable conclusion that I should be for the sanctity of every and each human life .
That 's why we go after that 12 - year - old boy in the woods of North Carolina when he 's lost , not because he has greater worth than someone else , but because we believe he has equal worth as everyone else .
I like it that in this country we treat each other -- at least we should -- with that sense of equality .
Our founding fathers penned that in the Declaration of Independence when they declared ...
MR. RUSSERT : Some Americans believe that life does not begin at conception , and that it's ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Well , scientifically I think that 's almost ...
MR. RUSSERT : But ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : ... a point that you could n't argue .
How , how could you say that life does n't begin at conception ...
MR. RUSSERT : Right .
Do you respect that view ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : ... biologically ?
MR. RUSSERT : Do you respect that view ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : I respect it as a view , but I do n't think it has biological credibility .
MR. RUSSERT : And what would happen to doctors or women who participated in abortion ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : It 's always the , the point of trying to say , " Are you going to criminalize it ? "
That 's not the issue .... read on
MR. RUSSERT : Well , if it , if it 's illegal , it would be .

Apropos of some arguments about home schooling , vouchers , Christian fundamentalists , and related issues that I 've been having online , it occurs to me that there are four different reasons to teach the theory of evolution as part of K - 12 education :
1 . It undermines religious belief .
More precisely , it provides a convincing rebuttal to the watchmaker argument for the existence of God , which is one of the more persuasive arguments for that conclusion .
2 . It is intellectually interesting .
3 . It is useful for teaching other things , mainly biology .
4 . Understanding it is useful to most students for making sense of the world around them and making decisions relevant to their lives .
The first seems to me a good reason for parents to teach their children about evolution but a suspect reason to teach it in the public schools ; under a system of separation of church and state , the government should n't be going out of its way to attack religion any more than it should be going out of its way to promote it .
The second is a good reason but not a very strong one , given that there are lots of intellectually interesting things that could be taught , many of which , given limited amounts of time , wo n't be .
The third is a good reason but again not a very strong one ; high school students do n't learn much biology and most of what they learn could probably be taught without explaining the underlying logic of why organisms are as they are .
The fourth , I think , is the best reason of all -- but the fourth depends on actually teaching the implications of evolution , which is unlikely to happen in public ( or most private ) schools .
To take the most obvious one , evolution implies that we are " as if designed " for reproductive success .
Males and females play strikingly different roles in reproduction .
Hence evolutionary theory strongly suggests that males and females should have lots of differences -- not merely reproductive machinery but distribution of abilities , behavioral patterns , and the like .
That prediction is strongly supported by empirical evidence .
For a good popular account , see Wright The Moral Animal .
But it is an implication inconsistent with a good deal of modern ideology , most obviously the main -- but not only - - strain of modern feminism .
There are quite a lot of other implications for our species .
For instance , theory suggests and evidence supports a pattern for species such as ours , with pair mating and offspring that require substantial care , of monogamy tempered by adultery , with good evolutionary reasons for both the monogamy and the adultery .
While there are surely some people who find none of the implications offensive -- myself , for instance -- I doubt they make up even a large minority of the population .
Hence we are unlikely to see the parts of evolutionary theory most useful to ordinary people - - its implications for understanding our own species -- taught .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - When Oscar the Cat visits residents of the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Providence , Rhode Island , the staff jumps into action -- Oscar can sense within hours when someone is about to die .
In his two years living in Steere ’s end - stage dementia unit , Oscar has been at the bedside of more than 25 residents shortly before they died , according to Dr. David Dosa of Brown University in Providence .
He wrote about Oscar in the New England Journal of Medicine .
“ It ’s not that the cat is consistently there first , ” Dr. Joan Teno , a professor of community health at Brown University , who sees patients in the unit .
“ But the cat always does manage to make an appearance , and it always seems to be in the last two hours . ”
Raised at the nursing home since he was a kitten , Oscar often checks in on residents , but when he curls up for a visit , physicians and nursing home staff know it ’s time to call the family .
“ I do n’t think this is a psychic cat , ” said Teno .
“ I think there ’s probably a biochemical explanation , ” she said in a telephone interview .
While pets are often used to bring comfort to the elderly in nursing home settings , Oscar ’s talent is special , though not unexpected .
“ That is such a cat thing to do , ” said Thomas Graves , a feline expert and chief of small animal medicine at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine .
Graves said there is no evidence to suggest cats can sense death , but he does n’t discount it for a minute .
“ Those things are hard to study .
I think probably dogs and cats can sense things we can ’t , ” he said .
On a particular day detailed by Dr. Dosa , Oscar settled onto the bed of a patient in room 313 .
His presence sent staff off to make calls and set up vigil .
When a grandson asked why the cat was there , his mother explained : “ He is here to help Grandma get to heaven , ” according to Dosa ’s account .
She died a half an hour later .

Owing to radio’s aptitude in transporting information , our planet is endlessly peppered by man-made low - frequency radiation .
Phone conversations , computer data , text messages , radar echoes , sitcoms , and morning DJ chatter are all electromagnetically belched in every direction at the speed of light⁠ — including straight up into outer space .
Purveyors of science fiction are fond of exploring the ramifications of this radio leakage , suggesting that someday an advanced alien race might materialize to befriend , enslave , or destroy humanity after a little electromagnetic eavesdropping from afar .
Indeed , if there happen to be any radio - savvy civilizations within 114 light years of Earth⁠ — an area which encompasses roughly fifteen thousand stars⁠ — humanity ’s earliest meaningful transmissions will have already reached them .
Similar speculation appears in science non-fiction , such as the Search for Extra - Terrestrial Intelligence ( SETI ) project , which strains its giant radio ears for extraterrestrial signals .
When consulting the wisdom of probability , one finds that the universe ought to be teeming with technology - toting aliens ; but aside from a couple of interesting - but - inconclusive detections , no discernibly intelligent patterns have ever been observed by Earth ’s space - listening instruments .
One might surmise that the conspicuous silence is “ evidence of absence , ” but such a conclusion might be a bit premature under the circumstances .
Outer space , as it was aptly put by the late Douglas Adams , is vastly , hugely , mind - bogglingly big .
Astronomy ’s most up - to - date observations and calculations number the stars in the visible universe at somewhere around seventy sextillion ( 7 x 1022 ) , an incomprehensible value which is seldom welcome in polite company .
This figure is so formidable that any attempt to scale it for human consumption results in such impotent analogies as “ ten times as many stars as grains of sand on all the world ’s beaches and deserts ; ” or , “ ten trillion stars for every man , woman , and child on Earth . ”
An infrared image of the core of the Milky Way galaxy
At least two hundred billion of these stars reside within our own 13 - billion - year - old galaxy , along with millions or billions of planets and moons .
Considering the abundance of potential habitats and the amount time our galaxy has been around , it seems inconceivable that our ordinary planet is the only one which has produced intelligent , signal - radiating life .
Even if a solar system ’s odds of developing intelligent life is only one - in - a - billion , that means that the Milky Way should be home to two hundred or so past or present civilizations , in addition to some seventy billion amongst the other galaxies .
In 1950 , famed physicist Enrico Fermi was one of the first to popularize the discrepancy between probable and observable life in the universe .
While lunching with colleagues and discussing the notion of interstellar neighbors , Fermi summed up the question by wondering aloud , “ Where is everybody ? ”
Thereafter the inconsistency was known as the Fermi Paradox .
The paradox is a product of science ’s mediocrity principle , the observation that the Earth seems to be an ordinary planet orbiting an ordinary star within an ordinary galaxy .
It follows , therefore , that Earth - like planets are probably somewhat common .
In 1961 , a collection of ten distinguished scientists and engineers known as The Order of the Dolphin set upon a quest to remedy this astronomical shortcoming in our knowledge .
They pondered the possibility of employing massive radio telescopes to scan the sky for stray extraterrestrial signals , a concept which eventually evolved into SETI .
During these early discussions , astronomer Dr. Frank Drake first described a formula intended to estimate the number of technologically advanced civilizations within the galaxy at a given time .
To this day the Drake Equation remains as a framework for extraterrestrial speculation .
The equation is essentially an elaborate “ what if ” question , and there is much fist - shaking and spittle - making debate regarding most correct inputs , but as we gradually increase our knowledge of the universe , our guesses for these values become increasingly educated , and the equation helps us to imagine how much life the universe might contain .
Editor ’s Note :
This interactive predates mobile browsers , so it may not work correctly in small viewports .
Even when using somewhat conservative inputs , the Drake Equation suggests that our own humble galaxy is home to at least one other advanced civilization at present , along with the lingering physical and electromagnetic remains of many others .
Massive radio telescopes have scoured the sky for such alien signals , including efforts by the Big Ear Observatory in Ohio ; the Very Large Array ( VLA ) in New Mexico ; and the famous Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico , the largest single - aperture telescope ever constructed .
In forty - seven years of signal - seeking , SETI twice detected signals of possibly intelligent origins ⁠ —
The “ Wow ! ” signal in 1977 , and Radio Source SHGb02+14a in 2004 .
But both had plausible Earthly explanations , so science must assume for now that they were not of extraterrestrial origin .
The failure to find any stray radio evidence is taken by some as an indication there may indeed be something special about our planet and its location in the cosmos .
The Rare Earth hypothesis is the antithesis to the mediocrity principle , suggesting that complex life requires an extremely uncommon combination of astrophysical and geological events and circumstances : a slightly tilted planet with just the right chemistry , a large moon , a suitably metallic sun , and an orbit at just the right distance .
Attenuation of electromagnetic signals
The hypothesis also advances the notion that there is a narrow galactic habitable zone where radiation levels are survivable , rogue meteors are few , and gravitational perturbations from neighboring stars are negligible .
If all life relies upon such factors , then Rare Earth resolves the Fermi Paradox .
The hypothesis carries the faint odor of anthropomorphic bias , however , since it assumes that all complex life must be very much like humans .
All these factors aside , there is one additional daunting obstacle which complicates any effort to tune in to intergalactic radio .
Even if the universe is thick with signal - slinging civilizations , including some old enough that their indiscriminate electromagnetism has had sufficient time to reach Earth , not even the most massive and sensitive equipment of science is currently capable of plucking the signal from the static .
When any non-focused electromagnetic signal is generated ⁠— such as a television broadcast or a cell phone conversation⁠ — the energy propagates as a spherical wavefront at the speed of light .
When a sphere is doubled in diameter , its surface area increases by a factor of four ; but in a spherical wave the “ surface area ” is the energy itself .
This means the signal ’s energy is spread over four times more area at twice the distance , resulting in a 75 % loss in intensity .
To put it another way , in order for a broadcasting tower to double its effective range for a given receiver , it must quadruple its transmitting power .
To demonstrate the degrading effect of distance on an everyday omnidirectional signal , one might imagine a spacecraft equipped with an Arecibo - style radio receiver directed towards the Earth .
If this hypothetical spacecraft were to set out for the interstellar medium , its massive 305 - meter wide dish would lose its tenuous grip on AM radio before reaching Mars .
Somewhere en route to Jupiter , the UHF television receivers would spew nothing but static .
Before passing Saturn , the last of the FM radio stations would fade away , leaving all of Earth ’s electromagnetic chatter behind well before leaving our own solar system .
If a range - finding radar beam from Earth happened to intersect the ship ’s path , it would be observable from a much greater distance ; though its short duration and smooth , Gaussian meaninglessness would make it an inconclusive detection⁠ — much like the Wow ! signal and Radio Source SHGb02+14a .
A highly focused beam such as that used to communicate with space probes would also remain detectable for some distance beyond the edge of the solar system .
If , hypothetically , A ) a race of extra-intelligent extraterrestrials happened to reside in the nearby Alpha Centauri star system , B ) they happened to broadcast a 5 Megawatt UHF television signal , and C ) we were fortunate enough to be pointing the mighty Arecibo telescope directly towards the source when it arrived four years later , we would still be unable to enjoy the zany capers of the Alpha Centauri equivalent of Mork & Mindy .
In order to detect such a signal from this relatively proximate star , a dish with a diameter of 33,000 kilometers would be required .
Even using Very Long Baseline Interferometry to link two Arecibo - style radio telescopes on opposite sides of the planet⁠ — thereby providing a virtual radio telescope the size of the entire Earth⁠ — our antenna area would still be 20,244 kilometers too small .
By coupling the laws of probability with our best current observations , we can be reasonably confident that some fraction of the 70,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 star systems in the visible universe are home to radio - sending species .
It may indeed be that our planet is subjected to an unending spray of alien TV and radio signals , though they ’d be attenuated beyond our best hardware ’s receiving extremes .
Unless we dramatically improve our interstellar listening skills , or some alien race makes a specific and vigorous attempt to send us a message , there is little chance that we Earthlings will be trading messages with our astronomical neighbors anytime soon .

Yesterday , John McCain asked his foes on the right to “ just calm down a little . ”
He was talking about Rush Limbaugh , Ann Coulter , Sean Hannity and other conservative big - mouths who in recent days have pumped up the volume of their anti-McCain crusade .
Just the day before , James Dobson , a leading social conservative who heads Focus on the Family , declared , “ I am convinced Senator McCain is not a conservative , and in fact has gone out of is way to stick his thumb in the eyes of those who are . ”
( Last year , Dobson also accused Fred Thompson of not being a real Christian . )
As the Republican Establishment swings behind McCain–each day his campaign sends out several emails noting this or that endorsement from a GOP figure –the conservative ideologues are holding firm .
This is setting up a dramatic split between the GOP elite and the conservative movement ’s leading influentials .
The ideologues hate McCain for several reasons .
He has pushed bipartisan , Democratic - backed legislation on campaign finance reform , global warming , and , worse , immigration reform .
He never got on his knees before the conservatives –particularly the religious right .
In 2000 , he blasted Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for exerting too much influence over his party .
And–egads ! –he has been a favorite of Washington journalists , that band of well - known , America - hating liberals .
The fact that McCain has been a prominent champion of the Iraq war–the number one issue for most of his detractors–means nothing to these ingrates .
Today , McCain is appearing at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference , a gathering of hundreds , if not thousands , of rightwing activists .
Imagine John Kerry speaking to a convention of Swift Boat Veterans for the Truth .
( My colleague Jonathan Stein will have a report on McCain ’s appearance later . )
But if McCain believes he can make nice with the rightwing talkers , he ’s kidding himself .
This group–especially Limbaugh , Hannity , and Coulter–have no incentive to be pragmatic .
They each earn much money by being provocative .
Their first loyalty is to their audience , which expects hard - edged ideological warfare from them .
They go soft–or reasonable–and they risk their reputations .
It ’s possible McCain could engage in an act of self - flagellation so extreme , his right - wing critics could claim victory and boast that he kissed their rings .
But in the absence of such a move , they will keep pounding him .
It makes good TV and radio .
So if the Democrats are stuck with a months - long battle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , the GOP could have on its hand a never - ending cat - fight between its nominees and the spiritual leaders of the conservative movement .
As of now , the conflict between Obama and Clinton has not gone so far that it cannot be resolved when that race is done .
The McCain wars on the right could continue right up to Election Day .

Report : ' Bush the Decider ' related to ' Vlad the Impaler ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday October 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Following the revelation that Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) , Vice President Dick Cheney and President George W. Bush are distant relations , the New York Post decided to report on some of Bush 's other relatives .
Most of Bush 's ancestors came to America in colonial times , and through them he -- like tens of thousands of other Americans -- is related to a large number of earlier presidents , as well as to both Dick Cheney and John Kerry .
Bush also turns out to be related to Vlad the Impaler -- the medieval tyrant who was one of the inspirations for the fictional Count Dracula .
Some critics might say that Bush has certain things in common with Vlad , who is still honored by many Romanians for having saved their country from invasion by the Muslim Ottoman Turks .
Vlad was a paranoid and bloodthirsty despot , however , who ruled through torture and murder .
According to Crime Library , " During his tenure , he killed by the droves , impaling on a forest of spikes around his castle thousands of subjects who he saw as either traitors , would - be traitors or enemies to the security of Romania and the Roman Catholic Church .
Sometimes , he slew merely to show other possible insurgents and criminals just what their fate would be if they became troublesome .
A pamphlet published in Nuremburg , Germany , immediately following his death in 1476 , tells of his burning beggars after allowing them free food at his court .
' He felt they were eating the people 's food for nothing , and could not repay it , ' the broadside explains . "
CNN reported at the time of the 2004 election that " Bush has closer ties to Dracula [ than John Kerry ] , going back 32 generations to the former ruler of Transylvania and what is now southern Romania .
Kerry has to go back 34 generations in the family tree . "
On a lighter note , Bush is also a relative of such celebrities as Brad Pitt , Hugh Hefner , and Marilyn Monroe , plus , more distantly , Madonna , Celine Dion , and Tom Hanks .
The following video is from CBS 's Early Show , broadcast on October 29 , 2007 .

A Delaware school district has agreed to revise its policies on religion as part of a settlement with two Jewish families who had sued over the pervasiveness of Christian prayer and other religious activities in the schools .
One family said it was forced to leave its home in Georgetown because of an anti-Semitic backlash .
The settlement , which was approved Tuesday , includes payments to the families that both sides would not disclose .
Although the settlement resolves many complaints in the suit , against the Indian River School District , the parties are proceeding with litigation over the school board practice of beginning its sessions with prayer .
Lawyers for the plaintiffs and defendants said their clients were satisfied with the settlement .
On local blogs , the anger many people felt toward the families for protesting Christian prayer at school events has flared anew .
Mona Dobrich , 41 , whose family was a plaintiff in the suit , said such a furious reaction had exacted a profound toll on her family and might indicate that the settlement would alter little on the ground .

COPENHAGEN , Feb 16 ( Reuters ) - Gangs of rioters set fire to cars and garbage trucks in northern Copenhagen on Friday , the sixth night of rioting and vandalism that has spread from the capital to other Danish cities , police said on Saturday .
Five youths were arrested in the capital on Friday after 28 cars and 35 garbage trucks were burned , Copenhagen police duty officer Jakob Kristensen told Reuters .
Danish media said arrests in other towns brought to 29 the number of people police were holding .
Scores of cars and several schools have been vandalised or burned in the past week .
Police could give no reason , but said that unusually mild weather and the closure of schools for a winter break might have contributed .
Police arrested two Tunisians and a Dane of Moroccan descent on Tuesday for planning to kill a cartoonist who drew one of the cartoons printed in a Danish newspaper two years ago that roused a storm of protest in Muslim countries .
Fifteen Danish newspapers reprinted his drawing on Wednesday in protest against the alleged murder plot .
Several hundred Muslims gathered in central Copenhagen on Friday to protest against publication of the cartoon .
Most Muslims consider depictions of the founder of Islam offensive .
Social workers said the arrests , the reprinting of the cartoon and protests against its appearance might have fuelled the riots .
Publication of the cartoons two years ago led to protests and rioting in Muslim countries in which at least 50 people were killed and three Danish embassies attacked .
In October police arrested more than 400 people in Copenhagen after demonstrators evicted from a youth centre earlier in the year tried to occupy a new building .

What the Federal Reserve Is Doing to Solve the Credit Crunch .
This Is Getting Little Publicity .
Feb . 18 , 2008
The FED is deflating .
I define the noun deflation as " a decrease in the money supply . "
When the FED deflates , this refers to a decrease in the monetary base .
The monetary base reversed in recent days .
It is headed lower .
The crisis began on August 11 .
If we compare the adjusted monetary base on August 15 with the most recent figure , February 13 , it is down by 0.4 % on an annual basis .
This is incredible .
With all talk about the FED inflating in order to reduce the FedFunds rate , in fact it has sold T - bills and other assets , net , thereby reducing the monetary base .
Look at the chart for M1 .
It does not precisely reflect the monetary base , but it comes close .
The figure for February 18 , 2008 is below the figure for the first week of January , 2007 .
There was a spike upward in August .
Then it fell back in late August , bounced around , but headed generally lower .
It fell like a stone in the first week of January .
Note : I have written a detailed report on M1 as the most reliable monetary indicator of price inflation over the following year .
Click here .
This is confirmed by a report released last week by the New York FED , Domestic Open Market Operations During 2007 .
Chart 9 on page 16 tells the story .
The FED has been deflating !
This is not what the public is being told by the financial media , including the " hard money " media .
Then why is the FedFunds rate in the 3 % range ?
Because the T - bill rate is at 2.2 % .
Short rates are falling because there is a move to safety .
It is the fear of recession , not the FED 's non-existent policy of inflation , that is driving the credit markets .
Why is the FED deflating ?
There is no public explanation .
I do n't think the general investing public knows that the FED is deflating .
So , the FED offers no explanation .
My guess : fear of a falling dollar internationally .
If it is not this , then I do not understand the policy .
Those who expect near - term price inflation to continue at 3 % or higher will be disappointed .
Those who think that the precious metals are rising because of a looming threat of price inflation in the United States are mistaken .
All is not what is seems .
But , then again , it rarely is .
Do not be stampeded by warnings of imminent price inflation .
Those warnings will be valid one of these days , or years , but not in 2008 .
Pay no attention to the little bearded man behind the curtain , who told the Senate Banking Committee on February 14 , " At present , my baseline outlook involves a period of sluggish growth , followed by a somewhat stronger pace of growth starting later this year as the effects of monetary and fiscal stimulus begin to be felt . "
There has been no monetary stimulus so far .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday that British territory was used to transport two suspects in the CIA 's rendition program .
David Miliband said two suspects in the CIA rendition program were transported via British soil .
The British government previously had said it played no part in the program .
The foreign secretary said Thursday 's revelations were the result of " new information " the United States gave to Britain last Friday .
The U.S. State Department said it regretted Britain was given wrong information and called it " an administrative error . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said : " We express regret that we initially provided inaccurate information to a good friend and ally . "
Miliband told the House of Commons that two flights , each carrying a U.S. detainee , refueled in 2002 in Diego Garcia , a British territory in the Indian Ocean .
Miliband said the U.S. government had assured Britain that no U.S. detainees were ever held on Diego Garcia .
Do n't Miss CIA flights to Greenland investigated
He said the planes only refueled at the U.S. facility on the island , and the detainees never left the plane .
He said a U.S. investigation showed no record of any other rendition through Diego Garcia or any other UK territory since then .
Then - Prime Minister Tony Blair assured the government 's Intelligence and Security Committee last March that the United States had never rendered any detainees through the UK or its overseas territories since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The committee released a report last June saying it was satisfied with the findings .
Miliband said the government had a " deep disappointment " about the late news of the rendition flights , but he said Britain believed the United States acted " in good faith " when it made the initial assurances that no flights had taken place .
" Secretary Rice has underlined to me the firm U.S. understanding that there will be no rendition through the UK , UK airspace or overseas territories without express British government permission , " he said .
Mike Gapes , chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee , was less forgiving about the late information .
His committee published its annual report on human rights last April in which it already expressed concerns about rendition .
" The fact that the United States Bush Administration has clearly misled or lied to our government has resulted in our government inadvertently misleading a select committee of this house and members of this house , " Gapes said .
" The United States administration has to bear in mind that this is a most serious matter and we do not wish to see it repeated . "
CNN obtained a copy of a message CIA Director Mike Hayden sent to CIA employees in which he said the information surfaced late last year when the agency " took a fresh look " at records of rendition flights .
He said it was important to take responsibility for the error .
" Given our mission , CIA could have no interest in a process destined to produce bad intelligence , " he wrote .
In his message , Hayden says speculation about a CIA holding facility on Diego Garcia -- and allegations that the detainees are transported for the purpose of torture -- are " false . "
" Torture is against our laws and our values , " Hayden wrote .
The European Parliament and human rights groups have condemned the CIA 's practice of rendition , in which the United States moved a suspected terrorist in CIA custody from one country to another .
Critics claim the suspects are turned over to foreign intelligence services who use harsher interrogation methods , including torture .
As for the two detainees transported through Diego Garcia , Miliband said neither was a British national or resident .
One is currently being held at Guantanamo Bay and the other has been released , he said .

Submitted by Rich_Rodriguez on March 7 , 2007 - 12:39 am .
I want to tell you a story of a recent debate I had .
The debate was with a local fundamentalist Christian pastor .
Before the debate , I learned a thing or two about the approach this pastor usually takes .
I learned that he never really intended to have a real debate with me and was going to rely heavily on an appeal to ignorance and faith .
He intended to ridicule me while I gave serious concise arguments by simply parrying them with faith .
So , in light of this new evidence I presented the following introduction to the debate .
( Opening statement )
Rich : “ I have FAITH that Christianity is completely and unequivocally false ! ! ” ---
I have just completely destroyed your religion and I am sorry but understand it was bound to happen .
What will you do now that I have completely dismantled any argument you could possibly use in defense of your religion ?
Well I hope it all works out for you and thank you for coming . ”
( Gathers notes and proceeds to leave the building ) .
* An odd rustling of chairs and whispers permeates through the church .
The congregation ( now in shock ) struggles frantically to come to grips with what has just transpired .
About half way down the aisle I hear the pastor ’s voice as he speaks very angrily into the mic *
Pastor : ” WHERE ARE YOU GOING ! ” ; “ WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? ”
( Still with my back towards the angry pastor )
Rich : “ The debate is over ; I have just proved your religion false ” .
Pastor : “ Simply stating that you have faith my religion is false proves absolutely nothing ! ”
( I stop in my tracks , turn and now armed with a mischievous grin from ear to ear say :
Rich : “ Well sir , now that we have established that faith proves absolutely nothing --- let ’s have a debate . ”
( I then proceeded to kick the living shit out of every one of his arguments with a real sense of pity for the old bastard .
He really never recovered from the first 30 seconds of the debate . )
Other variants :
This technique comes in handy if you think you will have a subject that is easily baited into a trap like this .
If you get no response , you can try several variants on this same theme .
It ’s important to give the audience enough time to process your statement of faith .
It is also important that the message be communicated as loudly and clearly as possible ( within reason that is ) .
If you get no response try returning to the podium and saying something like this :
Now how many of you think I have completely dismantled your religion with that statement of faith ?
Did I sway you in the least ?
Really look into your heart or hearts and tell me what it is telling you ?
( This is mumbo jumbo Xian talk , obviously the heart does not speak but they do n’t know that ) .
Are your views any different now that they were 30 seconds ago ?
No , they are not are they ?
- Simply stating that I have faith your religion is false proved absolutely nothing .
So as you have just seen , with your own feelings and emotions bearing witness - just how unpersuasive and meaningless an appeal to faith really is .
Simply declaring faith proves absolutely nothing !
So now that we have exposed this most illogical fallacy , let ’s have a debate without faith .
A network of individuals , independent and alternative media activists and organisations , offering grassroots , non-corporate , non-commercial coverage of important social and political issues .
Fighting Scientology - an anarchist perspective Seeing as everyone and their dog is getting in on this on the internet , now seems as good a time as any for a discussion about Scientology , the actions of its Church , and the logistics and politics of fighting against it .
One common argument against anti-Scientology campaigning is " freedom of belief . "
Under this argument , to campaign against any one religion is de facto bigotry and should be rejected .
This analysis , however , is extremely superficial .
Those Scientologists who do not work within the Church - the Free Zoners , in other words - have not been the target of nearly the same amount of attention , in spite of holding nearly identical beliefs .
Why ?
They do not behave in the same way .
The infamous South Park episode targetting Scientology was both a blessing and a curse .
On the one hand , it exposed the core Scientology beliefs for what they are - poorly written science fiction with a bit of pseudopsychology thrown in for good measure .
It may be possible that some people who would otherwise have joined the Church will have seen this and become skeptical in general .
On the other hand , however , it reduced the problems with Scientology down to it being a scam to make money by selling people religion - putting things in much more favourable terms for the church , in that the complaint becomes about what they believe , rather than what the church has done and continues to do .
This is not an issue of belief , it is an issue of action .
The Church 's history in this regard is well known , but just as a summary :
- Operation Freakout , an escalating plan of harassment against a woman who wrote a book critical of the church intended to result in her being sectioned .
- Operation Snow White , an attempt by Church of Scientology officials to have negative records about individuals and the organisation as a whole purged from government records .
- Extremely aggressive attack techniques against enemies and heretics , including regular harassment .
- Abuse of the law to attack splinter groups and suppress dissent and criticism , especially over the Internet .
The wikipedia article on Scientology controversies gives a fairly good introduction ; sadly it does n't even begin to cover the problems caused by this organisation .
On the realm of actions , another regular complaint against taking action against the Church is that it is only one such organisation among many .
This does bear noting - pretty much any religious ( or non-religious ) organisation of appropriate size or age is going to have its problems .
Why , then , " single out " Scientology ?
The first is , quite simply , that it 's easier .
Scientology , while it has a worryingly high profile , has a relatively low number of members .
It 's a young movement that has yet to take serious root .
Taking on an organisation of this type has certain advantages over an older , larger institution tied in with history and politics and all the complications they bring .
Secondly , I would argue that the Church of Scientology is , if not " worse " in some objective sense , markedly different from other institutions such as the Vatican .
While no - one can deny the bloody legacy of Christendom , it is largely a concept of the past .
The more recent history of the Catholic Church has seen its share of scandal ( such as the child sex abuse controversy ) and been rightly met with condemnation .
The greatest condemnation in this was not simply that the abuse was happening in individual cases ( which could , if not be excused , at least not be used to tar the entirety of the church ) , but that church officials higher up were aware of the situation and actively trying to cover it up .
It is this that marks the difference between the odd " bad apple " and a rotten barrel .
With the Church of Scientology , most , if not all , of the controversies associated with it have occured on an official level , and thus cannnot be dismissed as simply a few individual churches here and there going wrong .
Orders for harassment , orders singling out targets , Freakout , Snow White , the lawsuits that have bankrupted people time and again - all of these were planned and carries out at the highest levels with involvement down the chain as appropriate .
Another complaint against targetting the CoS is that by using certain tactics the attacker is " no better than them . "
This is reductionist idiocy that analyses actions only in terms of the action itself and not its outcome and should be ignored .
Why , then , should we fight it ?
There are a few reasons .
Free expression .
Much of the information we have about the Church of Scientology , its beliefs , practices , and internal memoranda ( including the Fair Game policy ) comes from documents released anonmyously via the Internet .
Some of its members left the church as a result of websites such as Operation Clambake .
In response , the Church of Scientology has repeatedly attempted to censor the Internet - from an attempt to have a Scientology discussion group removed from Usenet to their intimidation of Google to have Operation Clambake removed from results , to the multiple lawsuits against websites hosting anti-Scientology materials ( see www.chillingeffects.org - search for Scientology ) .
For every step forward the CoS makes in its attempts at intimidation and censorship , a precedent is set for the rest of us .
Protection for the vulnerable .
Some of the Church 's actions are directly aimed at people who are vulnerable , specifically Narconon ( drug counselling ) and Criminon ( criminal rehabilitation ) .
The methods they use are based on Hubbard 's writings and both organisations are staffed by Scientologists .
Their treatment , however , has no history of effectiveness and is believed by many to do more harm than good , as well as acting as a front for recruitment to the church .
They are trying to gain influence .
The Church has been trying to get close to police in London , through giving gifts of large amounts of money to individual cops and other activities .
Similarly they have attempted to get their materials taught in school , and in some cases succeeded .
Their activities in Clearwater , Florida , known as Project Normandy , read as the plan of an organisation seeking to completely take over a town .
Their aims , however , are much wider .
They are a sinister destructive cult .
This , more than anything else , needs to be kept clear .
The activities of the Church of Scientology from its inception to the present day have been calculated to sap money and energy from those who put their faith in it .
This is not a matter of freedom of religion .
It is a matter of freedom .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Transistor radios tinier than a grain of sand , made using nanotechnology , can not only tune in to the traffic report , but may end up outperforming current silicon - based electronics , U.S. researchers said on Monday .
The researchers made the microscopic radios out of carbon nanotubes -- tiny strands of carbon atoms -- and say in theory they could lead to faster devices .
They overcame a series of obstacles that have defeated efforts to make nano - radios , including getting amplification , by making their devices on quartz wafers .
“ Our goal is not to make tiny radios per se , but really to develop nanotubes as a higher - performing semiconductor , ” said John Rogers , a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois .
He said the devices are meant to showcase a new way of making carbon nanotubes in perfectly aligned rows , much like strands of silky hair that have been combed flat .
These strands are a hundred thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair , forming a thin layer of semiconductor material that can be used in electronics devices and circuits .
“ The radio is really a step along the path to building new platforms for electronics technology , ” said Rogers , whose study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
“ We ’re interested in nanotubes not because they are small but because smallness imparts some electronic properties that are very appealing , ” he said .
“ You could make a faster device . ”
He said a key to the work is to gain control over what shapes the tubes take and how they are configured .
The researchers make the tubes by combining carbon and heat and a catalyst on a special wafer material that makes the tubes line up in an orderly way .
“ There are millions of them all in these perfectly aligned arrays , ” Rogers said .
After they have made the arrays of tubes , he said the rest of the process is very similar to making electronics using conventional silicon chips .
The researchers teamed up with radio frequency electronics engineers at Northrop Grumman Corp Electronics Systems in Linthicum , Maryland , to build and test the radios .
They consist of two radio frequency amplifiers , a radio frequency mixer and an audio amplifier , all made from the carbon nanotube materials .
Regular - sized headphones plug directly into an output transistor made from the nanotube material .
And they used a regular - sized antenna .
In one test , the researchers tuned one of the nanotube - transistor radios to a Baltimore radio station and picked up the traffic report .
Rogers said the device could work better and have less distortion than some of the tiniest silicon chip technology used today .
“ The radio itself is not interesting , ” Rogers said .
“ But the fact that we are at a point that we can do things like a radio is a good milestone for us . ”

HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. space agency has dismissed the male astronaut involved in a love triangle that led to a bizarre confrontation between a female astronaut and another woman in a Florida airport , a spokesman said on Friday .
William Oefelein , 42 , who admitted to an affair with fellow astronaut Lisa Nowak that began when both were married , is being sent back to the U.S. Navy effective June 1 , a NASA Johnson Space Agency spokesman said .
He was told Wednesday .
Nowak , also a Naval officer , was dismissed from the U.S. astronaut corps in March and sent back to the Navy .
She awaits trial in September on attempted kidnapping , burglary and assault charges after police said she drove from Houston to Orlando , Florida , in February to confront another woman Oefelein was dating .
Orlando airport security video showed Nowak wearing a trenchcoat , confronting Air Force Capt .
Colleen Shipman in the parking lot and dousing her with pepper spray .
Police said Nowak had a knife , a steel mallet and a BB pistol when arrested .
She had worn diapers during the 1,000 - mile ( 1,670 - km ) drive to avoid having to stop , police said .
Oefelein has divorced since his affair with Nowak .
She has separated from her husband .
Each flew in space once -- she in July 2006 , he last December .
Oefelein was a space shuttle pilot and Nowak was a shuttle robot arm operator .
Luxim HQ ( TGW ) – Lightbulb maker Luxim has raised $ 21 million for its long lasting high intensity discharge ( HID ) lightbulb that creates light using radio waves .
The lamp uses a radio frequency amplifier to pump RF waves to an antenna inside a resonant cavity .
The interaction between the waves and the crystal cavity convert trapped gases into a plasma .
Luxim ’s bulbs get 120 lumens per watt , compared to the HID standard of only 90 lumens per watt .
Compare that to LEDs , which get about 70 lumens per watt and a 100 watt 120 volt incandescent lightbulb will produce about 17.1 lumens per watt .
Therefore , the bulbs are more efficient .
It has a 5 times lifetime over regular bulbs , as well .

A polar vortex in 3 - D at Venus ' south pole , as seen by the VIRTIS instrument on board ESA 's Venus Express .
Venusis more Earth - like than previously thought — including lightning where theoryheld that none could exist .
Venusis the world closest to Earth in terms of size , mass , distance and chemicalmakeup , but while Earth is a haven for life , Venus is typically described as hellish , with a crushing atmosphere holding choking clouds of sulfuric acid over a rockydesert surface hot enough to melt lead .
TheVenus Express mission that the European Space Agency launchedin 2005 is now shedding light not just how Venus became the daunting worldit is , but also how it still remains somewhat Earth - like .
Thespacecraft intriguingly found evidence of lightning on the planet , even thoughnone should exist .
The clouds of Venus are like smog clouds on Earth , which donot generate lightning here .
Theprobe did not actually see visible flashes in Venus ' sky , but it did spot" whistlers " — low - frequency radio waves that last for a split - secondand are thought to come from electrical discharges .
" Weconsider this the first definitive evidence of abundant lightning onVenus , " said researcher David Grinspoon .
" So how much lightning isthere ?
If the high latitudes are typical , we can extrapolate to the planet as awhole there are about 50 lightning flashes per second , about half the rate onEarth , but it 's possibly higher . "
Justas lightningalters chemistry on Earth — creating ozone and smog components such asnitrogen oxides — so too do researchers expect lightning to have profound effectson Venus .
" New models of Venus ' atmosphere and climate need to includethis new fact , " Grinspoon said .
VenusExpress also focused on vastrotating vortexes of clouds at Venus ' poles .
These vortexes are reminiscentof vortexes that appear over the poles on Earth in the winter of eachhemisphere .
Although the vortexes on Venus are larger and more energetic thanEarth 's , in many respects they are quite similar , researchers said .
Thespace mission also shed light on how Earth - like Venus was .
For instance , Venus mayhave had Earth - like oceans in its distant past , but its searing hot surfacecannot sustain water now .
Although vast volumes of water vapor are not now seenin Venus ' atmosphere , new findings suggest how a great deal of water may havebeen lost .
Venusdoes not have a strong magnetic field as Earth does , meaning that sunlightcould then have broken up the water into hydrogen and oxygen that then easilyescaped the planet 's atmosphere .
Scientists had seen hydrogen leaving fromVenus , but now they also have seen oxygen depart .
" Learningabout the escape rates of hydrogen and oxygen will help us reconstruct how muchwater Venus had in the past , " Grinspoon said .
" Venus may have lost atleast up to an Earth 's ocean 's worth of water . "
Thescientists discussed their findings in a teleconference with reporters todayand detail the work in the Nov. 29 issue of the journal Nature .
Following a post on the DomainState forum today , a number news and blogs have criticized Network Solutions for front running domain names that customers try to register .
( See for instance today 's report on DomainNameNews ) .
Jonathon Nevett , Vice President of Policy at Network Solutions , has offered the following in response to the news break :
" I 'd like to clarify what we are doing .
In response to customer concerns about Domain Name Front Running ( domains being registered by someone else just after they have conducted a domain name search ) , we have implemented a security measure to protect our customers .
The measure will kick in when a customer searches for an available domain name at our website , but decides not to purchase the name immediately after conducting the search .
After the search ends , we will put the domain name on reserve .
During this reservation period , the name is not active and we do not monetize the traffic on these domains .
If a customer searches for the domain again during the next 4 days at networksolutions.com , the domain will be available to register .
If the domain name is not purchased within 4 days , it will be released back to the registry and will be generally available for registration .
This protection measure provides our customers the opportunity to register domains they have previously searched without the fear that the name will be already taken through Front Running .
You are correct that we are trying to take an arrow out of the quiver of the tasters .
As you know , domain tasters are the largest Front Runners .
Due to no fault of registrars , Front Runners purchase search data from Internet Service Providers and / or registries and then taste those names .
Some folks may not agree with our approach , but we are trying to prevent this malicious activity from impacting our customers . "
WASHINGTON 
The many moving parts of a mission to shoot down a dying spy satellite with an anti-missile interceptor lined up Wednesday after the space shuttle Atlantis returned to Earth , officials said .
Military officials were reviewing the weather in the Pacific Ocean to determine if the operation could be launched overnight on Wednesday , as rough seas west of Hawaii prompted officials to caution that the attempt to destroy the satellite , carrying 1,000 pounds of toxic rocket fuel , might be delayed .
The goal of the mission is to prevent the fuel tank from reaching Earth and spilling its hazardous contents in a populous area .
In the event that any of the hydrazine fuel falls on a populated area , the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Wednesday issued directions to community first responders on how to deal with dangerous debris from the satellite .
Military officials said their goal was to carry out the mission before March 1 , when the satellite is predicted to start skidding against the upper reaches of the atmosphere .
That initial friction would bump the satellite into a more unpredictable orbit around the Earth , even before it starts a fiery descent through the atmosphere .
The controversy was unparalleled in a country where criticism of the Roman Catholic church is normally muted .
The Pope had been due to speak tomorrow during ceremonies marking the start of the academic year at Rome 's largest and oldest university , La Sapienza .
But the Vatican said last night it had been " considered opportune to postpone " his visit .
The announcement followed a break - in and sit -in at the rector 's office yesterday by about 50 students and a furious row over a letter signed by more than 60 of La Sapienza 's teachers , asking that the invitation to the Pope be rescinded .
The signatories of the letter said Benedict 's presence would be " incongruous " .
They cited a speech he made at La Sapienza in 1990 , while he was still a cardinal , in which he quoted the judgment of an Austrian philosopher of science who wrote that the church 's trial of Galileo was " reasonable and fair " .
The letter said : " These words offend and humiliate us . "
Among the signatories was the physicist Prof Luciano Maiani , who was recently appointed to head Italy 's main scientific research body , the Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche .
Maiani said he had later dropped his opposition to the visit after learning that the Pope would not be making the keynote address .
But the daily La Stampa reported that a number of foreign scientists had since added their names to the initiative .
One students ' group declared an " anti-clerical week " to protest at the Pope 's presence .
Among numerous banners and placards put up around the campus , there was one that read : " Galileo recanted .
We shall hold out against the papacy . "
The Pope is known for his deeply conservative outlook and the controversy is the latest in a string of rows since his election three years ago .
He upset Muslims with another quotation in an academic lecture , on that occasion from a medieval Byzantine emperor .
He has since been criticised by Latin Americans for his views on the colonisation of their continent and by Protestants for saying their denominations ought not to be considered as churches .
The newspaper Il Giornale , which republished his 1990 speech , said the Pope had " expressed a different position " from that of the Austrian scholar Paul Feyerabend , " absolutely not adopting it as his own " .
The Vatican 's own daily , L'Osservatore Romano , carried an article by the Jewish mathematician Giorgio Israel , in which he wrote that the Pope 's address " could well be considered , by anyone who read it with a minimum of attention , as a defence of Galilean rationality against the scepticism and relativism of postmodern culture " .
Speaking before last night 's announcement , Italy 's deputy prime minister , Francesco Rutelli , said : " The attempt to silence [ Benedict ] in a place that is a forum for study , teaching and dialogue ... seems inconceivable . "
He noted that a pope had founded La Sapienza in 1303 .
However , the trade minister , Emma Bonino , said the Pope already " held the floor morning and night " .
Rightwing opposition MPs were outraged .
One suggested La Sapienza , which means " wisdom " or " learning " ought now to be renamed La Ignoranza
Backstory
· Galileo Galilei was the Inquisition 's most high profile victim .
But by recanting his view that the earth moved around the sun , he managed to pay for his defiance of Catholic teaching , not with his life , but his freedom .
· Born in Pisa in 1564 , Galileo was a polymathic genius - a physicist , astronomer and mathematician who improved both the refracting telescope and compound microscope
· After ridiculing the views of the then Pope Urban VIII in his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , Galileo was ordered to stand trial for heresy in 1633 .
The judgment found that his view of the solar system was " absurd , philosophically false , and formally heretical , because it is expressly contrary to Holy Scriptures " .
· He spent the rest of his life under house arrest on orders of the Inquisition and died in 1642 .
It was not until 1835 that his Dialogue was dropped from the Index of banned books .

Well , what a lovely campaign for Miu Miu !
When I first heard the rumors that their new face for Spring Summer 2008 was Kiki , I kindda smiled .
Not because I would n’t see Kirsten Dunst in such position , but because I wandered what would they make her look like .
And she looks wonderful !
The pictures are completely decadent , she makes a perfect contrast to the red environment with her unnatural white skin .
She looks playful and lustful but not too obvious , just perfect !
Well done Kirsten , well done Miu Miu !
What do you think ?
Is she suited for the job ?
The campaign is successful ?
BAGHDAD , Oct. 11 ( AP ) —
An attack by American forces killed 19 insurgents and 15 civilians , including 9 children , northwest of the capital on Thursday , the United States military reported .
It was one of the heaviest civilian death tolls in an American operation in recent months .
The military said its targets were senior leaders of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia , the homegrown Sunni militant group that American intelligence believes has foreign leadership .
“ We regret that civilians are hurt or killed while coalition forces search to rid Iraq of terrorism , ” said Maj .
Brad Leighton , a spokesman for American forces in Iraq , in reference to the deadly airstrike on Thursday .
“ These terrorists chose to deliberately place innocent Iraqi women and children in danger by their actions and presence . ”
NABATIYEH , Lebanon —
The 6 - year - old boy screamed and shook his head to avoid the razor blade .
But his father held him firmly as Hajj Khodor parted the boy 's black hair and sliced his forehead three times with the blade .
Ali Madani 's cries became more violent as blood gushed from the wound , covering his small , terrified face .
His father and a few other men , waving daggers , broke into a religious chant , recalling how the 7th - century Shiite Muslim saint , Imam Hussein , was decapitated , his head placed on a lance .
In marking the holiest day of Ashoura , some Shiites believe children should learn at an early age about Hussein 's suffering , which is at the heart of their faith .
Lebanon 's top Shiite cleric , Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , has banned bloodletting during Ashoura , even for adults .
Clerics in mainly Shiite Iran forbid it as well , saying the practice is un-Islamic because it harms the body .
But traditions die hard , especially in a rite as fervent and emotional as Ashoura , marked Tuesday by Shiites across the Islamic world .
In the southern Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh , hundreds of nervous young boys ranging from early teens to toddlers were ushered by their fathers into a hall hung with black banners and paintings of Hussein 's last moments .
Hajj Khodor , a businessman and organizer of the Ashoura ceremonies , and several other men wiped blades with alcohol before swiping each boy three or four times on the forehead .
Some boys cried and resisted , but the cutting proceeded .
" We 're used to it , " said Mahmoud Jaber , 43 , who brought his five boys and two girls for the ritual .
" We 've been doing this since we were kids .
I started when I was 3 .
It does n't hurt because the cry of pain goes away with the faith . "
Hussein Shihab , 13 , wrapped in a white sheet symbolizing Hussein 's burial shroud , said he felt a burning sting " from the alcohol " as the blade hit .
His father , Jaber Shihab , told Hussein not to be " a wimp , " and to " be brave " as a reporter photographed him after the cut .
It was " for the sake of Hussein " that he had his head cut , the boy said .
" Because blood came from Hussein 's head .
They cut his head off and blood flowed . "
In the Ashoura rites , Shiites march in huge processions , beating their chests in mourning for Hussein 's martyrdom at Karbala , a city in present - day Iraq in A.D. 680 .
The most fervent cut themselves with swords or razors or lash themselves with razor - lined chains to draw blood .
The bloodletting is a reminder of Hussein 's suffering , as well as punishment for the failure of Muslims to help Hussein in his battle against Islamic ruler Yazid , leader of what became the majority Sunni branch of Islam .
Hussein was the son of Ali , the Prophet Muhammad 's cousin , who Shiites believe should have been his rightful successor .
The loss at Karbala effectively consigned Shiites to minority status in the Islamic world and it became a symbol of the sense of oppression that runs through the sect 's beliefs .
Women in Ashoura processions usually confine themselves to striking their chests with their fists , without drawing blood .
But in Shiite areas of Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , India and elsewhere , processions of men marched drenched in blood along with boys .
In the Nabatiyeh hall , splashes of bright red blood covered the floor from the cutting .
Some of the children held back tears and tried to put on a brave face as Hajj Khodor sliced the skin of their foreheads .
Their reward was fruit juice and cookies .
A father shoved a pacifier into his toddler 's screaming mouth , the boy 's forehead stained with blood .
Ali Madani 's screams did not save the 6 - year - old from the razor blade .
His father , Bilal Madani , said his son was crying because the smell of blood scared him .
Afterward , Ali said he was happy he had gone through with it " for Hussein 's sake . "
What did he expect in return ?
" God will make me do well in school , " he said , sipping juice from a straw .
Hajj Khodor , wrapped in white and wearing a white turban , said he has done cuttings on boys as young as 1 - month - old and men as old as 100 .
Asked if it was difficult for him to hurt the children , he said : " The child does n't understand what 's going on .
The parents are faithful and believe by doing this , their children will be protected and will enjoy a long life . "
Hind Abinabi , a 52 - year - old Shiite woman and mother of four , said to maim children was not only cruel , but also against the religion .
" When the rest of the world is going to the moon , look where these people are still drawing blood from their heads , " she said .
One boy 's screams and resistance Tuesday did pay off .
" No , no , I do n't want it , " the terrified boy kept yelling at the top of his voice .
After a few failed attempts , his mother quietly walked him down the stairs and out of the hall .

TALLINN , Estonia , May 24 —
When Estonian authorities began removing a bronze statue of a World War II - era Soviet soldier from a park in this bustling Baltic seaport last month , they expected violent street protests by Estonians of Russian descent .
They also knew from experience that “ if there are fights on the street , there are going to be fights on the Internet , ” said Hillar Aarelaid , the director of Estonia ’s Computer Emergency Response Team .
After all , for people here the Internet is almost as vital as running water ; it is used routinely to vote , file their taxes , and , with their cellphones , to shop or pay for parking .
What followed was what some here describe as the first war in cyberspace , a monthlong campaign that has forced Estonian authorities to defend their pint - size Baltic nation from a data flood that they say was set off by orders from Russia or ethnic Russian sources in retaliation for the removal of the statue .
The Estonians assert that an Internet address involved in the attacks belonged to an official who works in the administration of Russia ’s president , Vladimir V. Putin .
カリフォルニア州サンマテオ発、DIY （Do It Yourself）の祭 典Maker Faireを象徴する人物を1人挙げるとすれば、それは間違いなくSteve Wozniak氏であろう。
だからこそ 、Wozniak氏による講演が予定されていた5月19日の午後のイベントは、同氏の話を聞こうと集まった観衆で立ち見客が出るほどの混み具合となり、予定の時間を5分過ぎてもWozniak氏が姿を見せなかったときは、ある種の戸惑いが観衆の間に広がり始めていた。
しかし、そんな心配は無用であった 。Apple Computerの共同設立者であり、コンピュータ業界の英雄的存在であるWozniak氏がセグウェイに乗ってステージ右手に現れると、客席に興奮の渦が巻き起こったのである。
サンフランシスコの南に位置する小さな町で週末を通して開催されたMaker Faireは、DIY、ハッキング、ファイアアート、ロボット、マッドサイエンティスト、マッドクラフターなど、さまざまなクリエーターを集めた祭典であるが、Wozの愛称で親しまれるWozniak氏自身も、実はこのMaker Faireに参加したのは2007年が最初ではない。
2006 年のイベントにおけるWozniak氏は、セグウェイに乗ってポロ競技に興じたぐらいであったが、今回の祭典では、数学と工学に関する熱意に満ちた講演を観衆に向けて行うことが予定されていた。
こういったテーマの演説は、一般的な講演会であれば観衆からの不満の声を招く可能性がなきにしもあらずだが、その道に秀でたエンジニアやハッカー、そして将来のWozを目指す者たちが集まるMaker Faireにとっては、まさに待ち望まれているメッセージであった。
Wozniak氏 は 「このイベントは、私が若かったころに目指していたこと、つまりじっくり考えて何か面白いものを作り上げるというコンセプトを体現したものである」と述べ、演説の口火を切った。
Wozniak氏はまるで遅刻の埋め合わせをするかのように、マシンの使い方を理解することによって得られるエネルギー（それは、今日にいたってもWozniak氏を奮い立たせ続けているエネルギーである）について熱弁をふるった。
「 目標を達成したときに得られるこの感動が一生心から離れることはない」とWozniak氏は語った。
Should the President Use E-mail ?
Presidents of the United States do n’t use e-mail , any more than they carry their own petty cash .
But there are hazards in being unwired at the top , and among the greatest of these may be an inability to get bad news when you need it .
Take President Bush , whose credibility suffered a hit this week as the U.S. intelligence community published its opinion that Iran stopped its work on nuclear weapons four years ago , contrary to the administration ’s increasingly dire warnings .
The revelation kicked off another round of Washington ’s favorite question : “ What did the President know , and when did he know it ? ”
Bush told reporters that Adm .
Mike McConnell let the him know in August that there was new intelligence on Iran , but kept him in the dark on the specifics until last week .
Democrats dispute this account as completely implausible .
If Adm. McConnell was a little slow to give Mr. Bush the bad news , part of the explanation could rest with what psychologists call “ the MUM effect , ” our ingrained reluctance to deliver undesirable messages for fear of negative repercussions .
The effect is a major driver of organizational silence , a performance - sapping affliction in which subordinates routinely fail to deliver important bad news to their superiors .
But it turns out that e-mail may be a powerful antidote to the MUM effect , by stripping away the social cues that make delivering bad news unpleasant for the messenger , and leaving the receiver less defensive about the message .
That means bad news can be delivered more readily , and with less distortion , than in person .
That ’s not to say the President would have learned about Iran ’s nuclear change of heart via e-mail .
But a president who creates a climate in which bad news can flow freely through e-mail might be more receptive to it when it counts .
Setting aside the Bush administration ’s notoriously imperfect relationship with the medium , should the 2008 presidential candidates be promising to govern better by bringing e-mail into the Oval Office ?
From Power Up To Bash Prompt

I find it frustrating that many things happen inside my Linux machine that I do not understand .
If , like me , you want to really understand your system rather than just knowing how to use it , this document should be a good place to start .
This kind of background knowledge is also needed if you want to be a top notch Linux problem solver .
I assume that you have a working Linux box , and understand some basic things about Unix and PC hardware .
If not , an excellent place to start learning is Eric S. Raymond 's The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO
It is short , very readable and covers all the basics .
The main thread in this document is how Linux starts itself up .
But it also tries to be a more comprehensive learning resource .
I have included exercises in each section .
If you actually do some of these , you will learn much more than you could by just reading .
I hope some readers will undertake the best Linux learning exercise that I know of , which is building a system from source code .
Giambattista Vico , an Italian philosopher ( 1668 - 1744 ) said ``verum ipsum factum '' , which means ``understanding arises through making ' ' .
Thanks to Alex ( see Acknowledgements ) for this quote .
If you want to ``roll your own '' , you should also see Gerard Beekmans ' Linux From Scratch HOWTO ( LFS ) .
LFS has detailed instructions on building a complete useable system from source code .
On the LFS website , you will also find a mailing list for people building systems this way .
The instructions that used to be part of this document are now in a separate document ``Building a Minimal Linux System from Source Code ' ' , and can be found at From PowerUp to Bash Prompt home page .
They explain how to ``toy '' system , purely as a learning exercise .
Packages are presented in the order in which they appear in the system startup process .
This means that if you install the packages in this order you can reboot after each installation , and see the system get a little closer to giving you a bash prompt each time .
There is a reassuring sense of progress in this .
I recommend that you first read the main text of each section , skipping the exercises and references .
Then decide how deep an understanding you want to develop , and how much effort you are prepared to put in .
Then start at the beginning again , doing the exercises and additional reading as you go .
When you first turn on your computer it tests itself to make sure everything is in working order .
This is called the ``Power on self test ' ' .
Then a program called the bootstrap loader , located in the ROM BIOS , looks for a boot sector .
A boot sector is the first sector of a disk and has a small program that can load an operating system .
Boot sectors are marked with a magic number 0xAA55 = 43603 at byte 0x1FE = 510 .
That 's the last two bytes of the sector .
This is how the hardware can tell whether the sector is a boot sector or not .
The bootstrap loader has a list of places to look for a boot sector .
My old machine looks in the primary floppy drive , then the primary hard drive .
More modern machines can also look for a boot sector on a CD - ROM .
If it finds a boot sector , it loads it into memory and passes control to the program that loads the operating system .
On a typical Linux system , this program will be LILO 's first stage boot loader .
There are many different ways of setting your system up to boot though .
See the LILO User 's Guide for details .
See section LILO for a URL .
Obviously there is a lot more to say about what PC hardware does .
But this is not the place to say it .
See one of the many good books about PC hardware .
The machine stores some information about itself in its CMOS .
This includes what disks and RAM are in the system .
The machine 's BIOS contains a program to let you modify these settings .
Check the messages on your screen as the machine is turned on to see how to access it .
On my machine , you press the delete key before it begins loading its operating system .
A good way to learn about PC hardware is to build a machine out of second hand parts .
Get at least a 386 so you can easily run Linux on it .
It wo n't cost much .
Ask around , someone might give you some of the parts you need .
Check out , download compile and make a boot disk for Unios .
( They used to have a home page at http://www.unios.org, but it disappeared )
This is just a bootable ``Hello World !'' program , consisting of just over 100 lines of assembler code .
It would be good to see it converted to a format that the GNU assembler as can understand .
Open the boot disk image for unios with a hex editor .
This image is 512 bytes long , exactly one sector .
Find the magic number 0xAA55 .
Do the same for the boot sector from a bootable floppy disk or your own computer .
You can use the dd command to copy it to a file : dd if=/dev/fd0 of=boot.sector .
Be very careful to get if ( input file ) and of ( output file ) the right way round !
Check out the source code for LILO 's boot loader .
The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO by Eric S. Raymond , especially section 3 , What happens when you switch on a computer ?
The first chapter of The LILO User 's Guide gives an excellent explanation of PC disk partitions and booting .
See section LILO for a URL .
The NEW Peter Norton Programmer 's Guide to the IBM PC & PS / 2 , by Peter Norton and Richard Wilton , Microsoft Press 1988
There is a newer Norton book , which looks good , but I can't afford it right now !
One of the many books available on upgrading PC's
When the computer loads a boot sector on a normal Linux system , what it loads is actually a part of lilo , called the ``first stage boot loader ' ' .
This is a tiny program who 's only job in life is to load and run the ``second stage boot loader ' ' .
The second stage loader gives you a prompt ( if it was installed that way ) and loads the operating system you choose .
When your system is up and running , and you run lilo , what you are actually running is the ``map installer ' ' .
This reads the configuration file / etc / lilo.conf and writes the boot loaders , and information about the operating systems it can load , to the hard disk .
There are lots of different ways to set your system up to boot .
What I have just explained is the most obvious and ``normal '' way , at least for a system who 's main operating system is Linux .
The Lilo Users ' Guide explains several examples of ``boot concepts ' ' .
It is worth reading these , and trying some of them out .
The configuration file for lilo is /etc/lilo.conf .
There is a manual page for it : type man lilo .
conf into a shell to see it .
The main thing in lilo .
conf is one entry for each thing that lilo is set up to boot .
For a Linux entry , this includes where the kernel is , and what disk partition to mount as the root filesystem .
For other operating systems , the main piece of information is which partition to boot from .
DANGER : take care with these exercises .
It is easy enough to get something wrong and screw up your master boot record and make your system unuseable .
Make sure you have a working rescue disk , and know how to use it to fix things up again .
See below for a link to tomsrtbt , the rescue disk I use and recommend .
The best precaution is to use a machine that does n't matter .
Set up lilo on a floppy disk .
It does n't matter if there is nothing other than a kernel on the floppy - you will get a ``kernel panic '' when the kernel is ready to load init , but at least you will know that lilo is working .
If you like you can press on and see how much of a system you can get going on the floppy .
This is probably the second best Linux learning activity around .
See the Bootdisk HOWTO ( url below ) , and tomsrtbt ( url below ) for clues .
Get lilo to boot unios ( see section hardware exercises for a URL ) .
As an extra challenge , see if you can do this on a floppy disk .
Make a boot - loop .
Get lilo in the master boot record to boot lilo in one of the primary partition boot sectors , and have that boot lilo in the master boot record ...
Or perhaps use the master boot record and all four primary partitions to make a five point loop .
Fun !
The lilo man page .
The Lilo package ( lilo ) , contains the ``LILO User 's Guide ' ' lilo -u-21.ps.gz ( or a later version ) .
You may already have this document though .
Check / usr / doc / lilo or there abouts .
The postscript version is better than the plain text , since it contains diagrams and tables .

The Bootdisk HOWTO
The kernel does quite a lot really .
I think a fair way of summing it up is that it makes the hardware do what the programs want , fairly and efficiently .
The processor can only execute one instruction at a time , but Linux systems appear to be running lots of things simultaneously .
The kernel acheives this by switching from task to task really quickly .
It makes the best use of the processor by keeping track of which processes are ready to go , and which ones are waiting for something like a record from a hard disk file , or some keyboard input .
This kernel task is called scheduling .
If a program is n't doing anything , then it does n't need to be in RAM .
Even a program that is doing something , might have parts that are n't doing anything .
The address space of each process is divided into pages .
The Kernel keeps track of which pages of which processes are being used the most .
The pages that are n't used so much can be moved out to the swap partition .
When they are needed again , another unused page can be paged out to make way for it .
This is virtual memory management .
If you have ever compiled your own Kernel , you will have noticed that there are many many options for specific devices .
The kernel contains a lot of specific code to talk to diverse kinds of hardware , and present it all in a nice uniform way to the application programs .
The Kernel also manages the filesystem , interprocess communication , and a lot of networking stuff .
Once the kernel is loaded , the first thing it does is look for an init program to run .
Most of the configuration of the kernel is done when you build it , using make menuconfig , or make xconfig in /usr / src/ linux / ( or wherever your Linux kernel source is ) .
You can reset the default video mode , root filesystem , swap device and RAM disk size using rdev .
These parameters and more can also be passed to the kernel from lilo .
You can give lilo parameters to pass to the kernel either in lilo.conf , or at the lilo prompt .
For example if you wanted to use hda3 as your root file system instead of hda2 , you might type
LILO : linux root=/ dev/hda3
If you are building a system from source , you can make life a lot simpler by creating a ``monolithic '' kernel .
That is one with no modules .
Then you do n't have to copy kernel modules to the target system .
NOTE : The System.map file is used by the kernel logger to determine the module names generating messages .
The program top also uses this information .
When you copy the kernel to the target system , copy System .map too .
Think about this : / dev/hda3 is a special type of file that describes a hard disk partition .
But it lives on a file system just like all other files .
The kernel wants to know which partition to mount as the root filesystem - it does n't have a file system yet .
So how can it read / dev /hda3 to find out which partition to mount ?
If you have n't already : build your own kernel .
Read all the help information for each option .
See how small a kernel you can make that still works .
You can learn a lot by leaving the wrong things out !
Read `` The Linux Kernel '' ( URL below ) and as you do , find the parts of the source code that it refers to .
The book ( as I write ) refers to kernel version 2.0.33 , which is pretty out of date .
It might be easier to follow if you download this old version and read the source there .
Its amazing to find bits of C code called ``process '' and ``page ' ' .
Hack !
See if you can make it spit out some extra messages or something .
The next thing that happens as your computer starts up is that init is loaded and run .
However , init , like almost all programs , uses functions from libraries .
You may have seen an example C program like this :
main ( ) { printf ( " Hello World !
" ) ; }
The program contains no definition of printf , so where does it come from ?
It comes from the standard C libraries , on a GNU / Linux system , glibc .
If you compile it under Visual C++ , then it comes from a Microsoft implementation of the same standard functions .
There are zillions of these standard functions , for math , string , dates / times memory allocation and so on .
Everything in Unix ( including Linux ) is either written in C or has to try hard to pretend it is , so everything uses these functions .
If you look in / lib on your linux system you will see lots of files called libsomething .
so or libsomething .
a etc .
They are libraries of these functions .
Glibc is just the GNU implementation of these functions .
There are two ways programs can use these library functions .
If you statically link a program , these library functions are copied into the executable that gets created .
This is what the libsomething .
a libraries are for .
If you dynamically link a program ( and this is the default ) , then when the program is running and needs the library code , it is called from the libsomething .
so file .
The command ldd is your friend when you want to work out which libraries are needed by a particular program .
For example , here are the libraries that bash uses :
[ greg@Curry power2bash ] $ ldd / bin / bash libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 ( 0x40019000 ) libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 ( 0x4001d000 ) /lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ( 0x40000000 )
Some of the functions in the libraries depend on where you are .
For example , in Australia we write dates as dd / mm /yy , but Americans write mm / dd/yy .
There is a program that comes with the glibc distribution called localedef which enables you to set this up .
Use ldd to find out what libraries your favourite applications use .
Use ldd to find out what libraries init uses .
Make a toy library , with just one or two functions in it .
The program ar is used to create them , the man page for ar might be a good place to start investigating how this is done .
Write , compile and link a program that uses this library .
source code , see Building a Minimal Linux System from Source Code for urls
I will only talk about the ``System V '' style of init that Linux systems mostly use .
There are alternatives .
In fact , you can put any program you like in / sbin / init , and the kernel will run it when it has finished loading .
It is init 's job to get everthing running the way it should be .
It checks that the file systems are ok and mounts them .
It starts up ``daemons '' to log system messages , do networking , serve web pages , listen to your mouse and so on .
It also starts the getty processes that put the login prompts on your virtual terminals .
There is a whole complicated story about switching ``run - levels ' ' , but I 'm going to mostly skip that , and just talk about system start up .
Init reads the file / etc / inittab , which tells it what to do .
Typically , the first thing it is told to do is to run an initialisation script .
The program that executes ( or interprets ) this script is bash , the same program that gives you a command prompt .
In Debian systems , the initialisation script is /etc/init.d/rcS , on Red Hat , /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit .
This is where the filesystems get checked and mounted , the clock set , swap space enabled , hostname gets set etc .
Next , another script is called to take us into the default run-level .
This just means a set of subsystems to start up .
There is a set of directories
/etc/rc.d/rc0.d , /etc/rc.d/rc1.d , ... , /etc/rc.d/rc6.d in Red Hat , or /etc/rc0.d , /etc/rc1.d , ... , /etc/rc6.d in Debian , which correspond to the run-levels .
If we are going into runlevel 3 on a Debian system , then the script runs all the scripts in / etc / rc3.d that start with ` S ' ( for start ) .
These scripts are really just links to scripts in another directory usually called init.d .
So our run -level script was called by init , and it is looking in a directory for scripts starting with `S ' .
It might find S10syslog first .
The numbers tell the run -level script which order to run them in .
So in this case S10syslog gets run first , since there were no scripts starting with S00 ... S09 .
But S10syslog is really a link to / etc / init.d / syslog which is a script to start and stop the system logger .
Because the link starts with an `S ' , the run-level script knows to execute the syslog script with a ``start '' parameter .
There are corresponding links starting with ` K ' ( for kill ) , which specify what to shut down and in what order when leaving the run-level .
To change what subsystems start up by default , you must set up these links in the rcN.d directory , where N is the default runlevel set in your inittab .
The last important thing that init does is to start some getty 's .
These are ``respawned '' which means that if they stop , init just starts them again .
Most distributions come with six virtual terminals .
You may want less than this to save memory , or more so you can leave lots of things running and quickly flick to them as you need them .
You may also want to run a getty for a text terminal or a dial in modem .
In this case you will need to edit the inittab file .
/ etc / inittab is the top level configuration file for init .
The rcN.d directories , where N = 0 , 1 , ... , 6 determine what subsystems are started .
Somewhere in one of the scripts invoked by init , the mount - a command will be issued .
This means mount all the file systems that are supposed to be mounted .
The file /etc / fstab defines what is supposed to be mounted .
If you want to change what gets mounted where when your system starts up , this is the file you will need to edit .
There is a man page for fstab .
Find the rcN.d directory for the default run-level of your system and do a ls -l to see what the files are links to .
Change the number of gettys that run on your system .
Remove any subsystems that you do n't need from your default run-level .
See how little you can get away with starting .
Set up a floppy disk with lilo , a kernel and a statically linked " hello world " program called / sbin / init and watch it boot up and say hello .
Watch carefully as your system starts up , and take notes about what it tells you is happening .
Or print a section of your system log / var / log / messages from start up time .
Then starting at inittab , walk through all the scripts and see what code does what .
You can also put extra start up messages in , such as
echo " Hello , I am rc.sysinit "
This is a good exercise in learning Bash shell scripting too , some of the scripts are quite complicated .
Have a good Bash reference handy .
There are man pages for the inittab and fstab files .
Type ( eg ) man inittab into a shell to see it .
and files .
Type ( eg ) into a shell to see it .
The Linux System Administrators Guide has a good section on init .
source code , see Building a Minimal Linux System from Source Code for urls
In this section , I will be using the word ``filesystem '' in two different ways .
There are filesystems on disk partitions and other devices , and there is the filesystem as it is presented to you by a running Linux system .
In Linux , you ``mount '' a disk filesystem onto the system 's filesystem .
In the previous section I mentioned that init scripts check and mount the filesystems .
The commands that do this are fsck and mount respectively .
A hard disk is just a big space that you can write ones and zeros on .
A filesystem imposes some structure on this , and makes it look like files within directories within directories ...
Each file is represented by an inode , which says who 's file it is , when it was created and where to find its contents .
Directories are also represented by inodes , but these say where to find the inodes of the files that are in the directory .
If the system wants to read / home / greg / bigboobs.jpeg , it first finds the inode for the root directory / in the ``superblock '' , then finds the inode for the directory home in the contents of / , then finds the inode for the directory greg in the contents of / home , then the inode for bigboobs .
jpeg which will tell it which disk blocks to read .
If we add some data to the end of a file , it could happen that the data is written before the inode is updated to say that the new blocks belong to the file , or vice versa .
If the power cuts out at this point , the filesystem will be broken .
It is this kind of thing that fsck attempts to detect and repair .
The mount command takes a filesystem on a device , and adds it to the heirarchy that you see when you use your system .
Usually , the kernel mounts its root file system read - only .
The mount command is used to remount it read - write after fsck has checked that it is ok .
Linux supports other kinds of filesystem too : msdos , vfat , minix and so on .
The details of the specific kind of filesystem are abstracted away by the virtual file system ( VFS ) .
I wo n't go into any detail on this though .
There is a discussion of it in `` The Linux Kernel '' ( see section The Linux Kernel for a url )
A completely different kind of filesystem gets mounted on / proc .
It is really a representation of things in the kernel .
There is a directory there for each process running on the system , with the process number as the directory name .
There are also files such as interrupts , and meminfo which tell you about how the hardware is being used .
You can learn a lot by exploring / proc .
There are parameters to the command mke2fs which creates ext2 filesystems .
These control the size of blocks , the number of inodes and so on .
Check the mke2fs man page for details .
What gets mounted where on your filesystem is controlled by the /etc / fstab file .
It also has a man page .
Make a very small filesystem , and view it with a hex viewer .
Identify inodes , superblocks and file contents .
I believe there are tools that give you a graphical view of a filesystem .
Find one , try it out , and email me the url and a review !
Check out the ext2 filesystem code in the Kernel .
Chapter 9 of the LDP book `` The Linux Kernel ' ' is an excellent description of filesystems .
You can find it at the Australian LDP mirror

There is also a Ext2 fs - overview document here , although it is out of date , and not as readable as chapter 9 of `` The Linux Kernel ' '
Unix File System Standard Another link to the Unix File System Standard .
This describes what should go where in a Unix file system , and why .
It also has minimum requirements for the contents of / bin , / sbin and so on .
This is a good reference if your goal is to make a minimal yet complete system .
If you issue the ps aux command , you will see something like the following :

This is a list of the processes running on the system .
The information comes from the / proc filesystem that I mentioned in the previous section .
Note that init is process number one .
Processes 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 are kflushd , kupdate , kpiod and kswapd .
There is something strange here though : notice that in both the virtual storage size ( SIZE ) and the Real Storage Size ( RSS ) columns , these processes have zeroes .
How can a process use no memory ?
These processes are the kernel daemons .
Most of the kernel does not show up on process lists at all , and you can only work out what memory it is using by subtracting the memory available from the amount on your system .
The kernel daemons are started after init , so they get process numbers like normal processes do .
But their code and data lives in the kernel 's part of the memory .
There are brackets around the entries in the command column because the / proc filesystem does not contain command line information for these processes .
So what are these kernel daemons for ?
Previous versions of this document had a plea for help , as I did n't know much about the kernel daemons .
The following partial story has been patched together from various replies to that plea , for which I am most grateful .
Further clues , references and corrections are most welcome !
Input and output is done via buffers in memory .
This allows things to run faster .
What programs write can be kept in memory , in a buffer , then written to disk in larger more efficient chunks .
The daemons kflushd and kupdate handle this work : kupdate runs periodically ( 5 seconds ? ) to check whether there are any dirty buffers .
If there are , it gets kflushd to flush them to disk .
Processes often have nothing to do , and ones that are running often do n't need all of their code and data in memory .
This means we can make better use of our memory , by shifting unused parts of running programs out to the swap partition (s ) of the hard disk .
Moving this data in and out of memory as needed is done by kpiod and kswapd .
Every second or so , kswapd wakes up to check out the memory situation , and if something out on the disk is needed in memory , or there is not enough free memory , kpiod is called in .
There might also be a kapmd daemon running on your system if you have configured automatic power management into your kernel .
The program update allows you to configure kflushd and kswapd .
Try update -h for some information .
Swap space is turned on by swapon and off by swapoff .
The init script ( /etc/rc.sysinit or /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit ) usually calls swapon as the system is coming up .
I 'm told that swapoff is handy for saving power on laptops .
Do an update -d , note the blatherings on the last line about ``threshold for buffer fratricide ' ' .
Now there 's an intriguing concept , go investigate !

The Linux Documentation Project 's `` The Linux Kernel '' ( see section The Linux Kernel for a url )
The Linux kernel source code , if you are brave enough !
The kswapd code is in linux / mm / vmscan.c , and kflushd and kupdate are in linux / fs / buffer .c .
Init starts the syslogd and klogd daemons .
They write messages to logs .
The kernel 's messages are handled by klogd , while syslogd handles log messages from other processes .
The main log is / var / log / messages .
This is a good place to look if something is going wrong with your system .
Often there will be a valuable clue in there .
The file /etc/syslog.conf tells the loggers what messages to put where .
Messages are identified by which service they come from , and what priority level they are .
This configuration file consists of lines that say messages from service x with priority y go to z , where z is a file , tty , printer , remote host or whatever .
NOTE : Syslog requires the /etc / services file to be present .
The services file allocates ports .
I am not sure whether syslog needs a port allocated so that it can do remote logging , or whether even local logging is done through a port , or whether it just uses / etc / services to convert the service names you type /etc/syslog .conf into port numbers .
Have a look at your system log .
Find a message you do n't understand , and find out what it means .
Send all your log messages to a tty .
( set it back to normal once done )

Getty is the program that enables you to log in through a serial device such as a virtual terminal , a text terminal , or a modem .
It displays the login prompt .
Once you enter your username , getty hands this over to login which asks for a password , checks it out and gives you a shell .
There are many getty 's available .
Some distributions , including Red Hat use a very small one called mingetty that only works with virtual terminals .
The login program is part of the util - linux package , which also contains a getty called agetty , which works fine .
This package also contains mkswap , fdisk , passwd , kill , setterm , mount , swapon , rdev , renice , more ( the program ) and more ( ie more programs ) .
The message that comes on the top of your screen with your login prompt comes from / etc / issue .
Gettys are usually started in /etc / inittab .
Login checks user details in /etc / passwd , and if you have password shadowing , /etc / shadow .
Create a /etc / passwd by hand .
Passwords can be set to null , and changed with the program passwd once you log on .
See the man page for this file Use man 5 passwd to get the man page for the file rather than the man page for the program .
If you give login a valid username and password combination , it will check in /etc / passwd to see which shell to give you .
In most cases on a Linux system this will be bash .
It is bash 's job to read your commands and see that they are acted on .
It is simultaneously a user interface , and a programming language interpreter .
As a user interface it reads your commands , and executes them itself if they are ``internal '' commands like cd , or finds and executes a program if they are ``external '' commands like cp or startx .
It also does groovy stuff like keeping a command history , and completing filenames .
We have already seen bash in action as a programming language interpreter .
The scripts that init runs to start the system up are usually shell scripts , and are executed by bash .
Having a proper programming language , along with the usual system utilities available at the command line makes a very powerful combination , if you know what you are doing .
For example ( smug mode on ) I needed to apply a whole stack of ``patches '' to a directory of source code the other day .
I was able to do this with the following single command :
for f in /home / greg/ sh-utils - 1.16 *. patch ; do patch - p0 < $ f ; done ;
This looks at all the files in my home directory whose names start with sh- utils - 1.16 and end with . patch .
It then takes each of these in turn , and sets the variable f to it and executes the commands between do and done .
In this case there were 11 patch files , but there could just as easily have been 3000 .
The file /etc / profile controls the system - wide behaviour of bash .
What you put in here will affect everybody who uses bash on your system .
It will do things like add directories to the PATH , set your MAIL directory variable .
The default behaviour of the keyboard often leaves a lot to be desired .
It is actually readline that handles this .
Readline is a separate package that handles command line interfaces , providing the command history and filename completion , as well as some advanced line editing features .
It is compiled into bash .
By default , readline is configured using the file .inputrc in your home directory .
The bash variable INPUTRC can be used to override this for bash .
For example in Red Hat 6 , INPUTRC is set to /etc / inputrc in /etc / profile .
This means that backspace , delete , home and end keys work nicely for everyone .
Once bash has read the system - wide configuration file , it looks for your personal configuration file .
It checks in your home directory for .
bash_profile , .bash_login and . profile .
It runs the first one of these it finds .
If you want to change the way bash behaves for you , without changing the way it works for others , do it here .
For example , many applications use environment variables to control how they work .
I have the variable EDITOR set to vi so that I can use vi in Midnight Commander ( an excellent console based file manager ) instead of its editor .
The basics of bash are easy to learn .
But do n't stop there : there is an incredible depth to it .
Get into the habit of looking for better ways to do things .
Read shell scripts , look up stuff you do n't understand .
There is a ``Bash Reference Manual ' ' with this , which is comprehensive , but heavy going .
There is an O'Rielly book on Bash , not sure if it 's good .
I do n't know of any good free up to date bash tutorials .
If you do , please email me a url .

You do most things in bash by issuing commands like cp .
Most of these commands are small programs , though some , like cd are built into the shell .
The commands come in packages , most of them from the Free Software Foundation ( or GNU ) .
Rather than list the packages here , I 'll direct you to the Linux From Scratch HOWTO .
It has a full and up to date list of the packages that go into a Linux system as well as instructions on how to build them .
One of the best things about Linux , in my humble opinion , is that you can get inside it and really find out how it all works .
I hope that you enjoy this as much as I do .
And I hope that this little note has helped you do it .

On the morning of April 12 , 2006 , Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein was having breakfast in his Ramadi apartment .
Suddenly heavily armed U.S. Marines burst through his door .
There had been incidents involving suspected insurgents in the neighborhood .
Bilal was quickly detained , and disappeared from public sight .
That was 19 months ago .
Bilal was part of the team of Iraqi journalists that won a Pulitzer Prize for the AP in 2005 .
Sometime by month 's end , Bilal is scheduled to have his day in court , but no one knows exactly when .
His defense attorney , Paul Gardephe , a former federal prosecutor who has been hired by AP , has not been told what charges his client faces .
The military refuses to disclose what evidence it has .
All he knows is that Bilal will be facing the military 's charges in an Iraqi court in the next few days .
But not when or where the hearing will be held .
All he has been told is that the military will let him know by 6:30 a.m. on the day of the hearing .
No one will tell the attorney what his client will be charged with .
According to Associated Press President and CEO Tom Curley , " We believe Bilal 's crime was taking photographs the U.S. government did not want its citizens to see .
That he was part of a team of AP photographers who had just won a Pulitzer Prize for work in Iraq may have made Bilal even more of a marked man . "
The obvious question is " how can we be sure that this guy was n't actually a terrorist or insurgent ? "
Well , the answer is , we can't .
He may actually be a terrorist , as you , our reader , may be .
Or your co-worker , or your wife , husband , children , brother , sister , aunt , uncle .
We do n't know .
However , probability is a long way from possibility .
And , of course , that is the entire point .
If you saw the movie Rendition , you may have an idea of just how quickly the rights we assume we have can disappear in a climate of terror .
If you have read about , or if you are old enough to have lived through the 1950s , you 'll recall that Senator Joseph McCarthy accused hundreds of American citizens of being Communist sympathizers .
Countless lives and careers of otherwise loyal Americans were destroyed .
In this kind of climate , all the checks and balances of jurisprudence are rendered moot .
All it takes is a suggestion of an accusation , and a government that regards " national security " as a cloak to undermine our basic freedoms .
This time it is Bilal Hussein who is on trial for undisclosed charges .
When does the same finger point at Maureen Dowd or Thomas Friedman , or to the editor of your local paper , or even you ?
As AP's Curley comments , " This affair makes a mockery of the democratic principles of justice and the rule of law that the United States says it is trying to help Iraq establish . "
Bilal is being railroaded by a process that should be an anathema to any American .
It may be in an Iraqi court , but he was detained and held for 19 months by American forces .
Time is running out , but in this age of the World Wide Web we can do something about it .
The military is beyond our ability to influence , but our elected representatives are not .
The Digital Journalist asks you to send an e-mail to your representatives in Congress and , most importantly , to these members of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
They can make the military listen to them .
Please send an e-mail to them immediately .
You can also sign a petition in support of Bilal Hussein at : http://www.freebilal.org.

Richard Clarke , the man who served President Bush as a special adviser for cyber security , has a five - point plan for saving the internet .
Speaking at a Santa Clara University conference dedicated to " trust online , " Clarke called the net " a place of chaos in many ways , a place of crime in many ways , " but laid out several means of righting the ship , including biometric IDs , government regulation , and an industry wide standard for secure software .
He even embraces the idea of a closed internet - which seems to have sparked a death threat from net pioneer Vint Cerf .
" A lot of these ideas go against the grain .
A lot of these ideas are ones people have already objected to - because of certain shibboleths , because of certain belief systems , because of certain idealogical differences , " Clarke said .
" But if we 're going to create trust in cyberspace , we have to overcome some of those shibboleths , overcome some of those ideological differences , and look anew at these ideas . "
According to Clarke - who was also a special assistant to the President for global affairs and national coordinator for security and counter - terrorism - about 35 per cent of all U.S. citizens would rather shoot themselves than carry a national ID card .
But he thinks they 're being silly .
He believes biometric IDs are an essential means of fighting online crime .
" One thing you could do with a biometric ID card - if you wanted to - is prove your identity online , " he said , as if taunting his critics .
Yes , he realizes that internet mavens value online anonymity .
But he insists this has nothing to do with biometric internet IDs .
" One of the ideological underpinnings of the internet is that we 're anonymous , " he said .
" Well , guess what ?
We 're not anonymous .
Amazon and DoubleClick and all those other companies already know everything about what you 're doing online . "
ID cards do n't eliminate anonymity , he explained , because anonymity is already gone .
Then he added that Bill Gates agrees with him .
Next , Clarke called for more government oversight of the net .
According to his rough calculations , 75 per cent of all U.S. citizens are against government regulation of any kind .
But he thinks they 're being silly too .
" You do n't want government regulation ?
Then just let your kids eat all that lead off their toys . "
In short , he believes the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) should force ISPs to crack down on cyber -crime .
" [ The FCC ] could , for example , say to all the ISPs , ' You will do the following things to reduce fraud , bot nets , malicious activity , etc . "
Is n't the government one of the problems where online privacy is concerned ?
It is , as Clarke pointed out .
He also called for a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fighting abuses of government power .
" What if we had a champion in the government who we trusted on privacy rights and civil liberties ?
What if we had a government advocate with real power to ensure that the government does n't violate privacy rights . "
That 's three points from the five - point plan .
Two more to go .

The world 's smallest guitar is 10 micrometers long -- about the size of a single cell -- with six strings each about 50 nanometers , or 100 atoms , wide .
Made by Cornell University researchers from crystalline silicon , it demonstrates a new technology for a new generation of electromechanical devices .
The guitar has six strings , each string about 50 nanometers wide , the width of about 100 atoms .
If plucked -- by an atomic force microscope , for example -- the strings would resonate , but at inaudible frequencies .
The entire structure is about 10 micrometers long , about the size of a single human blood cell .
A nanometer is one - billionth of a meter .
For comparison , the diameter of a human hair is about 200 micrometers , or 200,000 nanometers .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Fresh from their feud on the campaign trail , Democratic presidential contender Barack Obama beat Bill Clinton in a contest almost as closely watched as the primaries being waged across the United States -- the music industry ’s Grammy Awards .
Obama on Sunday won the spoken word Grammy for the audiobook version of his blockbuster tome “ The Audacity of Hope : Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream . ”
It marked his second statuette , following a win in 2006 for “ Dreams From My Father , ” an audiobook for a memoir first published in 1995 .
The Illinois senator , who is engaged in a neck - and - neck race with Clinton ’s wife , New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , for the Democratic presidential nomination , was not present at the awards ceremony in downtown Los Angeles .
He was scheduled to attend a rally in Virginia later in the day .
Bill Clinton was seeking his third Grammy with “ Giving : How Each of Us Can Change the World , ” a call to public service .
Another former Democratic president , Jimmy Carter , also was in the running , with “ Sunday Morning in Plains : Bringing Peace to a Changing World , ” a collection of Bible lessons .
Carter won the award last year .
Actor Alan Alda and poet Maya Angelou , a three - time winner , rounded out this year ’s nominees in the category .
Not to be outdone by Obama , Hillary Clinton won the spoken word prize in 1997 , while she was still first lady , for her book “ It Takes a Village . ”
No Republican politician has won the category since Everett Dirksen , an Illinois congressman and senator , in 1968 .
Published in October 2006 , Obama ’s latest book posited that Americans have more in common than their polarizing politics suggest .
It included personal anecdotes about his struggles to balance public service and family life .
His appearances to promote the bestseller generated a rock - star atmosphere , helping to stoke his presidential ambitions .
In recent weeks he has faced Bill Clinton ’s wrath .
The former president dismissed Obama ’s contention of consistently opposing the Iraq war as a “ fairy tale , ” and said that putting Obama in the White House would be a roll of the dice .
Obama described Clinton ’s remarks as “ troubling , ” and Clinton has toned down his campaign rhetoric .
WASHINGTON 
More than a quarter of adult Americans have left the faith of their childhood to join another religion or no religion , according to a new survey of religious affiliation by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
The report , titled “ U.S. Religious Landscape Survey , ” depicts a highly fluid and diverse national religious life .
If shifts among Protestant denominations are included , then it appears that 44 percent of Americans have switched religious affiliations .
For at least a generation , scholars have noted that more Americans are moving among faiths , as denominational loyalty erodes .
But the survey , based on interviews with more than 35,000 Americans , offers one of the clearest views yet of that trend , scholars said .
The United States Census does not track religious affiliation .
The report shows , for example , that every religion is losing and gaining members , but that the Roman Catholic Church “ has experienced the greatest net losses as a result of affiliation changes . ”
The survey also indicates that the group that had the greatest net gain was the unaffiliated .
More than 16 percent of American adults say they are not part of any organized faith , which makes the unaffiliated the country ’s fourth largest “ religious group . ”
Clockwerks sez , " Apparently the U.S. Senate is trying to rush through the bad FISA bill that includes immunity for telcos because they 're in a hurry to catch their jets to Davos to hang out with rich people .
What is standing in their way ?
Senator Chris Dodd and his threat to filibuster .
He needs all the support he can get and people should be lighting up the phone lines of their senators in support of him . "
We have to finish FISA this week .
Everyone should be aware of that point .
We have to finish it this week .
I know there are important trips people want to take .
We have the very important economic conference in Davos that Democrats and Republicans alike would like to go to .

Washington Stirs a Witch ’s Brew in Pakistan

Plans by President George Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to attack Iran have been at least temporarily derailed by the mounting crisis in Pakistan .
Not only is this important South Asia nation a key US ally in its conflict with anti-western Muslim groups ( aka " the war of terror " ) , the US also planned to use three Pakistani air bases it now controls to launch air attacks against Iran .
I ’ve been in regular contact with former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto .
She calls the situation " grim . "
On Friday , she was temporarily put under house arrest , preventing her from leading a mass demonstration in Islamabad .
On Tuesday , she plans to lead a mass protest march from Lahore , to which she flew over the weekend , to Islamabad , mobilizing her party faithful and challenging the Musharraf regime .
Another important Pakistani party , Jamiat Islami , is also threatening mass demonstrations .
Bhutto and other opposition leaders are calling on Musharraf to resign as military chief and run in fair , internationally supervised elections .
Bhutto tells me she may face another attempt to kill her .
She accuses allies of President - General Pervez Musharraf of trying to assassinate her in the October 18th bombing in Karachi that that killed or wounded hundreds .
Bhutto ’s Pakistan People ’s Party commands broad popular support , particularly among the poor and illiterate .
But her attempt to unleash mass demonstrations has so far been thwarted by violent police repression against her supporters and the arrest of her political allies .
Musharraf ’s imposition of martial law , arrest of Supreme Court justices who were going to rule illegal his continued role as commander - in - chief and president , arrest of other opposition figures and muzzling the formerly feisty media have proven most embarrassing to the Bush Administration which claims to be an apostle of democracy .
Bush , who claims to have invaded Afghanistan and Iraq in order to bring them the light of democracy , must continue supporting Pakistan ’s military dictator or see his war in Afghanistan collapse .
So , under heavy pressure from Washington , Musharraf agreed to hold elections on 15 January and release some jailed opponents .
Washington hailed Musharraf .
In reality , however , it was another cynical ploy .
Every election Musharraf has held since seizing power in 1999 has been rigged .
Does anyone really believe there will be fair elections in Pakistan under martial law or with the media gagged ?
Musharraf , who commands less than 8 % popular support , and is widely hated as an American stooge , knows he would lose any honest election .
What he plans are the same kind of farcical " democratic elections " held by the US - backed military dictatorships of Egypt and Algeria .
My Pakistani sources report growing unrest in the 619,000 - man armed forces .
Senior commanders , recently promoted by Musharraf after pre-approval by Washington , still support him .
But they are increasingly dismayed by the threat of a clash with civilians .
Many senior officers fear their continued support of Musharraf is turning the public against the armed forces and injuring its good name .
Gen . Ashfaq Kiyani , the newly named vice chief of staff , could be Pakistan ’s next strongman .
If Musharraf is overthrown , killed or driven from office , Washington has chosen Gen. Kiyani as its Plan B , either with or without Benazir Bhutto .
Kiyani has close links to the US and received part of his military training there .
If Musharraf does finally resign his command , Kiyani will control the military .
Musharraf will be left without a power base — or perhaps even army protection .
Benazir Bhutto tells me pro-Taliban tribesmen and Uzbek allies in Northwest Frontier Province on the Afghan border are rapidly taking over cities and towns .
Army troops ordered to attack them have surrendered or refused to fire .
The Swat Valley , which is well inside Pakistan , fell to Islamists two weeks ago .
This could mark the beginning of a rebellion in the ranks .
The loyalty of the army ’s senior officers has been rented by billions of dollars of secret aid the CIA has funneled through Musharraf .
Those who could not be bought were ousted , including Pakistan ’s most capable military men .
Official post -9/11 US aid to Pakistan is $ 10.6 billion , but " black " payments are many times higher .
Some reports put them at $ 1 billion monthly .
These mammoth payoffs have not trickled down to the mid and lower ranks .
They have vanished into the pockets of the military brass and senior officials .
Pakistan ’s armed forces are still woefully deficient in modern arms .
Gen . Hamid Gul , former director general of Pakistan ’s intelligence service , ISI , and an old friend from the 1980 ’s Afghan War , has also been arrested .
He kept accusing Musharraf of selling out Pakistan ’s national interests in return for cash and US support for his dictatorship — and of dishonoring the military .
Gen .
Gul still has many friends in the army and ISI .
He shouted what many officers whisper .
In lauding Musharraf , President Bush made no mention of the dictator ’s disgraceful firing of Supreme Court justices who were about to declare Mush ’s ongoing rule violated the constitution .
Nor has Bush or the US Congress issued any demands that the exiled former PM Nawaz Sharif , leader of Pakistan ’s other major political party , the Muslim League , be allowed to return to contest elections .
So much for supporting democracy .
In the name of fighting extremism , Musharraf has jailed or intimidated nearly all of Pakistan ’s political moderates .
In Washington ’s wrongheaded view , it ’s either Mush or the mullahs .
Or if Musharraf falters , then it ’s Bhutto or Gen. Kiyani .
As of this writing , Bhutto still has not decided whether to collaborate with Musharraf or try to force a bloody confrontation with him , though she suggests talks are off .
Many of her friends and supporters are appalled she would make a shady , backroom deal with the military dictator .
Gen. Kiyani remains an unknown .
Anyone who still wonders why so many people in the Muslim World hate the west needs look no further than Pakistan , where , in the name of " democracy " and " counter - terrorism " Washington and London are stirring a witches ’ brew of dictatorship , intrigue and violence .

MANAMA ( Reuters ) - Boeing Co BA.N won an order from Bahrain 's Gulf Air for as many as 24 of its 787 aircraft , worth as much as $ 6 billion , according to Gulf Air , which also agreed an initial request for eight Airbus A320s .
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner sits outside the Boeing assembly plant in Everett , Washington , July 8 , 2007 before it 's world premiere .

The Boeing order is for 16 of the 787 Dreamliner passenger planes , worth $ 3.4 billion , with options for eight more .
The first of the aircraft will be delivered in 2016 .
“ If we look at the overall economics of operation of the Boeing 787 , it is more favorable than the Airbus 350 extra wide body , ” Bjorn Naf , Gulf Air acting chief executive officer told reporters in the Bahraini capital , Manama , on Sunday .
Bahrain 's national carrier aims to replace its fleet of 35 aircraft , and is in talks with European plane maker Airbus EAD .
PA to buy eight of its narrow body A320 aircraft , Gulf Air Chairman of the board Mahmood al - Kooheji said .
“ We have signed an MOU with Airbus for the A320 , ” Kooheji said , declining to give a value for the initial agreement .
An order of that size may be worth about $ 520 million at list prices .
Gulf
Air hopes to reach a final agreement by the end of March , Naf said .
Gulf Air and Chicago - based Boeing concluded their agreement late on Saturday during a visit by President George W. Bush to the island kingdom .
The state - owned airline plans to lease aircraft until the new planes are delivered , and is in talks with banks to finance the purchases .
Officials declined to give further details
Gulf
Air was the 56th customer to order the 787 , whose launch has been the most successful in Boeing history , Boeing regional sales Senior Vice President Marty Bentrott said in Bahrain .
Customers have ordered 833 of the planes since its launch in 2004 , he said .
Last year was a bumper year for aircraft orders .
Airbus said 2007 was a record .
However , orders this year may fall , Bentrott said , as U.S. airlines cancel requests on prospects of a weaker U.S. economy .
Boeing received orders for 1,413 planes in 2007 .
“ There is perceived weakness in the U.S. economy ... I would say industry orders will drop to about half of 2007 , ” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference .
Gulf
Air slashed its network and cut its workforce by about 25 percent last year after announcing losses of more than $ 1 million a day .
Then - CEO Andre Dose resigned in July after less than four months in the role .
The airline , which has pledged to operate with minimum state support , said it was now close to halving its losses .
The company has said its government owner could sell shares to the public as early as this year .
“ This is a strong signal to the market and to our competitors that Gulf Air is back in business , ” Naf said .
Because we ’re always on the look out for ways to speed up our web application , one of my favorite tools for optimization is the YSlow Firefox extension .
Based on rules created by research done by Yahoo engineer , Steve Souders ( his book High Performance Web Sites is a must read for anyone interested in front end engineering ) , the tool hooks into Firebug and helps you diagnose issues that can shave seconds off your pages ’ load times .
While we were able to implement most of the suggestions fairly easily , Rule # 3 , which specifies adding a far futures Expires header required a bit of elbow grease that some of you might be interested in .
Rule # 3 recommends that you use set an Expires header on your static files ( images , CSS and JavaScript ) very far into the future ( like 10 years ) so that your browser ’s cache is used to load those elements rather than making another HTTP request , which is costly when it comes to page load times .
Implementing this is pretty easy .
In your .htaccess file , you can use the following code :
# Far Future Expires Header < FilesMatch " \.( gif|png|jpg|js|css|swf ) $ " >
ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault " access plus 10 years " </ FilesMatch >
However , Steve makes a little note about using this technique :
Keep in mind , if you use a far future Expires header you have to change the component ’s filename whenever the component changes .
At Yahoo !
we often make this step part of the build process : a version number is embedded in the component ’s filename , for example , yahoo_2.0.6.js .
We , of course , did n’t have a built in build process that added the version number to our static files .
Obviously , we were n’t interested in changing version numbers by hand or having tons of different versioned files lying around in our SVN depository .
And so motivated by a goal ( increasing our Y Slow score ) and sloth ( not doing something manually ) , we figured out the following automated solution .
The first thing we did was set up some mod rewrite rules to allow version numbers in our file names .
In our .htaccess file , we added the following lines :
# Rules for Versioned Static Files RewriteRule ^( scripts|css ) /(.+)\.(.+) \.( js|css ) $ $ 1/$ 2. $ 4 [ L ]
What this does is quietly redirects any files located in our \scripts \ or \css\ folders with version numbers in between the file name and the extension back to just the filename and extension .
For example , I could now rewrite the url /css / structure.css as /css / structure .
1234.css and Apache would see those as the exact same files .
We only do versioned files for our JavaScript and CSS , but you could easily adapt the rule for images as well , like so :
# Rules for Versioned Static Files RewriteRule ^( scripts|css|images ) /(.+) \.(.+)\.( js|css|jpg|gif|png ) $ $ 1/$ 2.$ 4 [ L ]
Once that was in place , we wrote a tiny PHP function that would look at the last modified date of the file and automatically rewrite the url with that unix timestamp as the version number .
Here ’s that PHP function :
<? php function autoVer ( $url ) { $ path = pathinf o ( $url ) ; $ver = '.'.filemtime ($_SERVER [' DOCUMENT_ROOT ']. $url ) .'.' ; echo $ path [ ' dirname ' ] .'/'. str_replace ( '.' , $ver , $ path [ ' basename ' ] ) ; } ?>
Then , in our PHP documents we would include the function and then call it like so in the HTML markup :
include ($_SERVER [' DOCUMENT_ROOT ' ].'/ path/to/autoVer.php' ) ;< link rel=" stylesheet " href= " <? php autoVer ('/css/structure.css ' ) ; ? > " type =" text/css " /> < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " <? php autoVer ( '/ scripts/prototype.js ' ) ; ?>" ></ script>
When the pages load , our script would request the file modified timestamp and insert them in like this :
< link rel=" stylesheet " href= " /css/structure.1194900443.css " type =" text/css " /> < script type =" text/ javascript " src= " / scripts/prototype.1197993206.js " ></ script>
It ’s a great little system and required very little effort on our end and resulted in a noticeably faster browsing experience for our clients that frequented certain pages often , because their browsers were taking full advantage of their primed caches rather than calling our servers every time they loaded a page .
The best part is that when we make a change to a CSS or JavaScript file , we do n’t have to worry about tracking or managing version numbers or multiple files .
Steroid - sparing effect of wormwood ( Artemisia absinthium ) in Crohn 's disease : a double - blind placebo - controlled study .
Author(s ) : Omer B , Krebs S , Omer H , Noor TO Affiliation (s ) : Department of Internal Medicine , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA .
Publication date & source : 2007 - 02 , Phytomedicine. , 14(2-3):87-95 . Epub 2007 Jan 19 .
Publication type : Multicenter Study ; Randomized Controlled Trial
In this double - blind study carried out at five sites in Germany , 40 patients suffering from Crohn 's disease receiving a stable daily dose of steroids at an equivalent of 40 mg or less of prednisone for at least 3 weeks were administered a herbal blend containing wormwood herb ( 3 x 500 mg / day ) or a placebo for 10 weeks .
Besides steroids , 5 - aminosalicylates , if dose remained constant for at least 4 weeks prior to entering the trial and / or azathioprine , stable dose for at least 8 weeks , or methotrexate , stable dose for at least 6 weeks , were permitted as concomitant medications .
The recruited 40 patients - 20 in each treatment group , were evaluated with the help of a Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) questionnaire , an Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ( IBDQ ) , the 21 - item Hamilton Depression Scale ( HAMD ) and an 8 - item Visual Analogue Scale ( VA - Scale ) in 2 - week intervals during the first 10 study weeks , and then at week 12 , 16 and 20 , which were the trial - medication free observation periods .
The initial stable dose of steroids was maintained until week 2 , after that a defined tapering schedule was started so that at the start of week 10 all the patients were free of steroids .
At the end of week 10 the trial medication was also discontinued .
The concomitant medications were maintained at the same dose levels till the end of the observation period that was the end of week 20 .
There was a steady improvement in CD symptoms in 18 patients ( 90 % ) who received wormwood in spite of tapering of steroids as shown by CDA - Index , IBDQ , HAMD , and VAS .
After 8 weeks of treatment with wormwood there was almost complete remission of symptoms in 13 ( 65 % ) patients in this group as compared to none in the placebo group .
This remission persisted till the end of the observation period that was week 20 , and the addition of steroids was not necessary .
In two ( 10 % ) patients did the re-starting of corticoids become necessary ?
On the other hand , the CD conditions of the patients who received the placebo deteriorated after the tapering of steroids , and re-starting steroids became necessary in 16 ( 80 % ) patients in this group after week 10 .
These results strongly suggest that wormwood has a steroid sparing effect .
The improvements in HAMD scores indicate that wormwood also has an effect on the mood and quality of life of CD patients , which is not achieved by other standard medications .
On the first day , God created the dog and said : " Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past .
For this , I will give you a life span of twenty years . "
The dog said : " That 's a long time to be barking .
How about only ten years and I 'll give you back the other ten ? "
So God agreed .
On the second day , God created the monkey and said : " Entertain people , do tricks , and make them laugh .
For this , I 'll give you a twenty - year life span . "
The monkey said : " Monkey tricks for twenty years ?
That 's a pretty long time to perform .
How about I give you back ten like the dog did ? "
And God agreed .
On the third day , God created the cow and said : " You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun , have calves and give milk to support the farmer 's family For this , I will give you a life span of sixty Years . "
The cow said : " That 's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years .
How about twenty and I 'll give back the other forty ? "
And God agreed again .
On the fourth day , God created man and said : " Eat , sleep , play , marry and enjoy your life .
For this , I 'll give you twenty years . "
But man said : " Only twenty years ?
Could you possibly give me my twenty , the forty the cow gave back , the ten the monkey gave back , and the ten the dog gave back ; that makes eighty , okay ? "
" Okay , " said God , " You asked for it . "
So that i s why for our first twenty years we eat , sleep , play and enjoy ourselves .
For the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family .
For the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren .
And for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone .
Life has now been explained to you .

The right has been going nuts over the McCain lobbyist scandal and how evil the New York Times is , but thanks to the DemRapidResponse Channel on YouTube , who dug up some CNN clips from the 2000 presidential campaign , we are reminded that George W. Bush went after John McCain for the very same issue that he and the GOP are now attacking the Times for in 2008 -- lobbyists .
Bush , using a 2000 Wall Street Journal article on McCain 's lobbyist ties , attacks him for being a D.C. insider , flying on corporate jets and taking big money from lobbyists in return for favors .
And it bears repeating -- Drudge ran with this story months before the New York Times .
Maybe it 's time for the president and the right wing pundits and politicians to dial back the indignation ?
BUSH : " It 's important on campaign funding reform that we have campaign funding reform .
But it 's also important for people to know that my friend is raising money from people who have business in front of his committee .
Nothing illegal about that , but I just want to make sure the facts are laid bare . "

THURSDAY , Sept. 6 , 2007 ( HealthDay News ) --
When fat is present in the stomach , vitamin C transforms from a cancer - fighter to a possible contributor to malignancy , new research suggests .
Researchers at Western Infirmary in Glasgow , Scotland , analyzed the interaction between vitamin C and lipid ( fat ) in the upper stomach , which is particularly vulnerable to pre-cancerous changes and tumor growth .
They focused on changes in nitrite chemistry .
Nitrites are present in human saliva and preserved foods .
During the digestive process , they can be converted to cancer - causing compounds called nitrosamines , which form in acidic conditions .
However , vitamin C usually inhibits their formation by converting nitrites to nitric oxide .
But the researchers found that when vitamin C and nitrites meet in environments with 10 percent fat , vitamin C multiplied the production of cancer - causing nitrosamines by eight to 140 times .
Without high fat levels , vitamin C curbed the levels of two nitrosamines by a factor of between five and 1,000 .
And it completely eliminated the production of the other two , the researchers said .
Fat remains in the stomach for some time after eating and also makes up the content of many cells lining the stomach , the study authors noted .
Writing in the September issue of Gut , the team theorized that this interaction explains why vitamin C supplements have not had significant success in reducing cancer risk .

After suffering humiliation at the hands of a hacker in 2007 , the future of anti-piracy company MediaDefender is in serious doubt .
Its parent company , ARTISTdirect , has called in a team of specialists to " assist in the exploration of strategic alternatives . "
That 'll be alternatives to liquidation , then .
In early 2005 , online music business ARTISTdirect saw its stock being traded at just a cent .
Then in mid 2005 , it paid MediaDefender founders , Randy Saaf and Octavio Herrera , $ 43 m for their anti-piracy company and the stock rocketed to beyond $ 3.00 .
Smiles all round – but not for long .
In September 2007 , disaster struck .
MediaDefender had gathered many enemies due to their anti-p2p activities .
One of them decided to teach the company a lesson by hacking into their systems and leaking their internal emails and closest secrets to the Internet .
The effect on the company and its operations was dramatic .
Within days , seemingly everyone knew about the MediaDefender leak and inevitably , news started filtering through to MediaDefender ’s customer base .
With the company ’s secrets out in the open , and its operations virtually shut down , people started asking if it was possible for the business to continue and if it did , how effective could it be ?
MediaDefender ’s customers were n’t happy , and the company was forced to issue $ 600,000 in credits to them by way of compensation for a total lack of results in the 3 months following the leak .
But this was just the beginning .
In a SEC filing , the financial damage started to become clear .
As a result of the hacking , by November 2007 MediaDefender had lost a massive $ 825,000 – and growing .
Before the email leak , stock was around the $ 2.25 mark .
Three months later in December 2007 , things were starting to look bleak as stock plummeted to $ 0.63 .
With the stock sitting today at $ 0.51 , ARTISTdirect needed to take some drastic action – and they have , calling in Los Angeles based financial services company , Salem Partners LLC , to try and sort out the mess .
Salem Partners are to explore “ strategic alternatives ” for the business ( which is currently $ 30 m + in debt ) , such as restructuring , merger or sale .
For this service they will be rewarded well : Salem are on a $ 50,000 a month retainer for the first 4 months with numerous six and seven - figure bonuses woven in to the rates , dependent on the deals they manage to do .
They could decide to sell MediaDefender off as a separate entity , so it ’s possible that Randy and Octavio would like to buy their old business back .
One thing is certain – it wo n’t fetch anything near the $ 43 m they sold it for .
The pair currently pick up $ 350 k a year each at MediaDefender so they ’re not quite at rock - bottom yet , but would they even want it back after last year ’s disaster ?
Time will tell .
Potential buyers will probably choose to wait a little .
According to a source , ARTISTDirect ’s current FORM 10 - QSB financial statement is not online , but it should have been posted to SEC by Feb 14th 2007 March 31st 2007 .
Looks like the worst of the financial pain has n’t even been reported yet .
Update : A comment from a TorrentFreak reader who wanted to correct the above date :
“ Most companies have financial years that end 12 - 31 , and quarters that end 3/31 , 6/30 , 9/30 .
You file 4 reports about financials ( at a minimum ) per year .
A quarterly report is called a 10 - Q , a yearend report is called a 10 - K .
The forms they are filing are 10 - QSB and 10 - KSB , with the SB meaning small business , however they are still governed by the same rules and regulations .
Here is where it gets tricky , there are 3 types of filers .
Large Accelerated , Accelerated and Non-Accelerated .
Your Large Accelerated are your big boys , Ford , GE , Coca - Cola , etc , they have a market capitalization of over $ 700 Million US .
Accelerated are companies you ’ve heard of , but they are n’t that big .
Market capitalization of between $ 50 million and 700 million .
Non Accelerated is everything under 50 million .
To be filing a 10 - QSB / KSB , you have to be Non Accelerated by default .
So anyways , a non-accelerated company has 45 days after the end of a quarter to file a 10 - Q .
If their financial end of year was 6/30 , their 10 - Q would have been due February 14th .
However , this time of year , it ’s time for a 10 - K , because their financial end of year is 12/31 .
A Non Accelerated company gets 90 days from end of year to file a 10 - K .
All of this means , they are due to file a 10 - KSB by March 31st . ”

The main excuse people give for staying home is that they ’ve managed to tie themselves down with a thousand real or imagined responsibilities – the job , the relationship , the dog , the chess club – none of which they could dream of leaving behind .
Other people are simply too afraid to take their chances looking for a job overseas .
Their current job might be boring but at least it ’s safe .
The idea of facing a foreign language and culture in the quest to make a buck is altogether too much .
Still others would like to find a job abroad but just have no idea of how to start .
The world seems a pretty daunting place from afar and few travelers want to head off without a steady budget and a promising interview awaiting them at the very least .
Yet this world is still full of opportunity for the talented , the hard - working , the creative , the brave or simply the lucky .
Surely you belong to at least one of those five groups ?
Anyway , Road Junky is so sick of travelers whinging about not having enough cash to get on the road that we ’ve put together a list of job ideas , contacts and opportunities to work abroad .
And if you still can’t find work then there ’s nothing to do but admit you ’re a lazy bastard …
Good luck to anyone for whom it is final exam season !

5 You Can Blow Up Shit At Will With Hacking
Worst Offender : Live Free or Die Hard
What Happened :
The movie ' villain , Thomas Gabriel , and his band of hackers are so good at hacking that they 've gained the powers of an all - seeing and all - knowing God :
" OK , I want you to hack into that traffic light and make it red .
Good .
Now , I want you to hack into Kevin Smith ' basement and physically move his webcam around the room .
Now , hack into the brain of that fighter pilot and get him to shoot missiles into the middle of a busy freeway . "
Hacking is to this movie what magic is in the Harry Potter stories : plot - hole spackle .
All the gaping cracks in logic between scene A to scene C can be neatly smoothed over with the mystical power of hack .
The improbability reaches critical mass , though , when the bad guys hack into the natural - gas lines near a power plant and make them spontaneously explode under the streets .
Why It 's Ridiculous :
Look , we acknowledge that Bruce Willis movies take place in a universe where every object is teetering on the brink of spontaneous detonation ( see Armageddon , wherein the bolt on a valve handle breaks , causing an entire space station to erupt in an enormous fireball ) .
Still , if natural - gas safety precautions were so poor that entire city blocks could explode via broadband modem , we 're certain the guys at 4 chan would have done it by now .
In Real Life
Gabriel would make his insane demands to his hackers who , in turn , would snort derisively and call him a n00b .
An hour later , 30 unwanted pizzas would turn up , mysteriously ordered under his name from Pizza Hut ' online order form , while the hackers giggle and high - five each time the doorbell rings .
4 Hacking Will Let You Steal Any Damned Thing You Want Worst Offender : Swordfish What Happened :
The presumed abilities of computers are fairly well detailed in the actual tagline of this movie : " Log on .
Hack in .
Go anywhere .
Steal everything . "
And , that ' no exaggeration .
If you watch the movie , you 'll realize that 's exactly what the filmmakers believe .
John Travolta ' villain in Swordfish is Gabriel Shear ( wait , was n't the Die Hard bad guy named Gabriel , too ? ) and his scheme was to steal $ 9.5 billion from the U.S. government .
With hacking .
Above : Hacking Why It 's Ridiculous :
The entire premise of the plot is that in the vast , computerized world of modern finance , $ 9.5 billion could slip through the cracks so that a clever hacker could , with hacking , transfer it to his own account unnoticed .
This sounds plausible to some , because almost all the money exists only in computers ( not even 10 % percent of our money exists as printed currency ) and it seems like that would make it easier to steal .
We assure you , wherever there is $ 9.5 billion , there are several people who will fucking notice if it 's gone .
In a world full of brilliant , real - life hackers , the reason the money does n't continually vanish from your checking account is because there are equally brilliant people working on the other side .
In Real LifeÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃÂ ¦
Shear 's entire plan was to steal the money so he could use it to run an underground anti-terror organization .
We 're pretty sure all that takes is writing a letter to your congressman and saying , " I would like $ 9.5 billion to run an underground anti-terror organization . "
The check should arrive within four to six weeks .

3 Your Personal and Social Life Can Be Permanently Dismantled By People Who Know Stuff About Computers Worst Offender : The Net What Happened :
Hackers are after Sandra Bullock .
Using the Internet , they change her identity from successful , established Angela Bennett to Ruth Marx , a prostitute , drug addict and convict .
Bullock spends the rest of the film running away from the hackers and the police because the Internet , evidently , infiltrated Bennett ' family , her doctors , her neighbors and anyone she ' ever gone to school with .
Why It 's Ridiculous :
The Net came out in 1995 , when lots of people still had never actually seen the Internet ( this may include the screenwriter ) .
Since Americans have never met a threat we could n't grossly exaggerate , we immediately decided the ' net was in control of every single event that transpired on Earth and could fuck it all up with the slightest provocation ( for reference , see the Y2 K scare ) .
In Real LifeÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃÂ ¦
The hackers would first go right for her MySpace , filling it with tons of gay porn .
Then , upon figuring out that her online banking password was " PASSWORD " they would " steal her identity " in the sense that they would use her credit card to buy tons of anime porn DVDs .
The final act of this drama would be Bullock cancelling the card by filling out several forms while sighing in annoyance .
Also , we notice that Sandra Bullock 's character is portrayed as a hopeless loner .
In the real world , a computer geek who was female and looked like Bullock ... ... would have approximately 375 male " friends " orbiting around her on a daily basis , staring hungrily each time she turned her back and always trying to surreptitiously smell her hair .
2 A Computer Might Become Self - Aware At Any Moment Worst Offender : WarGames What Happened :
A teenage hacker ( Matthew Broderick ) , using an early - 80s computer that looks like it may have parts made of wood , accidentally hacks into NORAD ' supercomputer ( code named " WOPR " ) and finds out it is sentient and intends to launch a global nuclear war as a way to amuse itself .
Why It 's Ridiculous :
That thing that qualified as a " supercomputer " in 1984 ?
Your Xbox 360 is 500 times faster .
Look it up .
And , it ' pretty hard to imagine your Xbox giving birth to sentience when what it calls " A.I. " involves the enemies in a World War II shooter running confusedly into brick walls , face first .
In Real LifeÃÂ¢Ã¯Â¿Â½ÃÂ ¦
The microwave - sized IMSAI 8080 computer the hero used to take over the nation ' nuclear missile fleet had 64KB of memory .

Pelosi calls Iraq a ' failure '
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) said twice Sunday that Iraq “ is a failure , ” adding that President Bush ’s troop surge has “ not produced the desired effect . ”
“ The purpose of the surge was to create a secure time for the government of Iraq to make the political change to bring reconciliation to Iraq , ” Pelosi said on CNN ’s “ Late Edition . ”
“ They have not done that . ”

The speaker hastened to add : “ The troops have succeeded , God bless them . ”
Pelosi ’s harsh verdict is a reminder of the dilemma for Democrats as they head into this fall ’s presidential and congressional elections :
They need to make the case that the country needs to depart from the direction set by Bush .
Yet they do n’t want to look like naysayers at a time when Iraq has become more stable , albeit still violent .
Republican strategists say one of their few chances to avoid a blowout in November is to paint Democrats as defeatists .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) sparked a furious response from the right last year when he said the Iraq war “ is lost . ”
Bush announced in September that the surge policy of additional troops would allow a gradual reduction in forces as a “ return on success . ”
Improvements in Iraq helped revive the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain ( Ariz . ) , now the front - runner for the Republican nomination .
Shortly after Pelosi spoke on Sunday with Defense Secretary Robert Gates in Iraq , a suicide bomber killed more than 20 civilians at a checkpoint north of Baghdad , the U.S. military reported .
Pelosi ’s comment came during a discussion of her call for “ the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq . ”
Anchor Wolf Blitzer asked : “ Are you not worried , though , that all the gains that have been achieved over the past year might be lost ? ”
“ There have n't been gains , Wolf , ” the speaker replied .
“ The gains have not produced the desired effect , which is the reconciliation of Iraq .
This is a failure .
This is a failure .
The troops have succeeded , God bless them .
We owe them the greatest debt of gratitude for their sacrifice , their patriotism , and for their courage and to their families as well .
“ But they deserve better than the policy of a war without end , a war that could be 20 years or longer .
And Secretary Gates just testified in the last 24 hours to Congress that this next year in Iraq and Afghanistan are going to cost $ 170 billion .
“ Afghanistan is not settled because the president took his eye off the ball and took the full attention that should have been in Afghanistan , and shifted some of that to Iraq , a war without end , without a plan , without a reason to go in , without a plan to win , without a strategy to leave .
This is a disaster … we cannot perpetuate . ”
On other issues , the speaker said a Clinton - Obama or Obama - Clinton ticket would produce great enthusiasm , but she declined to take the bait on whether she would like such a so - called dream ticket to emerge .
“ The decision as to who is the running mate of the nominee of the party is the decision of the nominee of the party , ” Pelosi said .
“ If someone would ask my advice in that capacity , however great you are , Wolf , in that capacity as nominee I might have a suggestion .
But right now , let the democracy continue and see how this plays out .
And there are a lot of people who would be very enthusiastic about it .
I 'll agree with you on that . ”
Historic bill in Senate to fight warming California law a model for new measure
A bipartisan group of senators , borrowing heavily from California 's efforts to fight climate change , fired the starting gun on what 's expected to be a long global - warming debate in Congress with a proposal for limits on greenhouse gases affecting every major segment of the nation 's economy .
Lawmakers , industry groups and environmentalists have waited months for the bill , which was introduced Thursday by Sen.
John Warner , R - Va. , and Sen. Joe Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut .
The bill , expected to be the centerpiece of the Senate 's efforts to address climate change , would cap emissions and gradually reduce them using a market - oriented cap - and - trade system in which allowances to emit greenhouse gases would be bought and sold .
" Today will be remembered as a turning point in the fight against global warming , " said California Sen.
Barbara Boxer , chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee .
The bill requires cuts in carbon dioxide and other heat - trapping gases from electric utilities , transportation and manufacturing , accounting for about 75 percent of U.S emissions .
The bill would cap greenhouse gases at the 2005 emission level starting in 2012 and gradually reduce them to 1990 levels - a 15 percent reduction - by 2020 .
The measure requires deeper cuts over the long term : a 65 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050 .
" The goal should be to keep the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere below 500 parts per million , " Lieberman said .
" That will avoid what ( scientists ) describe as a high risk of severe global warming impacts here in the United States ... but also around the world . "
The bill would not pre-empt tougher climate rules enacted by states like California and would offer incentives to states that act early .
California enacted the first economy - wide limits on greenhouse gases last year ; initial regulations are set to take effect in 2010 .
The law , AB32 , intends to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020 .
California and a dozen other states also are battling in court and with the Bush administration to cut vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases .
Warner acknowledged that the new limits would burden industry and taxpayers .
But he said less painful approaches - like the Bush administration 's call for voluntary cuts - would not be enough to meet the global threat of climate change .
" The basic difference between the administration 's approach and our approach is that we feel voluntary will not achieve the goals , the leadership that the United States of America simply must take ... to join the other nations of the world , " Warner said .
Environmentalists mostly praised the bill as a good first step , though some groups said the emissions cuts were not deep enough .
Some scientists estimate that reductions of 80 percent below 2000 emissions levels will be needed to avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures .
" Senators Lieberman and Warner have offered serious preventative measures that will take us a long way to preventing catastrophic climate change , " said Kevin Knobloch , president of the Union of Concerned Scientists .
" But it needs improvement if we 're going to restore the patient to full health . "
Industry groups were skeptical of the measure , saying the emissions cuts could hurt the competitiveness of U.S. companies by increasing their energy costs .
" We believe the bill 's proposed greenhouse gas emissions reductions are ' too much , too soon , ' " said Jack Gerard , president and CEO of the American Chemistry Council , a trade group of plastic and chemical manufacturers .
He warned the bill would " turn energy markets upside down , causing massive reductions in coal usage and enormous increases in natural gas and renewable fuels usage . "
Cynics noted that previous climate bills have failed in Congress , including a similar measure sponsored by Lieberman and Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
But sponsors of the measure say rising public concern over global warming and the leading role played by Warner , one of the Senate 's most respected Republicans , gives this measure a better chance .
Several Republicans have signed on as co-sponsors , including Sens. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina , Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Susan Collins of Maine .
" I 'm convinced this bill does represent a tipping point , " Collins said Thursday .
Sen . James Inhofe , the Oklahoma Republican and leading climate change skeptic in Congress , took to the Senate floor to denounce the bill .
He warned it could cost average families several thousands of dollars in additional energy costs .
" These are things that are very , very costly , " Inhofe said .
The bill 's sponsors say the bill has several cost - containment measures , including a " bank and borrow " system that lets greenhouse emitters save their allowances to pollute for future years , or borrow from future year 's allowances to meet the goals .
The measure would also create a Carbon Market Efficiency Board , an appointed seven - member body that could loosen the rules on borrowing future credits if the price of carbon goes too high .
However , all emitters would still have to meet the bill 's targets over the long term .
The cap - and - trade system would work basically this way : A company that released more greenhouse gases than permitted would have to buy allowances for the extra pollution .
The allowances would be sold in the market from a pool that came from companies that cut their missions below their required cap .
Some environmentalists were still unhappy with the bill 's system for handling these allowances , which permit companies to emit greenhouse gases .
Environmental groups would like to see them auctioned off and the proceeds go for consumer rebates and incentives for clean energy projects .
Industry groups say an auction - only approach would be too costly to meet .
Warner and Lieberman have tried for a compromise that would start with auctioning off about one - quarter of the allowances , and increasing the number sold to 73 percent by 2036 .
But Friends of the Earth president Brent Blackwelder warned that bill 's approach " means that polluters will be rewarded with pollution permits worth tens or hundreds of billions of dollars or more . "
Boxer said she or another senator would introduce an amendment to test support for a 100 percent auction system .
" We 'll see if we can get 51 votes , " she said .
About half of the proceeds from the auctions would go to deploying clean energy technologies like solar , wind and geothermal energy as well as biofuels and plug - in hybrids .
The other half would help poor people pay their energy bills and weatherize their homes , as well for training for " green - collar " jobs and aiding species put at risk by warming .
Lawmakers plan a subcommittee hearing on the bill next week , and Boxer is pledging a vote in her committee by the end of the year .

newswire article commentary united states human & civil rights Should You Be On A Government Watch List ?
author : Jack Williams
The words " May pose a suspected threat to National Security " are so vague one can't wonder if that could " apply to stopping individuals wanting to fly to an anti-war or environmental protest .
Case in point : Currently , International air carriers are responsible for checking passengers against " government watch lists . "
That will change in 2008 .
Subsequently in 2008 , under the Federal Government 's " Secure Flight Program " the Government will begin not allowing U.S. Citizens on domestic flights until the government has prescreened a passenger 's information against " government Watch Lists . "
On its face that sounds great .
Everyone wants safe air travel .
The Government states , " Watch Lists " will be used to identify individuals who " may pose " a known or suspected threat to aviation or national security .
But what does that mean ?
" May pose a suspected threat to national security ?
U.S. Government officials have called protesters potential terrorists and a threat to national security .
The words " May pose a suspected threat ... " are so vague one can't help wonder if that could " apply to an individual wanting to fly to an anti-war or environmental protest .
You can read about the Government " Watch Lists " in the " Secure Flight Program " at :
http://www.tsa.gov/what_we_do/layers/secureflight/index.shtm
Note the Federal Government never defines what " may pose " actually means when they state , " may pose a suspected threat " to national security .
Have Americans reached a point where Citizens need to ask their representatives to clearly explain what lawful conduct or activities " may pose " a threat to National Security .
Especially because S.1959 the " Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act " could be passed by the Senate .
That Federal bill vaguely defines " homegrown terrorism " as " any planned act " that might use force to promote or accomplish a " political or social objective . "
No actual force need occur .
Government need only allege that an individual or organization thought about using force .
Under S.1959 anyone attending a planned anti-war rally or gun rights meeting could be erroneously alleged to be trying to coerce a government or its people .
S.1959 creates a " new government commission " that will determine and report to the U.S. Government which Americans are idealistically based toward Violence , or might or do support " Violent Radicalization ; or Homegrown Terrorism .
This " government commission " could report that most everyone joining a lawful protest was ideologically based toward violence should violence take place at a demonstration , which in America it frequently does .
Americans need to learn before S.1959 is passed if the bill 's vague and undefined provisions empower " a new government commission " to provide personal and other information on lawful U.S. Citizens and organizations to Federal Government Watch Lists .
Determine if findings and recommendations by the " a new government commission " can be used by government to prevent lawful U.S. Citizens from using domestic air travel in their own country .
Determine what the Federal Government means when they state in their " Secure Flight Program " individuals that " may pose " a threat to national security ?

Why Profiling and What to Profile ?
Last week we showed how we sped up Acunote ( our agile project management application ) using memory profiling .
That was the fish -- you can apply patches from that article and likely get nice boost for your app ( we got 5 x ) .
Today we give you the net and show how to identify performance and memory usage bottlenecks in your Ruby / Rails application .
Profiling performance and memory separately dramatically simplifies optimizing ruby code , and turns it into a deterministic profile / fix / go - faster / repeat loop , rather than ( profile or guess ) / fix / ( get disappointed ) / ( get discouraged ) loop it was before .
Read on to learn how .
Preparations And Tools
First , get Ruby 1.8.6 sources , patch them , compile and install .
Ruby 1.8.5 will work the same patch too .
Vanilla Ruby GC does n't give us enough information , hence the need for a patch ( composed from Sylvain Joyeux 's memory allocations patch , Stefan Kaes ' Railsbench GC patch , and my own memory counter ; the patch applies to both Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 ) .
It 's a good idea to install patched Ruby into its own prefix ( say , configure -- prefix= ~ / bin / ruby ) and to adjust the $ PATH every time you need to profile .
Second , install the recently released ruby - prof 0.6.0 .
gem install ruby - prof or gem update ruby - prof should do the job .
ruby - prof 0.5.2 does not have the memory profiler we 'll need , but you can patch it if you really need to .
It is important to have and use patched ruby before you start installing ruby - prof gem , otherwise installed gem will not have support for memory profiling compiled in .
Measure / Benchmark
Before profiling you need to measure the current state .
Forget about Rails logger and request time recorded there .
You need information about :
request time ;
size of memory allocated during the request ;
number of objects allocated during the request ;
number of GC collections ;
time spent in GC .
To get request time we 'll use Benchmark .
realtime {}
The get memory use and GC stats we 'll use this helper :
# Executes block and collects GC statistics during the block execution .
# Collected stats are printed to stdout ( or to the file set in $ RUBY_GC_DATA_FILE env var ) : # - allocated memory size ( in KB ) during block execution # - number of memory allocations during block execution # - number of GC collections during block execution # - time ( in milliseconds ) spent in GC # # Description string appears in stdout before statistics # Options are # - : disable_gc => true - disables GC during execution # - : show_gc_dump => true - shows GC heap dump after statistics def gc_statistics ( description = " " , options = {} ) # do nothing if we do n't have patched Ruby GC yield and return unless GC.respond_to ?

end
I personally find it Zen to create a special kind of integration tests for benchmarks ( let 's call them " performance tests " ) .
Using gc_statistics helper a performance test can look like this :
class PostsPerformanceTest < ActionController :: IntegrationTest def test_index puts " posts / index : " benchmark_time : get , ' posts / index ' benchmark_memory : get , ' posts / index ' end
< span class= " k " > def </ span > < span class= " nf " >benchmark_time </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " nb " > method </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " n " > url < / span >< span class= " p " > )</ span > < span class= " n " >measured_times </ span > < span class= " o " >=</ span > < span class= " p " > [ ]</ span > < span class = " mi " >10</ span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class = " nf " > times </ span > < span class= " p " >{</ span > < span class= " n " >measured_times </ span > < span class= " o " ><<</ span > < span class = " no " > Benchmark < / span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class = " nf " > realtime </ span > < span class= " p " >{</ span > < span class = " nb " > send </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " nb " > method </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " n " > url < / span >< span class= " p " > ) </ span > < span class= " p " >}</ span > < span class= " p " >}</ span > < span class= " nb " > puts </ span > < span class= " s2 " >" time : </ span >< span class= " si " >#{</ span >< span class= " n " > mean </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class= " n " > measured_times </ span >< span class= " p " > ) .</ span >< span class = " nf " > to_02f</span >< span class= " si " >}</ span >< span class= " s2 " > ± </ span >< span class= " si " >#{</ span >< span class= " n " > deviation < / span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class= " n " > measured_times </ span >< span class= " p " > ) .</ span >< span class = " nf " > to_02f</ span >< span class= " si " >}</ span >< span class=" se " >

end</span >
end
Sample output from such test will look like :
posts / index : time : 3.50 ± 0.01 memory : allocated : 150246 K total in 1650700 allocations , GC calls : 19 , GC time : 1500 msec
The results as in example output above suggest optimizing memory first because it 's possible to save more than a second by producing less garbage and doing less garbage collections ( 19 is too much ) .
My experience in optimizing Rails apps tells that normally you should aim at 1 - 2 GC calls per request and ideally you can get no GC collections at all .
Of course , some long requests may inevitably use more memory but the rule of thumb is : less GC collections is better .
How to Profile
Profiling with ruby - prof is very similar to measurements we 've seen above .
Integration tests again become the Zen way to profile ( let 's call them " profiling tests " ) .
Profiling test should :
run ruby - prof to generate processing time profile ;
run ruby - prof to generate memory profile ;
output profiling results in a suitable format ( preferably , calltree ) .
For example , profiling test can look like this :
require ' ruby - prof '
class PostsController alias : index_orig , : index def index RubyProf.start index_orig result = RubyProf.stop
< span class= " n " > measure_names </span > < span class= " o " >=</ span > < span class= " p " >{</ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " o " >::</ span >< span class = " no " >MEMORY </ span > < span class= " o " >=></ span > < span class= " s1 " >' memory ' </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " o " >::</ span >< span class = " no " >PROCESS_TIME </ span > < span class= " o " >=></ span > < span class= " s1 " >' time '</ span > < span class= " p " >}</ span > < span class= " n " > printer </ span > < span class= " o " >=</ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " o " >::</ span >< span class = " no " > CallTreePrinter </ span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class = " nf " > new < / span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class= " n " > result </ span >< span class= " p " > ) </ span > < span class= " n " > printer < / span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class = " nf " > print </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " no " >

end</span >
end
class PostsProfilingTest < ActionController :: IntegrationTest def setup GC.disable end def teardown GC.enable end
< span class= " k " > def </ span > < span class = " nf " > test_index </ span > < span class= " n " > profile </ span > < span class= "ss " >: get </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class= " s1 " >' posts / index '</ span > < span class= " k " > end </ span > < span class= " k " > def < / span > < span class = " nf " > profile < / span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " nb " > method </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " n " > url < / span >< span class= " p " > ) </ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class= " nf " >measurement_mode</span > < span class= " o " >=</ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " o " >::</ span >< span class = " no " >PROCESS_TIME </ span > < span class = " nb " > send </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " nb " > method </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " n " > url < / span >< span class= " p " > ) </ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " p " >.</ span >< span class= " nf " >measurement_mode</span > < span class= " o " >=</ span > < span class = " no " > RubyProf </ span >< span class= " o " >::</ span >< span class = " no " >MEMORY </ span > < span class= " nb " >send </ span >< span class= " p " >(</ span >< span class = " nb " > method </ span >< span class= " p " >,</ span > < span class = " n " > url < / span >< span class= " p " > ) </ span > < span class= " k " >
end</span >
end
Note that we do 2 separate profiler runs , one for PROCESS_TIME and one for MEMORY .
That 's because the profiler only supports measuring one thing at a time .
There are a few more things to note .
The code disables GC for the time of request .
Otherwise ruby - prof attributes full time cost of garbage collection to the method where GC gets triggered , not the methods that allocate the memory .
For profiling we need deterministic behavior without GC .
See original article for more info on this .
Second , the test records profiler information only for controller action .
There 's no point in profiling Rails integration testing framework and GCI dispatcher when we need to profile only our application .
Finally , and most importantly , the code outputs results in the calltree format for use with excellent KCachegrind profiler data visualization tool by Josef Weidendorfer .
Using KCachegrind
With KCachegrind you get all the goodies :
the list of methods sortable by both their total time and self time ;
call graph visualization ;
easy access to callers and callee 's of any given function ;
cycle detection in the code ;
profiler - annotated source code listings ;
more stuff like search , relative and percentage cost calculations , etc .
In short , with KCachegrind it is much easier to understand profiler output compared with using plain text and HTML formatted ruby - prof results .
I guess the example screenshot below will be the best proof of that .
KCachegrind is a part of KDE kdesdk distribution .
Linux 'ers should not have any troubles installing it .
On MacOS X you can install KCachegrind from either MacPorts with port install kcachegrind or from Fink .
In both cases Apple X11 is necessary .
Those who still are on Windows may try installing KCachegrind from KDE - Cygwin or resort to WinCacheGrind or even to HTML output .
By this point you should get all the data and only a few simple things left to do .
KCachegrind 's function profile sidebar will show you which methods took long to execute and which methods ate the memory .
Call stack sidebar and call tree will show you where those methods are called from .
Source listing will help you to traverse the call tree and locate hotspots .
This is all you need to understand where you app is slow and where it eats lots of memory .
Next step is to fix these problems .
How to Optimize
Unlike profiling , optimization is not deterministic and there 's no universal recipe on how to fix the slowdowns .
There 're some common tricks and although they are off topic here , I 'll give you some most important ones :
look for Kernel #clone in profiler and fix your code - never clone objects ;

Dawn Of The Ion Age
by Dr Marc D Rayman
Pasadena CA ( SPX ) Dec 25 , 2007
Dawn is climbing away from the Sun on a blue - green pillar of xenon ions as it begins a new chapter in its mission .
After the remarkably successful initial checkout phase , the project is now in the interplanetary cruise phase .
When last we visited Dawn , it had superbly demonstrated that it was ready to fly the way it will for most of the mission .
Although there will be many special activities during its journey to Vesta and from there to Ceres ( and be sure to visit this site again to be among the best informed on your planet of what Dawn is doing ) , the probe will spend most of its time doing what it is doing today : patiently reshaping its orbit around the Sun with its amazingly efficient ion propulsion system .
Without taking any more time than was needed for some high fives ( and a few high sixes for the more mathematically avant - garde ) following the flawless execution of the test of long - term thrusting , the team turned its attention to more checkout activities .
Ion thruster # 2 was the focus of tests on November 13 - 15 , and the excellent results matched those of thrusters # 1 and # 3 .
( The identities and locations of the thrusters were revealed in a previous log before such information could be publicized by more sensational , vulgar sources . )
November 19 was the first in - flight use of the spacecraft 's main antenna .
( In fact , that antenna was used in some of the thruster # 2 tests , in which the spacecraft was oriented so the antenna cast a shadow on the thruster .
This permitted operation at the highest throttle level without overheating while still relatively close to the Sun .
We recommend even to official Dawn scorekeepers that that not count as the antenna 's first use . )
Because of the celestial geometry earlier in the mission , pointing the main antenna to Earth would have exposed sensitive components elsewhere on the craft to too much solar heating .
All communications prior to the use of the main antenna relied on 1 of the 3 smaller antennas that do not emit as tight a radio beam .
As the distance to the spacecraft increases , the smaller antennas will allow only very slow communications , while the main antenna , with a diameter of 1.52 meters ( 5 feet ) , will permit the return of many pictures and other scientific data even from distant Vesta and Ceres .
Much of the rest of the initial checkout phase was dedicated to updating software on the spacecraft .
Many units onboard , both in engineering subsystems and in science instruments , incorporate their own computers , but the command and data handling subsystem contains the master computers .
One main computer runs operations aboard the ship , and another computer supports it ( and has a few other responsibilities of its own ) .
Each of these computers has an identical backup , able to take over should the primary unit experience problems .
With a planned 8 - year mission in the forbidding environment of deep space , Dawn may face challenges that require more than such backup hardware .
So each main and each support computer holds both a primary and a backup copy of the software .
If radiation or some other problem corrupts one version of the software , the system can detect that and resort to another .
Engineers recognized well before launch that new software would need to be loaded during the initial checkout phase .
As extensive as ground testing was , the team anticipated that the need for some updates would be identified once Dawn was operating in space .
In addition , during the last few months before launch , when ongoing testing ferreted out bugs , only those changes that were essential for the beginning of the mission were made .
Modifying complicated software is -- well , complicated ; and seemingly simple changes can have unintended consequences .
To allow thorough testing of the spacecraft 's capability to complete the complex and critical steps after separating from its Delta rocket , as described on September 21 , late prelaunch changes to the software were kept to a minimum , and an improved version was planned for November .
Following the popular trend of giving software a snazzy name , the project denoted the latest suite " flight software 7.0 . "
We fully expect this to inspire new toys , movies , fashions , and even lifestyles ( particularly among readers in the Pleiades ) , and Dawn 's marketing department is standing by to work with you .
On November 20 , the new software for the support computers was radioed from Earth and installed separately on the primary and backup units in the command and data handling system .
The software for each computer requires 67 files occupying about 135 kilobytes with a total of 22,800 lines written in the programming language C and in assembly code .
The backup copies of the 7.0 software were transmitted to both computers on December 6 .
Each of these activities required great care , verifying that the computer memory remained healthy throughout , that no bits were lost or altered in transmission or storage , and that if an unrelated problem arose on the spacecraft during the process , the computers would be able to handle it , never being left in a vulnerable state .
Each step was tested and verified repeatedly with the indispensable Dawn spacecraft simulator at JPL ( down the hall from mission control and around the corner from the very popular Dawn ice cream freezer and the less popular Dawn fruit bowl ) .
Loading software into the main computer was still more complex than doing so in a support computer .
To start running the new software , the computer would have to be rebooted .
While that is a familiar and straightforward procedure for most terrestrial readers in the early 21st century , it is considerably more complicated when the computer is in control of a spacecraft in flight .
On November 26 and 27 , the main computer 's memory was checked , its health was verified , and the updated software was sent from mission control to the Deep Space Network stations in California , Spain , and Australia ( the work took long enough that all 3 communications complexes were required ) , and then 17 million kilometers ( 11 million miles ) to the main computer .
The 2.6 megabytes of 7.0 software for that computer consists of 591 files totaling more than 410,000 lines of C and assembly code .
After loading all the software , operators began preparing the spacecraft for rebooting , scheduled for November 28 .
Whenever the main computer reboots , it commands the spacecraft into " safe mode . "
Other conditions can trigger this mode as well , including separation from the rocket on September 27 .
The probe does not know whether safe mode was planned , as it would be with the installation of new software , or was called in the process of dealing with a problem when ground controllers were not available to intervene .
Most of the characteristics of safe mode remain as they were on launch day , but there are some differences now .
Dawn no longer has to wait for xenon to stop spinning , and it does not have to deploy its solar arrays .
It still points one face to the Sun , the only easily identifiable spatial reference throughout its flight in the solar system .
For the first few weeks of the mission , the relative locations of the Sun , Earth , and spacecraft required Dawn to sweep its safe mode radio signal like a searchlight that would periodically illuminate Earth , as explained before launch .
For the rest of the mission , from Dawn 's vantage point well outside Earth 's orbit around the Sun , the planet and star always will appear close enough together that the spacecraft can use the broad beam of an antenna that points at the Sun in safe mode , instead of an antenna at right angles to it .
While extremely weak ( as we will see in a log early next year ) , the faint radio whisper that would reach Earth would still be loud enough to be heard .
In October , controllers modified safe mode so it would employ this other antenna .
After the reboot preparations were completed on November 27 , most team members went home to get some rest for the activities scheduled for the subsequent 2 days .
After they commanded the reboot and Dawn established itself in safe mode , the Deep Space Network would need to capture the radio signal , they would have to verify that the software was operating correctly , and then the long process of bringing it out of safe mode to normal operations would begin .
Exquisitely detailed plans for each step had been formulated with great care , but when the team left for the day , they did not know that a single surprise lay in store .
Around 10:00 pm PST on November 27 , the spacecraft 's main computer rebooted , just half a day before operators planned to command it , and Dawn entered safe mode .
As soon as the Deep Space Network detected the corresponding change in the radio signal and the small night - shift team in mission control realized what had happened , a different plan , known dryly as " anomaly response , " was put into action .
Some team members were called back in to JPL and spent the entire night investigating this unexpected event ; some others were in occasional contact by telephone or Internet .
As many team members as possible were not disturbed , so they would be fresh the next day to pick up after the anomaly team 's overnight work .
( In the same vein , although your correspondent was among those who went to JPL , he opted not to contact you right away ; rather , he chose to let you read about it now , under more leisurely circumstances . )
The team first used the trickle of data from the distant probe to verify that it was indeed safe .
Then , proceeding with great diligence , given the unanticipated behavior of the computer , they downloaded certain diagnostic files .
All indications were that Dawn was quite healthy , with no apparent signatures of a lingering problem .
By the middle of the day on November 28 , engineers had determined that the new software ( automatically loaded when the computer rebooted ) was doing well and the spacecraft was ready to resume its work .
That day and the next had been planned already for the time - consuming transition from safe mode to normal configuration , so most of the team followed those plans while others continued analyzing why the reboot had occurred .
On November 29 , all steps were complete , just as they would have been had the reboot been commanded the previous morning .
Even now the investigation into the unplanned reboot continues with simulators .
Meanwhile , the mission has progressed very smoothly .
The backup main computer received its primary copy of 7.0 on December 7 and its backup copy on December 14 .
The backup copy of the primary main computer 's software will be loaded in January during a hiatus in thrusting .
While flight software 7.0 had been tested extensively before being sent to the spacecraft , ever - prudent mission controllers had planned to conduct one additional test , this time on the spacecraft .
Because Dawn will spend most of its life thrusting with the ion propulsion system , engineers wanted to verify that the new software did not introduce any bugs that would interfere with this essential capability .
Under the guidance of the main computer , all systems operated well during the " thrusting validation " on November 30 .
In the subsequent 2 weeks , as they were finalizing plans for the beginning of interplanetary cruise , the team conducted another round of instrument tests .
Following the excellent results of the first set of tests in October , this month the science camera and the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer were pointed at specific targets to allow more thorough characterizations of their functions and capabilities .
Observations included Saturn ( too distant to appear as more than a bright spot to Dawn 's camera , but still useful for tests ) , Arcturus , Vega ( of special significance to your correspondent and his wife ) , and other stars and star fields .
While the primary science camera was operated for the first time in October , the backup had its first in - flight exercises on December 10 and 12 .
As the instrument and outreach teams find time , more views from the cameras and spectrometers will be here .
( Certain ones may take longer , while 3 - way negotiations drag on among the Dawn project , as - yet unnamed celebrities in the imaged star systems , and tabloids in those regions . )
Several lovely scenes have been captured .
While the brief encounter with Mars is still 14 months away , arrival at Vesta is 2.5 years after that , and rendezvous with Ceres takes place in 2015 , the excellent instrument tests whet our appetites for what will be revealed .
Readers are particularly recommended to see the image of a star field in Cepheus as well as the Eta Carinae Nebula ( known to some readers as NGC 3372 and to others as " home " ) , captured in a calibration image of the fine cluster of bright stars NGC 3532 , a popular sight for observers in Earth 's southern hemisphere .
Eta Carinae is a massive and unstable star in the gaseous star - forming nebula that bears its name , and it has displayed a highly variable brightness since it was cataloged 330 years ago .
For a time in the 19th century , it outshone all but one of the stars in Earth 's nighttime sky , despite being much much farther away than most .
It has faded and brightened several times since then , sometimes being too faint for naked - eye observation .
Dawn 's initial checkout phase was remarkably productive and has served extremely well to certify the systems on the spacecraft and in mission control for interplanetary cruise .
On December 14 , in addition to loading the backup copy of 7.0 into the backup main computer , controllers radioed to the probe all the instructions and data it would need for the first 37 days of the next mission phase .
The files were stored for use beginning on December 17 .
At 12:01 pm PST on December 17 , Dawn obediently began executing the instructions to reconfigure in preparation for long - term cruise .
Three hours later , it initiated the prestart sequence for the ion propulsion system .
While preparing for thrusting , the spacecraft also turned to aim ion thruster # 3 in the required direction .
This took the main antenna away from Earth - point , but the commands directed the craft to switch to one of the smaller antennas with broader coverage , allowing the team at JPL to monitor progress using signals received at the Deep Space Network complex in Spain .
After the spacecraft 's fine performance during initial checkout , engineers observing the beginning of thrusting expected no less .
During initial checkout , the ion thrusters were started a total of 16 times and accumulated about 11 days 14 hours of thrust .
( Some of the thrusting was for tests of the ion propulsion subsystem , and some was for tests of other subsystems or the entire Dawn system while thrusting . )
With this experience , there was little reason to be concerned , but prudence dictated verification that Dawn got underway smoothly .
Telemetry confirmed that thrust began on schedule at 4:08 pm , as Dawn began propelling itself deeper into space , farther from Earth and the Sun .
When the spacecraft turned its main antenna away from home , it set its sights elsewhere , on uncharted worlds , as it embarks on the next phase of its extraterrestrial expedition .
Dawn is 27 million kilometers ( 17 million miles ) from Earth or 70 times as far as the moon .
Radio signals , traveling at the universal limit of the speed of light , take 3 minutes to make the round trip .
DEKALB , Illinois ( CNN ) --
A gunman dressed in black stepped from behind a curtain at the front of a large lecture hall at Northern Illinois University on Thursday and shot 21 people , five of them fatally , then shot and killed himself , said university president John Peters .
Four died at the scene , including the shooter , and two later died at the hospital , he said .
At least 22 people , including a graduate student who was teaching an ocean sciences class , were shot , Peters said .
Seventeen victims were taken to Kishwaukee Community Hospital , its Web site said .
Of those , six were in critical condition and were flown to other hospitals .
One fatality , a male , was confirmed -- but was not the gunman , the hospital said .
Two were admitted , and three others were discharged .
The other five were not addressed on the Web site .
Four of the fatalities were female , said Peters .
Most of the injuries are head and chest gunshot wounds , a hospital spokeswoman told CNN .
The gunman started shooting from a stage in the room shortly after 3 p.m. ( 4 p.m. ET ) in Cole Hall , officials said .
Police Chief Donald Grady said authorities do not yet know of a motive .
They know the identity of the gunman but have not released his name , Grady added .
The shooter was a graduate student at NIU in the spring of 2007 .
Currently he was not enrolled there but , Grady said , " He may have been a student elsewhere . "
Kevin McEnery said he was in the classroom when the gunman , dressed in a black shirt , dark pants and black hat , burst in carrying a shotgun .
See photos of the scene »
" He just kicked the door open , just started shooting , " said McEnery , who was in the class at the time .
" All I really heard was just people screaming , yelling ' get out . ' ... Close to 30 shots were fired . "
Watch a student describe the chaos at the scene »
There are about 162 registered students in the class that met in the large lecture hall .
A student described the classroom as having four exits - two at the front and two at the rear .
" Witnesses say someone dressed in black came out from behind a screen in the front of the classroom and opened fire with a shotgun , " Peters said .
At 3:03 p.m. , NIU police responded , and four minutes later , the campus was ordered into " a lockdown situation , " Grady said .
At 3:20 , an all - campus alert went out via the campus Web site , e-mail , voice mail , the campus crisis hotline , the news media and various alarm systems , he said .

" The message basically was :
There 's a gunman on campus , stay where you are , make yourself as safe as possible , " he said .
Rosie Moroni , a student at the school , told CNN she was outside Cole Hall near the King Commons when she heard shots coming from the classroom she was heading to .
The shot was followed by " a lot of people screaming , " then people ran out the doors yelling , " He 's got a gun , call 9 - 1 - 1 , " she said .
" It was complete chaos .
It 's very scary here right now . "
By 4 p.m. , DeKalb police had swept the area " and determined there was only one gunman " and that he was dead .
Grady said the man used three guns : a shotgun , a Glock handgun and a small - caliber handgun , and was still on the stage when he turned one of the guns on himself .
The small - caliber handgun has not been recovered , he said .
The shooter started with a shotgun , then switched to a handgun , said Grady .
A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives told CNN that agents were on the scene , and could help trace the weapon or weapons used .
Peters said the FBI is processing the crime scene and ATF was interviewing witnesses Thursday .
Events and classes were canceled until further notice , Peters said .
Seven counseling areas were set up throughout the campus , and hotlines were established .
Security around campus was increased in December when police found threats scrawled on a campus bathroom wall that included racial slurs and references to last April 's Virginia Tech shootings .

One of the threats said " things will change most hastily " in the final days of the semester .
Peters said there is no evidence that points to a link between the December incident and Thursday 's shooting .
Grady said it was unlikely authorities could have prevented Thursday 's tragedy .
" As much as we do , it 's unlikely that anyone would ever have the ability to stop an incident like this from beginning , " he said .
Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich declared a state of emergency , which will open the governor 's disaster fund to reimburse local government entities for " extraordinary expenses related to the response in NIU DeKalb " and will allow the state Emergency Management Agency to provide assistance , the governor 's office said in a statement .
The 113 - year - old school is 65 miles west of downtown Chicago and has an enrollment of more than 25,000 .
The campus covers 755 acres .

Recently there was a NYTimes article about a Harvard professor ( Charles Nesson ) and some of his students that formed a group that shows how poker can be used to teach cognitive skills .
The name of their group is the Global Poker Strategic Thinking Society .
Their idea is a good one .
I ’ve discussed it in an earlier post about Steven Lubet ’s book Lawyer ’s Poker : 52 Lessons that Lawyers Can Learn from Card Players .
His fun book is a great guide for how poker could be effectively used to teach lawyers how to become better lawyers .
But why stop at law ?
Since poker deals with risk assessment and situational analysis , it could be used in business school .
You could become a better negotiator or real estate agent because poker can teach you how to read people .
People , such as Nesson , also think poker should be used as an educational tool for middle schoolers learning math .
Wow !
If they had taught me about poker in middle school and explained things like pot odds , I would have loved math .
Would using poker as an educational tool for middle school kids encourage them to gamble ?
Perhaps .
But intuitively it seems to me that if you really understand the game of poker and probability you will less likely have a gambling addiction .
If you understand odds , you will see how stupid games like the lottery and slots are .
Perhaps , as Plato taught us over two thousand years ago , reason may have a great amount of control over desire .
Hence the more you know about the game of poker the less likely you will lose control to it .
There is a check post at the entrance to the Bamiyan Valley – one of the scores of shacks set along the earthen roads of Afghanistan designed to provide some appearance of security or , at least , a quiet place for policemen to sip their green tea .
But this one is different .
It 's not merely that the building marks the blessed end to an eight - hour ride over unpaved roads that shake the body like a box of matchsticks .
It is that this shack seems to mark the entrance into an Afghanistan of which the world has never dreamed .
Beyond it , flowering fields stretch between stark gray mountainsides like a green carpet interspersed with the gold of wheat ready for harvest .
In an unpretentious governor 's residence sits the only female governor in Afghanistan 's history – appointed to rule over a province where 52 percent of the registered voters are women , 10 percent higher than the national average .
And on a rocky plateau , behind knots of barbed wire , stand international soldiers who say they 've drawn the long straw in the Afghan war .
The area is so safe , they have n't needed to fire a shot since they arrived in 2003 .
All Afghanistan reveals surprises upon closer inspection , but no place more than Bamiyan , where history and geology conspire to produce a people and place of incomparable beauty .
To drive to Bamiyan is to earn it .
Granted , it is no wagon train across the Continental Divide , beset by snow , starvation , and wild beasts .
But by the measure of 21st - century convenience , it 's not too far removed .
It is to rattle along roads unfit for goats , skipping though pockets of questionable security , until at last you arrive in the cool vales of Bamiyan , coated in dust .
Upon arrival , my hair had the properties of a light - brown helmet .
Yet there is something almost spiritual in the drive .
Nearly 1,400 years ago , a Chinese pilgrim named Huien - Tsaing made a similar journey , cresting what he called the " Snowy Mountains , " that he might come to this valley where two towering Buddha statues had been carved into sandstone cliffs and dozens of cave - monasteries honeycombed the ruddy rock beside them .
Today , those Buddhas are gone , destroyed by the Taliban in an act that , ironically , brought Bamiyan more global attention than it had ever enjoyed .
But the echoes of those pilgrimages remain .
I 've never been to Lhasa , the former home of the Dalai Lama , but this is how I imagine one would approach it : a slow and winding climb through flat - roofed villages , clinging to bare mountainsides that scratch the watercolor sky .
I am with Farouq , my friend and colleague who accompanies me on all my Afghan travels .
" Does it get better than this ? " I ask him .
He merely smiles with forbearance as my camera whirs along the constant incline as we follow the courses of creeks and rivers , until the neutral browns and grays of the Afghan palette give way to conceited greens that seem aware that they are , in this arid corner of the world , extraordinary .
Here at the check post , Afghanistan becomes Montana , Switzerland , or some other idyllic place .
The 90 - degree F. roast of Kabul has turned into what seems a pleasant autumn afternoon .
Beside the road , the Bamiyan River gurgles serenely over slick stones .
" The nature of Bamiyan puts you into deep thinking appropriate for a place of meditation , " says Zemaryalai Tarzi , an archaeologist who has worked extensively in Bamiyan .
At the heart of the Bamiyan Valley rises an ancient citadel city , pale white against brush strokes of green , the seat of an empire conquered by Genghis Khan .
Clearly , we are back in Afghanistan – though I must feel rather different than did Genghis Khan when he stood here 800 years ago .
In his anger , he destroyed the citadel , and ever after , the wreck of a city – never rebuilt – was known as Ghulghula , or the City of Sighs .
My sigh is of relief .
Here , there is no Taliban , which means that when journalists and aid workers enter the valley , their mind can shut off – freed from the constant vigilance that is Afghan life .
" Aid workers love coming here , " says Jennifer Brick , a Kabul - based researcher for the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit , as she munches on bread and rice in a restaurant while here to study a key government program .
Most of the New Zealander soldiers sent here to maintain peace can't believe their good fortune .
Col. Roger McElwaine , commander of the Bamiyan Provincial Reconstruction Team , says it is so safe that his troops can go out on weeks - long patrols , driving to the remotest corners of the remote province to make their rounds .
When he mentions this to colleagues in other parts of the country , they 're dumbfounded .
In the south , for example , patrols leave the safety of their base for no more than a few hours at a time .
Curiously , the creator of this unusual eddy of Afghan peace is none other than Genghis Khan .
The people of Bamiyan clearly look different from most Afghans :
Their features suggest a Mongol origin , giving rise to the belief that they are the descendants of Genghis Khan 's horde .
The Taliban certainly believe it , which is one reason they want to exterminate the people of Bamiyan and central Afghanistan , known as Hazaras , who are Shiites in an overwhelmingly Sunni country and are seen as outsiders .
By virtue of its staunch opposition and remote location , Bamiyan held out against the Taliban five years longer than Kabul , falling in 2001 – only months before it was freed by US - backed Northern Alliance forces .
Bamiyan 's ethnic heritage also means that its uniqueness is not confined to its landscapes .
Long derided as brutal and beastly by the bigoted among Afghans , Hazaras are , in fact , among the most progressive groups in Afghan society .
At the office of a leading Bamiyan cleric sits his head of financial affairs , Latifah Naseri , bashful but not in a burqa .
In two weeks in Afghanistan , I can recall sitting in a room with only one other woman – the wife of a Westernized Afghan who lives half the year in Germany .
Outside Kabul and perhaps one or two other cities , women are not to be seen or heard by male guests .
Lavish dinners are cooked by women , and then served by their sons and brothers , so that the women may do their duties in anonymity .
In another part of the country , I told a dinner host to pass my compliments to the women who'd made the food .
He looked perplexed , as if I was asking him to recite the quadratic equation .
It simply did n't compute culturally .
But here , in the office of a senior cleric of the province , was a woman , doing a job – openly .
" I feel so comfortable when I go to any part of Bamiyan , " said Ms. Naseri , who looked rather uncomfortable answering a Westerner 's questions .
" But I have been to Baglan and Kabul , and even in Kabul I feel threatened . "
It is why President Hamid Karzai appointed a woman as governor .
People see her sex as irrelevant .
The farmers and traders of this valley care about electricity and roads , and their concerns are understandable .
Bamiyan , in some respects , has been the Land the World Forgot .
There are no paved roads and no connection to the meager Afghan electricity grid – when the local diesel - powered plant shuts off in the afternoon , there 's no power , save personal generators .
Yet there is an allure to that – as if the whole valley is hushed in one sustained exhale .
At daybreak , a haze of smoke settles in the valley as wood stoves kindle homes into the day 's activity .
And again at midnight , when there is only moonlight to illumine the valley walls , and the distant barking of dogs alone breaks the stillness , Bamiyan seems a world best left alone .
The suicide rate among US soldiers has reached its highest level since records began almost 30 years ago , officials said .
Last year , 121 active members of the army took their own lives , up 20 % on the previous year .
Thirty - four of last year 's deaths happened while the soldier was deployed in Iraq , compared to 27 in 2006 .
Also on the rise are attempted suicides and self - harm .
The number of soldiers who tried but failed to kill themselves or who deliberately injured themselves rose to 2,100 in 2007 , up from 500 in 2002 .
The Washington Post today reported on the case of Lieutenant Elizabeth Whiteside , who attempted suicide on Monday night by swallowing pills .
She left a note saying : " I 'm very disappointed with the army . "
Whiteside had been awaiting news on a potential court martial for pulling a gun on a superior officer and then shooting herself after suffering a mental breakdown while working as a medic at an Iraqi prison .
She is now in stable condition , and the charges against her have been dropped .
The Post said studies had found that failed personal relationships , legal and financial problems and job - related stress have been the most common factors in soldiers ' suicides .
With the army stretched thin by years of fighting two wars , the Pentagon last year extended normal tours of duty from 12 months to 15 .
Some troops have been sent back to the frontline several times .
Combat Stress , a British charity that provides care for veterans , said the most common mental illnesses it treats were depression , phobic disorders , obsessive compulsive disorder , substance abuse and post - traumatic stress disorder .
It said many of the veterans it treats suffered from more than one of these conditions .
Monkey viruses related to HIV may have swept across Africa more recently than previously thought , according to new research from The University of Arizona in Tucson .
A new family tree for African green monkeys shows that an HIV - like virus , simian immunodeficiency virus , or SIV , first infected those monkeys after the lineage split into four species .
The new research reveals the split happened about 3 million years ago .
Previously , scientists thought SIV infected an ancestor of green monkeys before the lineage split , much longer ago .
" Studying SIV helps us learn more about HIV , " said the paper 's first author Joel Wertheim , a doctoral candidate in the UA department of ecology and evolutionary biology .
" This finding sheds light on the future direction of HIV evolution . "
All SIVs and HIVs have a common ancestor , added senior author Michael Worobey , a UA assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology .
The new work suggests African green monkeys ' SIVs , or SIVagm , may have lost their virulence more recently than the millions of years previously thought .
Green monkeys almost never get sick from SIVagm .
If SIVagm was once a monkey killer , the change in its virulence may shed light on the future course and timing of the evolution of HIV .
The new research also challenges the idea that one ancient SIV was transmitted vertically , down through time , and evolved into many SIVs as its original host diverged into many different species .

Wertheim and Worobey suggest various SIVs arose because SIVs were transmitted horizontally , between primate species , and evolved into a new host - specific form only after transmission .
HIV arose from chimpanzee SIV that was transmitted to humans , probably when people had contact with chimpanzee blood from hunting and butchering the animals , Worobey said .
The team 's research article , " A Challenge to the Ancient Origin of SIVagm Based on African Green Monkey Mitochondrial Genomes , " is in the July issue of PLoS Pathogens and can be found at http://www.plospathogens.org.
The National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health funded the research .
Previous research had sketched out the family trees , or phylogenies , of the four species of African green monkeys and their accompanying SIVagm , but Wertheim wanted to know more .
" I was n't convinced by the evidence out there that these monkeys were infected before they speciated , " Wertheim said .
" So I set out to perform a rigorous test of that hypothesis . "
He extensively sequenced the mitochondrial DNA genes of the four species of African green monkeys .
Mitochondrial DNA is passed from mother to child .

The four green monkeys he studied are the sabaeus monkey , Chlorocebus sabaeus , which lives in western Africa ; the tantalus monkey , Chlorocebus tantalus , which is found in central Africa ; the vervet monkey , Chlorocebus pygerythrus , which lives in eastern and southern Africa ; and the grivet monkey , Chlorocebus aethiops , which lives in northeast Africa .
The scientists used the genetic sequences to sort out the ancestral relationships among the different species of monkeys .
Other researchers had already constructed phylogenies for the four different SIVagm that showed their relationships .
" We put together , for the first time , a really solid phylogeny for African green monkeys , which we did n't have before , " Worobey said .
If the monkeys ' ancestor had been infected with an ancient SIV , the SIV family tree should match that of the four monkey species .
The trees did n't match .
" The monkey tree was significantly different from the virus tree , " Wertheim said .
The researchers then looked at the geographic distribution of the four African green monkey species .
The relative ages and information on which pairs of SIVagm were most closely related revealed the probable transmission route of SIV .
The researchers hypothesize that the infection started in the westernmost species , sabaeus monkeys , moved east into neighboring tantalus monkeys , and then took one of two paths : southeast into vervets and then north into grivets or northeast into grivets and then south into vervets .
Wertheim said , " I was surprised that the geography could explain the virus phylogenetic tree , how well it fit .
You just look and -- there it is ! "
The UA researchers suggest that in the border zones where two African green monkey species ' ranges come in contact , transmission probably happened during interspecies sexual encounters or fights .
Wertheim pointed out that hybrid monkeys have been seen in the wild in the border zones .
Worobey said , " Some of the trends we see give new evidence on how quickly or slowly these changes take place . "
Citing some laboratory research that suggests HIVs from the late 1980s are more virulent than HIVs from the 2000s , Worobey added , " For HIV , the really cool thing is that these changes can take place on a more rapid timeline that previously thought . "
Wertheim adds , " Understanding how emerging infectious diseases evolve in their natural host organism helps us understand the disease 's possible trajectory . "
The team 's next steps are figuring out exactly when SIV infected African green monkeys and studying SIVs in other species of monkeys .

The Coen brothers ’ “ No Country for Old Men ” casts an ominous and mournful spell from the first shot .
Over scenes of a desolate West Texas landscape , an aging sheriff ( Tommy Lee Jones ) , ruminating on the new viciousness of crime , says that he ’s not afraid of dying .
But , he adds , “ I do n’t want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I do n’t understand .
A man would have to put his soul at hazard . ”
Without transition , we see Anton Chigurh ( Javier Bardem ) , an odd - looking man in a modified Prince Valiant haircut , murder first a deputy sheriff , then a stranger whose car he needs .
( He strangles the deputy and shoots the stranger with some sort of gun attached to what looks like an oxygen tank . )
The movie jumps again , to Llewelyn , an early - morning hunter ( Josh Brolin ) who ’s out in the desert tracking antelope .
In the distance , he sees five pickup trucks arrayed in a rough circle and some dead bodies lying on the ground .
He moves in slowly , rifle held low .
His attentiveness is so acute that it sharpens our senses , too .
Ethan and Joel Coen .
They may be the first major filmmakers since Preston Sturges to exploit the dramatic possibilities of stupidity .

In the past , Joel and Ethan Coen have tossed the camera around like a toy , running it down shiny bowling lanes or flipping it overhead as naked babes , trampolined into the air , rise and fall through the frame in slow motion .
Now they ’ve put away such happy shenanigans .
The camera work and the editing in the opening scenes of “ No Country ” are devoted to what the hunter sees and feels as he inches forward : earth , a brush of wind , and the mess in front of him , the remnants of a drug deal gone bad .
So powerful are the first twenty minutes or so of “ No Country ” — so concentrated in their physical and psychological realization of dread — that we are unlikely to ask why Chigurh kills with a captive - bolt gun ( the kind used in killing cattle ) rather than a revolver , or if it makes any sense for Llewelyn , a likable welder and roughneck , to return to the scene with water for a wounded man after he ’s made off with two million dollars in drug money .
“ No Country ” is based on Cormac McCarthy ’s 2005 novel , and the bleak view of life that has always existed in the Coens ’ work merges with McCarthy ’s lethal cool .
After these initial scenes , Chigurh poses hostile and unanswerable questions to the baffled owner of a roadside gas station ( Gene Jones ) , and the mind games are prolonged to a state of almost unbearable tension .
Watching the movie , you feel a little like that gas - station owner — impressed , even intimidated .
That ’s a strange way to feel at a Coen brothers movie .
For almost twenty - five years , the Coens have been rude and funny , inventive and tiresome — in general , so prankish and unsettled that they often seemed in danger of undermining what was best in their movies .
Have they gone straight at last ?
The Coens form a conspiracy of two — industrious , secretive , amused , and seemingly indifferent to both criticism and praise .
Early in their careers , they gave detailed interviews , but in recent years they have discussed only specific and relatively trivial matters concerning their movies , avoiding comments on larger meanings or anything approaching a general intellectual outlook .
This strategic reticence — the avoidance of art talk — is solidly in the tradition of American movie directors ’ presenting themselves solely as pragmatic entertainers .
But the Coens have gone further into insouciance than any old - time director I can think of .
In the opening titles for “ Fargo ” ( 1996 ) , they announced that the movie was based on a true story , though it was n’t .
“ O Brother , Where Art Thou ? ” ( 2000 ) begins with a title stating that the movie is “ based upon ‘ The Odyssey ’ by Homer , ” which they later claimed they had never read .
From the beginning , they ’ve been playing with moviemaking , playing with the audience , the press , the deep - dish interpreters , disappearing behind a façade of mockery .
Consider a key moment in their first film , “ Blood Simple ” ( 1984 ) .
Two adulterous lovers , Ray ( John Getz ) and Abby ( Frances McDormand ) , frightened and at odds with each other , are standing at a screen door .
As they talk , we see something flying end over end toward them .
It hits the door with a thwack , but turns out to be just the morning newspaper .
“ Blood Simple ” is the kind of adultery - and - murder story that James M. Cain would have written in the nineteen - thirties and Hollywood would have made a decade later into a seductive work of cinematic nightshade — the kind of picture that , as James Agee put it , lulled the audience into “ a state of semi-amnesia through which tough action and reaction drum with something of the nonsensical solace of hard rain on a tin roof . ”
There ’s no such solace in “ Blood Simple , ” which was shot not at night in the labyrinthine big city but in the glare of rural Texas .
That thwack gave the audience notice that the Coens were going to pull at any rug it might be standing on .
For example , the romantic attraction between the lovers , which sets the story in motion , does n’t mean a thing ; it ’s completely without heat .
What interests the Coens is how foolishly people behave , and how little they understand of what they ’re doing .
The lovers keep misreading signs , misperceiving what ’s going on .
The Coens may be the first major filmmakers since Preston Sturges to exploit the dramatic possibilities of stupidity .
In Sturges ’s movies , however , you do n’t feel that the rubes and yokels are being put down .
Sturges was an affectionate satirist of gabby democratic vitality , but the Coens can be sardonic , even misanthropic .
In their world , stupidity leads to well - deserved disaster .
In “ Blood Simple , ” the cuckolded husband ( Dan Hedaya ) hires a vicious private eye ( M. Emmett Walsh ) to get rid of his wife and her lover , but the private eye double - crosses the husband , killing him instead , and sets up the lovers to take the fall .
He laughs to himself , enjoying what a bad guy he is , but then , chasing Abby , he reaches out of a window and into an adjacent one , only to get his hand tent - pegged to the sill by her knife .
The Coens spread dark blood on the floor in a spirit of play .
Even fans of the movie ( including me ) came away feeling a little wounded .
If “ Blood Simple ” suggested that the Coens did n’t want to make a thriller so much as tease one into existence , “ Miller ’s Crossing ” ( 1990 ) sported with the form in heavier and grimmer ways .
The movie is set during Prohibition , in a nameless , sombre - looking city dominated by Irish and Italian gangs .
The openly corrupt atmosphere and much of the slang ( “ What ’s the rumpus ? ” ) come out of Dashiell Hammett ’s novels “ Red Harvest ” and “ The Glass Key , ” as does the hero ( Gabriel Byrne ) , a morose , alcoholic , and mysterious loner who plays the gangs off against each other .
Shot in sullen browns and greens , “ Miller ’s Crossing ” begins as a rapturous Bertoluccian piece of filmmaking , and , with the Gabriel Byrne character front and center , the Coens seem to be saying , or confessing , something about the inability to express feeling .
But the situations and the dialogue are so stylized — so manically fretted with crime - genre allusions and tropes — that the Coens killed whatever interest we might have taken in their story or in their hero .
Perversely , they invented a new form of failure , acting in bad faith toward themselves .
In the comedy that the Coens made between those two thrillers , they found a style that did n’t trip over its own excesses .
“ Raising Arizona ” ( 1987 ) has the lilt and shock of a disjointed folk ballad .
This tall tale is set in a sun-drenched Arizona whose reddish deserts and magnificent mountains are disfigured by trailer homes and Short Stops — paradise giving way to suburbia .
A young married couple — Hi ( Nicolas Cage ) , a semi- retired convenience - store thief , and Ed ( Holly Hunter ) , an ex-cop — decide that , since they cannot have a child of their own , they have the right to snatch one of the quintuplets born to a wealthy couple .
This time , the Coens expressed open affection for their lunkheads :
Hi and Ed talk in moralistic platitudes culled from the Bible and self - help manuals , and , loving their snatched quint , they desperately want to do what ’s right — that ’s the comedy built into their outrageous behavior .
Their struggle is accompanied by subdued yodelling and Beethoven ’s Ninth , played on a banjo .
The Coens ’ joking is inseparable from topography .
In every movie , working first with the cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and later with Roger Deakins , they establish a specific landscape , and pull whatever eccentricities they can out of it .
In “ Arizona , ” two prison buddies of Hi ’s show up at the house and steal the baby , but then mistakenly leave him in a car seat along the road .
Shrieking with remorse ( they , too , have fallen in love with the kid ) , they drive back for him , and the camera sweeps across the blacktop , as if sliding on an oil slick .
The Coens may have been larking again with genre spoof — this time , of the late - sixties road - hog films — but they were the first to think that a tot ’s point of view might be cooler than a biker’s .
These three movies established the emotional and stylistic range of the Coen turf — the flagrancy , the jack - rabbit creativity , and the self - destructive whirl of unhinged pop scholarship .
The filmmakers clearly had no interest in ordinary Hollywood realism .
They could not tell their stories straight or develop themes ; their movies were jangled in style , adolescently skittish in mood , brilliant and flashing but without sensuality or much interest in women .
( Holly Hunter and Frances McDormand , who is Joel Coen ’s wife , play most of the women who show up . )
Using a stock company of actors ( John Turturro , John Goodman , Steve Buscemi , Jon Polito ) who were willing to play meatballs , hysterics , and killers , they made lurid thrillers and screw - loose comedies , all of them shot with a liberated camera that alternated between swooping runs and trancelike fixations on objects dislodged from their context — a hat flying beautifully through the woods in “ Miller ’s Crossing , ” a pair of dead fish lying atop a Zippo lighter in “ Blood Simple . ”
These objects were stuck somewhere between gag and symbol — a symbol without a referent .
( Gabriel Byrne ’s fedora , in “ Miller ’s Crossing , ” epitomized the décor of thirties gangster movies , but not their meaning . )
The movies were skewed genre commentary : surreal parody , offered without irony ; spoof that was too unstable to settle into satire .
As in a David Letterman routine , derisive quotation marks surrounded the higher sentiments .
“ Barton Fink ” ( 1991 ) , for instance , was a bizarrely malicious joke on a left - wing playwright ( John Turturro ) — Clifford Odets as he might have been imagined by Nathanael West .
The Coens portrayed the Odets character as an openmouthed prig and phony who goes to Hollywood in the early forties and sinks into artistic paralysis .
As the answer to Fink ’s lame and literal high - mindedness , the Coens appeared to be offering their own media - hip fluency .
They turned the writer ’s hotel into a flaming , horror - film fantasia out of “ The Shining . ”
In “ O Brother , ” three more openmouthed clods ( Turturro , George Clooney , and Tim Blake Nelson ) horse around in a Depression - era South soaked in myth and legend .
The movie is a stunningly uneven mix of cornpone monkeyshines , condescension , and lovely pastoral imagery .
Although “ O Brother ” revived the blues and country music of the period , it scorned such affecting Depression - era classics as “ I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang ” and “ The Grapes of Wrath . ”
The Coens , it seems , are irritated by the earlier naïve strains of earnestness or pathos .
You could call them nihilists , if only their subversions were more systematic ; or postmodernists , if their fooling were n’t so random that it shattered any academic category you could place it in .
Before “ No Country , ” the Coens had never made a movie that grossed more than fifty million dollars domestically , but , for good or ill , they ’ve never given up their aberrant panache , maintaining their independence by writing their own material and by keeping budgets low — sometimes very low .
( “ Fargo ” was made for just seven million dollars . )
If some of the movies have been misfires or hodge - podges , there are astonishing passages in many of them , like the Ku Klux Klan musical number in “ O Brother . ”
Except for “ The Man Who Was n’t There , ” a dud academic exercise , nothing the Coens did was spiritless , and a little more than a decade ago they stopped banging movie references together and made two harmonious masterpieces in a row , the first a tragic comedy , the second a slacker hymn of praise so gentle and goofy that it has floated off the screen into the fantasy life of the nation .
In “ Fargo , ” the Coens ’ topographical obsession yields a view of landscape as moral destiny .
Despite the title , the movie is set largely in Brainerd , Minnesota , where the snow falls so heavily that the fields and the sky merge into a single blinding mass .
Watching the horizon line disappear , one thinks of evil ’s white body — Melville ’s white whale and Robert Frost ’s “ dimpled spider , fat and white , on a white heal - all . ”
The movie is about the blurring of the ethical distinctions that people see and live by .
The protagonist , Jerry Lundegaard ( William H. Macy ) , who manages a car dealership , is deep in debt and needs more cash for a real - estate scheme .
He hires two thugs to kidnap his wife ; his wealthy father - in - law , he assumes , will come up with the ransom , which Jerry will use to pay the kidnappers , while keeping the lion ’s share .
Jerry is the most destructive of the Coens ’ dopes ; the confusion that he unleashes is so violent it comes close to farce .
But for once the Coens did n’t cross the line , and it turned out to make all the difference .
The pace of “ Fargo ” is deliberate , the tone deadpan , the style a flattening out of realism .
The Coens grew up in Minnesota and believed that something strange was going on there — a regional verbal tic that masked a collective nervous breakdown .
Jerry ’s idiocy is a product not just of personal fecklessness but of a way of life in which rampant greed ( among other things ) gets covered over by an implacable blandness .
Committed to politeness and the best of all possible worlds , Jerry has no inkling of his own wickedness — no words to put it in — and not the slightest fear that his idiotic scheme might fail .
The Coens ’ steady hand in this movie gives stupidity an appalling power .
The quiet directorial style takes in not only Jerry ’s depraved normality but also the brutishness of the two kidnappers ( Buscemi and Peter Stormare ) .
The morose Buscemi character protests against the silence of Stormare ’s dead - eyed killer so frequently that Stormare responds by feeding him into a wood - chipper , an act so casually ghoulish that the only response to it is laughter .
The black comedy encompasses even the good folks .
The pregnant sheriff , Marge ( McDormand ) , is more shocked by rudeness than by the bloody homicides that she successfully investigates .
She and her stolid husband , Norm ( John Carroll Lynch ) , a wildlife artist who paints wooden decoys , demand little ; they cuddle together in bed , awaiting their child , far happier than the grasping people outside in the snow .
In “ Fargo , ” the comic , violent , and gentle elements in the Coens ’ temperament achieve a perfect balance .
The surface of their work is often jumpy , even hyperactive , but in “ Fargo ” they associated goodness with , of all things , a state of rest .
That state , and its surprising life - affirming qualities , turns up again in “ The Big Lebowski ” ( 1998 ) .
The hero , known as the Dude ( Jeff Bridges ) , a waddling Los Angeles mammal in candy - striped shorts , T - shirt , and gray hoodie , gets into all sorts of trouble but wants only to be left alone .
“ The Big Lebowski ” received mediocre reviews and did little initial business , but over the years it has built an effervescent cult following .
There are minuscule and profane versions of the film on YouTube , as well as costumes , posters , stickers , and frequent regional stagings of a weekend “ Lebowski Fest , ” at which many White Russians ( the Dude ’s favorite drink ) are consumed by young men .
The devotion is entirely deserved .
As cult movies go , “ The Big Lebowski ” is much wittier than “ Animal House ” or “ Hairspray , ” and free of the dumb - bunny silliness of “ The Rocky Horror Picture Show ” or the fumy mystical pretensions of “ El Topo . ”
The jumping - off point for “ The Big Lebowski ” is the insolent Howard Hawks classic “ The Big Sleep ” ( 1946 ) , but this movie does n’t taunt its model ; it mutely reveres it , and finds a rhythm of its own .
In the Hawks film , Humphrey Bogart ’s incomparably adroit Philip Marlowe always anticipates the next moment , whereas the Dude , caught up in an indecipherable Los Angeles intrigue , is so limp and vaguely constituted that he can hardly complete a sentence .
He resists being drawn into a story ; he wants to spend his time bowling with his irascible friend Walter ( John Goodman ) , a Jewish convert who served in Nam and has become a rhetorically enabled face - down - in - the - mud kind of guy — he thinks the fact that Americans died heroically in Vietnam justifies his getting furious over the smallest incidents in his life .
Many of the Coens ’ idiots are obsessives , but Walter , who has burning eyes and a tight beard outlining a mighty jaw , is so fiercely methodical in his false syllogisms that you begin to understand paranoia as a form of intellectual egotism .
“ The Big Lebowski ” is a tribute to harmlessness , friendship , and team bowling .
It offers a persistent “ no ” to the hard - pressing American “ yes . ” Like “ Raising Arizona , ” it ’s a ballad held together by tenderness .
But it ’s not tenderness that impresses audiences in “ No Country for Old Men . ”
Stimulated by McCarthy ’s tough little sentences , which record action and thought but not sentiment , the Coens have hardened their style to a point far beyond what they accomplished in “ Fargo . ”
This movie never lets up .
Half of the Southwestern drug trade is after Llewelyn and his two million dollars , but they are most seriously pursued by the strangely armed Anton Chigurh .
The movie is essentially a game of hide - and - seek , set in brownish , stained motel rooms and other shabby American redoubts , but shot with a formal precision and an economy that make one think of masters like Hitchcock and Bresson .
The killer and the money - thief , as played by Bardem and Brolin , are alike in endurance , resourcefulness , and tolerance of pain .
We get to know their torn flesh with admiring intimacy .
Has there ever been a better chase ?
Tommy Lee Jones ’s sheriff remains on the sidelines ( he never really gets into the action of the movie ) and continues to make dejected remarks .
Civilization , it seems , has come to an end , petering out in the yellow - brown fields of West Texas .
But does the story support the sheriff ’s metaphysical dyspepsia ?
And have the Coens found , in Anton Chigurh , a correlative for their malign view of life ?
Who is Chigurh ?
What is he ?
He slaughters twelve people , and yet somehow manages to be seen by no one .
He kills a cop , yet the authorities never get their act together and track him down .
The plot , when you parse it from scene to scene , does n’t hang together as a crime story .
Some people have said that you cannot read the movie literally .
Chigurh is Death , they say , a supernatural figure , a vengeful ghost .
But what do you do with the realistic body of the movie if you read this one element supernaturally ?
Chigurh , despite Bardem ’s gravid tones and elocutionary precision , is not Death but a stalking psycho killer out of a grade - C horror movie .
You keep wondering when he ’ll return , like Freddy Krueger .
He ’s a trashy element in the book , too , but McCarthy gave him a shade more reality — he returns the money to the head of the drug syndicate and discusses an ongoing partnership .
He murders people , but he wants to continue working in the trade ; he ’s not quite the ineffable spirit of Evil .
The spooky - chic way the Coens use Bardem has excited audiences with a tingling sense of the uncanny .
But , in the end , the movie ’s despair is unearned — it ’s far too dependent on an arbitrarily manipulated plot and some very old - fashioned junk mechanics .
“ No Country ” is the Coens ’ most accomplished achievement in craft , with many stunning sequences , but there are absences in it that hollow out the movie ’s attempt at greatness .
If you consider how little the sheriff bestirs himself , his philosophical resignation , however beautifully spoken by Tommy Lee Jones , feels self - pitying , even fake .
And the Coens , however faithful to the book , cannot be forgiven for disposing of Llewelyn so casually .
After watching this foolhardy but physically gifted and decent guy escape so many traps , we have a great deal invested in him emotionally , and yet he ’s eliminated , off - camera , by some unknown Mexicans .
He does n’t get the dignity of a death scene .
The Coens have suppressed their natural jauntiness .
They have become orderly , disciplined masters of chaos , but one still has the feeling that , out there on the road from nowhere to nowhere , they are rooting for it rather than against it . ♦
Feb . 11 , 2008  -- Jason Rae is a typical junior in college .
He spends several hours a day in class at Marquette University in Wisconsin where he is majoring in history and political science .
He is closely following the Marquette basketball team and has the Golden Eagles ' schedule memorized .
But not many 21 - year - olds start their Monday with a personal breakfast with Chelsea Clinton , as Rae did this morning at the student union at the nearby University of Milwaukee .
Rae got the one - on - one treatment from the former — and possibly future — first daughter because he is a Democratic National Committee member from Wisconsin and thus a " super delegate , " one of the 796 free agents who can back any candidate in the race for the Democratic nomination .
Never Voted Before
Rae may be a typical college junior but he is certainly not the typical DNC super delegate .
He is only 21 years old — he has never voted in a presidential election because he turned 18 after Election Day in 2004 .
Since the race between New York Sen. Hillary Clinton and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama is so tight , Rae has become a power broker of sorts , as both campaigns push hard to lock down the support of super delegates .
Rae said he and Chelsea Clinton talked about electability and mobilizing young people to get involved in politics .
He said she spoke about what states her mother can carry in the general election and what demographics favor her candidacy .
The two talked about how the campaign 's operations were going in the states and what she is seeing on the ground .
The breakfast lasted about 30 minutes .
Rae said he had to hustle back to campus and get to his afternoon classes .
Rae was elected as a DNC member at the Wisconsin state party convention in June 2004 .
He was 17 years old at the time but there are no party rules that say a DNC member has to be of voting age .
Rae ran against and defeated the president of the state firefighters ' union and a state legislator .
Rae has been called on his cell phone by former President Clinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who tried to woo him to the Clinton side and Massachusetts Sen .
John Kerry , who was pushing for Rae to endorse Obama .
Super Delegate Gets Political Star Treatment
Despite the star power lighting up his cell phone , Rae told ABC News that he has no plans to endorse before the Wisconsin primary Feb. 19 .
Former President Clinton called Rae on his cell phone , Jan. 25 , the night before the South Carolina primary .
Rae was about to head out to dinner with friends when his phone rang and the screen said , " Number withheld . "
The voice on the other end said : " Please hold for the former president " and then a familiar voice said " Hey Jason , it 's Bill here . "
" I started to think , is this real ?
I am a junior in college and Bill Clinton is talking to me ? "
Rae said as he recalled the phone call .
Clinton talked about Hillary Clinton 's electability and gave Rae an update on how things were looking on the ground in South Carolina .
He then regaled Rae with stories about his travels to Wisconsin as president and the cities he visited during that time .
Rae received a call from Kerry , Feb. 1 , the Friday before the critical Super Tuesday showdown .
Kerry , too , talked about electability and also asked Rae about college life in general and even the weather .
Rae said he is getting a steady stream of calls from campaign staff and surrogates , including Rep. Tammy Baldwin , D - Wis. , and Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Barbara Lawton on behalf of the Clinton campaign .
But Rae said he is focusing on which candidate can win in November .
" Both have good positions , but it 's about who can win , " he said .
Last week , seven Swedish MPs wrote to a prominent Swedish tabloid newspaper ' Expressen ' to express their dissatisfaction with proposals for dealing with copyright infringers .
Now , that number has increased to 13 , and the issue seems to keep growing .
Initially , Karl Sigfrid , and 6 other MPs [ Members of Parliament ] wrote to Expressen ( Swedish , English ) to express their opposition to a plan proposed by Cecilia Renfors , a copyright analyst appointed by the Swedish government , in what Expressen called “ Seven MPs defy the party line : Legalizing file sharing is not just the best solution , but the only solution ” .
Her plan was that ISPs would close down the connections of filesharers , preventing them from participating in any further copyright infringement .
The condemnation for this was broad - based , from the Data inspection Board , the Competition Authority , all the way to the Swedish court of Appeal .
The message from the Moderate Party MPs to their AntipiratbyrÃ¥n supporting colleagues was “ be careful , they will never be satisfied ” , drawing parallels to the earlier attempts to ban MP3 players , and VCRs , both areas in which , having failed to ban , industry groups are now making a profit from selling content .
Karl Sigfrid told TorrentFreak that the APB proposals make no practical sense .
“ I think it could be solved in theory .
However , in reality , you would need such a surveillance system to achieve this that it would be all out of proportion .
So I do n’t think there ’s a feasilbe way of stopping individuals copying .
The cause for file sharing is basically that it ’s possible .
People have always done it to the extent that they ’ve been able to .
With cassette tapes 20 years ago and electronically today .
Copyright laws preventing individuals from sharing information have never been legitimate in the eyes of most people . ”
When asked about if it was down to content industries being slow to change their business practices , he replied : “ It ’s hard to say what would have happened if the content industries had been quicker releasing their material online , before the P2P networks grew mainstream .
Probably the illegal filesharing would be less extensive , but it ’s possible that it would still have been increasingly difficult for iTunes and such services to compete with free downloading .
The change needed might be so radical that it ’s no longer about selling copies of immaterial products at all . ”
Rickard Falkvinge , of the Swedish Pirate Party was understandably upbeat about it .
“ Karl Sigfrid ’s taking a stand marks a major turning point .
For the first time , an established politician shows deep - down understanding of the real conflict , instead of cluelessly humming along with a technophobical luddite industry .
Some other Swedish mainstream politicians have previously talked in terms of how it ’s unreasonable to declare war on an entire generation .
Sigfrid is the first to understand why . ”
His enthusiasm is understandable as , one Swedish torrent user put it “ a bunch of members of The Conservative Party have started listening to the policies of The Pirate Party , and they want to jump on their bandwagon , as it ’s gaining popularity ” .
Gaining popularity it is , as yesterday , thirteen members of Parliament joined in another attack ( Swedish only , no English translation at present ) on the likes of the APB , and recording industries , saying “ The record labels are obviously opposed to a development that makes them obsolete . ”
However , not everyone has been celebrating .
Pirate Bay administrator Brokep was skeptical , saying “ I ’m intrigued that the debate is sparking up again .
There ’s been a lot of lies from the politicians .
Promises and nothing has happened , so at least this will put the debate back on the map . ”
The initial seven MPs were Karl Sigfrid .

Ulf Berg. Lena Asplund .

The Pearly Gates club never closes .
Its public entrance , a revolving door , just keeps on spinning .
With each rotation some punters enter and others leave .
The club ’s owners would like to track this traffic .
Specifically , they ’d like to know the maximum increase in people entering the club over a given period .
The starting point is to track the people who enter / leave with each spin of the door .
Here ’s a 5 minute sample of that information .
Negative numbers mean more people left than entered during a particular cycle .
Entries Log 0 1 2 - 3 3 - 1 0 - 4 0 - 1 - 4 2 4 1 1 3 1 0 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 3 1 1 4 5 - 3 - 2 - 1 ...
Here ’s the same information plotted on a graph .
The archetypal problem we ’d like to solve can be stated :
Given a sequence of numbers , find the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of those numbers .
As an example , the maximum sum contiguous subsequence of 0 , - 1 , 2 , - 1 , 3 , - 1 , 0 would be 4 ( = 2 + - 1 + 3 ) .
This problem is generally known as the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem and if you have n’t encountered it before , I ’d recommend trying to solve it before reading on .
Even if you have encountered it before , I ’ll invite you to read on anyway — it ’s well worth another look .
The maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem appears in Jon Bentley ’s “ Programming Pearls ” .
He first presents a brute force solution which examines all possible contiguous subsequences of the initial sequence and returns the maximum sum of these subsequences .
A Python implementation might read :
def generate_pairs (n ) : " Generate all pairs ( i , j ) such that 0 <= i <= j < n " for i in range ( n ) : for j in range ( i , n ) : yield i , j def max_sum_subsequence ( seq ) : " Return the max - sum contiguous subsequence of the input sequence . " return max ( sum ( seq [i:j ] ) for i , j in generate_pairs ( len( seq ) + 1 ) )
It ’s a straightforward piece of code , though note the + 1 which ensures that we slice to the end of seq , and also that we include empty slices , which sum to 0 , handling the case when every item in the sequence is negative .
The trouble is , the algorithm is of cubic complexity : to process just 6 hours of logged activity takes over 2 minutes on a 2GHz Intel Core Duo MacBook , and the cubic nature of the algorithm means we ’d quickly fail to process more substantial log files in real time .
A simple optimisation eliminates the repeated calls to sum by accumulating the input sequence — the red line in the graph above .
Subtracting element i- 1 from element j of this cumulative sequence gives us the sum of elements in the range i , j of the original sequence .
We wo n’t study the code for this quadratic solution — it does n’t add much to our analysis .
Again , some care is needed to avoid fencepost problems .
We wo n’t look at the divide - and - conquer NlogN solution either .
It ’s hard to understand , and we can do far better .
There is a linear solution .
The idea is to scan the sequence from start to finish keeping track of maxsofar , the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence seen so far , and maxendinghere , the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence which ends at the current position .
Bentley ’s pseudo - code reads :
maxsofar = 0 maxendinghere = 0 for i = [ 0 , n ) /* invariant : maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate are accurate for x [ 0 ..i - 1 ] */ maxendinghere = max ( maxendinghere + x[ i ] , 0 ) maxsofar = max ( maxsofar , maxendinghere )
This translates directly into Python .
def max_sum_subsequence(seq ) : maxsofar = 0 maxendinghere = 0 for s in seq : # invariant : maxendinghere and maxsofar are accurate # are accurate up to s maxendinghere = max ( maxendinghere + s , 0 ) maxsofar = max ( maxsofar , maxendinghere ) return maxsofar
Now , this is a fabulous solution .
Bentley describes it as subtle .
Such a succinct code snippet hardly looks subtle , but I agree , the loop body does take a bit of understanding :
maxendinghere = max ( maxendinghere + s , 0 ) maxsofar = max ( maxsofar , maxendinghere )
Why does this work ?
Well , essentially maxendinghere is what ’s accumulating the subsequences — it keeps rolling the next element into itself .
Should this accumulated sum ever become negative we know that the subsequence - which - ends - here we ’re currently tracking is worse than the empty subsequence - which - restarts - here ; so we can reset our subsequence accumulator , and the first clause of the loop invariant still holds .
Combine this with the observation that maxsofar tracks peaks in maxendinghere and we ’re done .
The loop - invariant comment provides a good example of how comments can help us understand an algorithm , even though the code is minimal and the variable names are well - chosen .
I prefer to think of this problem in terms of streams — lazily evaluated sequences .
Think of our log file as generating a stream of numbers :
... 0 1 2 - 3 3 - 1 0 - 4 0 - 1 - 4 2 4 1 1 3 1 0 - 2 - 3 - 3 - 2 3 1 1 4 5 - 3 - 2 - 1 ...
The first thing we do is transform this stream to generate another stream , the cumulative sum of numbers seen so far .
It ’s an integration of sorts .
You ’ll remember we already used this stream , or an in - memory version of it , in our quadratic solution to the problem : the difference between points on it yields subsequence - sums .
We generate the accumulated stream from our original stream like this :
def stream_accumulate ( stream ) : total = 0 for s in stream : total += s yield total
The graph below samples the first five minutes of this stream .
The red line accumulates values from the pale grey line .
These accumulated numbers represent the number of members who have entered the club since we started tracking them .
On our graph , the maximum sum contiguous subsequence is simply the greatest Y - increase between any two points on this graph .
X ’s mark these points on the graph above .
( Note : it ’s not the Y - range of the graph we want since our X - values are time - ordered , and we require X1 <= X2 ) .
A second transformation yields the floor of the accumulated stream .
import sys def stream_floor ( stream ) : m = 0 for s in stream : m = min(m , s ) yield m
( Note that , for our purposes , the floor of the stream is n’t exactly the stream of minimum values taken by the stream — we enforce a baseline at zero .
It would be better to allow clients of this function to supply an optional baseline value , but I wanted the simplest possible code that shows the idea . )
Here ’s a graph plotting the accumulated entries alongside the floor of these entries .
We ’re very close to what we want now .
We can track Y - increases on the graph just by generating the difference between the accumulated stream and its floor — the shading on the graph .
Here ’s an implementation of stream_diff .
We ca n’t just plug a minus sign “ - ” into the mapping function , so we have to use the less wieldy operator .
sub .
import itertools import operator def stream_diff (s , t ) : return itertools.imap(operator.sub , s , t )
Alternatively , we could generate the new stream with an explicit loop :
import itertools def stream_diff (s , t ) : for ss , tt in itertools . izip (s , t ) : yield ss - tt
The final graph shows us the difference between the accumulated entry count and its floor .
I ’ve also added the ceiling of this stream as a thick red line ( I ’m sure you can figure out how to implement stream_ceiling ) , and this ceiling represents the stream of maximum sum contiguous subsequences .
We ’ve re-labelled the lines Max - so - far and Max-ending - here because they ’re the stream of values taken by the variables maxsofar and maxendinghere during Bentley ’s clever solution to the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem .
I think we ’re in a better position to understand how this solution works now .
Please do n’t imagine these streams are bloated .
They may be infinite ( remember the Pearly Gates club never closes ! ) but that does n’t mean they take up much space .
The graphs shown represent snapshots of their activity , and at no point do our presented algorithms actually store a five minute buffer of entries .
A final solution to the maximum sum contiguous subsequence problem reads like this .
We ’ve pushed the general purpose stream transformation functions into a separate module , stream.py .
import itertools import stream def max_sum_subsequence_stream(ss ) : " Return the stream of max sum contiguous subsequences of the input iterable . " accu1 , accu2 = itertools.tee(stream.accumulate(ss ) ) return stream.ceil(stream.diff(accu1 , stream.floor( accu2 , baseline=0 ) ) ) def max_sum_subsequence(ss ) : " Return the max sum of a contiguous subsequence of the input iterable . " return stream.last(max_sum_subsequence_stream(ss ) )
The iterable supplied to max_sum_subsequence has its last value read , and should therefore be bounded if we want the function to return .
We have n’t supplied arguments to extract a portion of this iterable ( to generate maximum subsequences for the club on a particular day , for example ) because that ’s what itertools .
islice is for .
Note that max_sum_subsequence_stream ( ) may be more useful to clients than max_sum_subsequence ( ) .
Suppose , for example , we ’re only interested when the maximum sum subsequence exceeds 100 .
We can do this directly by connecting itertools .dropwhile ( ) to our function .
def max_subseq_exceeds(seq , limit=100 ) : max_sub_s = max_sum_subsequence_stream( seq ) return itertools.dropwhile( lambda s : s <= limit , max_sub_s )
Perhaps we ’d like to know if the maximum sum subsequence reaches a plateau ; that is , it stays on a level for a while .
Here ’s the stream module .
For his first time behind the camera as a director , the actor Ben Affleck has chosen a brooding , serious drama about missing children , wayward parents and idealism lost and regained .
“ Gone Baby Gone ” is based on the novel by Dennis Lehane , who wrote the similarly themed “ Mystic River , ” which Clint Eastwood turned into a modern classic .
If Mr. Affleck has n’t raised his material to that rarefied level , he has taken a satisfyingly tough look into conscience , to those dark places where some men also go astray .
The story wants to break hearts : 4 - year - old Amanda McCready , a blond doll , has disappeared without a trace amid the squalor of her South Boston neighborhood .
The cops are out in formation , as are the television news vans , antennas raised high and all but trembling for blood .
Staring into the cameras , the neighbors eagerly offer ready - made headlines and self - flattering condolences : they ’re coming together , everyone loves Amanda .
The days tick past and the child ’s anxious aunt , Bea ( Amy Madigan ) , seeks help from a local private investigator , Patrick Kenzie , a squirt who looks as if he just dropped out of college and is played without an ounce of actorly ingratiation by Casey Affleck , the director ’s younger brother .
I ’m not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor .
Steven Soderbergh tapped him a few years back for recurring third - banana duties in the “ Ocean ’s Eleven ” films , and Gus Van Sant put him in “ Gerry , ” his 2002 avant - garde feature , in which Mr. Affleck roamed around a merciless desert landscape with Matt Damon , with whom he took turns playing Beavis and Butt - head , Vladimir and Estragon .
More recently he stole the show from Brad Pitt in the western “ The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford . ”
One of the unusual things about his performance as Ford was its lack of sentimentality .
He did n’t plead the character ’s case or remind us of his own humanity ; he just played the role .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Navy has moved the guided - missile destroyer USS Cole and other ships to the eastern Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon , Pentagon officials said Thursday .
A file image of the USS Cole , which the U.S. Navy moved to the Mediterranean Sea off Lebanon .
The deployment comes amid a political standoff over Lebanon 's presidency , but the Navy would not say whether the events are linked .
" It 's a group of ships that will operate in the vicinity for a while and as the ships in our Navy do , the presence is important , " Adm .
Mike Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Thursday .
" It is n't meant to send any stronger signal than that , " he said .
" But it does signal that we 're engaged and we are going to be in the vicinity , and that 's a very important part of the world . "
The Cole was badly damaged by an al Qaeda bombing during a port call in Yemen in 2000 , killing 17 sailors .
It returned to service in 2002 .
The destroyer and two support ships are close to Lebanon but out of visual range of the coast , Pentagon officials said .
Another six vessels , led by the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau , are close to Italy and steaming toward the other three , the officials said .
Mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming Lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president , which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week .
But he said the vote was " important , " and Washington was waiting for it to take place .
And a Bush administration official told CNN the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboring Syria that " the U.S. is concerned about the situation in Lebanon , and we want to see the situation resolved . "
" We are sending a clear message for the need for stability , " said the official , who was not authorized to speak for publication .
The ships " should be there a while , " the official added .
Lebanon 's pro-Western majority in parliament and the pro-Syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years .
The country has been without a president since November , when pro-Syrian leader Emile Lahoud 's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement .
Despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief Gen. Michel Suleiman , disagreements over how to share power in a future Cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote .
Parliament speaker Nabih Berri's office announced Tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to March 11 .
Berri's office said the Arab League needed more time to break the deadlock .
Lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes - violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri , whose supporters blamed Damascus for his killing .
The resulting outcry eventually drove Syrian forces out of Lebanon , where they had been stationed since the 1970s .

A former Graland Country Day School teacher has been sentenced to probation after she pled guilty today to sexual assault on a child by someone in a position of trust .
Meredith Hollen , 40 , entered her plea this morning and was immediately sentenced based on a stipulated plea to probation , said Lynn Kimbrough , spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney ’s office .
As part of the agreement , 11 sexual assault counts were dismissed , Kimbrough said .
“ This case was very much driven by the victim ’s wishes , ” she said .
“ This plea agreement did n’t have anything to do with her gender . ”
Hollen will be on probation from 10 years to life and initially she will be on intensive probation , Kimbrough said .
Previous reports indicated the charges were in connection with sexual assaults on a former student and occurred prior to this school year .
Hollen was not teaching at Graland this school year .
A big factor in the probationary sentence was the fact that the victim wished to remain anonymous , she said .
Because of that reason , prosecutors requested that the arrest warrant affidavit , which describes the offenses , remain closed , she said .
The former student from the elite K - 9 private prep school was between the age of 15 and 18 at the time of the assault , Kimbrough said .
Before the hearing today , Hollen had been free on a $ 50,000 bond .
Hollen now lives in California and has requested that she serve the probation in that state , Kimbrough said .
She must now apply with California authorities for the privilege .
As a condition of probation , Hollen will be required to attend sex - offender treatment , will report to a probation officer and must pay court fees .
She must also register as a sex offender .
If she violates conditions of probation , she could be sent to prison , Kimbrough said .

In a puzzling and potentially troubling development , an AIDS vaccine tested in a closely watched trial might have increased the risk among vaccine recipients of becoming infected with H.I.V. , researchers reported yesterday at a scientific meeting in Seattle .
But the researchers said not enough data existed to determine the meaning of the findings about the vaccine , which is made by Merck .
The increased risk was principally among a group of people who had pre-existing levels of immunity to a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 5 , which was modified to become a critical part of the vaccine .
Researchers emphasized that the vaccine itself could not cause AIDS , but one theory is that the cold virus may have activated the immune system in some way to make certain recipients more susceptible to becoming H.I.V.- infected when they were exposed to the AIDS virus .
But participants at the meeting also emphasized that the findings could be a statistical fluke and that nonbiological factors might have accounted for the difference .
Examples of such factors are rates of circumcision and sexual practices among trial participants .

The weather is appalling , the Christmas credit card bills are landing on the doorstep . . . and you 've already broken your New Year 's resolutions .
But do n't worry , if you can just get through today , things will start to look up .
Monday , January 21 , you see , has been officially declared the gloomiest day of the year .
Scroll down for more ...
Psychologist Cliff Arnall , an expert in depression , has used a mathematical formula to pinpoint today as Blue Monday .
He says it is the day when six factors come together to leave us at our most miserable .
They are : the dank and gloomy weather ; Christmas debt ; a feeling of monotony after the Christmas cheer has faded ; broken New Year 's resolutions ; low levels of motivation ; and a desperate feeling that you need to take action to improve your drab existence .
Millions are also still struggling to get back into the routine of working after a long Christmas break - and many will not have their next holiday until August .
Blue Monday may be compounded by the fact that , according to other research , many people get their worst night 's sleep on Sunday because they dread the prospect of going back to work the following day .
Mr Arnall , a former academic at Cardiff University , whose research was commissioned by personal development company Advance Performance , said one of the best ways to beat the blues was simply to stop moaning .
" If you are a regular whinger or moaner about the weather or minor ailments , stop , " he said .
" It is boring and you are boring .
" Focus on the good things you do have in your life .
If one of your limbs does not work , focus on the three that do . "
Other tips include : stop seeing those you do not like ; start saying " no " to unreasonable requests ; and help others by doing voluntary work .
Researchers say many workers lose up to one hour 's sleep on Sunday night because they hate the idea of returning to work on Monday morning .
Difficult bosses , looming deadlines and important presentations can all keep workers awake on a Sunday night .
The best night is Friday , when the working week is over and many are looking forward to the prospect of a relaxing weekend .
Leigh McCarron , of hotel chain Travelodge , which commissioned the research , said : " Millions of workers are starting the week tired and unmotivated .
" One in ten say their sleeping patterns are at their worst in January as they return to work after Christmas and feel unable to cope with increased workloads . "

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - U.S. immigration officials said on Thursday they had dismantled a Guatemalan human smuggling ring that brought more than 100 illegal immigrants a week into the Los Angeles area .

ICE officials said on Thursday they had dismantled a Guatemalan human smuggling ring that brought more than 100 illegal immigrants a week into the Los Angeles area .
REUTERS /ICE / Handout
Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) said 13 people , including two of the suspected ringleaders , face charges in connection with what officials described as one of the largest human smuggling operations uncovered on the West Coast in recent years .
The nearly three - year investigation was sparked by the discovery in May 2005 of two “ drop ” houses in south Los Angeles where more than 140 illegal immigrants were living .
According to court documents , immigration agents uncovered an organization run by Guatemalan nationals that provided housing and transport to immigrants who had already been smuggled across the U.S. - Mexico border to Phoenix .
The immigrants were taken from Arizona to the Los Angeles area where they were held in drop houses before being loaded onto vehicles and driven to U.S. cities around the nation .
The immigrants , mostly from Central America , paid the organization between $ 1,200 and $ 3,700 each for the journey .
“ Based on our investigation , we suspect this ring was transporting more than 100 illegal aliens a week into this area , ” said Los Angeles ICE investigator Jennifer Silliman .
“ The human smuggling trade is a ruthless , greed - driven enterprise that puts communities at risk and generates billions of dollars in illicit proceeds , ” she said .
Seven suspects , including a third alleged ringleader , are still being sought .
Those in custody face charges of transporting and harboring illegal aliens .
An estimated 12 million illegal immigrants , most of them Latinos , are thought to be living and working in the United States .
Attempts to reform U.S. immigration laws and provide a path to legal status have been stalled in Congress for almost two years .
Click to viewWe've had the Asus Eee PC $ 399 4GB model in my house since launch .
And while you can't argue with the system 's unbeatable size / performance / price ratio , users should know that once the honeymoon euphoria of the cheap ultraportable wears off , they 're going to deal with some persistent issues that very well may be deal breakers .
Advertisement
Screen
You know the 7 - inch screen size will be small — but really , it 's too small for extended use .
Seeing my wife working on the laptop , I watch as the screen gradually moves closer and closer to her face , until she 's basically wearing the computer like video goggles .
A 10 - inch screen model sounds like the sweet spot , and more what you 've envisioned as ideal .
Bugs
The system is , quite simply , not stable to work on .
It freezes up frequently when just going through the system 's dashboard — even without multitasking in progress .
And launching OpenOffice apps can be a hit or miss process , too .
Sure , the system is easy enough to reboot ( and speedy in this regard as well ) , but the OS just never feels stable .
Advertisement
My guess is that bugs and performance issues stem from a hardware problem ( maybe that stick 512 MB is n't enough after all ) and an unpolished OS ( Asus ' custom Linux system could use a few patches for sure ) .
But , most certainly , the 512MB of RAM is n't enough given the inefficiency of the OS 's memory management .
Asus , where are our updates ?
We 're still running software version 1.0 .
This must be the least - patched OS in history .
Wi-Fi
The biggest annoyance , by far , has to be the system 's subpar Wi-Fi .
If nothing else , the Eee is meant to be a web - surfing machine , the perfect companion to your overpriced espresso drink .
But it has a ton of difficulty finding hotspots .
Expect to retry detection several times before a list of local networks appears .
That might not sound all that tedious , but losing five minutes plus when connecting to the internet — frequently — gets real old real fast in the year 2008 .
And these problems even occur with your own saved networks .
For some reason the Eee does n't like to remember security keys .
Users eventually become smart enough to paste the code somewhere in their documents , but really , should we have to ?
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Conclusions
I 'm not sure that the Eee is a " do n't buy . "
But more and more every day , I 'm wishing that we 'd invested the $ 400 elsewhere ( a new smartphone , for instance ) .
Initial reviews accepted the system 's shortcomings partially because everyone loved that golden price / performance / size ratio and partially , even tacitly , because many expected bugs to be ironed out in due course .
Maybe more RAM would improve the experience , but at this point I 'm fearing the investment .
Maybe loading Ubuntu will solve the OS problems — I plan on doing just that this weekend — but most users wo n't deal with that hassle .
At this point our love affair is over and we realize that the Asus Eee PC , as important as it may be for the market , is a glorious " miss " in its current state .
WASHINGTON  Leading Democrats , including Senator Obama of Illinois , are distancing themselves from an essay published this week by one of their party 's leading financiers that called for the Democratic Party to " liberate " itself from the influence of the pro-Israel lobby .
The article , by George Soros , published in the New York Review of Books , asserts that America should pressure Israel to negotiate with the Hamas - led unity government in the Palestinian territories regardless of whether Hamas recognizes the right of the Jewish state to exist .
Mr. Soros goes on to say that one reason America has not embraced this policy is because of the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
Yesterday , Mr. Obama 's presidential campaign issued a dissent from the Hungarian - born billionaire 's assessment .
" Mr. Soros is entitled to his opinions , " a campaign spokeswoman , Jen Psaki , said .
" But on this issue he and Senator Obama disagree .
The U.S. and our allies are right to insist that Hamas  a terrorist organization dedicated to Israel 's destruction  meet very basic conditions before being treated as a legitimate actor .
AIPAC is one of many voices that share this view . "
The Soros article puts Democrats in the awkward position of choosing between Mr. Soros , a major funder of their causes , and the pro-Israel lobby , whose members are also active in campaign fund - raising .
Pressed by The New York Sun , some Democrats aired their differences with Mr. Soros .
Rep. Robert Wexler , a Democrat of Florida who sent out an e-mail to Jewish supporters in his home state last week vouching for Mr. Obama 's pro-Israel bona fides , said he too rejected Mr. Soros 's comments .
" Senator Obama says until the Palestinian government fulfills all three of the quartet requirements , the United States should not and would not recognize the Palestinian government .
Senator Obama is clear , Mr. Soros appears to have a different position , " Mr. Wexler said .
" I agree with Senator Obama and have felt that way for a long time . "
Mr. Wexler also took issue with Mr. Soros 's view that Aipac was a major reason why the Bush administration would not recognize the new Palestinian unity government .
" I have never met him , he 's a very substantial figure in the country , " Mr. Wexler said of Mr. Soros .
" I think his views are obviously the views of a prominent man .
I respectfully disagree with him . "
A Democratic congressman from New York who has endorsed Senator Clinton , a Democrat from New York , yesterday was tougher in his assessment of the new Soros article .
" He is obviously very self absorbed .
I am trying to be kind , but he does n't leave any room for kindness , " Rep. Eliot Engel said in a phone interview Monday .
Regarding Mr. Soros 's claim that Aipac drives American foreign policy , Mr. Engel said , " It 's a myth and lie about Aipac 's supposed stranglehold on the Congress , it 's just nonsense .
He went on to say , " I do n't think Mr. Soros will sway the Democratic Party one iota . "
Other prominent Democrats yesterday also differed with Mr. Soros .
A vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee , Susan Turnbull , said in an phone interview , " My view is the problem here is George Bush , Mr. Soros has made that clear and at that point I agree with him .
I am not going to say that the problem is Aipac .
I do n't necessarily agree with him on that . "
She added , " There are a lot of reasons why we are in the state we are in .
I do n't think that blaming it on one lobbying organization , which is one aspect of the Jewish community , is the be -all or end - all to the problem .
The problem is not with Aipac , but with President Bush . "
A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee , Amaya Smith , declined to comment .
At one point in his essay , in a section discussing how the pro-Israel lobby " has been remarkably successful in suppressing criticism , " Mr. Soros recalls the fate of Howard Dean 's campaign for the presidency .
" When Howard Dean called for an evenhanded policy toward Israel in 2004 , his chances of getting the nomination were badly damaged ( although it was his attempt , after his defeat in Iowa , to shout above the crowd that sealed his fate ) , " Mr. Soros wrote .
Dr. Dean is now chairman of the Democratic National Committee .
The chairman of the Dean campaign , Steve Grossman , yesterday respectfully disagreed .
" While Howard 's public statements about Israel certainly cost him support in the pro-Israel community , I believe his anti-war positions continued to attract a broad cross section of support from the Jewish community .
No one that I know ascribes Howard 's defeat in 2004 to his public statements about Israel , even though I 'll acknowledge that he lost support among some pro-Israel activists as a result . "
Mr. Grossman , a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and past president of Aipac , said he recognized and respected Mr. Soros ' commitment to " progressive American values , " and his " investment in political change in America . "
But Mr. Grossman also said , " I reject out of hand Soros 's charges directed toward Aipac . "
Prokaryotes , as you 've deduced , lack a cellular nucleus , yet they can live from the upper atmosphere to the ocean floor , from the human gut to rocks a mile deep .
And there are lots of prokaryotes .
Even though each one weighs less than a less than a quadrillionth of a gram when toweled dry , overall they weigh about as much as all the plants in the world -- roughly a gigaton .
So how many prokaryotes share the planet with us ?
According to William Whitman , a microbiologist at University of Georgia , the number is 5 x 10 30
This is a big number by any standard .
If you had that many pennies , Whitman and colleagues David Coleman and William Wiebe calculated , they would make a stack a trillion light years long .
Just where are all these prokaryotes ?
As we indicated , some bacteria live in the human gut -- a total of 3.9 x 10 23 among all six billion of us .
( Before you down another tetracycline as your part in the global crusade against bacteria , remember that most intestinal bacteria are helpful .
)
Furthermore , the vast majority of prokaryotes live under land or the sea floor , not in us .
In fact , 92 to 94 percent of all prokaryotes live underground lives of quiet desperation , hidden in the cracks and pores of rock and sediment , lacking sunlight , fresh air , even cable TV .
A whale of a census
Unable to count bacteria individually , Whitman and colleagues opted for a sampling technique .
They divvied the world into representative habitats , like forests , deserts , freshwaters , and shallow and deep ocean waters .
Then they scoured the science literature looking for studies on the density of bacteria in each habitat .
From there it was simple multiplication -- size of habitat in milliliters times number of prokaryotes per milliliter equals total number of bacteria in that habitat .
The math showed that the top eight meters of soil carry 26 x 10 28 prokaryotes , and all aquatic habitats carried 12 x 10 28 .
But the real jackpot lies underground .
More than 8 meters below the land surface , they found between 25 and 250 x 10 28 prokaryotes .
And beneath the ocean floor live a staggering 355 x 10 28 organisms without nuclei .
Although the researchers did try to cross-check their results against existing studies , much of their work was extrapolated from very limited data on subsurface conditions .
For example , information from two locations was taken to represent conditions under the land everywhere .
As a result , " We can't really give you an error bar " -- an estimation of how far off their results might be , Whitman says .
World 's least useful number ?
May we predict your response ?
The results are a ) " astonishing .
It 's amazing that as much as half of our biosphere is hidden prokaryotes , not trees and clams and dolphins , " or b ) " a waste of time -- the total number of prokaryotes is as useless as it is incomprehensible . "
Even to doubters , the research demonstrates that all discussions of life , and its effects on Earth , had best take into account the hidden biosphere .
Bacteria , after all , make some of the oxygen and virtually all of the nitrogen in our air .
They decay pollutants and dissolve rocks .
And like redwoods and mahogany trees , bacteria also store carbon .
That has bearing on the study of global warming , since removing carbon from the air slows the rise of carbon dioxide that is causing the planetary cook - out .
I took a course last semester called " Research Methods and Theory . " 
It was as exciting as it sounds .
I would much rather have been taking one of these 12 classes .
From pop culture to maple syrup , these are n't your average lectures .
1. The Horror Film in Context ( Bowdoin )
With Halloween approaching , you will probably soon discover my love of scary movies " “ especially bad ones ( Chopping Mall , anyone ? )
That 's why I wish Bowdoin 's course " The Horror Film in Context "  was offered as a graduate class at Iowa State .
It 's not about the psyche of Freddy and Jason , however " “ students taking the class can expect to discuss why society is infatuated with horror movies and death in general .
2. Simpsons and Philosophy ( Cal - Berkeley )
I 'm sure my husband is considering enrolling at the University of California at Berkeley as we speak , just to take " Simpsons and Philosophy . "
You 'll need to know more than Simpsons trivia " “ the class takes an in - depth look at how the long - running cartoon depicts social issues such as racism and politics .
Passing the class , which includes writing a 22 - minute show for the final exam , earns students two credits .
3. Maple Syrup " “ The Real Thing ( Alfred )
Chances are you probably do n't spend too much brain power pondering maple syrup , besides wondering whether it 's most delicious on French toast or pancakes .
Alfred University in New York is changing that for all students who take the course " Maple Syrup " “ The Real Thing . " 
It covers every aspect of the sweet breakfast topping , from production to products to , yes , recipes .
4. The Science of Harry Potter ( Frostburg State )
Another course near and dear to my heart is " The Science of Harry Potter , "  offered at Frostburg State University in Maryland .
This class combines the fantastical with the physical by asking if some of the seemingly impossible things in the popular series could actually be plausible .
Think about it : if there is a possibility that an invisibility cloak or a flying broomstick could actually exist , would n't you want to know ?
5. Oprah Winfrey " “ The Tycoon ( U. of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign )
Oprah is conquering the world .
The talk show , the book club , the magazine " ¦ and now , history class ?
The University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign offered " History 298 : Oprah Winfrey " “ the Tycoon "  in its class schedule several years ago .
Like many of the other courses on this list , the class was more than meets the eye .
Although it appears to be about the famous talk show queen , the class uses Oprah 's cultural rise to study race , class and gender issues .
6. Far Side Entomology ( Oregon State )
I took an entomology class during my undergrad and found it much more interesting than I thought I would .
Imagine how enthralled I would have been with Oregon State 's " Far Side Entomology , "  which used Gary Larson 's Far Side cartoons to study insects .
Larson 's tactic of giving his insects human qualities make them more relatable , which in turn gave students research ideas and questions they may have not otherwise thought of .
Before you commence transfer proceedings , know that this class is no longer offered .
7. History of Electronic Dance Music ( UCLA )
Do you still love C+C Music Factory ?
Get pumped to Deee - Lite 's " Groove is in the Heart "  while driving ?
Then the UCLA 's " History of Electronic Dance Music "  would probably be a cakewalk for you .
According to the syllabus , " Class lectures will deal with the historical narratives told about the music , musical form and technique in dance music , the political and cultural implications of the relentless hedonism of the dance floor , the influence of chemicals and technology on music production and consumption , and the aesthetic possibilities and pitfalls when popular music is no longer synonymous with popular song . " 
8 . The Future is Lost : TV Series as Cultural Phenomenon ( Tufts )
Next February is a very important month .
Why , you ask ?
Because it 's when Lost returns .
If , like me , you 're desperately jonesing for a Lost fix NOW , go ahead and enroll at Tufts University , the home of a 13 - week Lost seminar .
Be prepared to talk about more than Jack 's propensity for crying and Sawyer 's offensive nicknames for the other Lostaways , though .
Topics include thematic complexity , mechanical complexity , literary references and philosophies .
The course culminates with students pitching an idea for a television series to the rest of their classmates .
9. Goldberg 's Canon : Makin' Whoopi ( Bates )
If you 're excited about Whoopi Goldberg 's The View debut , it 's too bad you missed out on Bates College 's " Goldberg 's Canon : Makin ' Whoopi , "  the only course anywhere ( that I could find ) dedicated to the former Caryn Johnson .
As far as I can tell , the last time the class was offered was the 2003 - 04 school year , so anyone wanting to discuss her " controversial persona as an antagonistic public figure "  ( so says the syllabus ) is out of luck for now .
10 . Muppet Magic : Jim Henson's Art ( UC - Santa Cruz )
For some reason , I feel like the ratio of mental_floss readers who grew up watching and learning from Sesame Street is probably high .
Thus , by my theory , most of us would be thrilled to count Theater Arts 80L , " Muppet Magic : Jim Henson 's Art "  at the University of California Santa Cruz as part of our course load .
The class studies how Muppets have changed television , film and art since Jim Henson created them .
11 . Getting Dressed ( Princeton )
Seriously , some days getting dressed takes a lot more effort than it should .
Enter Princeton's " Getting Dressed "  class , a freshmen - only course that lets students discuss controversial topics such as jeans , baseball caps , tattoos , flip - flops and Chuck Taylors .
It 's more complicated than just figuring out what to wear in the morning , though .
The class discussed how people use fashion to do everything from study history to assess character .
Although it does n't appear that the class is offered any longer , Princeton does offer other interesting - sounding freshmen seminars , including " Google and Ye Shall Find ? "  and " Good to be Shifty : American Swindlers . "
12 . Biblical Model for Home and Family ( Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary )
A real controversy exists around the " Biblical Model for Home and Family "  course at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary .
The class , for females only , teaches cooking , sewing , and says that wives should submit graciously to their husbands .
OK , what I said at the beginning of this article was wrong : I 'd much rather sit through " Research Methods and Theory "  than learn how to " submit graciously . " 
So , what 's the craziest class you 've ever taken ?
Apologies if this piece is not up to my usual exacting standards but my nose hurts , on account of having been punched by a German policeman in Berlin .
This should not necessarily be taken as a reflection of German policemen .
We were both wearing boxing gloves at the time ; we had also just started a chess game .
This is not easy to explain .
Where to begin ?
Possibly in September 2003 , when the Berlin - based Dutch artist Iepe Rubingh unveiled chess boxing to the world in an art gallery called Platoon .
Styling himself " Iepe the Joker " , he took part in a demonstration fight against a Dutch friend called " Luis the Lawyer " .
Two months later , they fought again in Amsterdam , this time for the vacant world middleweight chess - boxing title .
Vacant because they were the only two middleweight chess boxers , indeed the only two chess boxers , in the world .
Rubingh won a dramatic encounter .
" I had a pretty terrible position on the board so in the last round I tried to knock him out , " he recalls .
" He only just managed to stay on his feet .
The bell went and he put his hands up in the air but he could n't find his corner .
He was really dizzy but we still had to play the final round of chess .
There was a clear win for him , but he just could n't figure out the right moves . "
Chess boxing is precisely that - a sport that combines chess and boxing .
There are six rounds of chess , each lasting four minutes , and five of boxing , each lasting two minutes .
The rounds take place alternately , beginning and ending with chess , with one - minute intervals .
You win by a knockout in the ring or checkmate on the board .
In the event of a draw in the chess and no knockout , a points winner can be declared on the basis of performance in the ring .
At least I think those are the rules ; I , too , was feeling a little dizzy after my trial fight .
Rubingh's inspiration to create the sport came from Yugoslavian artist Enki Bilal 's comic book , Cold Equator .
" When I was 17 or 18 I read this book , which was part of my father 's comic collection , " he says , " and it always stayed in my mind .
Bilal stated that chess boxing in the future would be like this - a 12 - round heavyweight boxing fight and then a game of chess , which can last up to five hours .
That 's not very public - friendly , so we started working the idea out and slimmed it down .
We want to combine both sports as closely as possible and have a balanced rulebook , so that either chess or boxing can force the decision .
We want the sports to be as important as each other . "
Chess boxing started with an artistic impulse .
" Chess boxing breaks certain rules , " explains the 31 - year - old Rubingh .
" We tend to divide everything into different worlds , but in my opinion worlds are much more connected than people see them at first .
Chess boxing breaks through this habit .
So many people say to me : ' Chess and boxing , they just do n't fit together , ' and some chess players hate the idea , but they forget that former world boxing champion Lennox Lewis and current champion Vitali Klitschko both play chess .
Boxing is about the control of aggression , and chess boxing is 200 % about the control of aggression . "
Somewhere along the line , however , Rubingh 's interesting artistic exercise has turned into a full paid - up sport .
At first , I think he is pulling my leg - as well as flattening my nose - but by the end he has convinced me that he is determined to establish chess boxing as a global sport .
Iepe the Joker has turned into Iepe the Entrepreneur , setting up the World Chess Boxing Association , franchising the idea in Bulgaria , planning fights in Tokyo and New York , preparing to open a chess boxing gym in Cologne , and now looking towards France and the UK .
Last month , a Bulgarian called Tihomir Titschko - a very strong chess player and decent boxer - won the European heavyweight chess - boxing title in a contest in Berlin that was given huge publicity in Germany .
The appeal , to the media anyway , is precisely that of the perceived difference between boxers and chess players .
Despite the example of Lewis , we see boxers as lithe killing machines and chess aficionados as fat blokes in anoraks who push bits of wood around in the smelly back rooms of pubs .
Chess players , surely , are prize nerds .
" Partly that 's true , but partly it 's not true , " says Rubingh .
" I 've met a lot of non-nerdy chess players .
Professional chess players these days tend to do a lot of physical working out .
They 've learned that it 's not about sitting in a bar drinking coffee or alcohol and smoking , and that you get your best game on the board when you 're in shape .
Players such as Vladimir Kramnik and Garry Kasparov have for years had their own physical trainers .
They 're full sportsmen , they train a lot , they 're physically in good shape ; mentally , of course , they 're in great shape .
Playing makes you tired and they sweat and their pulse rate is going up when they get excited .
They lose one or two kilos during a game . "
Rubingh now runs a chess - boxing club at a gym in a trendy part of the old east Berlin , and that 's where I will face policeman Frank Stoldt tonight .
What in boxing they call " the tale of the tape " is not heartening .
Stoldt is 35 , had 12 proper amateur fights in his 20s , winning 11 , and has an Elo international chess rating of 1,700 - good club standard .
I am quite a bit more than 35 , have only once been in the ring ( in 2000 ) with a heart - attack victim who boxed for exercise and had been told not to hit me , and might on a good day manage an Elo rating of 1,500 .
Today is not a good day .
" Do n't worry , " Iepe the Joker tells me just before the match .
" I have instructed him not to hurt you .
Not to really hurt you . "
How I wish he had n't added that qualification .
How I wish , too , that an hour ago , just off the plane , I had n't eaten a " Kraut Hot Dog " - sausage , sauerkraut and lashings of mustard - and a pizza .
Frank has legs made of tungsten and is skipping furiously .
I have just tried on my yellow satin boxing vest for the first time for five years ; it is so tight I can't breathe and it takes me 10 minutes to extricate myself from it .
" Usually we weigh in before the fight , " says Frank , " but I do n't think we will with you . "
The psychological battle has begun .
I 'd like to be able to blame the boxing for my impotence on the chessboard , but can't .
I play a wretched opening and am in trouble even before we climb through the ropes .
Perhaps I play too aggressively , hoping for a quick checkmate before the boxing even begins .
I certainly underestimate Frank 's chess , and that may have angered him , because within about three seconds of the start of the first boxing round he has landed a humdinger of a punch - I do n't see whether it is a left or a right - on my nose .
It starts bleeding and I lurch backwards .
" I did n't realise we were taking it quite this seriously , " I say pathetically .
" This is a contact sport , " says Iepe , offering me a towel for my nose and telling me not to sniff .
After that , Frank takes it more easily - concentrating on body punches and just giving me the occasional cuff to the head .
I manage to brush his shoulders a few times .
Even if he stood still for long enough , I do n't think I could punch him in the head .
I fear I lack the natural aggression that fighters require , though I can sublimate it through chess .
Or maybe I just do n't want to provoke him further .
Frank is in complete control on the board , too .
I 'm convinced he could finish me off quickly , but instead makes sure we box all five rounds before I lose in the final chess round .
Whether this is a thoughtful gesture to ensure I get the full chess - boxing experience or just sadism , I do n't know .
" How did I do ? " I ask Iepe .
" On a scale of one to 10 , you rate about three , " he replies .
The Dutch are noted for their directness .
" Come and have a drink , " I suggest to my opponent after the contest .
" I do n't drink , " he says and goes off to do some chess theory with the club 's resident chess expert .
These guys are serious .
What started as art really does seem to have been transfigured into sport - Rubingh hopes to attract high - class chess boxers and stage regular title fights under the auspices of his association .
How does a radical performance artist whose oeuvre includes blocking off intersections in Berlin and Tokyo to create monster traffic jams ( he was jailed for 10 days for his Japanese provocation ) justify such a departure ?
" I do n't care any more , " he says .
" I can see both .
If I talk to a sports magazine , we just purely talk about the sport ; if I talk to an art magazine , I explain my views [ about pigeonholing in society ] .
But the interest to me now is to put the ideas very deep into society , because as soon as you put the label ' art ' on it there are a lot of people who have a scary reaction .
They say , ' Art , that 's too difficult . '
So I search for other ways to spread my ideas in society , and chess boxing seems to be one way to do it . "
Oh , he hopes to make some money out of it , too .
Above all , he is attracted by the degree of self - control the fighters / players have to exercise .
" After a boxing round your heart will be beating , your adrenaline goes up and it's very difficult to concentrate on a chessboard , " he says .
" The first chess - boxing test that we ever did , I just gave away my queen immediately .
I said , ' This is not going to work out , people can't do chess boxing . '
But then the second test that we did , it was already a little bit better . "
For my match , he advises me to take it slowly when we resume playing chess after the boxing and to check my first move three times before playing it .
In fact , I am so dazed and so annoyed by my wretched position that I can barely bring myself to move at all and eventually lose on time - the most un -heroic of conclusions .
He says audiences for the title fights have been surprisingly enthusiastic .
" I wondered if they would concentrate and try to follow the game , or go to the bar to have a beer when the chess started .
But it turned out that everybody was very interested .
When the boxing comes they get very excited , and then , like the players themselves , they have to concentrate on the chess , look at the video screen and listen to the chess commentator .
The public has this very dialectic evening . "
I did n't quite understand that either , but it sounds good .
Rubingh , with his pyramidal hair , shapes like a cross between Don King and Marcel Duchamp and becomes very voluble when envisaging the possibility of getting Lennox Lewis back into the ring for a chess - boxing match with Vitali Klitschko :
" It would be as big as the Rumble in the Jungle , it would go down in history , we will offer them $ 15 m . "
If he can stop the traffic in Tokyo , perhaps he really can get the chess - loving former and current world heavyweight boxing champions back together .
Do n't bet against it .
I have a nose for this sort of thing .
Or I used to .

There was a moment during 2007 when I suddenly thought , no , this is wrong , it has to stop .
It was during New York Fashion Week in September , I was sitting front row at the Calvin Klein show , and I could see Joanna Coles , the very clever , mature and by no means lowbrow British - born editor - in - chief of American Marie Claire ( the thinking woman 's magazine , remember ) , scurrying along , positively bowing and scraping , in the wake of an Olsen twin .
I did n't know or care whether the blonde , diminutive pseudo - celebrity was Mary - Kate or Ashley ( in case you have lived in a remote Mongolian retreat with no broadband these past 12 months and do n't know who these particular young American women are , they are former child stars who now " design " a ludicrously expensive range of clothing called Row ) .
But what I did care quite deeply about was the fact that a grown and quite powerful woman was being so ingratiating in the presence of someone who is merely famous for being famous .
Scroll down for more ...
Joanna Coles was obviously trying to get this young ( and I wo n't say " star ; " let 's just call her a ball of gas ) into the pages of her publication .
And then it dawned on me : 2007 was the year of the airhead , a 12 - month period when no bit of female fluff was too fatuous to be brought to our attention .
Want some proof that we women have finally abandoned all pretence to having any sort of gravitas , or moral responsibility , or intellectual debate ?
How about the fact that Nicole Richie , who , as far as I can tell , is famous for being unable to tip the scales above 75 pounds , graced the cover of British Marie Claire .
Or the mass hysteria that was engendered by the fact that Kate Moss had been given an obscene amount of money to put her name to a whole load of tat for Topshop .
Incidentally , the woman even brought out her own scent last year ; I wonder what the dominant bouquet is : fags , alcohol or cocaine ?
Or how about the antics of Paris Hilton , or Jordan , or Penny Lancaster , or Jade Goody , who kicked off 2007 by wearing her ignorance like a badge in the Celebrity Big Brother house .
Or the ubiquitous Kerry Katona , who for some reason has been chosen as an iconic mother figure in order to promote a supermarket brand .
Even the good - natured Jonathan Ross seemed puzzled to be devoting a large segment of his television chat show to her new " novel , " a book she admitted she had not only not written , but which she could n't even remember the title of .
Scroll down for more ...
And , of course , there was the queen of all the airheads , straddling 2007 like a Twiglet - limbed colossus : good old Victoria Beckham .
It was the year she attempted to export her particular brand of banality to Los Angeles , a
case of taking coals to Newcastle if ever there was one ( and , by the way , given the recent BBC " documentary " on the Spice Girls , surely the Corporation 's claim to a licence fee is , finally , dead and buried ) .
To cap it all , towards the end of the year we had Gordon Brown , no less , holding up footballers ' wives and girlfriends as suitable role models for our impressionable teens because they have a few GCSEs between them and , gasp , even a smattering of A - levels .
My goodness , how commendable .
The drip - drip effect of all these empty - heads being paraded before us as beacons of success is that , among women of all ages , even those of us in our 40s who should know better , it is now no longer seen as ironic to be interested in whether or not Kylie has had a face lift , or Lindsay Lohan has or has not checked out of rehab , or totalled her car while drink driving .
Or Sienna Miller has said yes or no to Rhys Ifans , or Jennifer Lopez has piled on the pregnancy pounds .
Thanks to last year 's bombardment of the banal , to know and care about these people is now seen as normal .
Why do all the glossy weeklies and monthlies make such a meal of these women ?
Well , first of all , they are easy game .
They are rampant self - publicists and therefore easy to persuade to disrobe , or pose pregnant , or divulge their addictions .
The airhead is a needy creature with more money than sense , and she will therefore shore up her self - esteem by going shopping , and wearing the latest ridiculous fashion trend .
Which in turn prompts us , the voyeurs , to want to copy her , and so we buy ever more Louis Vuitton traveller luggage and Marc Jacobs Stam bags ( Stam , as in supermodel Jessica Stam ; please keep up ) and endless bottles of perfume .
And while on the subject , we should n't delude ourselves that the upcoming film of Sex And The City is art , or even entertainment : it is a monument to product placement , the luxury goods showcased in the movie guaranteed to ensure that credit card debt among women remains sky - high well into the next decade .
All these images might be lucrative for those who peddle and perpetuate them .
Newspapers are not immune to this process ; even though I was deeply sceptical and damning last year about Kate Moss , Victoria Beckham et al , I admit I , too , stoked the fires of their mediocrity by adding to their column inches .
But the women who insatiably consume this tat - and that , I admit , occasionally includes me - are deeply diminished by the process .
And here 's a point : this obsession with airheads ( which is , by and large , a female thing - at least when men indulge in poring over idiots , they do so for mild amusement , they do n't emulate these creatures or want to marry them ) is not just depressing , it is deeply dangerous .
I can only think the young women who were lured to a party in the Great John Street Hotel to " meet " the Manchester United players had been seduced not just into wearing the sparkly spaghetti- strapped tops and the skinny jeans and the platform shoes that is the uniform of the airhead , but into believing that they too could live " celebrity " lives , however vacuous and demeaning that is in reality .
We have become so used to seeing young women doing stupid things in public - Britney Spears shaving off all her hair , Cerys Matthews snogging someone else 's boyfriend , Amy Winehouse reduced by drugs to walking the streets of East London dressed only in a bra and a pair of jeans - that we think we can behave that way , too , and get away with it .
That the evening in Manchester ended with one woman being shared among five men , and another allegedly being raped , shows the nasty subcurrent of the airhead culture .
She has no respect for herself , and so commands none .
I particularly became aware of the vacuity of this culture when I was researching an essay for a book celebrating 25 years of Channel 4 .
My topic was how the past quarter century has changed women 's magazines , and women 's perceptions of themselves .
Twenty - five years ago , the magazines were full of art criticism , and short stories , and debate about everything from orientalism to surrealism .
Last year , the principal debate seemed to be about whether Big Brother 's Chantelle was still with her boyfriend or not .
I think part of the reason we have become so fascinated is that lots of us have found , to our cost , that being too smart and clever , and " banging on , " as my ex-husband so eloquently used to put it , about our careers and having it all , has alienated us from men .
They , the poor dears , became scared of us , and so ten years ago we started watching Sex And The City as a sort of ironic antidote to being serious career women , where all was fluffy and we were interested in such inconsequential things as expensive shoes .
The trouble is , we then became hooked on all this superficial rubbish , and it started to take over not just our shopping habits but our personalities and our relationships .
I am tired of these women 's antics cluttering up my brain .
But who on earth should we have been reading about and admiring last year ?
Hmm , it becomes really difficult to compile a list of women who have been doing something meaningful rather than flashing their knickers ( or lack of them ) while climbing out of a limo .
Scroll down for more ...
But I nominate sportswomen Nicole Cooke , who won the French cycling tour , and show jumper Ellen Whitaker , who is likely to represent Britain at the Beijing Olympics .
Clare Smyth , Gordon Ramsay 's new head chef at Hospital Road , who manages to cook superbly without either swearing or making a TV programme .
Natalie Portman , not just for her work as an actress but for the documentaries she is making with children in the developing world .
Novelists Alice Sebold , for her brave account of what it is like to care for an elderly parent , and Sophie Kinsella , who as well as being an Oxford graduate and multi-million selling author , manages to bring up three small children without moaning .
Woman 's Hour 's redoubtable Jenni Murray , for not making a fuss about having breast cancer , and the new voice of that programme , Jane Garvey .
And finally and most commendably the American news anchor Mika Brzezinski , for shredding her script in anger at being ordered to lead a bulletin with yet another Paris Hilton story - a liberating act tantamount to burning her bra , surely ?

THE FLUFF LEAGUE
PARIS HILTON
The ultimate vacuous celebrity , Paris Hilton , 26 , is famous primarily for being a party - loving heiress , but last month that came tumbling down when
Barron Hilton , head of the hotel dynasty , announced he was leaving 97 per cent of his fortune to charity .
Paris famously spent 22 days of last year in LA County jail after numerous driving offences .
She lists her talents as singer , model , actress , author and TV personality but is most famous for partying with fellow celebs in tiny dresses .
AIRHEAD RATING 10/10
CHANTELLE
Twenty - four - year - old Chantelle Houghton - former topless model and Burger King worker - was divorced in 2007 from husband Samuel Preston of pop group The Ordinary Boys after an exhausting year - long marriage .
The couple met when Chantelle was the only non-celebrity on Celebrity Big Brother .
Her autobiography Living The Dream shifted just five thousand copies .
But she 's still said to have made more money ( about £ 1 million ) than her singer ex-husband .
AIRHEAD RATING 9/10
KERRY KATONA
Still only 27 ( but does n't it seem longer ) .
Former drug addict Kerry famously won I'm A Celebrity and since then not a weekend has passed without more tabloid revelations about her various addictions .
The former singer with Atomic Kitten was once an exotic dancer , and in 2004 married singer Brian McFadden , with whom she has two daughters , Molly and Lilly - Sue .
Last year she had another daughter , Heidi , with new husband , taxi driver Mark Croft , and in a breathless year was held hostage , fought Brian for custody of her girls and was admitted to the Priory suffering from the increasingly glamorous " bipolar disorder . "
AIRHEAD RATING 9/10
JADE GOODY
Big Brother " star " Jade also saw her career hit potential meltdown as she appeared in Celebrity Big Brother last year and was vilified for making " racist " remarks about Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty , calling her " Shilpa Poppadom . "
Her celebrity fitness DVD was shown to be less than truthful when it was revealed she 'd had liposuction .
Famous for simply appearing on reality television , calling East Anglia " East Angular " and asking if Saddam Hussein was a boxer , she 's often portrayed as the unacceptable face of British talentless celebrity .
AIRHEAD RATING 8/10
COLEEN McLOUGHLIN
The 21 - year - old daughter of a bricklayer and a cleaner from Liverpool has carved an entire six - million - pound career out of being engaged to a footballer with a face like a potato .
The rights to " the wedding of 2008 " have already been sold for mega money - Wayne Rooney proposed on a BP forecourt .
Coleen is raking in the dough without having any discernible talent .
AIRHEAD RATING 8/10
BRITNEY SPEARS
2007 was meltdown year for singer Britney .
The former Mickey Mouse Club actress and singer of Hit Me Baby One More Time lost custody of her two sons to ex-husband Kevin Federline .
She famously shaved off all her hair earlier in the year , was frequently photographed drunk and was also arrested for drink driving .
AIRHEAD RATING 7/10
LINDSAY LOHAN
The once - successful 21 - year - old child actress has made a name for herself last year primarily by being drunk , crashing cars , getting arrested and ending up in either rehab or hospital .
Her wild sexual ways have also drawn attention , and last year she was arrested after cocaine was found in her car .
She has been in rehab twice and a Hollywood insider said that her acting career is now all but finished .
AIRHEAD RATING 6/10
JORDAN
JORDAN , aka Katie Price , is now , depressingly , one of Britain 's richest women with a fortune of £ 30 million .
Last year she made even more money through publishing , as well as revealing literally everything in Katie And Peter : Unleashed on ITV2 .
The couple have even been photographed on the toilet .
There seems to be nothing deemed too tasteless for them to do in order to make yet more money .
AIRHEAD RATING 5/10
SIENNA MILLER
Shot to fame as the girlfriend of actor Jude Law after he split from his wife Sadie Frost .
Educated at Heathfield School in Ascot , she 's rather blurred her " posh " credentials lately by taking up with wild Welsh actor Rhys Ifans , and was photographed wearing an extraordinary pair of big black pants .
She also posed topless for the magazine Vanity Fair and seems to be leading an increasingly wild lifestyle .
Starred in Stardust with Michelle Pfeiffer , to very mixed reviews .
AIRHEAD RATING 5/10
HEATHER MILLS McCARTNEY
2007 was not a good year for Heather , to put it mildly .
Public opinion over her divorce from Paul McCartney swung wildly in his favour after she appeared ranting in television in October .
The 39 - year - old former glamour model who lost her leg in a car accident is looking increasingly less likely to win a substantial settlement from Sir Paul , with whom she has a four - year - old daughter , Beatrice .
She 's also being sued for alleged non-payment of fees to her former divorce lawyers .
AIRHEAD RATING 4/10
VICTORIA BECKHAM
Thirty - three - year - old Posh Spice is currently on tour with the other Spice Girls , milking their former celebrity for all it is worth .
Last year she appeared in Victoria Beckham : Coming To America , as her husband David joined an American football club .
It was , to say the least , greeted with little enthusiasm by the critics .
The mother of three sons , she 's perhaps most famous for turning one of Britain 's most talented footballers into something of a joke , reduced to posing for an advert in skimpy underpants .
Can you imagine Bobby Charlton doing that ?
You can't imagine they need the money with an estimated fortune of £ 112 million .
AIRHEAD RATING 3/10
KATE MOSS
Her on / off romance with hopeless pop singer Pete Doherty bored the nation senseless in 2007 but they have thankfully now split .
The waif - like supermodel from Croydon ( who has just one C in her GCSEs ) was famously photographed snorting cocaine which caused her modelling contracts to nosedive - but she has fought back and last year was Britain 's 99th richest woman with a fortune of £ 45 million .
Notorious for her wild party lifestyle , she 's more often photographed falling out of a club than spending time with her five - year - old daughter Lila Grace by
Dazed And Confused editor Jefferson Hack .
She now lives in North
London and is dating The Kills guitarist Jamie Hince .
Next year she 'll be the face of Donna Karan and YSL .

Before Google and Opera mobile search partnership , default search engine was set to Yahoo !

There were a plenty of rumors that since Opera Software and Yahoo !
made some kind of deal ( and dropped Google ) , Google which slogan is “ Do n’t be Evil ” started to “ tweak ” their projects , so Opera web browser users would have some problems by using them .
Although I ’m not sure if those rumors are correct .

( CNN ) -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are in a statistical dead heat in Texas , according to a poll released eight days before the state 's crucial presidential primary .
Sen . Barack Obama has won the past 11 contests and leads in the overall delegate count .
In the CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday , 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said Obama is their choice for the party 's nominee , while 46 percent backed Clinton .
But taking into account the poll 's sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for Democratic respondents , the race is a virtual tie .
Clinton had a statistically insignificant 50 percent to 48 percent edge over Obama in last Monday 's CNN / ORC poll in Texas .
" The 2 - point gain for Obama and the 4 - point drop for Clinton are both within the poll 's sampling error , so although the survey appears to indicate some movement toward Obama , we cannot say for certain that he has gained any ground since last week , " said CNN polling director Keating Holland .
Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even .
Texas and Ohio , which both hold primaries March 4 , are considered must - win states for Clinton .
Watch what challenges the candidates face in Texas , Ohio »
Obama has won the past 11 contests and is ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in Texas .
The new survey indicates John McCain is the clear favorite in Texas for the Republican presidential nomination .
Among likely Republican primary voters , 56 percent said the senator from Arizona is their choice for nominee .
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee won the backing of 31 percent of those questioned , and Rep. Ron Paul of Texas was at 9 percent .
These numbers are virtually unchanged from last week 's poll .
The survey 's sampling error for Republican respondents is also plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .
McCain is the overwhelming front - runner in the fight for the GOP presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity .
Regardless , Huckabee and Paul remain in the race for now .
There are 137 Republican delegates at stake in Texas .
The poll was conducted by telephone from Friday through Sunday .
Pollsters talked to 2,149 adults in Texas , including 861 likely Democratic primary voter and 751 likely Republican primary voters .
A breakdown of how whites , African - Americans and Latinos are planning to vote shows one reason the race in Texas between Clinton and Obama is so close .
" Obama appears to be picking up support from nearly eight in 10 blacks , " Holland said .
" Clinton may win roughly two - thirds of the Latino vote .
There are likely to be more Latino voters than blacks when Democrats go to the polls on March 4 , which should work to Clinton 's advantage .
" But Obama 's huge lead among blacks -- plus a noticeable chunk of the Latino vote -- tends to counteract that .
The result : Clinton and Obama get roughly equal number of votes from nonwhite Democrats .
And since whites appear to be splitting almost evenly between the two candidates , the overall race is a virtual tie . "
Clinton and Obama faced off last Thursday at a presidential debate in Austin , Texas , hosted by CNN and the Spanish - language network Univision .
The poll suggests the debate gave Obama a boost .
Watch how the debate affected poll numbers »
" Among the one - third of Texas Democratic primary voters who watched all or most of the debate , Obama leads Clinton by 20 points , " said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider .
" Among the 42 percent who followed news about the debate , Clinton and Obama are neck and neck .
And among the one - quarter of Texas Democrats who paid no attention to the debate , Clinton leads Obama by nearly 20 points .
" Is this because Obama appeals to better - educated Democrats and they were more likely to watch the debate ?
No .
Even among college - educated Democrats , the more attention you paid to the debate , the better Obama does . "
Democrats and Republicans may not agree on the issues , but the poll indicates they do agree on what 's the most important issue .
Forty - three percent of Democrats and 31 percent of Republicans say the economy is the most important issue in their choice for president .
The second most important issue for Democrats was health care , followed by the war in Iraq , illegal immigration and terrorism .
For Republicans , illegal immigration was second , trailed by terrorism , health care and the war in Iraq .
" Likely Democratic primary voters think that Clinton would handle the economy and health care better than Obama , " Holland said , " and those are the top two issues on the minds of Democratic voters .
Obama has an advantage over Clinton on Iraq . "
The candidates and their surrogates are stumping heavily in both Texas and Ohio and both campaigns are advertising extensively .
Seeing less traffic are Rhode Island and Vermont , which also hold primaries on March 4 .

The man known to pilots simply as Widow Six Seven waited for weeks to call in his first air strike on the Taliban .
Eventually , after three days of surveillance , Prince Harry decided the time had come .
It was a moment he had trained for in secret .
As a forward air controller , it has been Harry 's job to ensure enemy targets are correctly identified and that aircrews are clear about where they
are aiming .
Most controversially , the prince is also responsible for making sure that the explosions do not kill friendly forces or Afghan civilians .
On New Year 's Eve , Harry finally got the chance to put his training into practice as he ordered two U.S. F15 fighter jets to attack the enemy .
Scroll down for more ...
5 : The first bomb lands on the enemy bunker .
6 : How Harry would have seen the blast on the screen 7 : The strike is successfully completed
Taliban fighters had been moving between bunkers in Helmand province , and as many as eight were seen digging fresh trenches .
They were spotted in surveillance flights by a lawnmower - sized Desert Hawk drone and a manned reconnaissance aircraft .
These are able to hover close to the ground , undetected by the men dubbed " Terry Taliban " by the British .
From the operations room at Forward Operating Base Delhi , one of the southernmost allied outposts in Helmand , Harry was able to watch live pictures via a laptop .
These are known as " Taliban TV " or " Kill TV " by soldiers .
Harry 's focus was a position , codenamed Purple , 150 metres behind the Taliban front line .
On the night before the air strike , the prince stayed at his post until well after midnight .
Then just before 10 am the next day , Gurkha troops at a small British observation post in front - line Garmsir were caught up in a clash with Taliban fighters .
Three Royal Artillery guns fired round after round from another British base seven miles away to force the Taliban back .
From his operations room , Harry could see where the enemy were , so he sent the two F15 fighters to a holding position six miles away where they could wait unseen .
Within an hour , 15 Taliban fighters had emerged , believing they were safe , and Harry called the jets in – verifying the co-ordinates for his first air strike .
Two targets were pinpointed at opposite ends of the bunker system .
The pilots signalled they were in position with the words " In Hot " .
After further checks , Widow Six Seven then gave them the final go - ahead with the words : " Cleared Hot " .
The pilots lined up the targets and dropped the first of two 500 lb bombs .
A third exploded moments later as Taliban fighters emerged from cover in full view of the aircraft above .
Grainy images from an Army " Rover " terminal screen show what Harry saw .
Although the exact outcome of the strike is not known , officers have described it as a success .
Asked if the job was tough , Harry said : " Well , I suppose bits of it are difficult . "
He then compared his role to that of an air traffic controller .
" You 've got jets flying all over the place and you 're trying to control them while looking at the screen , while trying to show a presence of force
with your jets to get the enemy to go to cover and to keep your guys in one piece and keep safe , " he added .
California appraisers say they 're pushed to inflate home prices Mortgage industry is rife with scams , many appraisers say
Who pressures appraisers ?

Who pressures appraisers ?

Ask any real estate appraiser : Being badgered to overstate home prices is a fact of life , they 'll say .
" We get pressured every single day to inflate our values , " said Dan Tosh , principal at Tosh & Associates , an appraisal firm in Brentwood .
" We get people telling us we 'll never work again , or they wo n't pay us because we wo n't play ball . "
New York 's attorney general sued a leading appraisal management firm Thursday , saying it had knuckled under to a big bank 's pressure to pump up home prices .
The practice might have helped fuel the current mortgage crisis and the dramatic home price appreciation of the past few years .
Many real estate experts say appraisal inflation is pervasive in an industry in which pressure to close deals is all - consuming .
" This makes things such as Enron and WorldCom look small by comparison , " said Ted Faravelli , executive director of the California Association of Real Estate Appraisers and principal at San Jose 's T.E. Faravelli & Associates , an appraisal firm .
" It was an epidemic . "
In a nationwide survey released early this year , 90 percent of 1,200 appraisers said they had felt " uncomfortable pressure " to adjust property values .
Mortgage brokers were named as the most common culprits , followed by real estate agents , consumers , lenders and appraisal management companies .
The increase in pressure was dramatic compared with that found in a similar survey in 2003 , when 55 percent of appraisers reported feeling pressured .
" Pressure on appraisers reaches pandemic proportions , " said David Hutton , senior editor at October Research Corp. , the Ohio company that conducted the study .
" The New York lawsuit ... may be just the tip of the iceberg . "
Appraisers are hired by mortgage brokers , bankers , real estate agents and home buyers as independent experts to give an informed analysis of a home 's market value .
Home loans , for both sales and refinances , rely on appraisals to assure lenders that the home is enough collateral for their money .
Appraisers , who make a flat fee of anywhere from $ 200 to $ 500 for a job , do a walk - through of a house and research recent local sales of comparable properties and then write a report on their opinion of the home 's market value .
Appraisers are licensed by the state and must complete relevant coursework and accumulate sufficient experience to earn the highest level of licensing .
Why would financial or real estate professionals lean on appraisers to hit higher numbers for homes values ?
" It 's called compensation ; it 's called money , " Faravelli said .
" Mortgage people ( brokers and lenders ) work on commission .
If the deal does n't get closed , they do n't get paid .
If the appraiser gets in the way of their money , they 'll find someone else . "
As home prices spiraled up during the most recent real estate frenzy , con artists found plenty of ways to skim off the top .
Inflated appraisals were one of the tools in their arsenal .
" In the mortgage fraud cases we 're uncovering , the linchpin of most of the fraud is a doctored or questionable appraisal , " said Tom Pool , a spokesman for the California Department of Real Estate .
" It 's a fairly common scam for properties to be overvalued and then purchased at an inflated price , with the difference coming back to the real estate broker or others involved in the scam . "
For instance , in a $ 500,000 home sale , unethical mortgage brokers or real estate agents could lean on an appraiser to give a price estimate of $ 600,000 .
A lender would then fund a mortgage at that amount , the home seller would get the $ 500,000 price , and the scam participants would pocket the $ 100,000 difference .
Regulators say it is difficult to clamp down on the practice without a smoking gun .
" We know what happens ; we know appraisers are pressured , intimidated , coerced , but we can't take an action typically because we can't prove it , " said Anthony Majewski , acting director of the California Office of Real Estate Appraisers , the state agency that oversees the profession .
" If someone has a piece of paper that says , ' I need $ 550,000 on this deal or else , ' that 's pretty good evidence " - but extremely rare .
The case filed in New York may have a smoking gun :
The attorney general 's office uncovered e-mails from the appraisal firm First American eAppraiseIT that appeared to discuss pressure from lender Washington Mutual to pump up prices .
A California law signed and implemented just last month makes it a crime for anyone with a vested interest in a real estate transaction to try to coerce an appraiser .
" I have heard numerous claims about the insidious practice of appraisal inflation , " the bill 's sponsor , Sen. Michael Machado , D - Linden ( San Joaquin County ) , said in a statement .
" More recently , inflated appraisals have been identified as a contributing factor to the subprime mortgage meltdown California is currently experiencing .
I introduced SB223 to stop the practice , once and for all . "
Similarly , federal legislation is pending that would toughen penalties for those who try to manipulate appraisals .
Rep. Paul Kanjorski , D - Pa. , introduced a bill last month to promote appraiser independence .
Still , enforcing the new laws may be difficult for the same reasons Majewski cited : actual proof of coercion is difficult to come by .
Appraisers say that requests to fudge the numbers are generally couched in code language .
" They say things like , ' What are you willing to do for us to do business ? ' - wink wink , nod nod , " Faravelli said .
He said his own appraisal business has suffered because he refuses to be what unscrupulous mortgage professionals call " a team player . "
He has switched the bulk of his practice to working as an expert witness in mortgage - fraud cases .
Similarly , Tosh of the Brentwood appraisal firm said : " We struggle to stay alive , we can't get work with a lot of people because we refuse to do what they tell us . "
Both men had numerous stories of clients who abruptly dropped them after they refused to change an appraisal .
" One of the major complaints we hear from appraisers is there are veiled and sometimes not - so - veiled threats that if you do n't hit this number for us , we 're not going to pay you or use your services again , " said Pool from the Department of Real Estate .
That explains why some appraisers cave in to the pressure :
Those who wo n't cooperate , do n't get work .
Faravelli said that appraisers who gave in have told him they figured the rapidly rising market would cover their tracks anyway .
" The pervasive attitude was , ' I know it 's not worth this amount today , but six months from now at the current rate of appreciation I 'll be covered so it 's OK , ' " he said .
When appreciation hit the wall and stalled out early this year , fake appraisals suddenly became more apparent .
People with risky mortgages who could no longer keep up with rising payments started to default on their loans .
As foreclosures multiplied , mortgage holders were left stuck with homes worth considerably less than the amount lent on them .
While market forces obviously depressed prices , if they were artificially high to begin with , that widens the gap .
Pumped - up appraisals " create what I call phantom equity , " Faravelli said .
" Appraisals are arguably the easiest part of the entire process to tweak .
After all , it 's just an opinion , and everyone has one . "

Thor 's Emerald Helmet
Credit & Copyright : Robert Gendler
Explanation :
This helmet - shaped cosmic cloud with wing - like appendages is popularly called Thor 's Helmet .
Heroically sized even for a Norse god , Thor 's Helmet is about 30 light - years across .
In fact , the helmet is actually more like an interstellar bubble , blown as a fast wind from the bright , massive star near the bubble 's center sweeps through a surrounding molecular cloud .
Known as a Wolf - Rayet star , the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief , pre-supernova stage of evolution .
Cataloged as NGC 2359 , the nebula is located about 15,000 light - years away in the constellation Canis Major .
The sharp image captures striking details of the nebula 's filamentary structures and also records an almost emerald color from strong emission due to oxygen atoms in the glowing gas .
introduces you to Christianity 's origins in ancient Pagan religion .
You 'll discover the evidence , the scholarship , and the reasoning behind this eye opening understanding of western intellectual history .
You already know Christmas trees and Easter eggs were originally Pagan , and you probably know the seasonal timing of the two holidays is Pagan too .
Mildly interesting .
Not what you 'll find here .
What you 'll discover at POCM is that ancient cultures around the Mediterranean shared a set of ideas about Gods and their powers and place in the universe — and that Christianity adopted those ideas , and applied them to Jesus .
Ancient people knew godmen did miracles .
The first Christians knew Jesus was a godman , so the stories they told about Him included miracles .
He even did the same miracles other , earlier Pagan godmen did .
The core of Christianity — the worship of a miracle working , walking , talking godman who brings salvation — was also the core of other ancient religions that began a thousand years before Jesus .
Heaven , hell , prophecy , demon possession , sacrifice , initiation by baptism , communion with God through a holy meal , the Holy Spirit , monotheism , immortality of the soul , and many other " Christian " ideas all belonged to earlier , older Pagan faiths .
They were simply part of ancient Mediterranean culture .
Along with miracle working sons of God , born of a mortal woman , they were common elements of pre-Christian Pagan religion .
Mithras had 'em .
So did Dionysus , Attis , Osiris , and Orpheus .
And more .
And they had them generations — centuries — before Jesus was a twinkle in Saint Paul 's eye .

Now that all is going so well in Iraq , and the flower strewing appears imminent , the New York Times has discovered what might just be a small problem :
As Iraqi refugees begin to stream back to Baghdad , American military officials say the Iraqi government has yet to develop a plan to absorb the influx and prevent it from setting off a new round of sectarian violence .
Oops .
And according to the reporters on the ground , the recent media hype has been media hype .
And despite the recent reduction in violence ( all the way to 2005 levels , not anywhere close to the actual levels before Bush invaded ) , the death toll from sectarian attacks around the country has nearly doubled , this year .
At a cost of a record number of American troop deaths , for this war , for a single year .
And the coverage has completely ignored the fact that militia leader Moqtada al - Sadr called a unilateral six - month cease - fire , at the end of August , which might just be a factor .
But the bigger , and largely ignored , story is the refugee crisis .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are more than four million Iraqis who have had to leave their homes ; the New York Times reported , in August , that more have fled since the escalation ; the San Francisco Chronicle reported , almost a year ago , that 40 % of Iraq 's middle class had fled ; and the Guardian reported , last summer , that a third of the population is in need of emergency assistance .
In short , as the Chronicle article pointed out , this is the Middle East 's worst refugee crisis since the Palestinians fled Israel , in 1948 - and we all know how well that has turned out .
As the Times continues : The Iraqi government lacks a mechanism to settle property disputes if former residents return to Baghdad only to find their homes occupied , the officials said .
Nor has the Iraqi government come forward with a detailed plan to provide aid , shelter and other essential services to the thousands of Iraqis who might return .
American commanders caution that if the return is not carefully managed , there is a risk of undermining the recent security gains .
Um , yeah .
Potentially millions of people returning to homes that are now occupied by others might just be a problem .
Particularly given that ethnic cleansing has left the country utterly Balkanized .
As Fareed Zakaria recently explained , on ABC News : ( O ) ne of the dirty little secrets about Iraq is that Iraq has increasingly been ethnically cleansed .
It 's sad to say , but the American Army has presided over the largest ethnic cleansing in the world since the Balkans .
If you look at Baghdad , it is essentially a very cleansed city .
It is , the Shia and Sunni communities have been separated by the river .
You look increasingly around the areas that were once intermixed .
They 're no longer mixed .
That explains , by the way , one of the reasons why violence has been reduced ...
So , it seems unlikely , when people say bad things are going to happen if we leave , bad things have already happened , where were you for the last four years .
It does n't seem that likely that we 're going to end up seeing some kind of massive genocide .
The ethnic cleansing has happened .
So , many of those returning refugees might just be returning to homes occupied by people they consider enemies .
And here 's the kicker , also from the Times article : Ahmad Chalabi , a Shiite politician and former Iraqi exile who made common cause with the Americans against Saddam Hussein , has been charged with developing a plan to provide services .
Yes , him .
Wherever there is a problem in Iraq , he can be sure to show up and make it worse !
And , of course , there 's also this little problem , as reported today by the Washington Post :
But according to interviews with more than two dozen people in neighborhoods throughout Baghdad , the effort to boost services has been uneven , marked by gradual successes and frequent setbacks .
In some neighborhoods , residents have seen government workers spruce up their parks or provide a few more hours of electricity , while residents of other districts report conditions continually deteriorating .
Yes , we still have n't managed to get their lights on .
Literally .
According to a military presentation based on figures from the U.S. Embassy 's Iraqi Transition Assistance Office , however , an average of 15.7 hours of power was provided in October nationwide .
Maysan province in the southeast received the least , 11.6 hours , while Anbar province in the west received the most , 23.3 hours .
Baghdad was on the lower end , with about 11.9 hours per day .
State Department figures from six months ago showed the city receiving an average of 5.1 hours a day .
No Baghdad resident interviewed by the Post said they had power for more than twelve hours a day .
We all wish things would miraculously turn around , in Iraq , and that the war would end and the Iraqi people suddenly have peace and prosperity .
But facts are stubborn things .
Despite our media 's hype , things remain bad , and seem likely to get worse : millions of refugees , many returning to homes now occupied by others , no plan to resettle them , and basic services still failing to rise to the level of basic functionality .
As one Baghdad resident told the Post " It was definitely so much better for us before the war , " he said .
" We were never suffering the way we are now . "
In a world of media decency , that would be the only story that mattered .
It 's weird to think of something so random as a ten year - old purchase of a television station in Pittsburgh as posing a major political problem for John McCain , but much more so than other politicians he 's made the myth of some kind of preternatural powers of honestness central to his persona .
At the same time , he 's told a series of whoppers in the past few days .
First we heard that he 'd literally never done favors for lobbyists or special interests when , clearly , he did try to intervene with the FCC on behalf of Paxson Communications .
Then he said he'd never met with Bud Paxson himself about this , even though in a 2002 deposition he said he had met Paxson .
Now the Washington Post reports that Paxson , too , is contradicting McCain 's story and also contradicting the desperate spin McCain tried to put on his earlier deposition .
Paxson also says McCain is wrong about never having met with Vicki Iseman on this issue .
Which of course makes sense .
We know that McCain tried to help Paxson out on this .
We know that Iseman 's job at the time was to get legislators to help Paxson out .
And we know that McCain and Iseman were friends at the time .
It would be pretty weird if she 'd never mentioned the whole thing to him , and he was just inspired to go write the letter by coincidence .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
This is a reasonably close paraphrase of an e-mail Kevin Landeck sent to his parents on Jan. 19 , a short note signed “ live from the ( excrement ) show ” that referred to the war strategy as “ senseless . ”
” Answer me this , ” Richard Landeck ’s letter demands of Bush .
“ How in the world can you justify invading Iraq when the problem began and continues to lie in Afghanistan ?
I do n’t want your idiotic standard answer about keeping America safe .
What did Sadaam Hussein have to do with 9/11 ? ”
The letter says , “ You have succeeded in taking down over 3,100 of our best young men , my son being one of them .
Kevin told me many times we are not fighting terrorism in Iraq and they could not do their jobs as soldiers .
He said they are trained to be on the offensive and to fight , but all they are doing is acting like policemen… .
“ He asked permission to take some of his men out at night with their night - vision glasses -- because as he said `we own the night ’ -- and watch for the people who are setting roadside bombs and `take them out . ’
He said , ` I want them to be the ones that are scared . ’
He was denied permission .
Why ? ”
Richard Landeck and his wife Vicki have never been active in politics , they told me as I sat with them around their kitchen table Sunday night in the Stonehedge subdivision in the heart of DuPage County .
He ’s a sales rep .
She ’s a dental hygienist .
Their other child , Jennifer , 23 , is an actress ( pictured below with her late brother ) who also works part - time at the nearby golf course .
As the war in Iraq enters its 5th year , look for families like the Landecks to become the face of the anti-war movement : Archtypal middle Americans who can no longer respond with platitudinous faith in our leaders to the persistent waste –-- a word Richard Landeck does not shy from –- of the lives of our young men and women in Iraq .
Saturday , they went to nearby Bloomingdale to join in a peace rally , their first .
“ This war is wrong , ” says the last paragraph of Landeck ’s letter to the president .
“ Because of your ineptness … I have lost my son , my pride and joy , my hero !
( You ) will never understand what the families of soldiers are going through and do n’t try to tell me you do .
My wife , my daughter and I cannot believe we have lost our only son and brother to a ridiculous political war . ”

UPDATE : Kevin Landeck 's e-mail 's home
Kevin C. Landeck 's guest book at Legacy.com
Here is the complete text of Richard Landeck 's letter to President Bush :
Feb 4 , 2007
Dear Mr. Bush :
This will be the only time I will refer to you with any type of respect .
My son was killed in Iraq on February 2 , 2007 .
His name is Captain Kevin Landeck .
He served with the Tenth Mountain Division .
He was killed while riding in a Humvee by a roadside bomb just south of Baghdad .
He has a loving mother , a loving father and loving sister .
You took him away from us .
He celebrated his 26th birthday January 30th and was married for 17 months .
He graduated from Purdue University and went through the ROTC program .
That is where he met his future wife .
He was proud to be a part of the military and took exceptional pride in becoming a leader of men .
He accepted his role as a platoon leader with exceptional enthusiasm and was proud to serve his country .
I had many conversations with Kevin before he left to serve as well as during his deployment .
The message he continued to send to me was that of incompetence .
Incompetence by you , ( Vice President Richard ) Cheney and ( former Secretary of Defense Donald ) Rumsfeld .
Incompetence by some of his commanders as well as the overall strategy of your decisions .
When I asked him about what he thought about your decision to “ surge ” more troops to Baghdad , he told me , “ until the Iraqis pick up the ball , we are going to get cut to shreds .
It does n’t matter how many troops Bush sends , nothing has been addressed to solve the problem he started . ”
Answer me this :
How in the world can you justify invading Iraq when the problem began and continues to lie in Afghanistan ?
I do n’t want your idiotic standard answer about keeping America safe .
What did Sadaam Hussein have to do with 9/11 ?
We all know it had to do with the first Iraq war where your father failed to take Sadaam down .
Well George , you have succeeded in taking down over 3,100 of our best young men , my son being one of them .
Kevin told me many times we are not fighting terrorism in Iraq and they could not do their jobs as soldiers .
He said they are trained to be on the offensive and to fight but all they are doing is acting like policemen .
Well George , you or some “ genius ” like you who have never fought in a war but enjoy all the perks your positions afford you are making life and death decisions .
In the case of my son , you made a death decision .
Let me explain a few other points he and I discussed .
He said when he and his men were riding down the road in their Humvees , roadside bombs would explode and they would hear bullets bouncing off their vehicle .
He said they were scared .
He thought “ why should we be the ones who are scared ? ”
He asked permission to take some of his men out at night with their night vision glasses because as he said “ we own the night ” and watch for the people who are setting roadside bombs and “ take them out . ”
He said , “ I want them to be the ones that are scared . ”
He was denied permission .
Why ?
It made perfect sense to me and other people who I told about this .
When he was at a checkpoint he was told that if a vehicle was coming at them even at a high rate of speed he could not arbitrarily use his weapon .
He had to wave his arms and , if the vehicle did not stop , he could fire a warning shot over the vehicle .
If the vehicle did not stop then , he could shoot at the tires .
If the vehicle did not yet stop he could take a shot at the driver .
Who in their right mind made that kind of decision ?
How would you like to be at a check point with a vehicle coming at you that wo n’t stop and go through all those motions ?
You will never know !
You or Cheney or Rumsfeld will never know the anguish , the worry , the sleepless nights , the waiting for the loved one who may never return .
If the soldiers were able to do their jobs and the ego ’s of politicians like you , your “ cronies ” and some commanders had their heads on straight , we would be out of this mess which we should not be involved with in the first place .
My family and I deserve and explanation directly from you …… not some assistant who will likely read this and toss it .
This war is wrong .
I want you to look me and my wife and daughter directly in the eye and tell me why my son died .
We should not be there , but because of your ineptness and lack of correct information I have lost my son , my pride and joy , my hero !
Again , you , Cheney and Rumsfeld will never understand what the families of soldiers are going through and do n’t try to tell me you do .
My wife , my daughter and I cannot believe we have lost our only son and brother to a ridiculous political war that you seem to want to maintain .
I hope you and Cheney and Rumsfeld and all the other people on your band wagon sleep well at night …. we certainly do n’t .

Brandenburg gave a status report on his research into Gravity - Electro - Magnetism ( GEM ) unification theory .

For the most part , the search for breakthroughs in space power and propulsion is akin to walking along the beach , hoping to find that doubloon - a gold coin-gleaming in the Sun , Brandenburg told SPACE.com .
" By the way , " he said , " I live in Florida ... and that happens occasionally .
So we 're trying to get lucky . "
Finding a pony in the pile
There is no doubt that anybody delving into warp drives and wormhole travel should expect a bit of a skeptical eye from others in certain scientific circles .
Getting a hearing for the out - of - the - ordinary inspiration is tough .
" We 've got to think about everything possible that there is to think about , " said Eric Davis of the Austin , Texas - based Institute for Advanced Studies .
" We have got to turn over every stone , " he said , " and look into the future to find out what 's waiting for us .
What can physics do ... where should physics be going ? "
To help explore that question , a forum is a legitimate place to present new thinking .
" Otherwise , we may never find it , " said Dana Andrews , chief technical officer for Andrews Space in Seattle , Washington .
He was an early advocate for having STAIF become a watering hole for challenging , non-traditional proposals .
The outlook that all physics has been discovered does n't resonate well with Andrews .
" I'm of the opinion that things like dark matter , dark energy , vacuum point energy ... there might be a pony in that pile .
And unless we invite people to think outside the box , we may never find the pony . "
Blitzkrieg of equations
As example , a new exact solution of Albert Einstein 's 90 - year - old gravitational field equation was offered at STAIF by physicist Frank Felber , Vice President and co-founder of Starmark , Inc. , based in San Diego , California .
And after you follow a blitzkrieg of his equations , Felber predicted that space travel near the speed of light is attainable - and not too far off in the future .
" I believe this new solution represents a major advance for space propulsion , in that it addresses the major engineering challenges of providing enormous energy to a payload quickly with negligible stresses , " Felber later told SPACE.com .
Although all such projections are inherently risky , Felber explained , he figures that the first mission to accelerate a massive payload to " a good fraction " - meaning 10 percent or more - of the speed of light might be launched before the end of this century .
" The solution also offers immediate opportunities over the next couple of years to test Einstein 's theory of gravity rigorously in the regime of relativistic speeds , where it has never before been tested , " Felber noted .
At less than one percent of the cost of space experiments -- like the recently completed Gravity Probe B mission - laboratory experiments can be conducted to demonstrate " antigravity " and test Einstein 's theory , he said .
From rest to relativistic speeds
Felber 's solution of Einstein 's gravitational field equation is the first to calculate the changing gravitational field of a mass moving near the speed of light .
" I was n't looking for antigravity or a means of propulsion ... and I was n't looking ' to push the boundaries , ' " Felber said .
Instead , he was looking for a way to relate inertial forces to the gravity of distant mass in the Universe .
" In order to do this , I figured I needed to know the gravitational field of relativistic mass , since most of the mass in the Universe is moving away from us at relativistic speeds , " Felber explained .
His analysis found that a mass moving faster than 57.7 percent of the speed of light will gravitationally repel other masses lying within a narrow " antigravity beam " in front of it .
The closer a mass gets to the speed of light , the stronger this antigravity beam becomes .
Thus , the forward antigravity field of a suitably heavy and fast mass might be used to propel a payload from rest to relativistic speeds , Felber explained .
Room for surprises
A healthy dose of skepticism is key , said John Cole , formerly in the Advanced Space Transportation Project Office at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama .
Cole worked over the past several years in the Propulsion Research Center at Marshall supporting several advanced propulsion concepts and experiments , and is now reassigned to support work for NASA 's Crew Launch Vehicle .
Regarding new propulsion ideas , Cole added that there 's room for surprises .
He said that novel concepts presented at STAIF are the by - products of people wanting to help move humans beyond the Earth 's environment out into the solar system .
" If we ever want to get to the stars ... we can't do that with chemistry , " Cole told SPACE.com .
Similarly , there are also drawbacks to nuclear systems , even fusion concepts , Cole said , for pushing humanity outward toward the stars .
" If you are going to do that in a reasonable amount of time , something exotic has got to be found , " he advised .
Not enough signal in the noise
Cole said that those at STAIF presenting exotic ideas are racking their brains ... finding " little niches or peculiarities " in the hopes of insight and possible breakthrough .
" But they are advocates ... so it 's hard not to drink your own bathwater . "
Scientific rigor is important , Cole said , and repeatable experiments must rule the day .
" Right now , there 's not enough signal in the noise to be convinced that there 's anything there .
One has to be strongly skeptical of all these kind of things , " Cole said .
" But you have got to be open - minded too .
Maybe somebody will find something .
But if they do , it has got to be solid . "
No stranger to ground - breaking ideas is Bob Cassanova , Director of the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts ( NIAC ) in Atlanta , Georgia .
NIAC is steadfast in its search for revolutionary aeronautics and space concepts that could dramatically impact how NASA develops and conducts its missions .
One new NIAC - supported concept , for instance , is building large , massive structures in space simply by using radio waves that create force fields to move materials and assemble them into various structures .
" It 's important for people to get together and expose their ideas to the scientific community ... and get back credible feedback , " Cassanova said .
While he did n't experience any " ah - ha " revelatory moments at STAIF , brainstorming and open discussion is key , he said , to help flesh out a sound idea from speculation .
But Cassanova cautions : " Just because you can write an equation that describes something ... does n't mean that such an equation describes the real physics that are going on . "
Cassanova noted that a number of the STAIF - presented concepts have not been confirmed experimentally .
In some cases , requisite power and massive pieces of equipment , as well as adequate funding are unavailable to researchers in order for them to carry out a cutting - edge experiment .
Oomph and might
NASA 's own Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project was axed in late 2002 .
That fact ties into the NASA of today that has slid back to heritage technologies , observed Davis of the Institute for Advanced Studies .
The ability to put some " oomph and might " into expanding humankind 's presence into the solar system has been " thoroughly destroyed by this heritage concept . "
" We can pick ourselves up off the ground and start using advanced , high - efficiency , high - powered , high - speed propulsion , " Davis said , " to make access to space much more effective and much easier to do . "
Be it laser beam propulsion , gravity modification , extracting energy from a vacuum , or traversable worm holes and warp drives - these and other concepts deserve attention , Davis said .
" It 's important , " Davis concluded , " because the future is everything . "

Perhaps the most encouraging feature of the Pakistan elections from the US , British and other Western points of view was the success of secular parties in resisting the spread of pro-Taleban influence .
The election cycle has surprised the outside world Those governments would agree with a commentator in the Pakistan Daily Times who said : " The return of the liberal and secular ANP [ Awami National Party ] and PPP [ Pakistan People 's Party ] to North West Frontier Province heralds a promise of peace and stability denied to the hapless province during the reign of the MMA [ religious parties ] .
" It is the rise of liberal democracy and not the ouster of President Musharraf per se by any confrontationist means that will help solve the problem of religious extremism in Pakistan . "
It is ironic that the democracy called for by the US , Britain and others has now very much isolated the man they supported before , President Musharraf .
Divided results
But they would say that that is the nature of an election and that it must be welcomed .
The system is bigger than one man .
The US called the election a " step toward the full restoration of democracy " .
The West should take heart from the poll successes of secular parties
But one can expect that they will place less reliance on President Musharraf than before without wanting him to retire from the scene .
The Wall Street Journal summed up this shift in US policy away from supporting one man : " For the Bush administration , Monday 's election means that it can continue [ the ] transition from what is often described as a " Musharraf policy " to a broader Pakistani one .
" It was never in America 's interests to humiliate or isolate the Pakistani leader ...
But US interests in Pakistan are best served by cultivating democratic institutions and a vibrant civil society with its own interests in fighting Islamic extremism . "
Disastrous Much remains uncertain , given the divided results .
A great deal depends on who will become prime minister and the eventual fate of Pervez Musharraf .
What can be said that is that , although the British and American hopes of getting Benazir Bhutto back into office failed because of a disastrous lapse of security , Pakistan seems to have come through the election cycle as it sometimes has in the past , by surprising the outside world and perhaps itself by sticking to the process .
The army under its new commander , Gen Ashfaq Pervez Kiani , has stayed in the background .
The question now is how far the army will pursue its anti-Taleban operations in the tribal areas along the Afghan frontier .
That work is seen as a vital by Nato governments supporting Afghan President Karzai .
How much will it depend on the atttiude of a new Pakistani government ?
Overall , the results must give hope to governments worried about the influence of Islamic extremism inside the country , about the security of Pakistan 's nuclear weapons [ though the US is quite confident about that ] and about the ability of the Pakistani government to combat the Taleban elements operating across into Afghanistan .
But as so often in Pakistan 's history , the stability of one moment is not necessarily a pointer to the long - term future .

The last time the savings rate dipped into the red was during the Great Depression .
At that time , of course , it made sense not to save .
Joblessness was high and money scarce ; we needed to dip into our kitty to survive .
But our negative savings during the Bush boom had a different cause .
Evidently , we felt so flush with ( paper ) gains in the stock and housing markets that we spent money as if there were no tomorrow .

Republicans have long argued that the way to stimulate long - term growth is by promoting investment over spending .
Hence their perennial efforts to lower taxes on capital gains , dividends and corporate profits .
But whether such policies actually stimulate increased investment is open to debate , since the wealthy folks who gain most from these tax reductions are probably already investing their money .
And the tax savings do n’t trickle down as much as their advocates claim .
Democrats , more concerned with helping working families , consider consumer spending to be the magic bullet , so they favor tax rebates .
But this only encourages us to continue our profligate ways .
Why not combine the best of both philosophies and try to stimulate investment by all Americans ?
The simplest approach would be to seed universal mutual fund accounts for low - income Americans .
The best way to do this would be through a so - called refundable tax credit deposited directly into a special investment account for each taxpayer .
In future years , the government could contribute an additional 50 cents for every dollar the taxpayer deposited into this account .
Think of it as a universal 401 ( k ) , but one that could be used not only for retirement but also for things like a down payment on a house , college expenses or unexpected health costs .
Such investment incentives would do more than just help stimulate business growth by providing new capital .
They would fundamentally change taxpayers ’ lives .
Some research suggests that asset - holders behave more responsibly and are more civic - minded than those without wealth .
After all , they have a stake in the future of the economy and their community .
This is why banks in cities do n’t readily offer mortgages for apartments in buildings in which most of the tenants are renters , not owners .
My own research suggests that having savings and investment equity is one of the best predictors of whether someone ’s children will attend and graduate from college .
Investing motivates people of all income levels to defer gratification and become knowledgeable about the economy and society .
In a diplomatically embarrassing about - face , the United States withdrew a draft United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the agreement reached this week in Annapolis , Md. , on starting Israeli - Palestinian peace negotiations , a day after it was introduced and had attracted widespread support from the Council ’s 15 members , including Qatar , the Council ’s Arab representative .
Israel said it had not been consulted on the language of the measure , and diplomats said that Israel objected to direct involvement in the peace process of the United Nations , where Israel is often pilloried .
“ We feel that the appreciation of Annapolis has other means of being expressed than in a resolution , ” said Daniel Carmon , Israel ’s deputy ambassador .
Alejandro D. Wolff , an American envoy , said , “ The focus , we ’ve all realized again , should be placed and remain on Annapolis . ”
These cheesy , puffy crackers taste similar to the Goldfish snacks .
They turned out quite tasty !
The recipe comes from Country Living
1 cup all - purpose flour
4 tablespoon cold unsalted butter , cut into tiny chunks
8 ounces grated extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
3/4 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoons fresh - ground pepper
4 tablespoons water
Preheat the oven to 350F !
Pulse the flour , butter , cheese , salt , and pepper together using a food processor until the mixture resembles coarse meal .
If you do n't have a food processor - like myself - you can attempt to put everything into a blender to mix .
I figured it had pulse buttons , so why not .
What I learned is not to put things in this order :
The wrong order .
The flour will spin around and the cheese will hang out at the top with the butter .
I ended up having to mix things up with a knife , pulsing , mixing again , pulsing , etc .
It turned out okay , but when doing it again , I would do the order of : cheese , butter , and flour .
Probably would still need a little mixin ' .
Once everything is mixed , add in the water , one tablespoon at a time .
The dough will begin to stick and pull from the sides .
Remove from the blender - or food processor , whatever - form into a cheese ball and wrap in Saran wrap to chill for 20 minutes in the fridge .
The dough 'll be fine up to 24 hours .
I 'm not sure what happens after 24 hours , but the Country Living recipe says no longer , and whom I am to say otherwise ?
Those guys make a paycheck on this sort of thing .
They do n't go into detail about what happens , but I have deep suspicions that it explodes into a giant buttery fireball .
After 20 minutes , sprinkle a little flour down and roll out the dough to rough 1/8 " thickness .
Bust out the cookie cutter hardware .
The weapons of choice .
Cut out circles for the pacman , and then use the star or another pointy edged cutter to cut out the mouth .
Place the pacmans on a cookie sheet about one inch apart .
They do n't puff out too much , so you can cram quite a few on a cookie sheet .
More dots !
Bake until the crackers are golden brown , about fifteen minutes .
They 'll keep for up to a week in an airtight container .
Makes three dozen 2 " pacman , plus a few dozen dots .

Congress to Probe Iraq Rape Allegations A
House panel is looking into charges by a former KBR employee .
Dec. 13 , 2007  -- A
House panel is looking into charges of sexual assault made by a former Halliburton / KBR employee in Iraq .
At a hearing next Wednesday , the House Judiciary Committee will hear testimony relating to allegations made by Jamie Leigh Jones that in 2005 , a group of Halliburton / KBR employees in Baghdad drugged her and gang - raped her less than a week into her time in the country .
The hearing comes on the heels of numerous letters from lawmakers demanding answers in the case , which will be featured on ABC News ' " 20/20 " this Friday .
Rep .
Ted Poe , R - Texas , wrote earlier this week to Attorney General Michael Mukasey , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a State Diplomatic Security agent who allegedly worked Jones ' case .
Jones has said Poe 's intervention with the State Department more than two years ago led to freeing her from the furnished container in which she says Halliburton / KBR held her following her alleged rape .
Sen. Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , also wrote to Mukasey , to ask for an investigation into Jones ' claims .
And House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D - Mich. , also wrote a letter to Mukasey , which was co-signed by Poe .
In a statement , Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Ill. , blasted the administration for taking so long to resolve Jones ' case , calling it " just another example of Justice Department 's inability to complete an investigation into possible wrongdoing by private contractors . "
On Tuesday , State Department spokesman Sean McCormack confirmed the department had investigated Jones ' case and turned results over to the Department of Justice .
He declined to give specifics or comment further .
Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said Wednesday the case was under investigation .
" We just are n't able to comment . "
Halliburton , once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney , has won more than $ 16 billion in contracts with the U.S. government for work in Iraq and Afghanistan between 2004 and 2006 .
It spun off its subsidiary KBR in April .
Jones is suing both companies in civil court ; Halliburton says she has improperly named them as a defendant .
In a statement , KBR said it was " instructed to cease " its own investigation by U.S. government authorities " because they were assuming sole responsibility for the criminal investigations . "
" The safety and security of all employees remains KBR 's top priority , " it said in the statement .
" Our commitment in this regard is unwavering . "

REUTERS / Darren Staples
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Web search company Google Inc has agreed to build an undersea cable with five telecoms operators that will link the United States to Japan , and provide the capacity to sustain a surge in Internet traffic between the continents .
Google and the five telecoms companies said in joint statement that the 10,000 km ( 6,200 mile ) undersea fiber optic cable , connecting the United States to Japan , will cost $ 300 million .
Google ’s partners in the consortium , dubbed Unity , comprises Bharti Airtel , Global Transit , KDDI Corp , Pacnet , and Singapore Telecommunications .
The cable will provide much - needed capacity to sustain unprecedented growth in data and Internet traffic between Asia and the United States .
“ The Unity cable system allows the members of the consortium to provide the increased capacity needed as more applications and services migrate online , ” said Jayne Stowell , a spokesman for the consortium .
The consortium said it has picked NEC Corporation and Tyco Telecommunications to construct and install the system , which is expected to be ready for service in the first quarter of 2010 .

Скачать
Плагин “ Article Directory ” ( каталог статей на WordPress ) Версия : 1.3 | Последнее обновление : 16.01.2011
Установка
Внимание : если вы используете плагин совместно с одноименной темой “ Article Directory ” , то пункты установки 5 , 6 , 7 и 8.1 выполнять не нужно :
Скопируйте папку article - directory в папку с плагинам и ( /wp-content / plugins / ) .
Активируйте плагин через админку .
Активируйте опци ю “ Любой может зарегистрироватьс я ” на странице общих настроек админки .
На той же странице в опци и
“ Роль нового пользовател я ” выберите “ Автор ” или “ Участник ” .
В файл index. php вашего WP - шаблона ( либо в любое другое место , где хотите отобразить список рубрик ) вставьте следующий код : <? php if ( function_exists ('article_directory ' ) ) article_directory ( ) ; ?>
Добавьте следующий код в том место шаблона , где хотите отобразить форму авторизации , например в файл sidebar .
php : <? php if ( function_exists ('article_directory_authorization_form ' ) ) article_directory_authorization_form ( ) ; ?>
Добавьте следующий код в файл header .
php перед тего м </ head > : < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " <? php bloginfo ( ' wpurl ' ) ; ?>/wp-content/plugins/article-directory/author-panel.css " type =" text /css " media= " screen " /> < link rel=" stylesheet " href= " <? php bloginfo ( ' wpurl ' ) ; ?>/wp-content/plugins/article-directory/categories.css " type =" text /css " media= " screen " />
Выберите интерфейс автора в соответствующей опции на странице “ Настойки → Article Directory ” .
Если вы выбрал и “ Панель автора ” , то выполните следующие подпункты : В папке с темой создайте новый PHP - файл , к примеру , author - panel.php , и вставьте в него следующий код : <? php /* Template Name : Панель автора */ if ( function_exists ('article_directory_author_panel ' ) ) article_directory_author_panel( ) ; ?>
Создайте в админке новую страницу и в блоке параметров страницы выберите шаблон “ Панель автора “ .
Через данную страницу авторы будут добавлять новые статьи и менять свой профиль .
При этом доступ в админку им будет запрещен .
Укажите ID этой страницы в соответствующей опции плагина на странице “ Настойки → Article Directory “ .
Готово .
Если необходимо , можете настроить другие опции плагина .
Настройка
Возможно , что понадобится сделать 2 вещи :
Поиграться с файлами author - panel.css и categories.css , чтобы привести панель автора и список рубрик к виду , соответствующему дизайну вашего сайта .
По умолчанию эти файлы уже содержит набор правил , поэтому вы можете изменить их под себя .
Настроить необходимые опции в админке на странице “ Настойки → Article Directory “ .
Как добавить иконки для родительских рубри к
Это делается с помощью CSS .
Стили для иконок нужно добавить в файл style.css вашего шаблона .
Стили должны иметь следующий вид :
#cat -23 { background : url(i/icon.gif ) 4px 3 px no-repeat}
Здесь цифра 23 означает , что данная иконка будет добавлена во 2 - й столбец для 3 -й сверху родительской рубрики .
Соответственно , необходимо создать столько таких стилей , сколько у вас имеется родительских рубрик , при этом указывая соответствующую цифру для каждой иконки .
i/icon.gif – это путь до файла иконки , начиная от папки с шаблоном .
4px – величина сдвига иконки слева от блока родительской рубрики .
3 px – величина сдвига иконки сверху от блока родительской рубрики .
Плагин также позволяет вывести отдельный , аналогично оформленный список со ссылками на RSS - фиды рубрик .
Для этого необходимо сделать следующее :
Создать новый шаблон страницы .
На месте вывода списка вставить следующий код : <? php global $ rssfeeds ; $ rssfeeds=true ; ?> <? php if ( function_exists ('article_directory ' ) ) article_directory ( ) ; ?>
В админ - интерфейсе создать новую страницу , выбрав созданный шаблон в параметрах страницы .

Avram Grant was sent a package containing a mysterious powder
A note addressed to Grant was opened by a member of staff .
It was found to contain anti-Jewish insults as well as claims that the powder was lethal .
A police source said it used the words : " When you open this letter you will die a very slow and painful death . "
The powder was analysed by specialists and found to be harmless , police said .
The letter also included threats to the manager 's wife Tzofit , a well - known personality in Israel .
A spokesman for Surrey Police said : " We were called to Chelsea 's training ground at Cobham at 12.15 pm yesterday after they received a suspicious package . "
The club 's training ground at Cobham , Surrey was sealed off while investigations were carried out .
Detectives are continuing to try to identify the source of the package .
In a statement , Chelsea said : " The required procedure for dealing with such matters was immediately activated and the police and other services were called to handle the situation .
" A harmless substance was discovered .
The matter is still being investigated . "

White House officials acknowledged that U.S. intelligence officials informed President Bush weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks that bin Laden 's terrorist network might try to hijack American planes , and that information prompted administration officials to issue a private warning to transportation officials and national security agencies .
In a press briefing , National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice said the threats were very general and did not mention a specific time , place or mode of terrorist attack .
Rice described a chronology of events detailing the how agencies dealt with the information about terrorist threats and how Bush was informed .
Officials , Rice said , were primarily concerned that the attacks would take place overseas in the Middle East , the Arab Peninsula and Europe , and thought terrorist groups would choose a more " traditional " mode of hijacking .
They thought terrorists would hijack an airplane and hold passengers captive and demand the release of one of their operatives .
The FBI , Rice said , reported that there was no way to predict a terrorist attack domestically , but that it remained a concern .
In July , there was a heightened sense that there would be an attack because of unrest in the Middle East , and officials were concerned that terrorists were targeting Paris , Rome and Turkey , she said .
The Federal Aviation Administration became so concerned it issued several information circulars in June , July and August and ordered officials to be on a heightened state of alert , particularly overseas .
Sources told ABCNEWS that one circular released in June said , " Although we have no specific information that this threat is directed at civil aviation , the potential for terrorist operations , such as an airline hijacking to free terrorists incarcerated in the U.S. remains a concern . "
One July circular , sources told ABCNEWS , did mention bin Laden , but only in a very general way .
No One Predicted the  Non- Traditional  Hijacking On Aug. 6 , Rice said , Bush received an " analytical report " at his ranch in Crawford , Texas , where officials described the methods bin Laden had used in past terrorist attacks .
She defended the administration 's decision not to issue a warning to the American people , saying that the threats were not specific .
" It is always a question of how good the information is and whether putting the information out is a responsible thing to do , " Rice said .
" You would have risked shutting down the American civil aviation system with such generalized information .
You would have to think five , six , seven times about that , very , very hard . "
Rice stressed that there was no way anyone could have predicted that terrorists would use hijacked planes as missiles and attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
She , and White House spokesman Ari Fleischer earlier in the day , said that before Sept. 11 " hijacking " had a different meaning to people than it did afterwards .
" Had this president been aware that terrorists would have used airplanes as missiles and attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , he would have acted on it , " Rice said .
 We Need Facts on the Table House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt called today for a full investigation that is open to public scrutiny .
" I think what we have to do now is to find out what the president , what the White House knew about the events leading up to 9 - 11 , when they knew it and most importantly what was done about it at that time , " he said .
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle , D - S.D. , echoed Gephardt 's call .
" Why did it take eight months for us to receive this information ? "
Daschle asked , calling for a blue - ribbon commission to investigate .
" And secondly , what specific actions were taken by the White House in response ? "
Daschle said that Vice President Dick Cheney had " requested on several occasions that we not have an inquiry " into what intelligence the administration had before the hijackings and how they acted on it .
In a speech at a dinner marking the 40th anniversary of the New York State Conservative Party in New York tonight , Cheney criticized Democrats for using partisan tactics in a time of war and hoped an inquiry would not interfere with ongoing battle against terrorism .
" An investigation must not interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack , because without a doubt a very real threat of another perhaps more devastating attack still exists , " Cheney said .
" The people and agencies responsible for helping us learn about and defeat such an attack are the very ones most likely to be distracted from their critical duties if Congress fails to carry out their obligations in a responsible fashion . "
Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott , R - Miss. , was outraged by the attacks on Bush , calling them reprehensible .
" I really think there 's nothing more despicable for someone to insinuate that the president of the United States knew there was an attack on our country that was imminent and did n't do anything about it , " Lott said .
Lott suggested that the country has to remain united , especially as the U.S. war on terrorism continues .
" For us to be talking like our enemy , George W. Bush instead of Osama bin Laden , that 's not right , " Lott said .
House Speaker Dennis Hastert , R - Ill. , insisted the threats before Sept. 11 were not kept secret from anyone .
" It is common knowledge that the government of the United States was put on higher alert during the summer of 2001 , in response to non-specific threats from terrorists , " Hastert said in a statement .
" The federal government took all appropriate steps to respond to that threat .
Democrats now say that they were kept in the dark about these threats .
That is not the case .
These threats were relayed on a bipartisan basis to the House Intelligence Committee in real time . "
Ignored Warning Signs
The revelation came as legislators were already demanding an explanation following the emergence of an FBI memo alluding to ignored warning signs about Sept. 11 .
Two months before the hijackings , FBI agents in Phoenix reported their suspicions about Arab students at a Phoenix flight school , and directly referred to the possibility of a connection to bin Laden .
" There should have been bells and whistles going off , " Sen .
John Edwards , D - N.C. , said today on ABCNEWS ' Good Morning America .
There were " three huge warning signs , " Edwards said , referring to a memo from the FBI about al Qaeda members training in flight schools in Arizona ; the arrest of suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui  the alleged " 20th hijacker "  in Minnesota ; and the warning given to Bush in August while he was vacationing at his ranch .
In the memo from the Phoenix FBI office to headquarters , the agents recommended an urgent nationwide review of flight schools " for any information that supports Phoenix 's suspicions " of a terrorist connection .
The memo reportedly cited bin Laden by name .
The memo 's existence apparently has been known for months , but until recently , lawmakers and congressional staff had not gained full access to it and the direct reference to bin Laden had not been revealed .
" Was anything done about any of those things ? "
Edwards asked .
" Why are we finding out now , eight months later ?
Was any action of any kind taken ? "
The memo has still has not been publicly released .
Sens. Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , and Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , are among the lawmakers asking the FBI to release it , and are demanding an investigation into the missed warning signs .
But Edwards said the White House has been resistant to allowing the investigation to proceed .
" We 've had some tension about trying to get the investigation started , " he said .
No Big Picture FBI Director Robert Mueller , who took over the post after Sept. 11 , has told Congress none of the signals was sufficient to prevent the attacks , but conceded the bureau failed to properly follow them .
" We did not have the people who were looking at the broader picture to put the pieces in place , " he said at a recent hearing .
The White House also insists the FBI did not drop the ball .
Mueller is seeking to address some of the flaws exposed by the Sept. 11 attacks by creating a new terrorism - fighting team in Washington that will oversee all U.S. terrorism investigations worldwide , officials told The Associated Press .

One of the adages of computing is that no hardware is safe when a hacker has physical access to the machine .
In an age of booming laptop sales , people have n't found that reassuring and have frequently turned to disk encryption in an effort to protect their personal data .
A new paper ( PDF ) by a group of Princeton computer scientists suggests that disk encryption is vulnerable to a hack that will be hard to correct for : data about the encryption can be extracted from the machine 's RAM .
Most people know that the contents of RAM are lost when a machine powers down .
The paper notes , however , that this process is n't instantaneous .
In their tests , the authors found that various forms of RAM take anywhere from 2.5 to 35 seconds to reach a null state ( newer RAM got there faster ) .
That process is temperature - dependent ; dropping the RAM to - 50 °C cut the rate at which memory was lost to 0.1 percent per minute .
If that temperature seems hard to reach , it 's not .
The researchers achieved it by turning a canned air dispenser upside - down and spraying it on the RAM chip .
Dropping the chip in liquid nitrogen kept the error rate at a similar level for up to an hour .
That 's more than long enough to move the chip to a new machine for analysis .
But the researchers also developed ways to hack the RAM while in place .
A quick reboot will also preserve the contents of memory but , in most cases , large portions of that memory are quickly overwritten by the operating system during the boot sequence .
To avoid this problem , the researchers devised tiny kernels that took up very little memory while dumping the remaining contents onto disk for further analysis .
These included versions that booted from USB drives or operated over a netboot infrastructure .
With the memory contents in hand , the next step was to crack the encryption and compensate for the sporadic memory errors .
Here , the researchers relied on the fact that most decryption systems store information derived from the encryption keys in memory to speed calculations .
These key schedules have a some known features that make finding them largely a matter of scanning for patterns in the memory .
Once near matches are identified , they can be set aside for more detailed analysis ( including corrections for memory errors ) , eliminating most brute force aspects of the cracking .
The authors also noted that memory in the the RAM chips they examined decayed in a stereotypical pattern across their tests , allowing for the possibility of sophisticated error correction based on the identification of these patterns .
That level of sophistication , however , was n't needed for their current implementations .
The paper describes algorithms for recognizing and extracting AES , DES , RSA , and tweak key information from memory .
The authors have also turned these on most of the common encryption methods , including TrueCrypt and dm-crypt , as well as Mac OS - X's FileVault and Vista 's BitLocker .
Using an external USB drive , the authors were able to identify and extract the key and mount a BitLocker - encrypted volume in about 25 minutes .
While wandering around the memory of an Intel Mac , they not only cracked the FileVault encryption but also stumbled onto multiple copies of the login password .
The paper includes a number of suggestions for improving security in the face of this kind of attack , but most of them would involve either changes in the hardware architecture or a radical overhaul of the encryption process itself .
In most cases , the changes would simply make the attack harder , rather than impossible .
Overall , it seems that disk encryption may help prevent casual data loss , but it is no match for a well - prepared attacker .

Every once in a while Chris Wallace surprises me .
You can see the hint of journalist rather than the White House sanctioned propagandist .
Chris asked Republican presidential contender Mike Huckabee about his 1992 statements questioning whether we might consider quarantining AIDS patients as a potential public health risk , and Huckabee tried to dance around it , claiming that back then we just did n't understand the risks .
Now , if Mike had made those statement 10 years earlier in 1982 , that might have been believable , but as Chris Wallace points out :
But Governor , forgive me , I do n’t think that ’s right .
All the way back in 1985 - this was n’t political correctness -- the Center for Disease Control , seven years before you made your statement , said that AIDS could not be spread by casual contact .
Oops .
As PERRspectives points out , even Ronald ( " AIDS ?
What 's that ? " )
Reagan refuted Huckabee 's extremism -- in 1987 .
OK , so Huck is flopping around on immigration because the hard core wingnut base of the GOP does n't like his stance on giving kids that were born in the country some protections because they are US citizens .
And he said that if all illegal immigrants were deported .
the American economy would collapse .

Huckabee :
In all due respect , we 're a better country than to punish children for what their parents did .
We 're a better country than that .
What a nice position to have .
Fooled ya !
After that debate he came out with a new plan that calls for sending all illegal immigrants home --- including their children that in his words --- would " collapse " our economy .
But if the children are American citizens , how can he do that ?
Would n't that be terribly destructive to them ?
Ahhh , compassionate conservatism .
Is this how a Christian warrior treats " children ? "
Timmeh calls him on it pretty good ....
RUSSERT : " Do n't punish those kids . "
A week later , you said , " No , no , no , send the parents home , " and what happens to the kids ?
HUCKABEE : They go with their parents .
I mean , I can't imagine a parent not taking their children ...
RUSSERT : But they 're American citizens .
Why do they have to leave the country ?
HUCKABEE : Because they 're -- first , before they 're American citizens , they 're the children of their parents .
RUSSERT : But are n't we a " better country , " to quote someone , than that ?
HUCKABEE : No , I did not send them home .
They will go home within 120 - day window , and then they have the process of starting to return .
RUSSERT : But that 's 15 million people .
You 're saying to do that would collapse the American economy , and now that 's exactly what you 're proposing .
HUCKABEE : No , I do n't think it would collapse the American economy if people went back and did their process of becoming legal .
And all of them are n't going to go back on the same day .
There 's going to be a window of time .
How long it 's going to take for them to come back , I do n't know
Huckabee still says we 're a better country than that !
He then says he's not sending them home , but he is ... Right ?
Oh , they get a chance to come back some day .
But he does n't have any kind of time frame , just ship 12 - 15 million people out of the country at an astronomical cost that would probably take years to accomplish and as he said earlier --- collapse our economy .
He does manage to get a " God " reference into the discussion too .... I 'm just baffled ...( transcript below the fold )
MSNBC :
GOV .
HUCKABEE : In all due respect , we 're a better country than to punish children for what their parents did .
We 're a better country than that .
MR. RUSSERT : " We 're a better country than punishing children for what their " ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : ..." parents did . "
GOV .
HUCKABEE : I still believe that , yeah .
MR. RUSSERT : But a week later , after that comment , you came out with this : " The Secure America Plan . "
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : " Propose to provide all illegal immigrants a 120 - day window to register with the Bureau of Citizenship " " Immigration Services and leave the country .
Those who register " " return to their home country will face no penalty if they later apply , " " those who do not return home will be , when caught , barred from future re-entry for a period of 10 years . "
Children born here are American citizens .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : And you were saying that .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : " Do n't punish those kids . "
A week later , you said , " No , no , no , send the parents home , " and what happens to the kids ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : They go with their parents .
I mean , I can't imagine a parent not taking their children ...
MR. RUSSERT : But they 're American citizens .
Why do they have to leave the country ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Because they 're -- first , before they 're American citizens , they 're the children of their parents .
MR. RUSSERT : But are n't we a " better country , " to quote someone , than that ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Let me be very clear .
I stand beside my statement , but here 's what we have to do to fix the immigration problem .
We 've got to seal our border , something our government has been dysfunctional and failed to do .
It 's also very clear the American people are not going to tolerate people who have gotten here illegally to get in the front of the line .
The only way they can get into the back of the line is to go back to the point of origin , to get behind that line , and then modernize that line so it should n't take eight years to process a piece of paper to get people the necessary paperwork to be able to do that .
MR. RUSSERT : But , Governor , this is , this is important , because this is what you said back in 2005 .
" Responding to a question about illegal aliens , Huckabee said `our economy would collapse ' without them . "
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Mm-hmm .
MR. RUSSERT : Do you believe that ?
GOV .
HUCKABEE : I think it would be very , very difficult to do construction and agriculture without them .
That 's why we need a policy that puts everyone in this country in a legal position .
And , Tim , let me , let me go further .
MR. RUSSERT : But , this , this is ...
GOV .
HUCKABEE : Let me explain why .
MR. RUSSERT : ... important , because your plan says send them all home .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : No , I did not send them home .
They will go home within 120 - day window , and then they have the process of starting to return .
MR. RUSSERT : But that 's 15 million people .
You 're saying to do that would collapse the American economy , and now that 's exactly what you 're proposing .
GOV .
HUCKABEE : No , I do n't think it would collapse the American economy if people went back and did their process of becoming legal .
And all of them are n't going to go back on the same day .
There 's going to be a window of time .
How long it 's going to take for them to come back , I do n't know .
But part of the process , the first process , if you read my entire plan , is seal the border .
Seal the border .
If you do n't do that , then you do n't have any control of who 's here , why they 're here and what they 're doing .
This process has to be modernized .
It 's our government that 's been dysfunctional .
Tim , I stand by many of the state -- all of the statements I 've made , and one of them has been , let 's thank God we live in a country people are trying to break into , not one they 're trying to break out of .
But let 's have a rule of law .
Let 's make everyone live by it .
And let me tell you why I believe my plan is not only a plan that respects the rule of law , but I think it 's the most humane plan .
Because nobody living in this country ought to live with his head down , ought to live in the shadows , ought to live in fear , ought to live every day looking if there 's a police car or a border patrol , running and hiding .
I want people to live in this country with their heads up .
I want them to be able to , if they 're going to work here , to work legally .
I want them to be able to pay the same taxes , live under the same laws , and also to be able to have the kind of sense of liberty that this country is bound by .
That 's what we 're trying to achieve .
Let 's not forget that our federal government has made a mess of this .
As a governor , I had to deal with their mess , and I believe , as president , one of the highest priorities is to fix the problem .
Why is it that when you step into a bar for a glass or two of cheer , you so often leave with five drinks ’ worth of impending doom ?
All you wanted was to loosen up , have some fun , unleash the gregarious you stuck somewhere in sobriety .
Yet it is all too likely that this feel - good glow will be followed by a hard - luck chaser .
Several drinks later , you stumble home , clumsy , belching and battling to stay awake .
Your judgement ’s shot : you urinate in a doorway , stuff down two kebabs and narrowly escape getting killed on the road .
At home , your partner declares you disgusting and , though you rant defiantly , you know it ’s true .
You toss and turn all night and in the morning wake tired , with a throbbing head and an uncanny certainty that you made an ass of yourself last night , though you ca n’t remember the details .
As you trudge off to work , a few brain cells lighter and with a slightly more withered heart and liver , you swear you wo n’t do it again .
But you probably will .
The simple fact is that alcohol makes people feel good .
There are obvious downsides , but it also relaxes you , makes you happy , chatty and sociable .
What if you could have all that is good about alcohol , with none of the bad ?
What if you could enjoy a night of frivolous fun , then simply pop a pill for instant revival ?
Your sobriety restored , home you ’d ride – or even drive – to a good night ’s sleep ( or better ) with no risk of a hangover .
Or what if , before imbibing , you could swallow a …
Recently , we told you that Polaroid launched a new color mobile printer that uses no ink .
Yes , there is a way to print images without a single drop of ink .
The trick is in a special type of paper developend by Zink Imaging ( “ Zink ” also stands for “ zero ink ” ) .
The paper incorporates color crystals that are be activated by heat of printhead .
Now here is a video of a “ dive ” inside the paper , so that you can have a look at how the crystals work :
Most people who knew Gabriel Hammond at Johns Hopkins in the late 1990s could have predicted he would rise quickly on Wall Street .
As a freshman , he traded stocks from his dorm room , making a $ 1,000 bet on Caterpillar .
Soon after , he abandoned his childhood dream of becoming a lawyer and , upon graduation , joined Goldman Sachs as a stock analyst .
Three years into his new job , Mr. Hammond noticed something .
Very few of his young co-workers were taking a hiatus from Wall Street to go to business school , long considered an essential rung on the way to the top of the corporate ladder .
So he , too , decided to forgo an M.B.A..
Instead , he raised $ 5 million and started his own hedge fund , Alerian Capital Management , in 2004 .
The fund now manages $ 300 million out of offices in New York and Dallas , and Mr. Hammond , 28 , enjoys seven - figure payouts .
Like other young people on the fast track , Mr. Hammond has run the numbers and figures that an M.B.A. is a waste of money and time — time that could be spent making money .
“ There ’s no way that I would consider it , ” he says .
As more Americans have become abundantly wealthy , young people are recalculating old assumptions about success .
The flood of money into private equity and hedge funds over the last decade has made billionaires out of people like Kenneth Griffin , 38 , chief executive of the Citadel Investment Group , and Eddie Lampert , 45 , the hedge fund king who bought Sears and Kmart .
These men are icons for the fast buck set — particularly the mathematically gifted cohort of rising stars known as “ quants . ”
Many college graduates who are bright enough to be top computer scientists or medical researchers are becoming traders instead , and they measure their status in dollars instead of titles .
Many of the brightest do n’t covet a corner office at Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley .
Instead , they ’re happy to work at a little - known hedge fund run out of a two - room office in Greenwich , Conn. , as long as they get a fat payday .
The competition from alternative investment firms — private equity and hedge funds in particular — is driving up salaries of entry - level analysts at much larger banks .
And top performers at the banks make so much money today that they do n’t want to take two years off for business school , even if it ’s a prestigious institution like the Wharton School or Harvard .
The new ranks of traders and high - octane number crunchers on Wall Street are also a breed apart from celebrated long - term investors like Warren E. Buffett and investment banking gurus like Felix G. Rohatyn .
What sets the new crowd apart is the need for speed and a thirst for instant riches .
“ With the growth of hedge funds , you ’re getting a lot of really smart people who are getting paid a lot very young , ” says Arjuna Rajasingham , 29 , an analyst and a trader at a hedge fund in London .
“ I know it ’s a bit of a short - term view , but it ’s hard to walk away from something that ’s going really well . ”
The shift has not gone unnoticed by administrators at some business schools .
Richard Schmalensee , who was dean of the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management until June , chalked it up to the changing nature of money - making .
In many banks and investment boutiques , traders with math and science backgrounds now contribute more to the bottom line than the white - shoed investment bankers who long presided over Wall Street .
And traders tend to be less likely to go to business school .
“ I do n’t think you will see M.B.A. ’s less represented in executive suites , but you may see M.B.A. ’s less represented in the lists of the world ’s richest people , ” Professor Schmalensee says .
BUSINESS school has not fallen out of favor among the student population at large .
The number of students who earned M.B.A. ’s in 2005 was about 142,600 , nearly twice the level in 1991 .
But as M.B.A. ’s become more common , the degree seems to carry less prestige with people who land top - paying jobs in finance soon after college .
And recent upheavals in the financial markets do n’t seem to be changing the thinking of these younger high - fliers and their employers .
Hedge fund managers are unlikely to punish their younger workers for any dip in returns this year , says Adam Zoia , managing partner at Glocap , a headhunter in New York .
Management fees charged by funds — typically 2 percent — come in regardless of return levels and can more than cover large salaries for young employees at many funds .
“ Most managers say , ‘ If I do n’t pony up a decent bonus , then I ’m going to lose people , ’ ” Mr. Zoia says .
“ It ’d be short - sighted of them not to retain their good people . ”
At funds that manage $ 1 billion to $ 3 billion , people with just a few years of finance experience will make $ 337,000 this year , Mr. Zoia says , and those with five to nine years of experience will average $ 830,000 , up 6 percent from last year .
These estimates include analysts and researchers but not portfolio traders , who can make much more because they sometimes share in profits .
Dozens of young people ( mostly male ) who want to be , or already are , successful traders said in interviews that they relished the challenge of their jobs , in addition to the lofty paychecks .
But they also spoke as if a money - clock were ticking : many said they wanted to make as much money as fast as they could so that they could live in style later in life while doing less lucrative things like running a charity , working for the government , spending time with their families , or inventing new technologies .
Some , of course , plan to stay in finance their entire careers , and they , too , are very focused on earning fat bonuses fast .
“ The sales pitch of these private equity funds or these hedge funds is , ‘ Come here , and you ’ll make a million bucks in two years , ’ ” says Gregg R. Lemkau , 38 , managing director and chief operating officer of investment banking at Goldman Sachs , who passed up business school to stay at Goldman in the early 1990s when that choice was more rare .
And because today there are more self - made millionaires — and billionaires — than ever before , 20 - something traders seem bolder in their monetary ambitions .
Business school often does not fit into these plans .
“ If you want to make the most money in the shortest period of time , you ca n’t be away from work for two years , ” says Vitaly Dukhon , 30 , who recently left the Fortress Investment Group in New York to join another hedge fund .
While in college at Harvard , Mr. Dukhon thought he would go to business school in his mid-20s , but in his first job on the Treasury desk at Deutsche Bank , he realized that the smartest people just a few years his senior were staying put .
“ I saw that people that had been working for 20 years did have M.B.A. ’s , but people five to six years older than me were not going , ” he says .
“ Going to business school is a way for people to try to open the door , to try to get into a company or hedge fund .
But if you ’re already there , it does n’t make sense to go . ”
Mr. Hammond of Alerian noticed the same trend while he was an analyst at Goldman Sachs .
His co-workers who went to business school either wanted to change careers , or they were not doing well in their current jobs , he says .
Part of the shift comes as investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have changed their tune on business school .
Instead of pushing all their young employees into M.B.A. programs , banks are telling the best ones to stay put .
“ We are the perfect training ground for people who want to have careers in finance , ” says Caitlin McLaughlin , director of campus recruiting for Citi , the former Citigroup .
Just 15 years ago , Ms. McLaughlin estimates , 85 to 90 percent of Citi ’s analyst classes ended up attending business school .
Now , she thinks that figure is closer to 50 percent .
Samir Ahmad , 25 , has worked at Citi since college .
This summer , he was promoted to associate , an M.B.A. - level position , in the fixed - income , currencies and commodities division .
Despite advice from his older brother that he should attend business school , Mr. Ahmad says he cannot see what he would gain to justify the time .
“ If I were to spend two years at business school , I ’d get an M.B.A. degree , but I think learning a different product or a different group here at Citi would be more valuable , ” he says .
To be sure , business school can still be a valuable investment , especially for those who want to change careers .
Most schools teach a well - rounded curriculum that exposes students to the full picture of the way the business world works .
They are great places to make friends and connections that can help throughout a career .
And the top business schools serve as a useful filtering system , placing a seal of approval on graduates that can help them find jobs .
“ Most banking — and that includes private equity — is about deals and about relationships , ” says Timothy Butler , director of M.B.A. career development programs at Harvard Business School .
“ That will always be M.B.A. territory . ”
YET even some students at top schools like Harvard say the decision to go is tougher now than it likely was two decades ago .
“ We all struggled with it , ” says Katie Shaw , 28 , who is in her second year of business school there .
“ It ’s not only , ‘ Where do I go to business school ? ’
It ’s also , ‘ Do I go ? ’ ”
Ms. Shaw worked in private equity before business school and plans to return to a position in finance .
In private equity , she says , an M.B.A. is valued because buying and selling companies involves relationships and company analysis skills .
Still , most private equity firms used to require their young hires to leave to go to business school , and some are now letting talented ones keep working instead .
Headhunters for hedge funds and private equity firms say hedge funds , in particular , do not value an M.B.A .
“ I have some clients that will legitimately say , ‘ An M.B.A. means absolutely nothing to us , ’ ” says Tim Zack , principal of In - Site Search , a headhunting firm in Westport , Conn. , that is a division of Chaves and Associates .
Mr. Hammond of the Alerian hedge fund recently hired someone from Carnegie Mellon ’s business school because of that person ’s engineering talent , not the skills he learned in business school .
While Mr. Hammond says he understands why his new employee went to business school to move into finance , he would look less favorably on someone in an M.B.A. program who had left finance to go to business school .
If he were looking at someone who went to Harvard Business School after the two - year analyst program at Goldman , “ I ’d be suspicious , ” he says .
“ I ’d be saying , ‘ What was it you were doing wrong that you could n’t get a promotion at Goldman or did not pursue an opportunity with a private equity or hedge fund ? ’ ”
When young people on Wall Street consider the benefits of business school , Mr. Hammond says , the upside no longer outweighs lost salaries and bonuses they would have earned .
He calculates the cost of going to a two - year business school to be at least half a million dollars for the average bank employee — $ 250,000 or more each year in lost salary , plus $ 50,000 a year in tuition and living expenses .
For hedge fund employees , Mr. Hammond says , the number would be considerably higher .
The result , headhunters say , is that many of the best people in finance are no longer entering the M.B.A. pipeline .
“ If someone is doing well at a hedge fund , they absolutely do not encourage their employees to go off to business school , ” says Mr. Zoia of Glocap .
Some young people are pursuing alternatives that can be completed without leaving their jobs .
Some take the certified financial adviser tests or study part - time at night at schools like N.Y.U. that offer master ’s degrees in subjects like financial engineering .
“ There ’s a real shift in assumptions as to what is going to make you a better applicant or a prospect for a job , ” says Art Hogan , chief market analyst for Jefferies & Company , noting that he had seen an increased interest in young people pursuing a degree as a certified financial adviser at night rather than leaving their jobs for an M.B.A .
At the banks , there has been a push in recent years to keep top performers around after their time as analysts , the most junior position , ends .
“ Strong performers we want to keep at the firm for as long as possible , ” says Julie Kalish , 28 , head of United States recruiting for Credit Suisse .
“ The amount of analysts that we try to keep for the associate promotion process has grown over recent years . ”
Admissions officers at top business schools say finance firms always try to hold onto their best employees when the economy is good .
They say interest from applicants working in finance is not declining and their graduates still land a large number of top finance jobs .
What administrators at business schools do not know — largely because their admissions and career placement offices are separate — is whether their students with a finance background are staying in that industry .
Recruiters at banks say a large number of the students that they are hiring from business schools are from an international background or are changing careers .
These students are valuable , they say , but they come in with a different background from someone who has been in finance since age 22 .
Jeffrey Talpins , chief investment officer at Element Capital Management , a small fixed - income hedge fund in New York , says he likes to hire people fresh out of school so he can teach them himself .
Mr. Talpins attended
Yale as an undergraduate but did not go to business school .
If a young employee asked his advice on business school , he says , he would tell them not to go if they wanted to stay in finance .
“ I ’d say , ‘ You already have a great platform for a job in finance , ’ ” he says .
“ If you ’re a superstar , and you ’re very good , you ’ll grow very rapidly in this field . ”
Eventually , these young people may want to raise money and start their own fund , suggests Thomas Caleel , director of admissions at Wharton , and that ’s where an M.B.A. and the connections that come with it could help .
“ If you are trying to raise money for a hedge fund , you will need that network , ” he says .
Mr. Talpins of Element said he had no trouble raising money for his hedge fund without an M.B.A .
After all , he had a track record from Citi and Goldman Sachs to show to potential investors .
In his corner of the world , where math equations are likely to be scrawled on white boards around the office and young people hold the purse strings to millions of dollars in investor money , it seems there is no point in going to business school just to punch a ticket .
In 2005 , Trader Monthly named Mr. Talpins one of the top 30 traders under 30 .
“ Youth is not wasted on this crop , any of whom could be a billionaire by 40 , ” the magazine said .
“ Or , then again , they could be belly up and bust . ”
Mr. Hammond of Alerian , who was featured on the magazine ’s list last year , said he has seen people go to hedge funds and get fired in six months “ because they could n’t hack it . ”
But he says the risk is worth it .
“ If you look at the really successful hedge fund managers — the Eddie Lamperts , ” he says , “ they ’re all in their 40s now .
They were probably making only low single - digit millions in their 20s .
“ That ’s why you do this , ” he continues .
“ That ’s why it ’s so attractive , because the payoff of being the winner , the next Eddie Lampert , is so high . ”

5 Strangest Things To Be Outsourced
Is Hef really having a better time at the Playboy Mansion than you are at home ?
Who Is Shawn Casey ?
Is He For Real ?
Michael Ossarehof Heysan ! advises two new startups .
A few weeks ago , we kicked off Y Combinator ’s sixth funding cycle with 21 new startups .
They ’re all living in the Bay Area now and are totally immersed in building their products .
Some have already launched .
One of the things that surprised us recently is how big the YC alumni network has grown .
Now that we ’ve invested in 80 startups , there are almost 200 alumni .
It did n’t really hit us till we started organizing a reunion and realized they ’d barely fit even in our huge west coast building .
A cheery reunion with founders from last summer 's funding cycle .
It ’s great how much the founders help one another .
As usual , several alumni came to our first dinner to talk about what they wish they ’d known when they were just starting .
The most consistent pieces of advice : launch quickly , be really careful about hiring , and that raising money can take longer than you ’d expect .
Joe Kraus ( seated far right , in " Cookie Monster " t- shirt ) talks to the founders .
Joe Kraus , a perennial favorite with the founders , came to the second dinner to talk about his experiences founding Excite and JotSpot .
Joe is such a smart and articulate person — I always enjoy hearing him talk .
My favorite takeaways :
- #1 Persistence .
The “ $ 4 billion dollar story ” of how Excite landed the Netscape button deal is a must - read for every entrepreneur .
- Hiring is key .
The cost of hiring someone bad is so much greater than missing out on someone good .
I think this was a rule they took very seriously the second - time around .
They wanted “ no false positives . ”
- You make what you measure .
Merely measuring something regularly will help you to improve it .
And not measuring it will almost guarantee failure .
Carolynn Levy of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati joined us at the third dinner to talk about corporate law .
WSGR is probably the most prominent startup law firm in the valley .
Most founders do n’t get too excited about legal stuff ( which is as it should be ) but everyone liked Carolynn because she knows startup law so well and is what Paul calls “ hacker compatible . ”
