The number of people missing out on places has doubled in two years
Almost a quarter of a million people applying for university this year are going to miss out on a place , university leaders are forecasting .
Spending cuts have reduced extra university places at a time when there has been a huge surge in demand .
The number of applicants not getting a place will have doubled in two years .
Professor David Green , vice - chancellor of the University of Worcester , says it will mean thousands of " unnecessarily blighted lives " .
With the spending cuts stopping university expansion , this summer will see an unprecedented number of applicants failing to get a place on a degree course .
' Tough on young '
" Many highly - qualified young people with good A - levels will not get a place at university , " says Professor Green .
" The same students , with the same qualifications , applying for the same university two years ago , would have got a place . "
The same students , with the same qualifications , applying for the same university two years ago , would have got a place David Green , Vice - chancellor , University of Worcester
He says this is " tough on young people who are entirely blameless " of the financial problems that are putting a brake on university places .
Professor Green is also forecasting that because of spending restrictions designed to curb numbers there will be an actual drop in overall places available this year , despite the announcement of a small number of extra places .
He argues that universities have the capacity on courses to offer a further 40,000 places , if the funding was made available .
Last year , there were 158,000 applicants who did not get a place - up from about 120,000 in 2008 .
Professor Green is forecasting that this will rise to 225,000 this year and could edge towards 250,000 .
The most recent admissions service figures show an average 16.5 % increase - and 80,000 extra applicants - but he believes that this could rise further with late applications .
Individual institutions have seen rises in applications of more than 40 % .
A separate analysis by the Million + group of new universities suggests there will be a " mismatch between supply and demand of 250,000 " .
The admissions service Ucas says there will be at least 200,000 applicants who will not end up with a place - with a full breakdown of applications due in July .
Good grades
Within this total number of people failing to get places will be some who did not reach the grades needed - and others who might apply and then get a job instead .

There could be 100,000 applicants with good A - levels missing places
But Professor Green says that about 100,000 of those failing to get a place will have good grades .
He attributes this increase in applications to young people getting the message that they need a degree to improve their career chances .
He also sees a major change in the employment market , with new jobs more likely to be created in graduate areas , rather than manufacturing or unskilled jobs .
This means that both young people leaving school and mature students who want to improve their skills are chasing places on the same courses .
This year 's applications are also now competing with those who did not get places last year .
Ucas has said that more than 40,000 of this year 's applicants had previously applied last year .
Spending cuts
Cuts in university spending announced this week meant that the number of extra places on 2009 levels has been reduced to 8,000 full - time places .
But Professor
Green says these extra places will be counterbalanced by losses elsewhere leading to a reduction in places overall .
And in particular , he says that the fines levied on universities which over - recruit mean that they will be much more cautious about the number of students - leading to them recruit less than their cap .
The new universities and work - related courses are seeing particular surges in demand .
Alice Hynes , chief executive of the Guild HE group of smaller specialist universities , says there are particular concerns for students who might miss out on work - related courses .
Too often debates about higher education become " tangled up " in who gets into the top universities , she says .
But a much more pressing issue is about those students who might need a degree to improve their job chances , she says .
Million + is warning that the lack of places will mean that many students from families from poorer backgrounds will be discouraged from applying .
" This shortage will only grow more acute between now and the start of the academic year , " says a Million + spokesperson .
" It 's clear that the decision to reduce the number of places was the wrong one . "
The Business , Innovation and Skills department , which is responsible for universities , says that " securing a place at university has always been a competitive process " .
" The government wants to support people with the ability and talent to go to university - because it is good for those individuals and the future of our economy .
That is why we are creating 10,000 additional places to meet the demand this year . "

Here 's the deal : an ongoing California class - action lawsuit filed in 2007 claims that Apple and AT&T illegally exerted a monopoly over iPhone service by telling customers the iPhone 's required service contract was two years long when the Apple / AT&T exclusivity deal was actually for five years -- thus requiring buyers to re-up with AT&T for three years ( and not , say , T - Mobile ) if they wanted to keep using the iPhone .
Obviously Apple had to respond to these allegations , and in addition to arguing that no one was ever promised an unlocked iPhone after two years , the company 's lawyers repeatedly confirm the existence of the five - year agreement while noting it was publicly reported in USA Today .
It 's extremely black and white -- check these choice quotes from Apple :
" The duration of the exclusive Apple - [ AT&T ] agreement was not ' secret ' either .
The [ plaintiff ] quotes a May 21 , 2007 USA Today article – published over a month before the iPhone 's release – stating , " AT&T has exclusive U.S. distribution rights for five years - an eternity in the go - go cellphone world . "
...
" [ T ] here was widespread disclosure of [ AT&T's ] five - year exclusivity and no suggestion by Apple or anyone else that iPhones would become unlocked after two years ...
Moreover , it is sheer speculation – and illogical – that failing to disclose the five - year exclusivity term would produce monopoly power ... "
Now , this all went down in October of 2008 , and while it 's sort of amazing we had n't seen it earlier , the real question is whether or not the exclusivity deal is still on the books .
( The case is ongoing , but most of the relevant bits have been under seal since 2009 . )
Contracts can be canceled , amended , and breached in many ways , and AT&T 's spotty recent service history plus the explosion of the iPhone and the mobile market in general have given Apple any number of reasons to revisit the deal .
In addition , the two companies obviously hit the negotiating table again to hammer out the iPad 's pricing plans , and there 's no way of knowing whether that deal involves the iPhone as well .
But it 's nice to finally know for certain that AT&T 's initial iPhone exclusivity period was booked until 2012 -- now we just have to see if all this recent chatter means something 's changed .
P.S. - Oh , and this case also covers some other relevant and controversial ground : the plaintiffs argued that Apple exerted illegal monopoly power over the iPhone applications market by barring third - party apps from iPhone OS 1.0 , and the court ruled the argument was valid enough to go forward .
Pretty prescient for 2008 -- we 're guessing Adobe and the Federal Trade Commission are very interested in what 's going down in California 's Northern District right around now .
begging the question
Begging the question is a fallacious form of arguing in which one assumes what one claims to be proving .
An argument is a form of reasoning whereby one gives a reason or reasons in support of some claim .
The reasons are called premises and the claim one tries to support with premises is called the conclusion .
An argument is said to beg the question when its conclusion is assumed to be true by its premises and the premises are used to prove the conclusion .
The classic and simplest form of this fallacy is called arguing in a circle .
But begging the question can sometimes be a bit more complicated than just circular reasoning such as America is the greatest country in the world because there are no countries better than the U.S.A .
warranted assumptions
Before explaining the fallacy of ' begging the question ' in more detail , let me try to explain the difference between warranted and unwarranted assumptions .
An assumption is a claim that is taken for granted , for which no proof is given or argument made .
Every argument makes assumptions .
It would be ridiculously tedious and unreasonable to require every assumption in every argument to be proven before proceeding .
But it is not improper to require that the assumptions of an argument be warranted or , if not , stated as conditional or provisional .
A warranted assumption is an assumption that is either known to be true or is reasonable to accept without requiring an argument to support it .
Since a good argument must be based on true or reasonable assumptions , it follows that arguments based upon false or questionable assumptions are not good arguments .
A questionable assumption is one that is controversial and one for which there is no general consensus among the vast majority of those with the appropriate knowledge or experience .
A claim does not become questionable just be you or anyone else questions it ; otherwise all claims would be questionable .
The contrary of a questionable assumption is not an unquestionable assumption .
There truly are very few claims that are unquestionably true in the sense of not possibly being false .
How do we determine which assumptions of an argument are warranted and which ones are not ?
It should be obvious that many , if not most , statements can be known to be true or false only by shared experience or by studying the particular field in which the statements are made .
If you want to know whether a statement about law is true , you have to study the field of law ; if you want to know whether a particular statement about biology is true , you must study biology .
Many of the claims we run across as we read arguments and many of the claims we make in our own arguments come from experts and authorities in fields of which we are not knowledgeable .
We determine whether or not assumptions are warranted based on our knowledge , experience , the quality of the source of our information and the type of claim made .
( Note :
If we are unable to determine whether the premises of an argument are warranted , we may still be able to go on and evaluate the reasoning of the argument .
That is , we can often determine the relevance and sufficiency of evidence even if we do not know whether the premises are true .
We may conclude our evaluation of an argument sometimes by saying that an argument would be a good one if its premises are true .
Or , we may conclude that an argument is not a good one even if its premises turn out to be true . )
Even if we find that we cannot accept the premises of an argument , we might still find the argument instructive .
The argument may clarify concepts we are fuzzy on , or introduce new material we were ignorant of , or make us aware of material that should be included in an argument on the topic at hand .
The argument may serve as a model of reasoning ; for , the arguer whose premises we cannot accept might be very adept at drawing conclusions from those premises .
Finally , do not consider an assumption unwarranted simply because you do not know whether it is true .
Your lack of knowledge does not make a claim questionable .
Also , do n't assume that just because consensus claims in science are questioned by some people that such questioning implies that the consensus claim is questionable .
Just because , for example , some people believe that vaccines cause autism does not make the claim that vaccines do n't cause autism a questionable claim .
begging the question
If one 's premises entail one 's conclusion , and one 's premises are questionable , one is said to beg the question .
In the following examples , at least one of the premises is a bit different than the conclusion , but that premise is questionable or controversial for the same reasons that one would question the conclusion .
( For more on this broadened use of ' begging the question ' see Kahane , Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric . )
The following argument begs the question .
We know a god exists because we can see the perfect order of creation , an order which demonstrates supernatural intelligence in its design .
The conclusion of this argument is that a god exists .
The premise assumes a creator and designer of the universe exists , which many people would take to mean that a god exists .
In this argument , the arguer should not be granted the assumption that the universe exhibits intelligent design , but should be made to provide support for that questionable claim .
The following argument also begs the question .
Abortion is the unjustified killing of a human being and as such is murder .
Murder is illegal .
So abortion should be illegal .
The conclusion of the argument is entailed in its premises .
If one assumes that abortion is murder then it follows that abortion should be illegal because murder is illegal .
Thus , the arguer is assuming abortion should be illegal ( the conclusion ) by assuming that it is murder .
In this argument , the arguer should not be granted the assumption that abortion is murder , but should be made to provide support for this controversial claim .
The following is another example of begging the question .
Paranormal phenomena exist because I have had experiences that can only be described as paranormal .
The conclusion of this argument is that paranormal phenomena exist .
The premise assumes that the arguer has had paranormal experiences , and therefore assumes that paranormal experiences exist .
The arguer should not be granted the assumption that his experiences were paranormal , but should be made to provide support for this questionable claim .
Here is another example of begging the question .
Past - life memories of children prove that past lives exist because the children could have no other source for their memories besides having lived in the past .
The conclusion of this argument is that past lives exist .
Claiming that the childrens ' memories could have no other source than a past life is to assume that past lives exist .
The arguer should not be granted the assumption that children have had past lives but should be made to support this questionable claim .
Another example of begging the question is provided by Perry Marshall :
1 ) DNA is not merely a molecule with a pattern ; it is a code ... and an information storage mechanism .
2 ) All codes are created by a conscious mind ; there is no natural process known to science that creates coded information .
3 ) Therefore DNA was designed by a mind .
Marshall assumes what he should be proving , namely , that all codes are created by a conscious mind .
Even if it is true that scientists have not found any natural process that creates coded information -- something only one with specific knowledge of the science of natural processes and codes could know -- it is still possible such processes exist .
Here Marshall commits the fallacy of argument to ignorance .
( He also claims that DNA is a language , which is arguable , and that no language has evolved naturally , another questionable claim . )
The two premises in this argument are questionable for the same reason that the conclusion is questionable .
Note for the student of logic who knows about valid argument forms such as modus ponens :
It has sometimes been said that in a sense , all deductively valid arguments beg the question .
However , the above definition of begging the question -- If one 's premises entail one 's conclusion , and one 's premises are questionable , one is said to beg the question -- distinguishes the two somewhat .
In any case , modus ponens , for example , is always a valid form of arguing , even if its premises are false and even if it begs the question .

Advertisement Europe 's Cryosat - 2 spacecraft is set to be sent into orbit to assess the state of ice cover at the Earth 's poles .
The information will help researchers calculate how melting polar ice affects ocean circulation patterns , sea level and global climate .
It will launch atop a converted intercontinental ballistic missile from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan .
Cryosat - 2 is a copy of the spacecraft destroyed in 2005 when its rocket failed five minutes after lift - off .
Member states of the European Space Agency ( Esa ) thought the mission was so important they agreed to rebuild and refly the satellite .
The launch is timed for 1357 GMT ( 1457 BST ; 1557 CEST ) .
" One will be nervous , " said Richard Francis , the Esa Cryosat project manager .
" But it will be so exhilarating when the spacecraft finally makes it into orbit and we get the first contact with it , the thing we did n't get the last time . "
Although built mainly in Germany and France , CryoSat - 2 is led scientifically from the UK by its proposer and principal investigator , Professor Duncan Wingham from University College London .
The spacecraft will measure very precisely the rates of change of sea and land ice in the Arctic and the Antarctic .
A key quest for Cryosat will be to assess the volume of sea ice in the Arctic - something that has been hard to do from space .
Satellites have long been used to track ice extent ( area ) , but calculating the thickness of the marine floes requires the overflying spacecraft to gauge the difference between the top of the ice surface and the top of the water - a relatively simple calculation then gives the overall volume .
HOW TO MEASURE ICE THICKNESS FROM ORBIT Cryosat 's radar has the resolution to see the Arctic 's floes and leads Some 7/8ths of the ice tends to sit below the waterline - the draft
The aim is to measure the freeboard - the ice part above the waterline Knowing this 1/8th figure allows Cryosat to work out sea ice thickness
Radar altimeters flown on missions previous to Cryosat have not had the resolution to do this as precisely as researchers would like , and have not flown far enough to the north to get a full view of the Arctic basin .
Cryosat , however , will see finer detail , and its " vision " will cover virtually all of the Arctic .
Its orbit will leave just a 400 km - wide circle at the pole that is out of sight of its instrument .
The radar has not one , but two antennas .
By listening to the radar echoes with an additional device offset from the first by about a metre , the instrument can sense much better the shape of the ice below , returning more reliable information on slopes and ridges .
DNEPR launch vehicle
The Dnepr is a converted nuclear missile that is launched out of a silo .
Launch is initiated by firing a black powder charge under the rocket .
Expanding gas shoots the vehicle up and out of its air - tight canister .
The ejection system 's base tray and rings are dropped above the silo .
Only when the Dnepr clears the silo are its first - stage motors ignited .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT
This is important for the study of Greenland and Antarctica where past missions have struggled to discern events at the edges of the ice sheets - the very locations where some of the biggest , fastest changes have been taking place .
Current assessments of Antarctic ice show some areas thickening and some areas thinning , with zones of rapid ice loss apparent in the West of the continent .
During the satellite era , Arctic ice extent has declined at a rate of 11.2 % per decade as measured during the warmest summer month , September ; and at 2.6 % per decade in the coldest winter month , March .
Surveys of sea-ice thickness undertaken by submarines suggest ice draft may have reduced by about 40 % compared with the 1960s and 1970s .
Interestingly , cold temperatures and strong winds saw the area of Arctic Ocean covered in ice this winter reach near - " normal " levels .
The complexity of behaviour has proven very difficult to model .
" None of the changes that you see [ in the Arctic and the Antarctic ] are either well modelled , in the case of the Arctic , or modelled at all in the case of the Antarctic , " explained Professor Wingham .
" We have poor predictive capability in the Arctic and more or less no predictive capability in the Antarctic .
" If we wish to know about what is happening in the poles then we have to continue flying these satellites . "
Cryosat - 2 could have been launched about a year ago , but there is a dearth of rockets in the class capable of putting the 720 kg spacecraft in orbit .

The Dnepr is a modified SS18 ICBM released for civilian operation under the terms of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty .
Following lift - off from Baikonur , the rocket will fly south , dropping its first stage over Turkmenistan and its second stage over the Indian Ocean .
Esa's " mission control " in Darmstadt , Germany , will hope to pick up the satellite via a tracking station in Malindi , Kenya , shortly after separation from the Denpr 's third stage , about 17 minutes into the flight .
If for some reason Malindi misses Cryosat , there is a second opportunity to make contact using the Norwegian Troll tracking station in Antarctica 31 minutes after launch .
Cryosat - 2 is part of Esa's Earth Explorer programme - seven spacecraft that will do innovative science obtaining data on issues of pressing environmental concern .
The first in the series , Goce ( Gravity Field and Steady - State Ocean Circulation ) , was launched in March last year .
The second , the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity ( Smos ) spacecraft , was launched last November .

Well I ’ll be damned .
Apple released iPhone OS 4.0 Beta 4 earlier today and it was n’t long before developers found the strongest evidence yet that tethering for US based iPhone customers may very well happen sooner than later .
Tethering , of course , is n’t new to the iPhone OS and was first introduced back when Apple released iPhone OS 3.0 in June of 2009 .
Enabling the feature , however , is carrier and phone specific , and though AT&T kept on promising that tethering support would be coming soon , those promises went unfulfilled time and time again .
Frustratingly , AT&T currently supports tethering for smartphones aside from the iPhone .
But with the latest iPhone OS screenshot specifically mentioning tethering and AT&T in the same breath , we can only hope that this is n’t one big tease and that a tethering option will finally become a reality for iPhone users here in the US .
With this year ’s WWDC scheduled to kick off on June 7 , an announcement regarding AT&T tethering support may very well be on the agenda during Steve Jobs ’ keynote .

NAM Y. HUH / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Gary Bettman addresses the media during a news conference today in Chiicago .
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman was preaching more patience for Winnipeg at his annual state - of - the - league press conference today at the Stanley Cup final in Chicago .
This time , Bettman not only identified Mark Chipman and David Thomson , the True North Sports and Entertainment partners , but admitted for the first time they had submitted a " bona fide " offer for the ailing Phoenix Coyotes .
The NHL had referred to that offer anonymously in the deal it signed last week with the City of Glendale that keeps the team in the Arizona desert for at least one more season .
That arrangement covers up to US $ 25 million of cash losses in operating the team next season .
The league bought the team out of U.S. bankruptcy court last fall .

BRYKSA / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS ARCHIVES MTS Centre
" There was also a lot of speculation , and I ’ll address it now , about what would have happened if the City of Glendale did n’t step up as they were prepared to do to support the franchise for next season , " Bettman said today .
" We would have been forced ; we would have had no choice but to move it .
" There has been a lot of speculation about Winnipeg .
Winnipeg did make a bona fide offer .
We never concluded a deal .
That offer was made by Mark Chipman and David Thomson as partners in True North and they ’re very comfortable with the process .
They understood that the likelihood was that the team was going to be remaining in Phoenix .
They wanted us to know of their interest and they have told us that they are prepared to be patient . "
The commissioner also said something that a lot of people in the hockey world either were n’t aware of , or did n’t believe — that the 15,003 - seat MTS Centre is an NHL building .
He was actually being questioned on a interest in another franchise in southern Ontario and received a follow - up question : " There does n’t seem to be NHL buildings in either Quebec or Winnipeg at this stage ... "
The commissioner interrupted the question : " Winnipeg , I believe , has an NHL building , and in Quebec they ’re talking about building one . "
True North spokesman Scott Brown said today that there would be no comment on Bettman ’s remarks about the offer for the Coyotes .
" We ’re pleased to hear the commissioner confirm what we ’ve held since we constructed the building back in 2004 , that MTS Centre meets NHL standards , " Brown added .
Bettman was also asked if he had a timeline in mind for True North ’s offer to move the Coyotes .
" I ’m not going to put a timeline on it because I do not want to raise expectations , " Bettman said .

BBC News , Moscow
Pavel Astakhov said Russia wanted clear guarantees Russia and the US have held talks in Moscow over the adoption of Russian orphans by American families , which were suspended this month .
Russia 's ombudsman for child rights told the BBC a draft treaty that would ensure the safety of adopted children would be handed to US officials .
He said Russia would not allow adoptions until the treaty was signed .
The tough new stance comes after a US woman sent a seven - year - old adopted orphan back to Russia unaccompanied .
He arrived at Moscow airport earlier this month carrying a note from the woman in Tennessee who was supposed to be his new mother , saying she did not want him .
Growing anger The Russian government described this case as " a monstrous deed " and " the last straw " .
We want the right to go to the US and monitor the situation where our children live
Pavel Astakhov
Russian ombudsman for child rights
There had already been growing anger about the number of Russian children who had been killed by their American parents or died as a result of neglect , since foreign adoptions began in the mid-1990s .
According to officials in Moscow , the number of those who have died is 16 .
" We want the right to go to the US and monitor the situation where our children live , " said the ombudsman , Pavel Astakhov .
This would include allowing officials from Russia 's social services as well as Russian diplomats based in the US to enter the homes of families who have adopted orphans .
A spokesman for the US embassy in Moscow refused to comment on whether the US government would accept the new conditions being demanded by the Russian authorities before adoptions can resume .
But speaking after Thursday 's talks the head of the US delegation , deputy assistant secretary for consular affairs Michael Kirby , said the meeting had been " fruitful " .
" We agree we want to do the best for the children and we will meet again on 12 May , " he said .
American families waiting According to the United Nations Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) , there are more than 700,000 children in Russia who are either orphans or do not live with their biological parents .
It 's very emotional , your hope is there and you put your heart into it
Mary Shultz
Most are being looked after by relatives , but the latest official figures show that 140,000 children are currently in orphanages waiting to be adopted either by Russian families or foreigners .
A large proportion do go abroad , with the US taking the largest number .
The suspension of adoptions to the US , which began two weeks ago , is reported to be affecting 3,000 American families .
" No matter where you are in the process [ of adopting ] , it 's heart - breaking , " says Mary Shultz , who was in Moscow this week trying to finalise the adoption of her second Russian child so she can take him back home to Wisconsin .
" It 's very emotional , your hope is there and you put your heart into it it 's very difficult . "
She still believes she will be able to collect a three - year - old boy from his orphanage when she returns to Russia next month .
But officials insist all cases have now been put on hold until the agreement with the US is signed .
Prospective parents and Unicef are concerned this will be very traumatic for the children involved , who are expecting to leave their orphanages and become part of a new family .
Russian officials say the negotiations for a new treaty could take anything up to six months to complete .
They are also demanding that American families that adopt Russian children maintain the children 's Russian language , culture and traditions .
If agreement is not reached , Mr Astakhov has warned that the Russian parliament could change the law to ban all foreign adoptions .

What are these ?

As both an electrical engineer and professional software developer , I 'd like to start an open source hardware movement similar to the open source software movement that has currently been happening .
I 've seen ideas similar to this from other people before , although not well thought out nor articulated correctly , and definitely not the same thoughts I have about the subject .
This ( somewhat long ) post is a summary of my ideas , hoping to get some feedback from other people .
THE TOOL IS THE ISSUE
Open source software has been around for awhile .
We 've all seen it : Linux is the biggest example .
Why does open source software exist ?
Because it is easily copied , reproducible , and editable almost for free , and because many software developers like have a hand in it .
Drop a couple hundred to thousands of dollars buying a computer , and anybody with the knowledge to do so could be running and developing open source software .
A computer is , essentially , the tool to develop and use open source software .
Open source hardware obviously has different requirements .
You can't just download and compile a physical circuit .
The key issue is this : users lack a tool to do develop open source hardware .
I believe that , just as a computer is the physical tool to develop open source software , a PCB router would be the first key to developing open source hardware .
CAN'T JUMP TO IC'S AT FIRST
Many people believe that open source hardware has to be all about integrated circuits ( IC's ) on chips .
It can not start out this way , simply because developing a single IC 's costs hundreds of thousands of dollars , plus the cost of a manufacturing plant and everybody 's time involved .
Instead , open source hardware developers and users should rely on existing IC 's and develop full working circuits using a home - built ( read : cheap ) or inexpensively purchased circuit fabrication tool ( note that you can get free samples of just about any IC shipped to you from almost any IC manufacturer online - and they do a good job reacting to the market ) .
FPGA's and simple microcontrollers can do a fine job of emulating many ( any ? ) IC packages .
REPRODUCIBILITY OF HARDWARE
Now that the whole IC issue is out of the way , back to the PCB router .
A tool like a router would be critical to developing hardware - and not just for circuitry ( although the subject I 'm focused on is the circuitry design - this can also be to do woodworking , plastic shaping , aluminum cutting , etc. ) .
Why ?
Because a PCB router is * reproducible * .
Once you have one made , it can make another one , more accurate and stronger .
Once you have version 2 made , it can produce version 3 - even more accurately .
You can make these desktop PCB routers for your friends , given that somebody supplies you with the materials ( and possible monetary compensation for your time ) .
PCB routers normally cost thousands of dollars .
Again , ask yourself , why is this ?
Because they are made for industry - they 're made for people who throw around thousands of dollars at a time and require precision tools for mass production .
These things are souped up with vacuums and all kinds of unnecessary gadgets that would n't be needed in a home or school environment .
I 've already built a PCB router myself from scratch using a couple broken printers and a broken scanner , and from my experience , it should cost no more than a new printer ( although I built my version 1.0 for $ 12 - the cost of a unipolar stepper motor and its driver when my bipolar motor got shot ) .
It would be beneficial for people who are into this stuff to have PCB routers on their desk like they do printers .
And for those of you who do n't know how it works , you get a double - sided copper plated board at RadioShack , stick it in the machine , and hitting a Print button on some circuit layout software .
Viola - the circuit layout is etched into the board .
OBTAINING A PCB ROUTER
The users can get a desktop PCB router by either
1 ) Downloading open source plans for the router and building it himself .
2 ) Having his / her friend who already built one build a replicate .
3 ) Buying an inexpensive one developed by someone in the open source hardware community .
Again , once the user as a single PCB router , depending on how much money they put into their tool ( just like people put more money into souping up their computers ) they too can have a really souped up router .
I 'm planning on making my version 2.0 router not only develop circuit boards but also be strong enough to carve three - dimensional surfaces on aluminum and plastic housings ( cases for my projects ) .
I 'm actually using my first , cheap version of the PCB router to build this more powerful second version .
OPEN SOURCE CIRCUIT DEVELOPMENT
As for circuit development , projects can be created and people can collaborate online .
Because software is needed to develop , simulate , and layout circuitry , the open source software community could get involved to develop the necessary programs .
In this case , hardware development relies on the software available - not vice versa as it used to be .
When a user wants a new circuit , he / she can download the plans online , load it up in the open source software , alter it to his standards and then hit print .
The PCB router goes to work for a minute , carves out the circuit on the board , and then it's up to the user to populate the board with the necessary components using on - screen schematics , pictures , or instructions .
That 's our way of " compiling " the project .
If changes are made , the project can be re-submitted to the project server , with a description of the changes , for others to view and download .
The online project server would be responsible for remember all the variants of the circuitry so users can decide what type of functionality they want to download .
It does n't have to stop there though - because the router can reproduce itself ( and can , itself , be a living open source project ) , it has the capability of evolving into more advanced tools that may not require users to populate the board themselves .
Give the device the right parts and have it populate for you .
A device like this , of course , would be developed by the open source hardware community and fabricated using the " deprecated " router .
One version builds the next .
I believe that it is also possible to write software for kiddie hackers to develop both * analog * and digital circuitry ( not just VHDL or Verilog ) by communicating simply the constraints of such a circuit to the computer , and having a neural network , swarm intelligence , distributed computing , etc. produce a working circuit - but I 'll save that complete thought for another day .
CONCLUSION
Open source hardware is feasible , reproducible , and implementable so long as users develop or get a hold of a tool to develop open source hardware .
That tool is essentially a router , which can evolve , reproduce , as well as build other projects .
Open source hardware must be backed by the open source software community to develop the tools necessary for building , testing , and laying out circuitry to be printed on the PCB router .
In the future , we should ( and will ) be able to download projects for whatever you need online , and print those electronics for use in your own home .
Sorry for writing a huge essay here .
Hope nobody mods this idea down for being so long .. :)
Our BFFs over at Joystiq have what seems to be a pretty solid line on PSN + , with multiple sources verifying features mostly in line with what was gleaned from that survey last year .
Lucky for us , most of the features seem to have to do with giving new features to paying users , instead of taking away functionality from the existing free service .
Notables include exclusive DLC , PSP Minis , and PSone Classics , " first hour " demo access , Sony Protection Plan service , and cross - game voice chat .
The sources seem to be less clear on pricing for all these goodies , but someone tossed out a speculative $ 9.99 .
What everyone does seem to agree on is that we should be seeing this announced in full at Sony 's E3 media briefing a few weeks from now , so start stashing those Hamiltons !

Hellooo there !
It 's been ages since I 've done a blog , so hopefully you 'll enjoy this .
Below is a link to something I 've just made .
I do luv a good horror story , especially an audio one ( saves on reading )
So , just for you , is an old Horror Radio Show / Play entitled .
And to add that extra bit of awesomeness , I 've also added in old advertisments , trailers and even a song in the right places .
The story is pretty average to be honest , it 's about a doctor who resurrects a man from the dead .
Very much like , or , or any of the other millions of films with the same plot !
But this is OLD - SCHOOL and it just adds to the creepiness I think .
Plus it 's quite funny too - especially the adverts .
So , click on the link , download the file , turn of the lights and snuggle up to Mr. Snugums your teddy bear , as you go on a journey back in time and listen to a great little horror radio play .
BTW - I know that the adverts / songs / story / etc do not come from the same time .
I was n't going for accuracy here , but mood and tone .
ENJOY !
Kyle

Hello and welcome !
We have gathered here to celebrate politics in a special way .
All those beautiful puns brought to us by the election coverage and , of course , the people involved , have already sparked the imagination of most of us .
This is the place to show your ideas to a ( hopefully ) big audience .
You want to read what David Cameron and Nick Clegg did when they were on holiday in Malta ?
Ask for it !
You are looking for inspiration and " OMG , someone asked for a Food !
AU which plays in a supermarket at night , everyone is turned into a food item and they have a secret party " , which you think is perfect ?
Write it !
You could n't help yourself and wrote the adventures of Gordon " Grumpy " Brown and his six brothers ?
Post it here !
It 's an anonymous meme , which means you will either have to log out to post or you can use the " anonymous " - option when commenting .
Anything goes !

I live in Nashville now ; I have for a long time .
I started watching the rain on Saturday morning .
It was coming down so hard it looked white .
My husband and I stood at the front door with our very old dog and decided she ’d have to wait until things eased up .
But they did n’t ease up .
We canceled our plans for the day .
Finally I put on my flip - flops , shorts and raincoat and took the dog out .
I went down the street to walk my mother ’s dog , then the dog of a friend who lives on a hill around the corner .
The water was now up to my ankles , but it was mesmerizing , all that thunder and lightning .
I went to see how high the nearby creek was .
It was raging like an angry little river .
All night long the tornado sirens wailed , which in the South is a sound you get used to , like cicadas .
The next morning when I again went to walk my mother ’s dog , the water was up to my knees at points and I could barely see through the rain .
My husband went off to walk our friend ’s dog , but he could n’t make it there on foot .
He picked me up in the car and we drove for 15 minutes , looping over higher streets to make it to her house , just a block away .
Yesterday ’s angry creek was now a torrent , leaping over the road and through the houses beside it .
It would take just the slightest error in judgment to be swept away  though maybe fording floodwater to carry small dogs to higher ground to relieve themselves could also be called an error in judgment .
Three years ago we bought a small piece of land along the Cumberland , just off River Road on the way to Ashland City , not far from where I had lived as a child .
We keep meaning to build a little house there , a single room with a wide porch where we might spend quiet weekends .
We go out there some evenings to have a picnic or paddle around in a canoe .
We like to visit with our neighbors .
A view of a NASA - provided Short Radius Centrifuge at UTMB in Galveston is reminiscent of similar equipment from 40 years ago when astronauts were training for the initial giant leap to the Moon .
New plans for artificial gravity tests in space usingcentrifuges may hold the key to helping future astronauts ward off thedebilitating loss of muscle and bone due to weightlessness on long missions toasteroids or the moon under NASA 's revised space exploration plan .
The newNASA budget proposed by President Obama not only setssights on long - duration missions , but also extends the lifetime of the International Space Station .
Upgrades for the space station " could includea centrifuge to support research into human physiology , " according to a summaryby the Office of Management and Budget .
Space station residents currently rely upon differentexercises to keep themselves fit for the eventual return to Earth .
But a spinning centrifuge device could create artificial gravity , whichsimulates the gravitational tug a planet , like Earth , has .
The giant spinningdevice will give astronauts a healthy break from the weightlessness of space .
" You can try to treat each of the effects ofweightlessness system by system , with certain pills for bone loss and certainexercise regimens for the muscles , " said Laurence Young , an aeronauticsand astronautics engineer at MIT in Cambridge , Mass .
" Or you can treat theroot cause of weightlessness by restoring gravity . "
NASA 's earlier focus on sending astronauts back to themoon meant shorter - duration spaceflight and less urgency to develop artificialgravity .
The U.S. space agency focused on traditional countermeasures , such as modifyingsquats or other exercises to counteract bone and muscle loss , according toJustin Kaderka , an artificial gravity researcher working with Young at MIT .
Now the prospect of longer missions to more distantdestinations has once again raised the appeal , if not necessity , of artificialgravity .
Recreating Earth gravity
One of Young 's Japanese colleagues filed a proposal withthe Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency months ago to launch a human centrifugeto the International Space Station .
The device could ideally take up thediameter of a space station module with a radius as wide as 6.6 feet ( 2meters ) .
Astronauts would lie down on or strap themselves to oneend of the centrifuge arm or frame , and experience artificial gravity while thedevice spins .
A rider could also provide the human power to spin the centrifugeby pedaling bicycle - style .
" If you have two arms that 'd work nicely , " Kaderka told SPACE.com .
" Cycling would give an aerobic workout , and the other person not cycling could do resistance exercises like squats orpresses . "
The riders on a two - arm centrifuge could then switch offon exercises and on powering the device .
A vibration isolator would absorb anyresidual vibrations that might otherwise disturb the rest of the space station , according to the proposal .
Spin me right round
Earth experiments suggest that artificial gravity worksjust as well as traditional countermeasures to prevent long - term weightlessnessfrom affecting human cardiovascular health , Kaderka said .
He drew thatconclusion after reviewing 75 experiments done over the past 40 years , as hisMIT master 's thesis .
But Kaderka also found that more research is needed toassess whether artificial gravity can work its wonders upon muscle and bone .
That 's partly because researchers must resort to expensive , long - term bed - reststudies to really see the effectson muscle and bone .
One human centrifuge did go into space with the STS - 90 " Neurolab " mission aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1998 .
But theastronauts spent barely an hour in total testing out the centrifuge during the 16 - day mission , which still left the effectiveness of artificial gravity opento question .
" It 'd be amazing to get hard data on how artificialgravity is an effective countermeasure in space , " Kadera said .
Artificial gravity research has suffered in the latterhalf of the past decade because of NASA 's budget issues and earlier focus onreturning astronauts to the moon .
No funded centrifuge studies on human physiologycurrently exist in the United States or among most of its international spacepartners , Kaderka noted .
Taking the next step
NASA shut down its artificial gravity studies at the Johnson Space Center in Houston several years ago ?
a decision that resulted in much lost momentumfor researchers , according to Young .
But both he and Kaderka seemed optimisticthat the space agency 's new direction would lead to resurgence in artificialgravity work .
Getting a centrifuge up to the space station would domuch more than help answer the question of artificial gravity 's effectivenessin space , or putting renewed interest in complementary Earth experiments .
Itwould also allow researchers to start fine - tuning the exact conditions neededto for artificial gravity to work .
" One of the hopes is to have the [ centrifuge ] protocoldown to within an hour or so of being spun , because that 's roughly how much theastronauts spend doing exercise , " Kaderka explained .
Other questions include debate over how fast should thecentrifuge spin , setting the ideal artificial gravity level , as well as howmuch time astronauts will need to spend aboard the centrifuge to see itsbenefits .
Then there are also biomedical questions about whether astronautsencounter problems with dizzinessor vertigo , and whether the centrifuge is both effective andenjoyable .
Of course , researchers can begin tackling some of thosequestions if they can get renewed NASA funding for Earth experiments as well .
Otherwise they could be in for a long wait until they see a centrifuge launchto the space station .
" Hopefully we wo n't have to wait as long as havingdata come back from a space station centrifuge , " Kaderka said .
Leinster ( 3 ) 16
Try : Kearney Cons : Sexton Pens : Sexton 3
Munster ( 3 ) 3
Pen : O'Gara Drop - goal : O'Gara Cian Healy ( centre ) get support from Malcolm O'Kelly as Paul Warwick attempts to halt the Leinster prop
Leinster set up a Magners League final against the Ospreys by beating Munster in a bruising contest at the RDS .
Jonathan Sexton kicked Leinster ahead in a frantic first half before Ronan O'Gara levelled before the break .
O'Gara edged the defending champions into the lead after the restart but Sexton 's superb exchange of passes set up Rob Kearney for the decisive try .
Sexton added six more points and despite late pressure , Munster were unable to muster a scoring response .
The match started at a ferocious pace and the frantic nature of the proceedings continued for the remainder of the first half .
Sexton , back after a month out because of a broken jaw , missed an early wind - assisted opportunity for Leinster before Keith Earls threatened the home team 's defence at the other end with a surging run .
Big hits were the order of the day in the opening minutes but Shane Horgan over - stepped the mark on 12 minutes with a dangerous tackle on Niall Ronan which resulted in the Leinster wing being sin-binned .
Despite temporarily being a man down , Leinster edged ahead six minutes later as Sexton slotted a penalty .
Inevitably , Munster responded quickly as the lively Nick Williams threatened the Leinster line and Paul Warwick hit the woodwork with an attempted drop - goal after the ball had been recycled .
Munster did level on 29 minutes as O'Gara judged the wind expertly to kick a penalty .
606 : DEBATE
Munster look vulnerable with an ageing pack and a lack of fire - power out wide

The score remained a 3 - 3 at the break to leave the match perfectly poised for the second period .
Munster edged ahead 10 seconds after the resumption as O'Gara slotted a long - range drop - goal after Malcolm O'Kelly had failed to gather the fly - half 's restart .
But the score only served to stir the Leinster backs to produce the crucial moment of the match three minutes later .
The score was all about Sexton 's attack - minded instincts as the Leinster fly - half exchanged passes with Gordon D'Arcy in the Munster 22 before releasing Kearney to score in the corner .
Sexton added the difficult conversion and when he kicked another penalty on 50 minutes , Leinster were suddenly 13 - 6 ahead .
In addition to Leinster 's silky play behind the scrum , Jamie Heaslip was inspiring his pack with a series of crucial interventions - including a couple of dangerous charges into opposition territory .
Leinster looked unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty try three minutes later as Tomas O'Leary 's high challenge on Cian Healy stopped a certain touchdown .
Sexton kicked the three points but Nigel Owens ' decision not even to yellow card O'Leary appeared highly questionable .
Munster produced a five - minute period of sustained pressure after the hour mark but Leinster held firm to register their fourth straight win over their Irish rivals .
O'Gara missed a difficult chance to cut Leinster 's lead but the comeback never really looked on as Michael Cheika 's side set up a decider against the Ospreys at the RDS on 29 May ( 1830 BST ) .

The activist group Color of Change started a campaign last year to contact Glenn Beck ’s sponsors after Glenn Beck said on the air that President Obama was a racist and had a deep - seated hatred of white people .
That effort has been very successful .
According to Stop Beck , 102 sponsors have pulled out of Glenn Beck ’s show .
The effort has been so successful , in fact , that Beck ’s show has no sponsors when it airs in the U.K .
During the last week and a half , Glenn Beck lost his 100th , 101st and 102nd sponsors .
A full list of all 102 sponsors that dropped Mr. Beck ( or Fox News as a whole ) can be found here .
Please note that this total includes sponsors that have dropped him both United States and / or in the United Kingdom .
It seems like our efforts are having an effect …
Glenn Beck ’s show in the United Kingdom has not run any commercials during the past three days ( Tues - Thurs ) .
Glenn Beck ’s show in the UK used to run commercials .
The shows that come on before and after Glenn Beck still run commercials .
But , for the past three days , Mr. Beck has n’t had any sponsors in the U.K .
During the commercial break , instead of running ads , they cut away to Sky News updates or the weather .
Perhaps they ’re having trouble finding sponsors willing to subsidize Glenn Beck ’s misinformation , vitriol , sexism and race - baiting ?
An intimate Facebook affair between a single man , 25 - year old Awais Akram , and a married woman , 24 - year old businesswoman Sadia Khatoon resulted in a vicious “ honor ” revenge attack using sulphuric acid that turned Awais into a zombie .
The revenge was planned by Sadia ’s husband , 32 - year old Shakeel Abassi .
The Old Bailey heard when Ms Khatoon ’s husband Shakeel Abassi found out about the online conversations , he got his 24 - year - old wife to lure the victim out of his flat , where concentrated sulphuric acid was poured over his head .
The jury was told that during the attack the men received instructions from Mr Abassi , 32 , who was in a hotel room near Heathrow with his wife .
Ms Khatoon and her husband later disappeared in Pakistan and detectives said they now feared for her safety .
Source : news.bbc.co.uk
The attack involved Sadia ’s brother Mohammed Vakas and cousin Mohammed Adeel who recruited a 16 - year - old youth – all three have been found guilty .
Mrs Khatoon , then aged 23 , helped him find a flat in Leytonstone when he arrived in East London .
But their relationship became known to her family , including her husband Shakeel Abassi .
Mr Akram was beaten to the ground , stabbed and then doused with sulphuric acid .
He was left in agony , to get help from nearby householders who heard his screams .
Source : www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk
Check out the computer generated pictures of Awais Akram –
He suffered 47 % burns during the attack in which he was also beaten and stabbed .
Mr Akram was also left blind in his right eye , suffered facial fractures and had to have both ears amputated .
Prosecutor David Markham said : “ A witness was to see the victim as he begged for help , with his clothes in tatters and literally falling off him from the acid and blood coming from his nose and eyes and covering his bare chest .
“ The witness told police the figure looked like a cross between a zombie from a horror movie and the Incredible Hulk . ”
Source : news.bbc.co.uk
It seems like Sadia was also jealous as Awais was planning to fly to Pakistan to get married .
Speaking about the relationship , Mr Akram said they ended up seeing each other nearly every day and , although it did not go beyond kisses and touching , it was clear to him she “ did want to have sexual relations ” .
Ms Khatoon was also jealous about his plans to go to Pakistan to get married but the wedding went ahead in May .
Source : news.bbc.co.uk
Makes you wonder if these men involved in the “ honor ” revenge attack are actually animals ?
I understand the husband getting pissed off by the event , but woman ’s brother and niece involvement is just plain stupid .
Exhibit A from a WaPo online chat :
Boston , Mass . :
Here is my question for the Tea Party .
What are your solutions to today 's problems ?
For example , I hear the word socialism used alot and government getting too big .
But then what would you cut ?
Or what would the Tea Party members have done about the financial crisis from 2008 ?
I assume that they would not vote to bailout the banks , but what would they do if the biggest banks in the world go under ?
Judson Phillips : First , cut taxes to increase economic growth .
That works everytime .
Second , let 's go through the entire federal budget and eliminate programs that are consumed by waste , fraud or abuse .
Start eliminating them .
Seriously ?
I mean : seriously ?
We 're talking about a debt larger than we 've ever contemplated outside of the Second World War and he 's talking about eliminating " waste " ?
And I thought Glenn Reynolds was dishonest ...
Of course , we later find out that defense is off the table .
But he does mention entitlements , when challenged further :
Judson Phillips : Let 's start with entitlement programs .
They are the biggest source of out of control spending .
Then let 's go to congressional pork programs .
Pork is a teensy part of the problem .
He does later argue that social security disability checks are the source of the spending problem .
Yep : seriously , that 's his one actual specific recommendation , apart from cutting taxes further !
Yes , this tea-partier is still drinking the Laffer curve Kool - Aid .
What does he specifically propose for entitlement cuts that come close to the scale of the problem ?
Nada .
And he does n't even have the excuse of being a pathetic politician trying to get elected .
He 's not running for office ; he 's heading up a protest movement against government spending - and he yet he can't offer any serious specifics on what he'd cut that would solve the problem .
In fact , he barely seems to have thought about the actual fiscal choices before us for a split second .
Taxes ?
Pure denial of reality :
Washington , D.C. : Judson --
Are you willing to admit that taxes have actually gone down for the vast majority of Americans under President Obama ?
Judson Phillips : No
Of course not .
And the past has to be airbrushed as well :
Alexandria , Va. :
Are you willing to admit that marginal tax rates went up for the majority of Americans during the Reagan administration ?
Do you know the difference between average and marginal tax rates ?
Could you answer a simple econ 101 questions regarding the impact of progressive taxation on the labor - leisure choice ?
Judson Phillips : No .
If I have contempt for these non-arguments , it is because I retain some smidgen of a belief in honest politics and small government .
These people are thoroughgoing frauds - a bunch of right - wing victim - mongers whining about something they have no actual ideas about confronting .
They are not something new .
They are the decaying stench of the Republican corpse .
If they get into power somehow , it will be Weekend At Bernie 's for conservatism .

As of June 1st , 2010 , at least 20 million gallons ( 75.7 million liters ) of oil has spilled into the Gulf of Mexico .
This has been a complete and utter disaster for BP in every sense .
The timing , the location ( i.e. , it did n’t occur on the borders of a developing nation ) , it is all bad for BP right now .
Everyone is chiming in and it wo n’t stop until the leak does .
Greenpeace UK has just launched a campaign / contest urging people to ‘ rebrand ’ the BP logo and show that they are n’t ‘ Beyond Petroleum ’ as their slogan suggests .
While entries are open until the end of June there have already been over 300 to date !
I ’ve culled 25 of the more interesting submissions below .
( see entire collection here )
THE ORIGINAL
From BP Corporate : Our visual identity reflects the revolutionary quality of our business .
Our logo was launched in 2000 , and was designed as a dramatic break with tradition .
It is unlike any other energy identity , and symbolises a number of things – from the living , organic form of a sunflower to the greatest source of energy … the sun itself .
The colours of the ‘ Helios ’ – named after the Greek god of the sun – suggest heat , light and nature .
It is also a pattern of interlocking shapes : like BP , a single entity created by many different parts working as one .
This was particularly relevant , as the new brand was launched after a series of mergers and acquisitions .
It united all the heritage companies and employees that now make up BP and its global brand .
THE BP ‘ REBRAND ’

If you enjoyed this article , the Sifter highly recommends : 25 HILARIOUS ILLUSTRATIONS BY GLENNZ
From the NPD press release issued this morning :
First quarter 2010 information from
The NPD Group 's Mobile Phone Track reveals a shift in the smartphone market , as Android OS edged out Apple 's OS for the number - two position behind RIM NPD 's wireless market research reveals that based on unit sales to consumers last quarter the Android operating system moved into second position at 28 percent behind RIM's OS ( 36 percent ) and ahead of Apple 's OS ( 21 percent ) .
To be explicit , for the first quarter of 2010 , Android was sold on 28 per cent of smartphones in the United States .
This puts its sales directly between the reigning Blackberry OS and the former “ second place ” iPhone OS .
This is very impressive in its own right and I think the Android platform ought to be congratulated for its performance .
Better still , it lights a major fire under Apple 's ass , and the old saying comes to mind : companies compete , customers win .
So if nothing else , this should mean better products no matter what platform you choose to support .
It is important to note , however , raw sales data does not equal exact market share .
Android is clearly trending upward , and if this trend continues it will naturally chisel away at Apple and RIM 's OS market share .
A Dose of Zealotry
As with any news even remotely belittling Apple , it is immediately treated as libel by some of the pro-Apple press ( the zealots , while few , are certainly vociferous ) .
Here 's one choice gem from the MacStories ' reaction to NPD 's press release :
Suggesting that Android holds 28 % of the smartphone market compared to the iPhone ’s measly 21 % , things are looking great for Google and friends right ?
Well considering the iPhone is only on one carrier in the United States ( and produced by a single manufacturer ) , compared to the four big carriers Android is on and multiple manufacturers , why has n’t Android captivated more than 30 % of the marketplace ?
Heck , they should be up there with RIM by now if their phones were really that good .
I personally do n’t think the numbers are all that impressive ( if we pretend for a moment that NPD ’s numbers are actually reliable ) .
Let ’s look at the Android phone world as a whole – we have dozens of devices out there , compared to Apple ’s main three ( 3GS , 3G , and 2G ) .
NPD 's market research ( like many other firms ) is not an exact science , as device manufacturers rarely reveal exact sales data , and it is often difficult to gage actual market share information ( browsing usage is one metric , and Apple does lead in this metric ) .
But NPD 's data is generally quite highly regarded among market research firms .
Were Apple leading in the survey , would MacStories also be discrediting the data ?
So while NPD does not offer precise - down - to - the - sale data , they are quite competent at measuring general trends in the market .
The argument against NPD 's data is that they are somehow less valid because Android phones are offered on more carriers and there are more devices than iPhone devices for sale in the US .
It is completely true Android OS is available on more carriers in the US than iPhone , but this hardly undermines the data .
It 's just a fact , whether it seems fair or not to the zealots .
Cold Shower
While Android OS is becoming great competition for iPhone OS I hardly think this is the beginning of any doom for Apple 's platform .
There are some facts to remember when considering this :
There are new iPhones every June or July , and this trend has repeated for the last few years .
Savvy consumers ( those who understand the difference between iPhone OS and Android , at least ) are well aware of this schedule , and as a result iPhone sales have generally slowed down in the months before a new device is unveiled ( * ahem * properly ) .
Apple already has a burgeoning developer community with over 200 000 applications in their App Store already .
Android 's marketplace has continued to make strides and has also been expanding rapidly , but not at the same growth - rate of the App Store .
Platform strength is extremely important ( * cf. * Windows in the 1990s ) .
Tangential to no .
2 , applications developed for an iPhone work exactly the same on any current iPhone ever sold , and any iPod touch ever sold .
There are something like 100M of them worldwide .
While that not be the market leader , consider the same application will run identically on the devices .
Aside from the cellular chip in the iPhones , iPod touches are essentially the same device .
There is no consideration given as to whether the device will have a physical or onscreen keyboard , or the screen size , or whether the device will have Maps built in , or whether location functionality is available .
All iPhone OS devices are guaranteed to have these capabilities .
Fourth , and possibly Apple 's secret weapon of strengthening the iPhone OS platform is the iPod touch ( and to a lesser degree , the iPad ) .
iPod touch is just an iPhone without a cellular contract , which makes it irresistible to many more people .
And more people buy more apps .
And more app sales attract more developers .
And more developers make for a stronger platform .
There is no Android equivalent to the iPod touch ; there is no way to get the Android platform without purchasing a phone ( which usually means a contract ) .
If I had to guess the reason of Android 's current success in the United States , it would simply be that the devices are available on networks other than AT&T , which has been the chagrin of many american iPhone users over the past years .
I have the feeling many Android users on Verizon are there for the network , and not the phone .
Either way , I think it 's important for Apple to remove abysmal network performance of AT&T as a reason for not buying an iPhone in the United States .
PADRE ISLAND NATIONAL SEASHORE , Tex. —
It is nesting season here , and just offshore , Kemp ’s ridley sea turtle No. 15 circles in the water before dragging herself onto the sand to lay another clutch of eggs .
The sea turtle , affectionately nicknamed Thelma by a National Park Service employee , has already beaten some terrible odds .
Still in the egg , she was airlifted here from Mexico in the years after the 1979 blowout of the Ixtoc 1 rig , which spilled millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and covered the turtles ’ primary nesting place .
Now Thelma and others of her species are being monitored closely by worried scientists as another major oil disaster threatens their habitat .
Federal officials said Tuesday that since April 30 , 10 days after the accident on the Deepwater Horizon , they have recorded 156 sea turtle deaths ; most of the turtles were Kemp ’s ridleys .
And though they cannot say for sure that the oil was responsible , the number is far higher than usual for this time of year , the officials said .
The Deepwater Horizon spill menaces a wide variety of marine life , from dolphins to blue crabs .
On Tuesday , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expanded a fishing ban in the gulf because of the spreading oil .
But of the endangered marine species that frequent gulf waters , only the Kemp ’s ridley relies on the region as its sole breeding ground .
An estimated 50,000 marchers joined one of the biggest protests in Auckland for decades today , to give the Government a firm message to stay away from mining on conservation land .
Marchers left the bottom of Queen
St about 11 am and by the time the first of them arrived at Myers Park , just below Karangahape Rd , they were still leaving the bottom of Queen St .
The protest blocked most of Queen
St for at least an hour , but it showed how passionate New Zealanders were about protecting conservation land from mining , said Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei .
The Government has announced plans to open 7058 hectares of protected conservation land and marine reserves for mining , while adding protected status to a further 12,400ha .
It said the value of resources underground could be $ 140 billion .
However , Ms Turei said the numbers being " bandied around " were estimates and based on superficial core samples .
She said the figures had not been substantiated , and people were saying to the Government there were some places which " were out of bounds for mineral exploitation " .
" This is the Government trying to satisfy the interests of the mining industry over the interests of the New Zealand public .
They want to sell off these assets to private interests , knowing they will get less than 1 percent of the royalties back , spinning industry numbers about the jobs that might be created . "
The level of support was not surprising , she said .
" More than 50 percent of the country does not want schedule four land mined . "
She said the Government was backing off its plans because of the widespread public opposition to mining on schedule four land , and the public wish for protection of conservation land .
She also said the Government had failed to consult Maori about the impact on them of mining the lands .
Protestors were concerned about harm to the economy , the country 's " clean green " brand and the tourism industry .
" These plans are an attack on our values , that we believe our country is worth protecting , that the environment provides us with essential ecosystems services that we cannot get from elsewhere - health and soil , clean water , bio -diversity .
" Those things are not negotiable , " she said .

CSS3 is probably the hottest trend in web design right now , allowing developers the opportunity to implement a number of solutions into their projects with some very straightforward CSS while avoiding having to resort to nonsemantic markup , extra images , and complex JavaScript .
Unfortunately , it ’s not a surprise that Internet Explorer , even in its most recent version , still does not support the majority of the properties and features introduced in CSS3 .
Experienced developers understand that CSS3 can be added to new projects with progressive enhancement in mind .
This ensures that content is accessible while non-supportive browsers fall back to a less - enhanced experience for the user .
But developers could face a situation where a client insists that the enhancements work cross - browser , demanding support even for IE6 .
In that case , I 've collected together a number of options that developers can consider for those circumstances where support for a CSS3 feature is required for all versions of Internet Explorer ( IE6 , IE7 , & IE8 — all of which are still currently in significant use ) .
Opacity / Transparency
I think all developers are baffled at why Internet Explorer still fails to support this very popular ( albeit troublesome ) property .
It 's been around so long , that we often forget that it 's actually a CSS3 property .
Although IE does n't offer support for the opacity property , it does offer similar transparency settings via the proprietary filter property :
The Syntax
#myElement { opacity : .4 ; /* other browsers and IE9 + */ filter : alpha( opacity=40 ) ; /* IE6 + */ filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha( opacity=40 ) ; /* IE6 + */ -ms-filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha( opacity=40 ) " ; /* this works in IE8 only */ }
You really only need the second line , which works in all versions of Internet Explorer .
But if for some reason you needed the opacity setting to apply only to IE8 , and not to IE6 / 7 , then you can use the last line , which the older versions do n't recognize .
The third line is just another way to do basically the same thing , but with a more convoluted syntax .
The opacity value at the end of each IE line works basically the same way that the opacity property does , taking a number from 0 to 100 ( the opacity property takes a two - digit number from 0 to 1 , so " 44 " for IE would be " 0.44 " for the others ) .
Also , as many have experienced when using opacity ( even when using the standard method ) , the opacity settings will be inherited by all child elements , for which there is no easy workaround .
You may also be interested in the following related posts :
The Demonstration
This element has a solid blue background color ( #0000 FF ) , but is 60 % transparent , making it appear light blue in all browsers
This is the same element without the opacity settings .
The Drawbacks
The filter property is a Microsoft - only property , so your CSS wo n’t validate
As is the case for the opacity property , the IE filter causes all child elements to inherit the opacity
property , the IE filter causes all child elements to inherit the opacity
There could be performance issues with the IE filters
Rounded Corners ( border - radius )
The border - radius property ( more commonly referred to as CSS3 rounded corners ) is another popular CSS3 enhancement .
This property has allowed developers to avoid the headache of bloated JavaScript or extra positioned elements to achieve the same effect .
But once again , Microsoft does n't want to cooperate , so IE does n't have any support for this property .
Fortunately , at least one person has come up with a very usable workaround that can be used in an IE - only stylesheet .
Remiz Rahnas of HTML Remix has created an HTC file called CSS Curved Corner that can be downloaded off Google Code .
The great thing about this piece of code is that it does n't require any extra maintenance if you adjust the amount of radius on your rounded corners .
You just link to the file in your CSS , and the script will automatically parse your CSS to find the correct radius value from the standard border - radius property .
The Syntax
Here ’s what your code might look like :
. box -radius { border - radius : 15 px ; behavior : url ( border- radius.htc ) ; }
The way it works is pretty straightforward , as shown above .
Ideally , however , you would apply the behavior property in an IE - only stylesheet , using the same selector in your CSS , so the code knows where to get the radius value from .
The Demonstration
Because this technique requires use of an external HTC file , you can view the demo at this location .
The Drawbacks
The HTC file is 142 lines ( minifying or GZipping would help , but it ’s still extra bloat )
The behavior property will make your CSS invalid
property will make your CSS invalid
Your server needs to be able to load HTC files for this technique to work
IE8 seems to have some trouble in some circumstances when the HTC file forces the curved element to have a negative z - index value
Box Shadow
The box - shadow property is another useful CSS3 feature that will even add a curved box shadow naturally to an element that uses the border - radius property .
IE does n't support box - shadow , but a filter is available that offers a close replication .
It should be noted that the box - shadow property has been removed from the CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders Module , so its future in CSS3 seems to be a little uncertain right now .
The Syntax
. box - shadow { - moz - box - shadow : 2px 2px 3px # 969696 ; /* for Firefox 3.5 + */ - webkit-box - shadow : 2px 2px 3px # 969696 ; /* for Safari and Chrome */ filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadow( color= '#969696 ' , Direction=145 , Strength=3 ) ; }
As shown above , in addition to the proprietary WebKit and Mozilla properties , you can add a shadow filter that works in all versions of Internet Explorer .
The Demonstration
This element has a drop shadow that works in Internet Explorer .
The Drawbacks
The settings for the IE shadow filter do not match those of the other proprietary properties , so in order to make it look the same , you have to fiddle with the values until you get it right , which can cause maintenance headaches
The filter property does n’t validate , but neither do the WebKit and Mozilla properties , so this is a drawback in all browsers
Text Shadow
Adding drop shadows to text elements has been practiced in both print and web design for years .
On the web , this is normally done with images and occasionally with text duplication combined with positioning .
CSS3 allows developers to easily add shadows to text using a simple and flexible text - shadow property .
Unfortunately , there does n't seem to be an easy way to add a text shadow in Internet Explorer — even with the use of proprietary filters .
To deal with this problem , a Dutch front - end developer named Kilian Valkhof has written a jQuery plugin that implements text shadows in Internet Explorer .
The Syntax
First , in your CSS , you would set the text - shadow property :
. text - shadow { text - shadow : # aaa 1px 1px 1 px ; }
The values specify the shadow color , position on the horizontal axis , position on the vertical axis , and the amount of blur .
After including the jQuery library and the plugin in your document , you can call the plugin with jQuery :
// include jQuery library in your page // include link to plugin in your page $ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " .text - shadow " ) .textShadow ( ) ; } ) ;
The plugin also allows the use of parameters to override the CSS .
See the plugin author ’s original web page for more details on the parameters .
Although there is a cross - browser jQuery plugin that applies drop shadows , the one I 'm demonstrating above actually utilizes the CSS3 value that 's already set in your CSS , so it has the advantage of working along with the standard CSS setting for text shadows , whereas the other plugin needs to be set independently .
The Demonstration
Because this technique requires use of the jQuery library and an external plugin file , you can view the demo at this location .
The Drawbacks
There are some significant drawbacks to this method that make it very unlikely to ever be practical .
You ’re probably better off creating an image to replace the text for IE instead .
In order to make the shadow look almost the same in IE , you need to use different settings in an IE - only stylesheet , adding to development and maintenance time
Requires that you add the jQuery library , in addition to a 61 - line plugin file ( GZipping or minifying would help )
The IE version of the shadow never looks exactly the same as the other browsers
When using the overriding parameters , the plugin seems to be rendered somewhat useless , displaying a big ugly shadow that wo n’t change with new values
Unlike the CSS3 version , the plugin does n’t support multiple shadows
For some reason , in order to get it to work in IE8 , you need to give the element a z - index value
Gradients
Another practical and time - saving technique introduced in CSS3 is the ability to create custom gradients as backgrounds .
Although Internet Explorer does n’t support gradients of the CSS3 variety , it ’s pretty easy to implement them for the IE family using proprietary syntax .
The Syntax
To declare a gradient that looks the same in all browsers , including all versions of Internet Explorer , use the CSS shown below ( the last two lines are for IE ) :
#gradient { background - image : - moz-linear - gradient ( top , # 81a8 cb , #4477a1 ) ; /* Firefox 3.6 */ background - image : - webkit - gradient ( linear , left bottom , left top, color - stop( 0 , #4477a1 ) , color- stop ( 1 , # 81a8 cb ) ) ; /* Safari & Chrome */ filter : progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(GradientType=0,startColorstr='#81a8cb ' , endColorstr= '#4477a1 ' ) ; /* IE6 & IE7 */ - ms- filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(GradientType=0,startColorstr='#81a8cb ' , endColorstr= '#4477a1 ' ) " ; /* IE8 */ }
For the IE filters , the GradientType can be set to " 1 " ( horizontal ) or " 0 " ( vertical ) .
The Demonstration
This element has a linear gradient that works in Internet Explorer .
The Drawbacks
Some of the usual drawbacks apply to gradients created with the IE - only filter , along with some other problems .
Your CSS wo n’t validate , although that ’s also true for the WebKit and Mozilla values
Different code is needed for IE8 , adding to maintenance time
The WebKit and Mozilla gradients allow for “ stops ” to be declared ; this does n’t seem to be possible with the IE gradient , limiting its flexibility
IE ’s filter does n’t seem to have a way to declare “ radial ” gradients , which WebKit and Mozilla support
For a gradient to be visible in IE , the element with the gradient must have layout
Transparent Background Colors ( RGBA )
CSS3 offers another method to implement transparency , doing so through an alpha channel that ’s specified on a background color .
Internet Explorer offers no support for this , but this can be worked around .
The Syntax
For the CSS3 - compliant browsers , here ’s the syntax to set an alpha channel on the background of an element :
#rgba p { background : rgba( 98 , 135 , 167 , .4 ) ; }
With the above CSS , the background color will be set to the RGB values shown , plus the optional “ alpha ” value of “ .4 ” .
To mimic this in Internet Explorer , you can use the proprietary filter property to create a gradient with the same start and end color , along with an alpha transparency value .
This would be included in an IE - only stylesheet , which would override the previous setting .
#rgba p { filter : progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(GradientType=0,startColorstr='#886287a7 ' , endColorstr= '#886287a7 ' ) ; }
The “ gradient ” will look exactly the same in IE as in other browsers , duplicating the RGBA transparency effect .
The Demonstration
This first example below will work in browsers that support RGBA colors .
The second example will only work in Internet Explorer .
This paragraph has a background color with a 40 % opacity setting declared using RGBA ( does n’t work in IE ) .
This paragraph has an IE - only filter applied to mimic RGBA transparency ( only works in IE ) .
The Drawbacks
The filter property is not valid CSS
property is not valid CSS Requires an extra line of CSS in an IE - only stylesheet
The element needs to have layout
strong > Note : Initially , I had used a PNG image method to achieve this effect , but apparently it was working only partially in IE7 and IE8 , and required a PNG - hack for IE6 , so I tried the method given by Liam and Matias in the comments and this seems to work better .
The PNG method is another option , but seems to be more troublesome , and has more drawbacks .
Multiple Backgrounds
This is another CSS3 technique that , when widely supported , could prove to be a very practical addition to CSS development .
Currently , IE and Opera are the only browsers that do n’t support this feature .
But interestingly , IE as far back as version 5.5 has allowed the ability to implement multiple backgrounds on the same element using a filter .
The Syntax
You might recall trying to hack a PNG in IE6 and noticing the image you were trying to hack appearing twice , which you had to remove by adding background : none , then applying the filter .
Well , using the same principle , IE allows two background images to be declared on the same element .
To use multiple backgrounds in Firefox , Safari , and Chrome , here ’s the CSS :
# multi-bg { background : url ( images / bg- image - 1.gif ) center center no -repeat , url ( images / bg- image - 2.gif ) top left repeat ; }
To apply two backgrounds to the same element in IE , use the following in an IE - only stylesheet :
# multi-bg { background : transparent url( images / bg- image - 1.gif ) top left repeat ; filter : progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader ( src='images/bg-image-2.gif ' , sizing Method='crop ' ) ; /* IE6 - 8 */ -ms-filter : " progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='images/bg-image-2.gif ' , sizing Method='crop ' ) " ; /* IE8 only */ }
The Demonstration
The box below shows multiple backgrounds in Chrome , Firefox , and Safari ( you wo n’t see anything in IE ) :
The next box shows multiple backgrounds in Internet Explorer 6 - 8 ( you 'll only see a single background in other browsers ) :
The Drawbacks
Your CSS will be invalid
The second background image applied using the filter property will always be in the top left , and cannot repeat , so this method is extremely inflexible and can probably only be used in a limited number of circumstances
property will always be in the top left , and cannot repeat , so this method is extremely inflexible and can probably only be used in a limited number of circumstances
In order to get the element to center ( as in other browsers ) , you have to create an image with the exact amount of whitespace around it , to mimic the centering , as I ’ve done in the demonstration above
The AlphaImageLoader filter causes performance issues , as outlined here
Element Rotation ( CSS Tranformations )
CSS3 has introduced a number of transformation and animation capabilities , which some have suggested are out of place in CSS .
Nonetheless , there is a way to mimic element rotation in Internet Explorer , albeit in a limited fashion .
The Syntax
To rotate an element 180 degrees ( that is , to flip it vertically ) , here is the CSS3 syntax :
#rotate { - webkit - transform : rotate ( 180deg ) ; - moz-transform : rotate ( 180deg ) ; }
To create the exact same rotation in Internet Explorer , you use a proprietary filter :
#rotate { filter : progid: DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=2 ) ; }
The value for the rotation can be either 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 .
Those numbers represent 90 , 180 , 270 , or 360 degrees of rotation respectively .
The Demonstration
The element below should appear upside down in Internet Explorer , having a rotation of 180 degrees set via the filter property .
To demonstrate this more emphatically , I 've applied a 3 px solid gray " bottom " border , which should appear at the top of the element .
This element is rotated 180 degrees in Internet Explorer .
The Drawbacks
Your CSS wo n’t validate , although that ’s also true for the WebKit and Mozilla code
While the Mozilla and WebKit code allows for rotation changes to increment by a single degree , the IE filter only permits 4 stages of rotation , minimizing its flexibility
Update :
As pointed out in the comments , IE does allow the ability to rotate objects with the same flexibility as the CSS3 methods .
To explain the method here is too complex , but the CSS3 , please project by Paul Irish has implemented this method into its code generator , so you can use that to create the IE - compatible code for CSS3 rotations .
Conclusion
Developers might hate me for compiling this list , seeing as any client could search for “ CSS3 in Internet Explorer ” and stumble across this page .
So be careful what you tell your clients ; although IE does not support these things natively , that does n’t mean they ’re impossible to implement .
And remember that anytime you need to override the initial CSS settings for IE , or if you have to use JavaScript , jQuery , or an HTC file , make sure the calls to the external resources are made using IE conditional comments .
This will ensure the other browsers are n’t making unnecessary HTTP requests .
In many cases , the best solution for dealing with Internet Explorer is to let it display a less - enhanced experience .
I hope , however , the above solutions provide some options for working with CSS3 when a client wants a more accurate cross - browser experience .
A legal matter can turn your world upside down .
You may not have ever had to deal with something like this before .
Where do you even start when you have been accused of a crime like DUI and your future is on the line ?
What do you do next after your life has been derailed because of a serious injury caused by someone else ’s negligence ?
What steps should you take to protect your interests during a divorce or other family law issue ?

Apple is increasingly finding itself in the crosshairs of Federal Regulators who are now investigating possible antitrust issues rooted in Apple allegedly leveraging the popularity of iTunes to prevent Amazon from offering songs as exclusive pre-release downloads .
The New York Times is reporting that the Justice Department is currently examining Apple ’s business practices as they relate to the sale of online music , and have been busy interviewing record labels and an assortment of online music retailers .
The root of the investigation stems from a recent Billboard report which detailed how Apple urged record labels not to participate in Amazon ’s “ Daily Deal ” music promotion under the threat of a reduced presence and promotion for artists on iTunes .
In case you ’re unfamiliar , Amazon ’s “ Daily Deal ” is a promotion where Amazon will offer an album or song for download 1 day before it hits iTunes and record stores .
Albums and songs falling under the “ Daily Deal ” umbrella are heavily advertised and naturally help attract away customers who would ordinarily purchase their music from Apple or from more traditional brick and mortar stores .
Apple , not surprisingly , did n’t take too kindly to Amazon ’s music initiative , and according to Billboard , told record labels that it was in their own best interest not to participate .
Now the reason why this attracted the attention of the Justice Department is because the popularity of iTunes continues to increase .
In 2009 , for example , iTunes was far and away the top music retailer in the US , accounting for 26.65 % of all music sales .
Amazon , meanwhile , checked in as the 5th most popular retailer with a 7 % share .
The numbers are even more stark when you look solely at online music sales where Apple ’s iTunes commands 69 % of the market .
As iTunes grows , the need for record labels to maintain a congenial disposition with Apple becomes that much more important .
A prominent spot on the iTunes landing page can do wonders to help give a new song or album a strong push out of the gate .
Apple allegedly abusing that power in an anti-competitive manner has naturally attracted the attention of federal regulators .
With the investigation into Apple ’s practices still in the preliminary stages , it ’s still too early to tell how thoroughly regulators will examine the matter .
But the underlying lesson here is that Apple is no longer the underdog in all facets of tech .
As the saying goes , with great power comes great responsibility , and for a company that does n’t ordinarily enjoy a commanding marketshare in anything ( MP3 players aside ) , Apple needs to be keenly aware of how its ordinary business practices can easily run afoul of antitrust laws .
While there ’s nothing wrong with being a monopoly , abusing the power inherent with that position can have serious consequences .
We heard earlier this month that Hurt Locker producer Voltage Pictures had teamed with US Copyright Group in an effort to go after individual BitTorrent users who downloaded the film .
Now , it looks like the lawsuits have been filed , and boy , is there a lot of paperwork to go around .
The lawsuit is targeting 5,000 defendants , currently unidentified but might soon be unmasked via subpoenas issued to the related ISPs .
And what might the damages be ?
The Hollywood Reporter , Esq. blog cites a previous suit over the film Far Cry , where the plaintiffs demanded a minimum of $ 1,500 from each defendant , up to $ 150,000 for cases that make it to trial -- and no , there is n't a body suit in the US Army EOD unit strong enough to make it go away .
Why are we interested in the lesbian hipster ?
Partially , it ’s ’ cause she looks really , really cute on Facebook and you ca n’t stop lurking her pictures .
But it ’s mostly ’ cause the “ lesbian ” and “ hipster ” worlds seem to have converged so naturally that there ’s clearly something going on past Generation X /Y ’s universal adoption of any westward - blowing trendwind .
Remember that time in the ’ 80s when power suits were all the rage ?
Of course you do , you ’re a lesbian !
Trends may come and go , but once in a star - crossed while , styles work their way permanently into various subcultures .
Lesbian hipsters are one of the newer members of the already highly categorized girl - on - girl community , but within the lesbian subculture , does this “ trend ” have the power to outlast the shelf life of the mainstream “ hipster , ” just as power lesbians kept the power suits ?
Despite its relative newness , the lesbian hipster style is almost ubiquitous in certain spaces , like Tegan & Sara concerts or The Abbey on a Friday night .
So why does hipster jive so easily with lesbian ?
a lesson in hipster history
+
Hipstory , if you will .
I know it ’s hard to believe that all these thrift store shirt - wearing , gold lamé - legginged girls carry with them any sort of legacy other than ‘ 80s dance movies ( Jennifer Beals , I ’m looking at you ) , but the tale of how the hipster came to be is a history of histories .
At the risk of unleashing some violent anti-hipster hatred from a movement which actually meant something — according to one legend , the great ancestor of the lesbian hipster is none other than the riot grrrl .
Lesbians and hipsters look alike , they say , because hipsters have evolved from scenesters who were once emo kids , a phenomenon preceded by the re-emergence of punk , influenced of course by riot .
A more comprehensive look at the composition of typical hipster is recognizing it as a compilation of appropriated cultures , more specifically those that exist not only outside the mainstream , but as a rebellion against it .
“ Oversaturation turns the outlandish into the normal and the DIY into the mass - produced . ”
It ’s all how we cycle “ cool . ”
A subculture creates a style to distinguish itself from the mainstream .
These subcultures usually arise from some form of societal oppression , and as women and gays , we are obvs all about oppression .
Once the style becomes distinctive as a symbol of resistance , dissent , or even difference , the mainstream reacts not in fear but instead by picking and choosing what can be reinterpreted and then marketed to the masses as trendy .
Oversaturation turns the outlandish into the normal and the DIY into the mass - produced .
Suddenly what began as dissent becomes a trend .
This sort of appropriation of cultures allows us to buy the edginess of rebellion while bypassing the troubled history .
This edginess is the ‘ trend ’ — but when the trend fades from the mainstream , those with “ genuine ” ties to the ethos of the trend often continue on sporting it .
The lesbian hipster , we like to think , is more aware .
hipster as third gender

Despite the fact that , in my opinion , I walk around all day looking like a big giant lesbian with the ability to wear a bandana at least six different ways and a haircut whose tell - tale asymmetry can be spotted by even a novice , I still unintentionally pass as straight .
Not just in the way that everyone assumes everyone else ’s heterosexuality , but in the way that I can wear a tie , use the word “ girlfriend ” non-platonically , and still be actively pursued by men .
Perhaps this is due to my extraordinary good looks .
But most likely this is due to the fact that hipster style tends to be androgynous .
Aside from the ironic mustache ( most of the time ) , most hipster trends are suited to fit both guys and girls .
What was once “ boys in girl pants ” has now just evolved into “ skinny jeans , ” and any clothing items once sized large enough to fit only men have been shrunken down to skin tight .
Hipster seems to be functioning as a third gender in fashion .
It ’s not uncommon in many non-Western cultures to recognize third or multiple genders in society , although it makes our government and health care system very uncomfortable .
While the third - gendered peoples are generally accepted in these societies , and often were revered as oracles , this acceptance tends to come at the price of their sexuality .
Basically , in order to avoid that whole confusion over reproduction and gender binaries and such , these individuals are generally regarded as asexual .
But worry not , lesbian hipsters – we still think you ’re hot .
Hipsterdom may be viewed as somewhere in between genders , but identifying yourself as a lesbian means not only identifying yourself as a woman but also identifying yourself based on sexuality .
Therefore , the lesbian hipster has universal appeal .
Her style is just new enough to be trendy and sexy , while the items in her wardrobe are familiar enough to be safe .
good music , bad romance
+
As we have seen , empirical research has proven that the hipster lesbian is typically perceived by straight men as “ just an edgy straight girl ” and by straight women as “ that cute lesbian I would totally go gay for . ”
And that ’s all fine and good for walking around all hipster - cool , but what does it mean in the world of lesbian ?
“ However , dressing like Tegan and Sara does not a trendy lesbian make . ”
Once again , we ’ve got Tegan and Sara to thank , maybe not exclusively , but definitely largely , for making the lesbian hipster cool .
Always appearing with swoopalicious bangs , ankle - choking jeans , and trendy t- shirts , the girls made lesbian hipster not only acceptable , but also attractive .
However , dressing like Tegan and Sara does not a trendy lesbian make .
Because let ’s face it , y’all : hipsters are sometimes ridiculous .
Take it from someone who has actually been turned down for being “ just too hipster ” : not everyone ’s into it .
This is potentially because hipsters , like members of any fashion culture or subculture , have the tendency to flock together , which has the danger of breeding a culture of exclusivity .
Luckily , the queer girl community holds a stronger bond than the hipster one does , allowing the lesbian hipster to socialize freely among other lesbians .
In fact , her obvious appearance as a lesbian may even draw in girls who can easily recognize her – she just should n’t expect to pick up all of them .
the lesbian three - piece suit
+
To illustrate this , I present the separate histories of the lesbian three - piece suit : a plaid shirt , a bandanna , and skinny jeans .
1. Plaid Shirt
+
Do n’t you go around calling this lesbian staple your “ lumberjack shirt . ”
Unless , of course , you are a lumberjack , in which case you would probably just call it your shirt .
But believe it or not , plaid was once so controversial that English authorities banned the print after the Scottish rebellion in the late 1740 ’s .
Yes , before becoming offensive , Mel Gibson taught us in Braveheart that plaid means business .
More recently , you oughta know that plaid shirts were donned by women ’s libbers in the ’60s , proving you do n’t need to be a man to wear a button - down .
2. Bandana
+
Bandanas are so gay that Peaches wrote a song about them .
“ Hanky Code ” poetically weaves the tale of a system of colored handkerchiefs used by gay men in the ‘ 70s to indicate their sexual preferences and fetishes .
And even though bandanas have gone fairly mainstream as a fashion item and are now popular lesbian trademarks , you probably still should n’t casually walk into an S&M workshop with a bandana hanging out of your back pocket .
Other than that , you go for it , lesbian hipster .
3. Skinny Jeans
+
Super - tight straight leg pants , worn notably by sex symbols and rebellious icons Elvis Presley and James Dean , made it big in the 1970s underground punk scene .
The pants ’ popularity stayed alive through the decades , persisting largely through other music scenes .
And although skinny jeans were once – and still are – the choice pants of rock stars and those looking to fight The Man , they have now joined the ranks of the lesbian subculture so that we , too , can experience the awkwardness of trying to hook up , having trouble getting your skinny jeans off , having to hop around the room removing them from your ankles , and finally end up with a pair of inside - out skinny jeans on the floor .
Holla .
Conclusion
+
So does the lesbian hipster really exist , and if so , what is her place in the queer girl community ?
She ’s a different kind of lesbian , paying tribute to the subcultures that came before her .
Or maybe she ’s just a girl who thinks solid - colored v-neck t- shirts maker her look hotter than any other kind ( she ’s correct ) .
Androgynously sexy and dykey but not quite butch , the lesbian hipster creates its own categories by falling in between older ones .
Hipsters get their clothes from lesbians , and lesbians get their clothes from hipsters ; maybe this means there are no lesbian hipsters or even hipsters at all , there are just lesbians , and straight people who dress like them .
We invited the lesbian hipster over , and now she ’s here to stay .
Perhaps for tea , preferably something trendy like rooibos out of a thrifted 4 - H mug .
We wo n’t even kick the lesbian hipster out the next morning .
In fact , maybe she can move in .
Maybe we can get a cat and name it something like Jane Lynch , or Shane Jr .
“ The lesbian hipster style provides for us the perfect outlet for androgyny , which we all already know to be sexy .
It ’s a middle ground of gender – androgyny is hipsterdom ’s gift . ”
But really , much to the grievance of heterosexual hipsters , the look will pass .
Autostraddle predicts that for gay ladies , however , the trend will stay .
It ’s the same reason we want the lesbian hipster herself to stay .
These trends are giving queer girls what we ’ve always deserved : to be hot …on our terms .
The lesbian hipster style provides for us the perfect outlet for androgyny , which we all already know to be sexy .
It ’s a middle ground of gender – androgyny is hipsterdom ’s gift .
We can still be girls without having to be too girly .
It ’s like in the ‘ 80s when women in the business world adopted power suits , and even when they went out of fashion , lesbians kept them ( ‘ sup Bette Porter ) .
They were n’t our access to power , but they were a sign of our empowerment .
Such is the case for today ’s hipster .
Dressed once in full hipster clad for church ( a different story entirely ) , my mom told me that I had to change so I could look like a girl .
Well , now thanks to hipsters , we do n’t have to take it when our moms tell us to look like girls .
We already know we ’re girls .
Nay , we are women ( womyn ? ) , and we are so hip and so cool that we do n’t need frills or poofs or heels or however they ’re selling femininity to us these days .
The lesbian hipster is confident ; she knows who she is and what she wants , and she ’s wearing her little gay heart on her plaid sleeve .
As President Barack Obama prepares to shutter the infamous US prison at GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo Bay , Cuba , he appears to be supporting the expansion of another secretive prison in Afghanistan — at a pricetag of some $ 10 to $ 25 million .
In a little - noticed filing Wednesday , the US Army announced it is soliciting bids for the expansion of the US prison at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
The announced request for proposals says the Army seems a “ build contract for three ( 3 ) new detention housing units to be located directly adjacent to the existing detention facility at Parwan .
The three new detention housing units include one ( 1 ) Special Housing Unit ( SHU ) and two ( 2 ) Detention Housing Units ( DHU ) . ”
“ The dollar magnitude of this project is between $ 10,000,000 and $ 25,000,000 , ” the Army adds .
The solicitation was first noticed by Nathan Hodge at Wired.com .
Hodge notes another startling fact — that the US is planning to shortly hand over the base , despite the fact that they ’re going to spend more than $ 10 million on expanding it .
“ Timing here is key :
The jail is supposed to be handed over to Afghan control of the place , sometimes called ‘ ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s GuantÃ ƒÂ¡namo , ’ sometime next year , ” Hodge writes .
“ Afghan and U.S. officials have signed an agreement to hand control of the Parwan facility to the Afghan ministry of defense , and eventually to its ministry of justice .
The transfer may help resolve an issue that has caused a fair amount of controversy for the U.S. military . ”

“ Back in 2002 , two Bagram detainees died in a prisoner - abuse scandal , ” he adds .
“ And last year , The New York Times reported the existence of a ‘ black jail ’ at Bagram that was kept off limits to the Red Cross .
The military has maintained that there is no separate facility at Bagram :
In a bloggersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ roundtable earlier this year , Navy Vice Adm .
Robert Harward emphasized that there were ‘ no black jails ’ at Bagram , but he did clarify that there was a short period of detention at undisclosed ‘ field - detention sites , ’ where Afghan and U.S. authorities hold individuals to determine who they are and whether they have any actionable intelligence . ”
According to a BBC report published in April , the US military operates a “ secret jail ” at an Afghan airbase where prisoners are deprived of sleep and “ made to dance ” by US troops whenever they want to use the toilet .
The BBC interviewed nine people who say they were held at the facility , known as the “ black hole , ” at the site of the Bagram air base .
The prison appears to be separate from the main Bagram prison , which the US established after the 2001 invasion and which continues to be the target of human rights complaints .
ADVERTISEMENT
A man identified only as “ Mirwais ” who says he spent 24 days at the facility told the BBC that prisoners are routinely subjected to sleep deprivation .
“ I could not sleep , nobody could sleep because there was a machine that was making noise , ” said Mirwais .
“ There was a small camera in my cell , and if you were sleeping they ’d come in and disturb you . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Mirwais said he was made to dance to music by American soldiers every time he wanted to use the toilet , ” the BBC reports .
Witnesses said the lights were kept on in their cells at all times ; that the Red Cross had no access to the facility ; and most had been beaten by US troops before they were brought there .
The BBC report does not address under what circumstances the witnesses found themselves there , or whether any of them were insurgents .
With earlier reporting by Daniel Tencer .
In a final step , a team led by Daniel G. Gibson , Hamilton O. Smith and Dr. Venter report in Thursday ’s issue of the journal Science that the synthetic DNA takes over a bacterial cell just as the natural DNA did , making the cell generate the proteins specified by the new DNA ’s genetic information in preference to those of its own genome .
The team ordered pieces of DNA 1,000 units in length from Blue Heron , a company that specializes in synthesizing DNA , and developed a technique for assembling the shorter lengths into a complete genome .
The cost of the project was $ 40 million , most of it paid for by Synthetic Genomics , a company Dr. Venter founded .
But the bacterium used by the Venter group is unsuitable for biofuel production , and Dr. Venter said he would move to different organisms .
Synthetic Genomics has a contract from Exxon to generate biofuels from algae .
Exxon is prepared to spend up to $ 600 million if all its milestones are met .
Dr. Venter said he would try to build “ an entire algae genome so we can vary the 50 to 60 different parameters for algae growth to make superproductive organisms . ”
On his yacht trips round the world , Dr. Venter has analyzed the DNA of the many microbes in seawater and now has a library of about 40 million genes , mostly from algae .
These genes will be a resource to make captive algae produce useful chemicals , he said .
Some other scientists said that aside from assembling a large piece of DNA , Dr. Venter has not broken new ground .
“ To my mind Craig has somewhat overplayed the importance of this , ” said David Baltimore , a geneticist at Caltech .
He described the result as “ a technical tour de force , ” a matter of scale rather than a scientific breakthrough .
“ He has not created life , only mimicked it , ” Dr. Baltimore said .
Dr. Venter ’s approach “ is not necessarily on the path ” to produce useful microorganisms , said George Church , a genome researcher at Harvard Medical School .
Leroy Hood , of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle , described Dr. Venter ’s report as “ glitzy ” but said lower - level genes and networks had to be understood first before it would be worth trying to design whole organisms from scratch .
In 2002 Eckard Wimmer , of the State University of New York at Stony Brook , synthesized the genome of the polio virus .
The genome constructed a live polio virus that infected and killed mice .
Dr. Venter ’s work on the bacterium is similar in principle , except that the polio virus genome is only 7,500 units in length , and the bacteria ’s genome is more than 100 times longer .
Image caption Deforestation accounts for up to 20 % of all CO2 emissions
Indonesia will introduce a two - year moratorium on deforestation to help tackle climate change , the country 's president has said .
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono made the announcement in Norway on the eve of a climate conference in Oslo .
The decision is part of a deal reached with Norway , which has agreed to contribute up to $ 1bn ( £ 694 m ) to help preserve Indonesia 's forests .
Deforestation can lead to significant levels of carbon dioxide emissions .
" We will conduct a moratorium for two years where we stop the conversion of peat land and of forest , " President Yudhoyono said at a joint news conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg .
The pledge comes ahead of Thursday 's climate and forest conference in Oslo , which is expected to be attended by officials from some 50 countries .
Norway says that developed nations have already promised about $ 500 m to fight deforestation in addition to $ 3.5 bn agreed at last December 's climate change summit in Copenhagen .
Deforestation - the burning of woodlands or the rotting of felled trees for farms , roads or towns - accounts for up to 20 % of all greenhouse gas emissions from human activities .
Gordon Brown said he " profoundly regretted " his remarks
The woman at the centre of a media storm after being called " bigoted " by Gordon Brown has said she will not be voting for Labour or any party .
Gillian Duffy told the Mail on Sunday she felt sorry for Mr Brown after he made the unguarded remark , minutes after she confronted him in public .
Mr Brown later visited Mrs Duffy 's home in Rochdale to express his regret .
Mrs Duffy said she accepted his apology but declined his invitation to shake hands with him in front of the cameras .
" He wanted me to go outside with him and shake his hands for the camera but I said no , " she told the newspaper .
" I did n't want that fuss . "
Mr Brown 's remarks - in which he described his discussion with Mrs Duffy on issues such as immigration and education as a " disaster " - were captured by a microphone he was still wearing .
' Sad not angry '
A life - long Labour supporter , Mrs Duffy said she was " shocked " by the episode and felt more " sad " than " angry " about what happened .
All she had done was " ask questions " , she told the paper .
" Does that make me a bigot ? " , she said .
He was smiling when he spoke to me but he was thinking that .
What else is he thinking when he smiles
Gillian Duffy
" If you are going to go and talk to people you should have answers , should n't you ?
You do n't just go there and shake their hands and tell them how well they are doing . "
She added : " He was smiling when he spoke to me but he was thinking that .
What else is he thinking when he smiles . "
Reflecting on Mr Brown 's visit to her house , she said she had told him : " I 'm sorry for you , Gordon , because you have more to lose than me .
I 'm very sorry that this has happened but it 's you who 's going to lose out not me . "
After the incident , Mr Brown said he had " misunderstood " what Mrs Duffy had said and thought that she had been talking about sending students from Eastern Europe back home .
Mrs Duffy said she had never said anything of the kind .
She said she wished Mr Brown had never " bothered " coming to Rochdale in the first place .
' High price '
Immediately after she was told about Mr Brown 's remarks , Mrs Duffy suggested she would not be voting Labour as she had previously intended .
She told the newspaper she could not " bring herself " to vote at all after what she had gone through .
I could tell from the tone of his voice when he called me that he had done something he felt mortified about
Sarah Brown
The interview is the first public comment she has made since the prime minister spent 40 minutes in her Rochdale home - ripping up his campaign schedule in the process .
After the incident , Mr Brown told Labour members that he " profoundly regretted " the remarks and has since acknowledged he has paid a " very high price " for them .
Writing in the Sunday Mirror , Sarah Brown said her husband would " forever regret " his remarks .
" I was not with Gordon at the time but I could tell from the tone of his voice when he called me that he had done something he felt mortified about , " she said .
" If there is one thing everyone who knows him agrees on about Gordon , it is that he simply hates upsetting people .
" The idea that somebody would have been caused pain or embarrassment by something he had done is the sort of thing that goes right to the core of Gordon and I know that his apology came straight from the heart . "

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit yesterday announced that they would take up the matter of Tivo , Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. en banc .
The earlier panel decision , which was issued on March 4 , 2010 , is now vacated and the appeal is reinstated .
For more information about the original panel decision see TiVo Stock Surges Over 50 % on Patent Decision in EchoStar Case .
While en banc rehearings are rare , it seems that the Federal Circuit is showing increased willingness to take high profile cases en banc .
Recently the Federal Circuit agreed to hear Hyatt v. Doll en banc , which relates to whether new evidence can be submitted in an appeal of a decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences to the United States Federal District Court for the District of Columbia .
See CAFC Grants En Banc Review of BPAI to District Court Appeal .
Just weeks ago the Federal Circuit also agreed to hear important matters of inequitable conduct en banc , taking up Therasence , Inc. v. Becton Dickinson and Co. See Federal Circuit to Consider Inequitable Conduct En Banc .
Perhaps this may show an increased willingness to settle certain fundamental areas of law , which would be a welcome occurrence after what appears to be in - fighting among CAFC Judges on a variety of important issues .
The en banc appeal will be heard on the basis of the original filed briefs , additional briefing and oral argument , with the oral argument date and time to be determined .
The Defendant - Appellant ’s ( “ EchoStar Corporation et al. ” ) new briefs are due within 42 days from yesterday , and Plaintiff - Appellee ’s ( “ Tivo ” ) response briefs are due 42 days after service of the EchoStar ’s new briefs being served .
The EchoStar ’s reply brief , if any is to be filed , must be filed within 28 days after service of the Tivo ’s response brief .
Briefs of amici curiae will be entertained , and any such amicus briefs may be filed without leave of court but otherwise must comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 29 and Federal Circuit Rule 29 .
After the original panel decision EchoStar filed a request for reconsideration and a petition for rehearing en banc .
The panel requested a response from Plaintiff - Appellee TiVo Inc .
The court granted Defendants - Appellants leave to file a reply in support of the petition .
The court also granted leave to Five Law Professors to file a brief as amici curiae in support of the petition .
The petition for reconsideration was considered by the panel that heard the appeal , and thereafter the petition for rehearing en banc , the response to the petition , the reply , and the brief of the amici curiae were referred to the circuit judges who are authorized to request a poll on whether to rehear the appeal en banc .
A poll was requested , taken , and the Federal Circuit decided that the appeal warrants en banc consideration .
The Federal Circuit has requested additional briefing on the following issues :
Following a finding of infringement by an accused device at trial , under what circumstances is it proper for a district court to determine infringement by a newly accused device through contempt proceedings rather than through new infringement proceedings ?
What burden of proof is required to establish that a contempt proceeding is proper ?
How does “ fair ground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the defendant ’s conduct ” compare with the “ more than colorable differences ” or “ substantial open issues of infringement ” tests in evaluating the newly accused device against the adjudged infringing device ?
See Cal. Artificial Stone Paving Co. v. Molitor , 113 U.S. 609 , 618 ( 1885 ) ; KSM Fastening Sys. , Inc. v. H.A. Jones Co. , 776 F.2d 1522 , 1532 ( Fed. Cir. 1985 ) .
Where a contempt proceeding is proper , ( 1 ) what burden of proof is on the patentee to show that the newly accused device infringes ( see KSM , 776 F.2d at 1524 ) and ( 2 ) what weight should be given to the infringer ’s efforts to design around the patent and its reasonable and good faith belief of noninfringement by the new device , for a finding of contempt ?
Is it proper for a district court to hold an enjoined party in contempt where there is a substantial question as to whether the injunction is ambiguous in scope ?
Oral argument will be held at a time and date to be announced later , likely sometime late Fall 2010 .
STRIKEFORCE women 's 135 - pound sensation Miesha " Takedown " Tate and four - time world champion and MMA pioneer Frank Shamrock will begin production on a DVD project that seeks to educate women on rape prevention techniques this Friday in Los Angeles .
The DVD will feature defensive instructions from the MMA stars as well as feature interviews with three high - profile rape victims , who will recount their horrific experiences in order to educate potential victims .
In the instructional component of the video , Shamrock will act as an attacker while Tate demonstrates self defense techniques for a variety of scenarios .
The production is part of Tate 's Take Down Enterprises , which endeavors to educate society on the history of MMA and why it 's the fastest growing sport in the world .
Tate ( 9 - 2 ) , of Tacoma , Wash. , is coming off a second round submission of previously unbeaten Zoila Frausto at a STRIKEFORCE Challengers event live on SHOWTIME ® from Fresno , Calif. on March 26 .
Shamrock , the first STRIKEFORCE middleweight champion in history as well as the first - ever UFC middleweight champion , has been educating fans on a regular basis as an announcer for live CBS and SHOWTIME televised STRIKEFORCE MMA events .
In an era of trillion - dollar federal deficits , is it possible for members of Congress to oppose a White House proposal to cut “ unnecessary spending ” ?
You betcha !
Congress in recent years has let slide many of its powers – from punting big investigations to outside commissions to signing a blank check for President Bush to use force after the 9/11 attacks .
But Article I congressional spending powers are clutched tight , especially by those lawmakers who have won seats on the A - list Appropriations Committees .
Inside the Beltway , he who holds the purse strings holds the power , and key Democrats are giving no indication that they are ready to yield to President Obama this precious pearl of lawmaking .
“ I have long defended the congressional power of the purse , and , as chairman of the Appropriations Committee I have no intention of ceding that authority to the executive branch , ” said Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D ) of Hawaii , in a statement on Monday .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who has done the heavy lifting for most of Mr. Obama ’s domestic agenda , is not out in front on this one .
In a statement , she said that she “ looked forward to reviewing the president ’s proposal . ”
" She wants an opportunity to hear from members of the caucus and talk to others in the administration , ” says spokesman Nadeam Elshami .
“ We just received the proposal today . ”
That proposal , released Monday , boils down to this :
Within two months after the president has signed appropriations bills into law , the White House can opt to give Congress a second chance to vote down a list of projects in that fiscal year ’s spending bills that the White House deems wasteful .
Congress must vote this package of rescissions up or down in its entirety , by a simple majority vote .
Budget watchdog groups hailed the proposal as an important first step to reining in unsustainable federal spending .
“ It is just another tool that can help Congress help themselves , ” says Steve Ellis , vice president of programs for Taxpayers for Common Sense , noting that members often wind up voting for projects they do n’t like in vast spending bills .
This so - called expedited rescission bill gives lawmakers a second shot at eliminating these projects .
In FY 2010 , Congress included 9,499 member projects , adding up to $ 15.9 billion .
“ This step by the White House puts more responsibility on the president to say , ' I will take wasteful dollars out of the budget . '
It can build trust , ” says Maya MacGuineas , president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget .
“ The challenges we face now are so great that it ’s going to have to be done in a series of steps .
Before you can turn to Social Security and taxes , you have to hit these trustbusters , like earmarks , ” she adds .
“ Every normal taxpayer says , ‘ Why should I be part of the solution when Washington is still broken ? ’ ”
In fact , presidents now have the power to propose rescissions , but no president has used it since 2000 because the process is so unpopular with Congress .
The last time a president requested rescissions – three worth $ 128 million in 2000 – none of them was accepted .
Several times , Sen. John McCain ( R ) of Arizona has proposed giving the president the expedited - rescissions powers under discussion now , but Obama and the Democrats rejected it .
“ The president would have this authority already if he and members of his administration had n’t blocked similar legislation when they served in the Senate , ” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell , referring to a filibuster of the McCain proposal .
Sen. Robert Byrd ( D ) of West Virginia , who spoke for six straight hours in opposition to a GOP proposal to give President George H.W.
Bush a presidential line - item veto in 1992 , says he will oppose a " power grab " by a Democratic president as well .
" The elected representatives of the people know a lot better than any bureaucrat in Washington as to what our spending priorities should be .
Not only would these rescission decisions be those of unelected bureaucrats – with no transparency or accountability , they would allow the White House to leave intact its own spending priorities , ” he said .

Hispanic students fill nearly half the seats in Arizona ’s public school classrooms , but a new law signed by Governor Jan Brewer Tuesday makes it illegal for these students to learn about their heritage in school .
HB 2281 prohibits schools from offering courses at any grade level that advocate ethnic solidarity , promote overthrow of the US government , or cater to specific ethnic groups — regulations which will dismantle the state ’s popular Mexican - American studies programs .
Much like Arizona ’s new immigration law , this ethnic studies ban is political interest dressed up to look like education reform .
The bill was passed largely because of State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne ’s personal distaste for the Tuscon Unified School District ’s Chicano studies program , in which 3 percent of the district ’s 55,000 students participate .
He has been hell - bent on squashing the program ever since learning several years ago that Hispanic civil rights activist Dolores Huerta told Tucson High School students that “ Republicans hate Latinos , ” the Associated Press reports .
“ Traditionally , the American public school system has brought together students from different backgrounds and taught them to be Americans and to treat each other as individuals , and not on the basis of their ethnic backgrounds , ” Horne noted in an April press release .
“ This is consistent with the fundamental American value that we are all individuals , not exemplars of whatever ethnic groups we were born into .
Ethnic studies programs teach the opposite , and are designed to promote ethnic chauvinism . ”
District officials insist the program covers history — not activism or chauvinism .
In the Mexican - American studies program , an American history course highlights Hispanics ’ role in the Vietnam War , and literature students analyze the works of Latino authors .
The kids learn , for example , that Arizona was once part of Mexico , and that in the 1960s Chicano radicals called for reclaiming the land , reports Valerie Strauss of the Washington Post .
The new law also means Arizona students will lose access to African - American and Native - American studies .
On her blog , The Answer Sheet , Strauss describes the bill as symptomatic of a larger problem — the growing number of state legislators telling educators how to do their jobs .
“ We tried this once before , in a big law called No Child Left Behind , which was designed with the input of not a single teacher , and which spectacularly failed in its goal to close the achievement gap , ” Strauss writes .
“ We never seem to learn from our own mistakes .
How do we expect kids to do that if the adults ca n’t get it right ? ”
A DRIVER told how her car broke down in the middle of a busy motorway after faulty fuel from a Greenock garage wrecked her vehicle .
Anna Blyth , 26 , had her engine badly damaged after filling up with £ 40 of petrol at the BP garage in Branchton .
After leaving the station in Inverkip Road she made it just half a mile towards Inverclyde Royal Hospital , in Gleninver Road , before her car broke down .
It was the second time there had been a problem with fuel contamination in four months , according to Trading Standards .
Anna said : " I had to phone the AA and they towed it to Charlie Cullen Motors in Port Glasgow for me .
" The mechanic had a look at the car and removed the petrol from the tank , where we found a gallon of water with it .
He told me he had just seen another car with the exact same problem after using the garage in Branchton Road .
" I visited BP at Branchton and they said it was likely to be a fault with the fuel tanker and advised me to contact BP customer services which I did . "
Anna got her car back from the garage three days later with a bill for £ 142 - but her misery was n't over .
She said : " The next day I was driving to work in Glasgow when the car stalled twice at traffic lights , chugging randomly and losing power .
" On the advice of the mechanic , I added more petrol .
On the way home from work it seemed to be chugging more , and the mechanic said to get it down the motorway slowly to him .
" The car broke down on the motorway , I had no power and was surrounded by cars doing 70 mph , while I was unable to go faster than 5 mph .
It was only by sheer luck that I made it across into the hard shoulder . "
Again Anna had to be rescued by the AA , which towed her car back to the garage in Port Glasgow .
The fuel tank was removed and emptied , where it was found that water and grit had now filtered all the way through to the engine .
Anna said : " I got the car back a day later and the engine management light came on during the first journey .
I took it back to mechanic to check what the fault was , but he could find nothing .
" It stayed on for three months before finally going off just last week . "
After a wrangle with BP 's head office , involving having to fax mechanic reports , call - out bills and receipts for the work done , the company agreed a £ 300 compensation payment for what they called ' inconvenience and disappointment ' .
Anna added : " I now think maybe the cash I accepted was n't adequate for the danger I was put in .
" What happened to me on the motorway was very scary .
" It has been a lot of bother and inconvenience which has lasted over a long period of time .
" I was left in danger and I can't help feeling this could have been easily avoided . "
A spokeswoman for BP admitted there had been problems at the garage but said motorists had been fully compensated .
She said : " We did experience a problem some months ago where we identified water in the tanks , we took immediate action to isolate these tanks .
" Significant work has been done to resolve the matter and everything is now back to normal .
A small number of vehicles were affected .
" We are unable to go into individual claims , or action taken , but the matter was rectified as soon as possible after the problem occurred and those motorists affected compensated .
" BP is unable to say how water got into the tanks . "
Meanwhile , oil giant BP is still in the worldwide spotlight after it made headlines when the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico exploded in April , killing 11 and injuring others .
With more than 5,000 barrels of oil a day escaping into the water , the environmental disaster has quickly become one of the worst in history .
Despite hoping to have finally plugged the leak on Friday , experts estimate the clean - up bill could cost BP around £ 1 billion .

The BBC Top Gear presenter sparked protests from ramblers when he diverted a path on land at his holiday home , a lighthouse on the Langness peninsula .
He claims there had never been any rights of way across the land .
But a public inquiry concluded he interfered with a right of way and he must now reinstate the path .
Mr Clarkson has 28 days to appeal against the ruling .
Health Minister David Anderson MHK , who was acting transport minister at the time the inquiry began , said anyone was able to object to the report 's findings .
He said : " If any objections are received , and are not subsequently withdrawn , the matter has to be brought to the High Court for resolution . "
' Horrible experiences '
Mr Anderson said the inquiry inspector , Roy Hickey , said " strong and persuasive evidence " had been put forward by members of the public that they had the right to use the paths on Langness .
He said that all of the paths on Langness , apart from five , should be dedicated as public rights of way .
The five paths that may remain private include three leading from the lighthouse to the shore south and south east of the lighthouse , a fourth running across the peninsula and a fifth crossing the golf course .
Anyone can object to the decision within 28 days Mr Clarkson 's wife , Frances Cain , said the family had received unwanted attention from passers - by and put a fence up to protect their privacy .
" This is the place that I brought my family , my husband and my children , with such a happy heart , and we 've had such horrible experiences , " she said .
However , the report 's outcome was welcomed by Rushen MHKs Juan Watterson , Quintin Gill and Phil Gawne .
All three MHKs said in a joint statement that they felt it was a " victory for common sense " .
They said : " Whilst not condoning the actions of some of the more militant campaigners who used dogs to deliberately distress wildlife or impose on the privacy of the landowners , the MHKs did feel that this was a victory for common sense and people power . "
Mr Gill said he was " delighted " at the outcome .
" This has been an issue I have campaigned on for almost five years , " he said .
" I am delighted that Mr Hickey has determined that rights of way have been established over the Langness peninsula . "

2010 Public Alligator Hunting season applications available online May 1
Beginning May 1st , the S.C. Department of Natural Resources ( DNR ) will start accepting online applications for the 2010 Public Alligator Hunting season .
Applicants for the alligator hunting season are required to apply and pay online through the application available on the DNR website or at one of the walk - up counters at a DNR Regional Office in Clemson , Florence , Columbia , or Charleston .
No paper applications will be accepted .
This year 's season will begin at 12 p.m. ( noon ) on Sept. 11 and run until 12 p.m. ( noon ) on Oct. 9 .
First time users of the online application system will have to create a new user account that requires creating a personal user ID and password .
Be sure to write down your user ID and password using exact upper and lower case characters you chose .
Your access to this site will be controlled by the accurate entry of this information at a future sign - on .
Returning users will be able to sign on using their current information .
A $ 10 nonrefundable application fee is required to apply for the hunt , and a randomized computer drawing will determine the selection of hunters .
One thousand permits are available and the coastal plain is divided into four alligator management units with 250 permits allocated for each unit ( 1000 total ) .
Applicants can select the option to be considered for any number ( or all ) of the units , but the issued permit will only allow them to hunt in one unit per season .
If selected , a $ 100 fee for the permit and one harvest tag is required to be paid online through the same application process .
Selected alligator hunters will be allowed to take one alligator on public waters or private lands where hunting rights are granted .
No alligator hunting is allowed on Wildlife Management Areas ( except in navigable waters ) , state parks , or federal properties like National Wildlife Refuges .
Unsuccessful applicants will accumulate preference points for future alligator hunt drawings .
For the hunting season , only alligators four feet or greater in length may be taken and the hunter must tag the animal immediately with a harvest tag provided by DNR .
This hunting season does not allow the shooting of unsecured alligators , even on private land .
All alligators must be secured using approved equipment and brought boat - side or onto land before they can be dispatched .
While others may assist the permitted hunter , all participants ( including permittee ) must possess a valid South Carolina hunting license .
All permitted hunters are required to report their harvest to the DNR whether an alligator was taken or not in order to participate in any way in the following year 's alligator hunt .
All hunters will be notified beginning in July of selection status .
DNR will begin to send out permits and tags to fully paid applicants after Aug. 1st .
This deadline for paying the $ 100 permit fee for selected applicants is Oct. 1 , but you must allow the department five business days to deliver the permit and tag after receipt of payment .
Hunters that fail to pay the $ 100 permit fee by the end of the Alligator Hunting Season will not receive any preference points and will forfeit any accumulated points .
DNR will conduct a series of optional seminars for those selected for the alligator season that will include vital information on how to conduct a safe and successful hunt .
DNR will closely monitor these hunts and the harvest and regulations may be modified for future seasons .
More than 100,000 alligators live from the Midlands to the coast of South Carolina and the population is not threatened by the regulated removal of a relatively small number of alligators .
Last year , hunters took 452 alligators during the public alligator hunting season with the average size being 9 ' 5 " in length .
South Carolina 's natural resources are essential for economic development and contribute nearly $ 30 billion and 230,000 jobs to the state 's economy .

The Daily Monitor reports :
A committee of Cabinet has made recommendations that could end Ndorwa West MP David Bahati ’s proposal to have a separate law punishing homosexuality in Uganda .
The recommendations , which Saturday Monitor has seen , come close to dismissing Mr Bahati ’s draft legislation .
Dr. James Nsaba Buturo is n’t very happy :
Dr Nsaba Buturo , the junior ethics minister , who has spoken fiercely against homosexuality , never attended this meeting .
He has since complained to Local Government Minister Adolf Mwesigye , who chaired the committee , that the report did not reflect his views .
The article ends on an interesting note :
It was hoped , at least according to Dr Buturo , that the Cabinet committee would make certain amendments to the draft law .
As it turned out , the committee critiqued Mr Bahati ’s work so deeply that no amendments were proposed .
Mr Mwesigye said on Thursday that he had no comment to make .
Cabinet is yet to discuss the committee ’s recommendations .
Things are n’t looking good for proponents of this egregious bill , are they ?

Although they sneer at the very notion of religious faith , skeptics and atheists have their own martyrs — high among them Hypatia , the brilliant , beauteous , avowedly virginal fourth - century philosopher , mathematician , astronomer , and Carl Sagan pinup girl .
In Alejandro Amenábar ’s somber and bloody Agora , her big sandals are filled by Rachel Weisz , who has eyes so wide apart they seem made to take in the whole of the cosmos , and British diction so crisp and forceful that her words could carry far into space .
That ’s where we first hear her voice , in fact .
As she mulls over the trajectories of the stars , the camera descends from on high , way on high , above the Earth itself , to Alexandria , the civilized Egyptian outpost of the teetering Roman Empire , and to the stone hall in which Hypatia holds forth while her students ( male , besotted ) drink in her words .
Weisz is an excellent Hypatia .
For all her intelligence , there ’s something childish , off - kilter , vaguely otherworldly in her aura .
She ’s just the type to be gazing into the heavens while around her all hell breaks loose .
The title refers to the public space in front of Alexandria ’s illustrious library , although in light of what happens there , a better one might be Agoraphobia .
The ruling pagan Ptolemies ( among them Michael Lonsdale as Hypatia ’s father , the head librarian ) attack the obstreperous Parabaloni Christians , who prove to be greater in numbers and more ferocious than the pagan pointy - heads anticipate .
When the blood finally dries , the Christian rabble has overrun Alexandria ( and the empire ) , the Ptolemies are kaput , the Jews are ( again ) in exile , and the library — the repository of centuries of Hellenic wisdom — has been turned into a barnyard .
Agora does n’t merely exalt the empirical outlook of Hypatia , it portrays religious faith — all religious faith — as monomaniacal superstition , a fount of anti-truth .
Poor Hypatia is both behind and ahead of the curve .
When the hallowed conceit that the cosmos revolves around Earth looks wobbly , damned if she ’ll fit the data to the doctrine .
She ’ll get to the bottom ( or top ) of it even if humans turn out not to be the be-all and end - all .
Amenábar , who dramatized the schism between flesh and spirit in works as various as The Sea Inside and the ghost story The Others , allegedly did n’t set out to make a movie that cried “ A plague on all your houses of worship ! ”
He and co-writer Mateo Gil stumbled on Hypatia while researching a project about people who , in Gil ’s words , “ managed to rise above the circumstances of the moment of history in which they lived by looking up at the stars and wondering who we are , where we are , and what it all means . ”
Would that we all could be suitable subjects !
In any case , Agora sticks to the arc laid out in Justin Pollard and Howard Reid ’s fast - paced The Rise and Fall of Alexandria .
( Pollard was a consultant . )
It ’s true that Hypatia probably spent more time on Neoplatonism than astronomy , but Neoplatonism would have been , by definition , less visual .
Hypatia also did n’t have a slave - cum - student named Davus ( Max Minghella ) who was torn between his love for her and his burgeoning Christian faith , but Davus makes a good vehicle for dramatizing how even good , educated , imaginative people can be impelled to get their scriptures in a twist .
One of the best moments is when Hypatia ’s onetime student and suitor , the prefect Orestes ( Oscar Isaac ) , pushes through a crowd that wants to rip him to shreds , yelling he ’s as much of a Christian as they are .
Cyril , the bishop who urges his followers to teach Orestes a lesson by visiting their wrath upon his “ witch ” and “ whore , ” is better known as “ Saint Cyril . ”
Given all the weighty colloquia , Agora has remarkably few bad laughs , and the CGI re-creations of ancient Alexandria are so detailed I wanted to freeze the frame and linger on the city ’s layout .
I did keep being jarred by the chief loudmouth Christian stone - thrower , who looks like Topol in Fiddler on the Roof , down to the gap in his front teeth .
But maybe the early Christians are meant to look Semitic — they mostly were .
It ’s too bad Muhammad is n’t in this thing ( he had n’t been born ) , or fundamentalist Christians , Jews , and Muslims could bond on the Agora picket line and just for yuks hurl stones at the women waiting to get into Sex and the City 2 .
The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film .
The SATC dynamic has always been fragile , but at its most affecting you could see beyond the costumes and artifice and feel the characters fighting for validation — and connecting with one another in their struggle .
Now there ’s nothing but surface .
And what a surface .
The film is an epic eyesore .
It ’s as if they set out to make a movie that said , “ You ’re right !
We are hideous ! ”
It begins with the nightmarish manic gaiety of Mamma Mia ! , with strenuous lockjawed smiles that make you think you ’re watching stroke victims .
Then Liza Minnelli shows up to perform a gay marriage .
Heralded ( and hooted at ) as the embodiment of camp unreality , she looks more human — nervous but happy to belong somewhere — than the four leads .
The thinking behind the movie ( written and directed by Michael Patrick King ) is undisguised .
Let ’s start with an over - the - top gay wedding !
Then we ’ll send the girls to Abu Dhabi so they can rile up the fundamentalists with their sexuality !
Then they ’ll make fun of women in niqab ( “ Certainly cuts down on the Botox bill ! ” ) but later show ( campy ) feminist solidarity !
Wo n’t they look great swishing around the desert being waited on by smooth young Arab men ?
Amy Odell , of nymag.com ’s
The Cut , accompanied me to the screening and was kind enough to whisper that a particular dress of Carrie ’s cost 50 grand .
But what ’s the point of spending that much when the cinematographer , John Thomas , lights Sarah Jessica Parker to bring out the leatheriness of her skin ?
How did he manage to mummify the lovely Cynthia Nixon ?
Kim Cattrall , fresh off her witty , subtle work in The Ghost Writer , is costumed to look like a cross between ( late ) Mae West and ( dead ) Bea Arthur .
Kristin Davis gets by ( just ) pulling little - girl faces , probably for the last time .
For all the sniggery double entendres , virtually all of Sex and the City 2 is a pale shade of vanilla .
But there is this one moment … Cattrall , in short shorts in the Arab marketplace , has a flurry of hot flashes , drops to the ground , and writhes around screaming , “ I have sex , yes !
I quite enjoy it ! ”
People coming out of surgery with bad reactions to the anesthesia have been known to behave like that , which gives it some fleeting connection to real life .
Go to my blog The Projectionist for a review of George A. Romero ’s Survival of the Dead , a rambling but surprisingly handsome , well - acted mix of lefty sociology and militant nihilist splatter .

The latest scandal to touch the Absolute Poker / UB network continues to unfold this week , as key players from Cereus stepped up to address player ’s concerns .
The story so far :
Last week , online poker data site PokerTableRatings announced that they had uncovered a flaw in Cereus ’ security that could allow 3rd parties to compromise player accounts , giving hackers access to funds , information and hole card data .
For a full explanation of the flaw , check out the original PTR report .
To date , there are no confirmed cases of this exploit actually being employed .
Nevertheless , concern about the weakness – especially in light of past scandals involving UB and AP – spread quickly throughout the poker community , and traffic to the network plummeted accordingly .
Perhaps learning from the mistakes of the past , officials at Cereus were quick to respond to this issue .
Paul Leggett , COO of Cereus parent company Tokwiro Enterprises , issued a response to PTR within a few hours , and now additional details of the network ’s plan to beef up security have emerged .
Those details have come in the form of a comprehensive FAQ regarding the security issues posted on UB ’s website .
We ’ve excerpted the most vital aspects of the post below :
How can you assure me that the site is secure currently ?
After we learned of the vulnerability , we immediately began implementing an improved method for encrypting data as it transmits between player ’s Clients and our Servers .
We released the new and improved method in less than 24 hours after learning about the vulnerability .
We consulted a team of hackers in order to help us develop this solution , which includes complicated random keys in combination with MD5 encryption .
We have also employed this team of hackers to continually attempt to crack this solution , while we finish our implementation of the Open SSL standard for encrypting data between player ’s Clients and our Servers .
These hackers have been provided with the exact details of how we currently encrypt the data and we ’ve asked them to use that information and attempt to crack the current encryption we are using .
So far they have been unsuccessful at cracking the current encryption solution .
They have assured us that the methods we are currently using are secure and that it will take enormous amounts of resources and time to try to crack this method even with access to our code .
They continue to work on cracking this code but we are confident that no one will be able to hack this solution .
We will also plan to release a new version of our software on Friday , May 14th , 2010 , that will be based on the Open SSL standard .
Cue the “ hackers on UB ’s payroll again ” jokes in 3 … 2 … 1 .
Read the full FAQ .
Also forced to blog about the issue : UB mouthpiece Joe Sebok , who is sounding less and less like a fan of UB these days .
Is it just us or does he sound like he ’s distancing himself from UB in this excerpt ?
Whether it is hand - histories , ownership issues , or security ones like the one above , often I am not in a position to directly answer them as I do not work in Costa Rica at the home offices and actually help run the company .
I advise , and again , try to serve as a conduit for information to flow through when issues are brought up , but in truth I do n’t often have the answers .
I was n’t with UB when many of the negative issues originally happened and thus do n’t always know the answers , but I want to be able to put Paul in a position where he can answer them .
I am hoping that this will bring more truth into the light and hopefully assuage people ’s fears .
… and if it does n’t sound that way there , it certainly does in the next paragraph , where Sebok references the hand histories from the original UB scandal that he ’s still trying to produce for the community :
I always have some frustration at the time that it takes to get things sorted out , as well as the fact that there are some issues on the UB side with retrieving the data occasionally , I ’m usually told that are based in the fact that the Cereus network was began not too long ago and much of that data is held elsewhere .
I would like Paul to write a blog explaining the issue there as well …

But for legions of Google heads , the fact that it feels like a science project adds to the allure .
Working versions of Chromium have appeared across the Web and have been downloaded more than a million times .
By all accounts , the most popular and functional have been on the Web site of a 17 - year - old in Manchester , England , who goes by the Internet handle “ Hexxeh . ”
Liam McLoughlin , as Hexxeh is known to family and friends , is a college student and programmer who has taken Google ’s Chromium code and compiled it so the operating system can be downloaded to a separate USB memory stick , which can then be used to boot up a computer .
He has spent countless evenings and weekends configuring Chromium to work on various kinds of computers , including the Macintosh , and added features that Google has not gotten to yet , like support for the Java programming language .
He explained that his work on Chromium began partly as a way to demonstrate his computing skills and possibly open doors in the technology industry .
It also sprang from an interest and belief in Google ’s computing vision .
“ Many people do n’t care about how PCs work and all the security software that comes with today ’s computers .
They just want to use the Internet , ” he said .
Since last fall , a small but vibrant community has formed around his work , encouraging him with ideas and supporting his efforts by providing money for servers and other programming tools .
Steve Pirk , a former systems engineer at the Walt Disney Company and now based in the Seattle area , helped to support a coding marathon this year by donating $ 50 via PayPal , which Mr. McLoughlin spent on a supply of highly caffeinated Jolt cola .
Mr. Pirk said he tested Hexxeh ’s resulting software , code - named Flow , on a half - dozen computers ; all functioned properly running Chromium from a USB drive .
He says he looks forward to the day when low - powered but fully functional computers running Chrome can help lead to a new wave of telecommuting .
“ The more work we do in the cloud , the less need there is for people to be in physically secure network environments , ” he said .
1. I am here with Chris Wanstrath of GitHub who has been having a lot of success lately an want to talk to you a little bit about that success and where GitHub is going and the interesting stuff about it .
So , first of all , for readers that might not be exactly familiar with what GiHub does just give us the 50000 foot view
We like to call it Social Coding because it 's similar to the sites that have been around 10 years like SourceForge or Google Code even , where that 's a place you go and you put up an open source project so you can share it with everyone else .
GitHub is different , we think , because you are not just sharing it with random people who are googleing for whatever and then landing on your side incidentally .
You are sharing it with your coworkers , you are sharing it with your friends , you are sharing it with people that you know either by reputation or because you 've met them in person .
And so GitHub is a lot more about the people behind the Open Source then just putting up Open Source code .
So I think that 's what makes it different and what makes it really fun for us and the people who are very into the site to use .
3 . You can tell that by what 's public and what 's private right ?
Yes .
There is a very strong line between the two .
So you can host public Open source code or private commercial code on the same account if you want and we try to make it so there 's never any confusion about which is which .
So it 's nice because you can have the same account that you are using during the week doing your work on and if you ever want to experiment something or play with some Open source that you might even pull into your company 's code you can do that from the same place .
4 . Is GitHub just the playground for Rubyists or have other language communities adopted it ?
It used to be the playground for Rubyists and Ruby is still definitely the strongest community on the site .
But we 've seen a lot of growth lately in .NET which has been pretty cool for us , Python is the second biggest dynamic language that 's on the site besides the Javascript .
And then Javascript almost all the major libraries in Javascript use it for their code hosting .
And then Perl we see a lot of that going on so it 's pretty exciting for us because we came out of the Ruby community and that 's what we knew best and this is giving us an opportunity to learn what other communities are doing and kind of like get ideas from them and it's pretty cool because everyone is on the same page and a lot of times there 's solutions in other languages that we have n't even thought of .
We see a Perl project pop up and we say : " That 's a good idea , let 's do that . "
5 . I 've heard GitHub described or compared to the introduction of sexual reproduction in the evolutionary stream .
Is that hyperbole or do you think that ?
It 's an interesting analogy .
I mean the idea is just that with GitHub one of the things we always say , it sounds kind of funny when I say that loud , but it's one of our mantras lowering the barrier to contributing code and releasing code and what we think that 's doing and people have written some blog posts suggesting this as well , is that when it 's easier for you to publish Open source code or modify someone 's else Open source code , the rate at which Open source code evolves just gets faster and that 's a lot like the analogy you are talking about is with reproduction , at first single cells would just split , it was just all like asexual reproduction and then you got to the stage where they would just run into another cell and then some of their DNA would cross over the cell wall and then you get a higher rate of evolution and that 's kind of what we are talking about is that it's a lot easier to take code from someone else to share your code and to kind of evolve a project with something like GitHub and these newer generation of code hosting sites then the classical ones where all you are doing there is publishing a project .
So it 's more about the code then contributing and publishing with GitHub and that 's why some people think it 's making it go faster .
6 . Forking used to be a dirty word .
Forking used to be a dirty word .
That is one of the things I am most proud of is that even in some communities a Fork is a bad thing and something we wanted to do was make it a good word .
We have shirts that say " Fork You " and it kind of sounds like another phrase but the idea is n't kind of like " Fork you and get away from me " , it 's this phrase that at first looks negative is really inclusive and inviting and so for us and GitHub is all about forking where I see your code that you published either internally in our commercial business or as Open source I can fork it which is a branch , I can make my changes to it without asking for your permission and then if you like what I 've done you can pull them in , if not I can keep going .
And the truth is really that this has been happening for a long time .
Even with older tools like subversion you do that , you get an Open source piece of code , you modify it but you never shared that with the outside world and maybe you even forget what it was you did .
You have a little patch that you add to your framework and then when you upgrade your framework there 's a conflict or a regression and you do n't even remember adding that patch and when it 's easy to keep track of that patch that you made you are lot more likely to do anything I think and it kind of helps practicing .
7 . It helps contribute to the overall growth of that community .
Absolutely .
We see a lots of projects where just one person threw out some code and they are pretty good about watching what are people are doing and the project just explodes .
The best example is " ClickToFlash " where it was posted on Google Code ; it 's a Safari plug - in that you block flash on a page , posted to Google code then Google code or the person who posted it just removed it .
He said : " I deleted my project " .
Someone who had a copy of the source code , which is Open source , posted on GitHub ; he was n't the original author of it and then people started forking it , adding features that person has been really diligent about merging in changes and kind of guarding the code and it just has this huge network some forks are doing their own thing and it's just thi growth that I do n't know if it would have happened anywhere else .
And so seeing stories like that pop up more and more is great because this whole model really helps
Open source in that way .
8 . You guys , and by guys I mean you and Tom and I guess other members of you team , are known for championing " Not Invented Here " as a good thing .
And generally that 's been a bad thing , so why do you guys have such innovation going on at GitHub compared to other places ?
I think that the whole our going about and saying not Not Invented Here is a good thing .
It 's not about us trying to be like to oppose the mainstream .
What message we want to get across is " think about what you are doing " .
Just because there is a phrase called : " Not invented here " that has an acronym that you can post in a reddit comment does n't mean that that 's a good thing in all circumstances , so what we are trying to do in our company is always think about everything .
We are the company of the compelling argument and so it does n't matter if there is a phrase that has 1000 years of history behind it , if it does n't make sense in the circumstance we are looking at .
So we try and kind of advertise that by saying , sometimes Not Invented Here is a good thing and we did this for this reason and in all those cases it was because we thought about the situation , we looked at what was out there that would fit our needs , we drew up a list of requirements and if it met our needs we went with the system and if it did n't we wrote our own thing .
I mean every system that we write that 's note invented here there is a hundred other pieces of open source code that we are using somewhere else .
9 . The latest example that is an RPC framework called BERT and Ernie .
How did that come about and what is it ?
That is mostly Tom Preston - Werner innovation .
BERT is to Erlang as JSon is to Javascript , so it 's a subset of the language that could be used to describe data structured in the language .
And the beautiful thing about Erlang is because it 's dynamic it has so many data structures that other languages have : Python , Ruby , Javascript .
So you can express Ruby data structures in Erlang 's binary term format pretty simply .
And so what Tom has done has he 's given it a name and he has written a specification for how to use BERT and what BERT is exactly .
So this is already going on between Erlang processes .
10 .
So this is already production ready .
And then the libraries are BERT RPC and Ernie those are what we use on GitHub right now .
The reason we specifically wanted to do something else or something different is because we handle lots of large binary data .
Big commits , big diffs , big pieces of code we 're constantly sending them back and forth , so for us we needed the kind of Edge case to be priority .
Many systems like JSon , they are great for almost everything except large binary data , let 's say , and so for us that was the main requirement .
So that 's why we did n't go with the JSon RPC system and why we had to evaluate all the systems from that point of view .
12 . You were a victim of your own success , right ?
Yes .
People say is a happy problem we have , but none of us are happy about it .
13 .
Is it further proof that Rails does n't scale like along the lines of Twitter ?
I wish , because I know that a lot of people are really good at Rails and if Rails is our problem I could just call them up am have them fix it .
But no , we 've had lots of other problems specifically dealing with Unix file systems , dealing with , like I am talking about storing large amounts of data accessing it really quickly from all these sorts of web servers that are all spread across different machines .
Keeping it up to date , keeping it backed up , keeping it secure , keep making it fast , this is something that none of us had any sort of experience with and I do n't think a lot of people do , especially with Git .
I mean we are definitely do n't even need to look , we are the biggest Git hosting provider in the world so we are dealing with challenges with Git itself and Unix file system that no one else had done before and so it definitely was really hard for us for the first year and so especially when we started getting really big , kind of figure out how can we make this fast , how can we make it stable .
So our first priority was stability definitely , but making it fast ; that 's what we wanted to do and that 's what we focused on and then once we 've made it fast we started talking to Anchor which is our support team that we use , about : " How do we make it stable ?
You guys are Unix pros ; tell us what you think is the best way to keep machines up to do high availability , to do swap over , I mean what have you guys learned about dealing with big sites , how do we make this site never go down ? "
And so we are not there yet but that is the goal : the goal is the site will never go down and what will happen instead is part of this site will die in isolation in the worst case scenario , but the idea that one of our file servers goes down and brings down the web site , that brings down something unrelated , that should never happen .
So right now there is still a chance because our new system we are growing into , we 're figuring all the pain points , we are getting all the high availability in place , but that 's our goal , no down time for the site as a whole just isolated instances of failure .
14 . GitHub is still relatively young , correct ?
What is the future of GitHub , what is the feature of Chris Wanstrath ?
Is it going to become a huge company or you guys think very small focused on what you are doing ?
I wish I knew .
We are definitely staying focused .
We want to hire more people .
We have 8 people full - time right now , but we want to grow the engineering team .
We want to add more people ; we want to add really good people .
Luckily working on a coding site gives us access to really good people .
We meet people really easily through the site and it gives us kind of a big available pool of hires which is sort of frustrating when we can't afford them all right now and we are not really big enough to really need them all .
But I think we want to have a big company .
15 . GitHub has a commercial model that seems to make sense .
So I for instance from Hashrocket have given you guys quite a bit of money because we have maybe 100 projects on there .
Are there a lot of other companies like us that are using GitHub in that way ?
Does that provide room for you to grow ?
We have almost 10000 paying customers ' accounts and we are growing really quickly and we are adding more and the rate of growth is increasing and what that lets us do is make good decisions .
When we were able to make fund our website , fund the software , the hardware and pay people salaries without having to worry about what people with money want us to do .
I think it 's a really good thing ; it 's put us in a really good position because what we can do now is try and make good decisions based on what our customers want and so our future plans are always based around : " What can we do for Hashrocket , what can we do for the people working at Hashrocket , for the people coding there ? " like what is right now , for instance , one of our primary focused is organizational support is getting better permissions in place , having one person being able to administer a whole group , being able remove people , add people easily and doing things that businesses want , make it easier for businesses because that 's who our customers are .
So we want to be constantly adding features for businesses in Open source users and we want to be doing that because they tell us that they need it and not because we took a big check from some big company .
So for us in our rate of growth having grown as we would have as far as staff goes if we had taken a bunch of money ...
Who is the most influential person in Internet history ?
That argument could go on for years .
But you could make the case that one guy with a pencil has the strange power to make things happen without a company , without a title , and without even asking .
Randall Munroe has influence he never asked for .
His creation xkcd is " A webcomic of romance , sarcasm , math , and language . "
The accompanying blog , which Munroe calls a " blag , " is where he posts everything outside of the thrice - weekly comic .
He 's published several books , too , but it 's the comic that seems to have the biggest impact .
1. THE BALL PIT
When Munroe posted this comic , Mike McHenry was inspired to install a ball pit in his home .
Then Munroe was inspired to make it happen in his own home ( shown at the top ) .
He later enlarged it .
Then Last .fm put one in their office , although it did n't last long .
2. CORY'S COSTUME
When Munroe posted this comic , Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing was just an average - looking guy you might not recognize on the street .
A couple of months later , he showed up at ETech 2007 looking like this .
Since then , the red cape and goggles have become Doctorow 's signature in various comics and animations .
3. NINJA ATTACK
When Munroe posted this comic , it was n't long before Free Software Foundation founder Richard Stallman was given a gift of a katana by two xkcd fans .
He did n't know what to do with it .
Maybe he should have taken lessons .
A few months later , he was mock - attacked by a band of ninjas as he spoke to the debate club at Yale University .
4. INTERNET MAP
When Munroe posted the " Map of the Internet " comic , it inspired Hourann Bosci to create an application to find the location of any IP address on the map .
5. ONLINE COMMUNITIES
In 2007 , Munroe posted a map of online communities , and updated it in 2010 .

Last year , Martin Vargic produced a map that used the data from Munroe ’s online communities in the style of National Geographic maps .
The print is for sale .
6. CHESSCOASTER
When Munroe posted this comic , a new " sport " was born .
Andrew , Chris , Ryan , and Chance recreated the stunt in real life and sent Munroe a photo .
More people sent in pictures , which end up in the Chesscoaster gallery .
See more pictures here .
7. RULE 34
When Munroe posted a comic about Rule 34 , he thought ahead and registered the domain wetriffs.com .
Pictures were , of course , submitted .
Wetriffs is no longer , but the mildly NSFW contents can be viewed via the Wayback Machine .
Rule 34 leads to Rule 35 , which is “ If it does n't exist on the internet , it must be created . ”
8. OPERATING SYSTEM NOT FOUND
When Munroe posted this comic , Dustin Spicuzza was inspired to create software that posted a love note at the startup , with a ominous " Missing operating system " appended .
He also posted warnings about trying this at home .
It could lead to panic , anxiety , and domestic discord .
9. BUTTERFLIES
When Munroe posted this comic , Raffael Mancini was inspired to develop the butterfly easter egg for Emacs .
Only real programmers will understand it .
10 . TASTY AND DIFFICULT FRUIT
When Munroe posted this comic ( be warned : its title is NSFW ) , it caused an explosion of dissenting opinions .
To appease the grapefruit lovers , Munroe took a poll that plots everyone 's opinions on fruit .
A response comic was then posted to reflect the disagreement with the original graph .
11 . BOOM-DE -YADA
Remember the Discovery Channel song that we all sang in 2008 ?
Munroe made his own version , featuring recurring elements from xkcd .
Noam Raby made an animated version , and then there was a live - action version of the comic , and then another featuring some folks you might recognize .
( I ’m the one singing the first boom - de - yada . )
12 . WOOD
On July 7 , 2008 , Munroe posted this comic .
The Wikipedia entry for " wood " immediately sprouted more pop cultural references for wood .
It was the highest traffic that particular entry would ever see .
The entry has since been edited , with the " Pop Cultural References " section removed .
13 . YOUTUBE COMMENTS
When Munroe posted this comic , YouTube was paying attention and made it come true .
Sadly , the " audio preview " comment feature only lasted about a year .
14 . GRAPHING MOVIE PLOTS
When Munroe posted this comic , shown only in part here , Vadim Ogievetsky was inspired to create a generator called PlotWeaver to plot narratives for other movies .
15 . TETRIS
Munroe posted about Tetris Heaven , then followed up with Hell .
It was only a few hours before someone had a working version of the game online .
It is every bit as frustrating as you 'd think .
16 . PACKAGES
When Munroe published the strip " Packages " in 2009 , the punch line was that the kind of things a ‘ bot buys on Ebay could be used to profile the buyer as if he consciously chose those items .
But the idea for an automatic buyer appealed to New Zealand developer Paul Hunkin , who created a program to do just that .
His Python script scanned the Australian auction site TradeMe for cheap items with free shipping .
The bot was given a dollar a day , and could make purchases out of its balance .
He even told us about his purchases on Twitter for about a year .
Hunkin was not the only one who tried it .
In 2014 , a service called Bobcat in a Box launched , inspired by the comic .
You can sign up for $ 30 a month , or any amount above that , and then receive surprise packages bought by their automated system .
You can even set keywords on your account to limit your preferences .
17 . MALAMANTEAU
The comic " Malamanteau " appeared in 2010 .
Munroe did n’t coin the word malamanteau , but he popularized it .
A malamanteau is " a neologism for a portmanteau created by incorrectly combining a malapropism with a neologism . "
Some of those things are explained here .
So , of course , some Wikipedia editors immediately added a page for malamanteau .
It was taken down and re-added several times before the URL for malamanteau was redirected to the page on xkcd , but not before the word was analyzed at The Boston Globe and The Economist .
The kerfluffle spawned a blog called Malamanteau Mania !
that lasted for a couple of years .
Malamanteau survives at Urban Dictionary .
18 . TOP TEN HUNDRED WORDS
In November of 2012 , Munroe posted the comic " Up Goer Five , " which explained the parts of a Saturn V rocket using only the thousand most common words in the English language .
Writing in that manner is not easy .
Munroe had help from his computer , and he eventually posted a text editor that lets you know what words are not in the top thousand .
Even “ thousand ” is n’t in the top thousand .
I put the first paragraph of this article into the editor and found about half the words are verboten .
An earlier text editor based on the idea was even harsher in its word rejection .
The " Up Goer Five " comic inspired Alaska Robotics to rework the song “ Space Oddity ” using only those common words .
The result was the song “ Space Weird Thing . ”
MinutePhysics made a science video explaining space travel using the same technique .
In 2015 , Munroe published a book titled Thing Explainer : Complicated Stuff in Simple Words that takes on quite a few subjects in this manner .
No doubt there are other projects inspired by the many xkcd comics .
If you have any doubts about Munroe 's influence , bear in mind that there have been several sites dedicated to explaining xkcd .
One is still active , and there 's an app that can link each comic to the explainer .
One defunct site that explained the comic was itself parodied by another site , devoted to explaining the explainer .
And another site explains how bad it is .
Of course , there 's an xkcd subreddit .
There ’s even a forum where other artists take xkcd comics and alter them to make them less funny .
( That 's influence . )
Do n't forget to check the hovertext at each xkcd comic for an additional punch line .
The Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign was set up in late 2001 by a group of established Irish human rights and community activists , academics and journalists who were deeply concerned with the current situation in the Occupied Territories .
In partnership with Palestinians now living in Ireland the IPSC was formed to provide a voice for Palestine in Ireland .
We are an independent , non-party political organisation , run by volunteers all committed to a just and sustainable peace in the Middle East .
For the environmentalist who has done it all , from greening their home to decarbonising their travel , there 's a new frontier : greening their pet .
Later this year the UK's 8 m cat owners will , for the first time , be able to feed their kitties their favourite fish with a clear conscience .
In a move announced today , Whiskas and Sheba pet foods are to become the first to sell products using Marine Stewardship Council - certified fish , which is caught sustainably and without threatening further dwindling stocks .
While eight out of 10 cats are likely to have no opinion on the provenance of their fish , Mark Johnson of manufacturer Mars Petcare said people were increasingly aware of the importance of sustainability .
" The End of the Line film [ a documentary about overfishing ] has had a big impact , " said Johnson , the company 's UK general manager .
" We are now the first pet company to make a commitment to sustainable fish , and we hope that will act as a catalyst for the whole industry . "
Supermarkets have been quick to respond to rising human demand for sustainable fish , with the Co-operative eliminating threatened species from its own - brand products and Marks & Spencer recently becoming the first high - street name to sign up to WWF 's new seafood charter .
But pet lovers have so far been limited to giving their animals human food such as sustainably caught tinned tuna : an expensive way to limit their pets ' ecological impact .
While cats and dogs may seem unlikely environmental villains , UK pet owners buy 1.5 m tonnes of food a year and globally there are an estimated 750 m pets who consume 20 m tonnes annually .
The authors of a recent book , Time to Eat the Dog ? , warned that the energy required to feed a cat is the same as that required to build and drive a Volkswagen Golf for 6,000 miles a year .
Robert Vale , one of the authors , has said that poultry and rabbits have a lower impact than red meat and fish when used as pet food .
" When feeding a pet … the advice is to think feathers and long ears , not horns and fins , " he said .
Under the Mars Petcare plan , MSC - certified fish will be available in Whiskas and Sheba brands to all European consumers by Christmas , with certification eventually coming to all the company 's fish products in Europe .
It pledged to source all its fish globally from sustainable sources by 2020 .
The MSC badge is awarded through a voluntary process whereby fisheries approach the council to be assessed under 23 different criteria , followed by an annual audit .
The process can cost $ 150,000 ( £ 100,000 ) ; Mars has said it will absorb the cost of buying the more expensive fish .
Conservation groups WWF and the Marine Conservation Society welcomed the news .
Jason Clay of WWF US said : " There is no quick fix to this problem but when companies as influential as Mars take a leadership role , it is great news for the world 's oceans . "
However , experts also argue that pet food companies need to reduce the prime fish in their products , which is included as whole fillets in some of Mars Petcare 's products but will be phased out under the new initiative .
Callum Roberts , professor of marine conservation at University of York and the author of Unnatural History of the Sea , said : " Clearly it 's more sustainable using certified products than uncertified ones , but what makes me uncomfortable is we are feeding so much fish protein to pets when there is n't enough fish in the world to give everyone a healthy amount of fish in their diet .
" I say this as a cat owner :
Pets are definitely second rate when it comes to eating fish , and should be largely fed by the trimmings market . "

Remorseless German and Austrian boffins have a cunning new plan which could be good news for cutting down on fossil fuel use : they can make " synthetic natural gas " using electric power , water and carbon dioxide .
" Our demonstration system in Stuttgart splits water using electrolysis .
The result is hydrogen and oxygen , " explains Dr Michael Specht of the Zentrum für Sonnenenergie - und Wasserstoff - Forschung ( Solar energy and Waterstuff [ Hydrogen ] Research centre - ZSW ) .
" A chemical reaction of hydrogen with carbon dioxide [ then ] generates methane – and that is nothing other than natural gas , produced synthetically . "
The process is thought to scale up well , with Specht and his colleagues planning to fire up a " double - digit megawatt range " unit by 2012 .
The kit is intended to solve one of the great problems of renewable power supplies - wind , solar and tidal - which is that their electric output is variable and uncontrolled , bearing no relation to demand at the time .
Storing electricity on a large scale can be done by pumping water uphill for later use in hydropower turbines , but this is expensive even where suitable geography exists .
Even with the present , fairly low fractions of wind and solar power seen on the linked grids of Germany and adjacent countries , sudden pulses of renewables output often result in negative electricity prices as renewables operators pay to get their power onto the grid ( and so claim the subsidies which are the principal source of their revenues ) .
" Surplus wind and solar energy can be stored in this manner .
During times of high wind speeds , wind turbines generate more power than is currently needed .
This surplus energy is being more frequently reflected at the power exchange market through negative electricity prices , " confirms Specht 's colleague Dr Michael Sterner .
This is not a good situation for renewables , but scope for expansion of pumped storage at reasonable cost is limited in Germany .
Hence the plan to store surplus electricity as gas , rather than by lifting water .
At the moment , pumped storage has better efficiency - 70 per cent or better of the electricity so stashed can be recovered , compared to the ZSW synthi-natural gas figure of " more than 60 per cent " .
" In our opinion , this is definitely better than a total loss , " says Specht , modestly .
The synthi - gas plan has other things going for it , however , which pumped storage does n't offer .
First off you can store a lot more power , as massive gas storage is already available within the gas grid - to the tune of 200 terawatt - hours in Germany , apparently .
That 's enough to cover months of present - day German gas demand , or alternatively to generate more than two months '
German electricity assuming the gas is used in efficient combined - cycle turbine generators .
Thus Germany could potentially store enough renewable juice in gas form to last it through a days - long midwinter calm of the sort which feasible amounts of pumped storage could probably never cope with .
For nations like Germany and the UK which make massive use of gas in the home and industry , too , supplies of natural gas made sustainably are potentially a secure option compared to Russian imports , though they could never compete on price at the moment .
BP has said the amount of oil recovered from a leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well on Thursday was less than half an earlier estimate .
BP said it had siphoned 2,200 barrels in the 24 - hour period to midnight on Thursday , down from an estimate of 5,000 barrels earlier in the day .
The US government has formed a team to develop a more precise estimate of the amount of oil gushing from the well .
BP will attempt to stem the oil flow next week , instead of Sunday as hoped .
The oil leak began more than a month ago , when a rig leased by BP exploded .
Image caption
Heavy rust - coloured oil has washed ashore , threatening wildlife
The spill has reached Louisiana and is threatening Florida and Cuba .
Thick , sticky oil is washing on to miles of fragile Louisiana wetlands , with brown , foul - smelling globs coating reeds and grasses .
The crude oil has been flowing since the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon exploded off the coast of Louisiana on 20 April and sank two days later .
' Flow not constant '
It was widely expected that BP would proceed on Sunday with a so - called " top kill " operation to plug the well , which underwater video shows to be gushing oil and gas .
But BP chief operating officer Doug Suttles on Friday said the move would be delayed until next week , perhaps on Tuesday .
ANALYSIS
Increasingly , the oil pouring from the Deepwater Horizon spill feels politically toxic .
Under pressure from reporters , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs pointedly refused to say that President Barack Obama had faith in BP as it struggles to contain the spill .
Mr Gibbs denied that the administration was a mere spectator in the unfolding disaster , but acknowledged that only the oil company possessed the technology to address the emergency 5,000 ft , or 1,500 m , beneath the waves .
In the " top kill " operation , heavy mud would be injected to stem the oil flow , then cement used to block the well permanently .
The delay was announced on the same day the company indicated the amount of oil it has been able to capture from the well was significantly less than initially estimated .
A BP spokesman told Reuters news agency on Friday that the company had only siphoned off 2,200 barrels , or 92,400 gallons , in the 24 hours up to midnight on Thursday .
" The flow changes , it 's not constant , " BP spokesman John Curry said on Friday .
But on Thursday , a spokesman had said the company was collecting 5,000 barrels per day or more .
A live video feed showing the oil gushing from the well has been made available by BP after pressure from a US congressman .
It shows a large , flowing plume of oil and gas next to the tube that is carrying some of it to the surface .
Transparency call
It remains unclear exactly how much oil is streaming from the burst well 5,000 ft below the surface , and the US government has formed a multi-agency task force tasked with precisely gauge the amount .
Independent scientists have estimated the flow is as much as 10 times more than the widely distributed figure of 5,000 barrels , or 210,000 gallons , per day .
GULF OIL SPILL Live pictures ( External site )
In the meantime , the Obama administration has asked BP to make public all measurements of the growing leak , air and water quality samples , trajectories of underwater plumes and locations of dispersants .
The request came in a letter to BP chief executive Tony Hayward from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) administrator Lisa Jackson .
It said : " In responding to this oil spill , it is critical that all actions be conducted in a transparent manner , with all data and information related to the spill readily available to the United States government and the American people . "
The officials said that despite claims by BP it was making efforts to keep the public and the government informed , " those efforts , to date , have fallen short in both their scope and effectiveness " .
They said it was " imperative that BP promptly " make public all data on the spill .
Dispersant damage warning
Also on Friday , Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal demanded the federal government and BP commit to long - term clean up efforts until the tainted beaches and marshlands have been restored to their pre-spill state .
And a top coast guard official in Louisiana speculated that oil had washed ashore because the weather had been too calm for the past two days to use chemical dispersants to mitigate the slick .
Image caption
An ocean current is threatening to carry the oil into the Atlantic
The EPA has told BP to use a new dispersant to contain the spill , as fears grow about potential damage from the use of such chemicals .
BP has used a number of dispersants , all approved by the EPA , to try to break up the spill .
It emerged on Wednesday that a small part of the slick had entered the so - called Loop Current , which could take it to Florida and up the eastern US coast .
Florida forecasters said it would be at least a week before the oil reached waters near the state .
Farther south , US officials have been talking to Cuba about how to respond should the spill reach the island 's northern coast .

Infinite USB plug created by Chinese design student
So honestly I ’ve gotten a little bored of all the scandals , internet celebrities , political issues , censorship stories , protests , riots , etc. that China blogs usually cover so I ’ve recently tried to post things that are a bit more fun and quirky – for example , the Chinese version of a Danish bacon commercial , the magic tricks by Liu Qian , the strangely totalitarian dating rules , etc .
Of course , this does not affect Key , Annie , or Nancy – they will continue to do whatever they want .
Also , I trust that most of the other China blogs will cover the usual ( i.e. the new chinadivide , Shanghaiist , China Media Project , China Digital Times , Danwei , Global Voices , ESWN , etc. ) and I hope that they continue to do so .
Also , since I peruse a lot of other blogs , I want to bring in things from some English blogs that the typical " China blog readers " might not read .
Of course , these will still be relevant to China .
This is from Engadget :
They say :
In a world of combustion engines and smoke stacks , we are all sucking in poison with every breath .
Invisible to the eye , each puff of air has innumerable particles that destroy our bodies from the inside .
Some parts of the planet are worse than others ; the following article outlines 10 cities where it ’s most hazardous to breath .
Emissions fall into two categories – ozone pollution and particle pollution .
Today , 1 in every 4 Americans are breathing air contaminated with one or the other ( source : American Lung Association ) .
The very air we breathe has become hazardous to our health .
Statistics from the U.S. EPA show that the average person breathes 3,400 gallons of air every day , with children breathing in more air than adults .
This makes our air supply one of our most dangerous heath risks .
“ Addressing air pollution is the easiest way to be able to fix someone ’s well being … there are all sorts of harmful particulates in the air – link ”
1. Milan
Pm10 – a particularly insidious particle – causes cancer and respiratory problems .
Take a trip to Milan , Italy and you ’ll get more than your fair share .
Legambiente , an Italian environmental group , claims that Milan has more smog than any other European city .
Cars are thought to be the primary culprit , but with a 26 % drop in traffic since January ( thanks to congestion pricing ) the city ‘s residents are hoping the smog clouds blow away .

2. Norilsk , Russia
Blacksmith Institute , an environmental think tank , ranks the Russian city of Norilsk within the top 10 most polluted places in the world .
The world ’s largest smelting plant sits in Norilsk , coating the air with nickel and cobalt deposits .
With adults dying 10 years younger than the average Russian plant worker and children developing serious respiratory diseases , the company has finally started taking curative steps .
They ’ve even pledged to move the plan outside of the city … eventually .

3. Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania
Pittsburgh – the Steel City – has more soot , aerosols , heavy metals and exhaust in its air supply than Los Angeles .
This , with a paltry population of about 335,000 residents ( Interesting note : L.A. has over 10 times as many residents at about 3.8 million . )
When figuring out the cause , researchers are pointing their finger west ; they say dirty air is blowing over from Ohio factories and power plants .

4. Mexico City , Mexico
3,000 buses .
8.84 million residents with the corresponding amount of cars , motorcycles and taxis .
A deep valley , enclosing all of that in a 3 sided bowl of mountains and volcanoes … and you have Mexico City .
Its natural tendency to limit airflow makes it one of the most polluted cities on the face of the planet .
Being 7,400 feet above sea level accentuates the problem .
And what has the government done to alleviate the problem ?
They ’ve started a project to retrofit special filters on 25 diesel buses .
Do n’t ask about the other 2,975 buses , or the 4 million private cars .

5. Linfen , China
Citizens of Linfen , China are strangled by clouds of coal dust as they walk the streets .
The city ’s drinking water is laced with arsenic , the same poison used in various chemical weapons .
Linfen may be the world ’s most polluted city .
China ’s lax environmental controls hold some of the blame .
The fact that Linfen is the heart of China ’s coal production operations does n’t help .

Benzene – a pollutant caused from burning motorbike petrol – and dust particles are 3 times the World Health Organization ’s prescribed limits in Ouagandougou , Barkina Faso .
As a result , cases of cancer and respiratory disease are up considerably .

The air in Beijing , China is literally gorged with nitrogen dioxide .
This is the same pollutant that can fatally damage the human lung .
Pollutants are just as prevalent in surrounding Chinese provinces ; satellite data shows a 50 % spike in breathable pollutants over the last 10 years .
Zhang Lijun , deputy director of the EPA , says the worse is yet to come .
According to Lijun , pollution levels will quadruple over the next 15 years unless China gets a hold on its energy consumption methods .

8. Tianying , China
An industrial city — though China does n’t really have any other kind — in the country ’s northeastern rust belt , Tianying accounts for over half of China ’s lead production .
Thanks to poor technology and worse regulation , much of that toxic metal ends up in Tianying ’s soil and water , and then in the bloodstream of its children , where it can cause lowered IQ .
Wheat has been found to contain lead levels up to 24 times Chinese standards , which are even more stringent that U.S. restrictions on lead .
“ China has a commitment to environmental protection , but it also has a commitment to industry , ” says Richard Fuller of the Blacksmith Institute .
“ It ’s a constant push that ’s mostly won by industry . ”

Los Angeles metro has the United State ’s highest levels of ozone pollution , according to the State of the Air report 2010 ( publisher : American Lung Association ) .
Dr. Norman H Edelman , a chief medical officer for the ALA , says breathing ozone is like “ getting a sunburn on your airways . ”
Constant exposure increases chances of respiratory disease … not good news for those living in La La Land .

Calcutta , India has roughly 18.4 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 residents yearly , eclipsing Delhi , India in the occurrence of the disease .
( Delhi has 13.34 cases per 100,000 residents per year . )
This is despite having less than half the population count .
Apparently , the city ’s high air pollution is the primary cause .
70 % of the Calcutta ’s respiratory diseases are said to be the direct result of air pollutants , according to a recent study by the Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute .
Suspended Particulate Matter ( SMP ) , an air pollutant , should never have a count above 140 in a healthy environment .
In Calcutta the average SPM count is 211 .
Likewise , Respiratory Particulate Matter ( RPM ) count should never pass 60 .
Calcutta almost doubles that figure with a RPM count of 105 .

Rauðafell , Iceland ( yes i know it ’s not a city ! )
Sometimes nature itself contaminates the air we breathe ; it ’s almost as if Mother Nature is protecting herself with proactive measures .
This is especially apparent in the wake of the volcanic eruption in Iceland .
Finnu Tryggvason , a farmer in Rauðafell , had to put down some of 4 of his horses in answer to the eruption .
“ I would have like to keep them a while longer , ” he says , “ but circumstances do not allow for that . ”

Since it was released 50 years ago , the Pill has become a by - word for liberation .
I was on the Pill for a decade – from 16 to 26 .
I would not describe my experience as liberating .
In a blog , Sweetening The Pill , I have detailed how this tiny tablet made me feel – trapped , silenced , suppressed , stagnant .
The Pill made me feel as though I were held hostage , and later , as though I were an addict .
I know I am not the only woman who had , or is still having , problems with the Pill , because I hear from women with stories similar to mine every day .
I am left out of the Pill ’s birthday celebrations ; I ca n’t even thank it for turning me into a women ’s health writer and activist .
It was n’t until I stopped taking this drug that I developed the needed energy , motivation and clarity of thought to write about why I had to stop .
Discussing the arrival of the birth control pill , science - trained financial analyst James Balog , working for Merck Pharmaceuticals in 1960 , remarked : “ The issue then was whether any woman would take a pill every day to prevent the chance she might get pregnant .
They believed nobody ’s going to do that , not when they ’re not sick , and they ’re not sick ! ”
The articles printed in celebration of the anniversary of this event paint the Pill as a cure - all for every female problem , biological or social .
An editorial in The Huffington Post calls it “ small , safe and effective ” , arguing that there has only been one issue with this miracle drug – it liberated women , an issue only to those who do n’t want women liberated .
One night in 2008 my best friend and I were talking about how we had both been feeling very down and detached .
My friend said her interest in life was draining away .
A “ nothingness ” is how I described it – this flat - lining , empty , dulled nothingness .
Our shared despondency included a loss of libido , and it was this detail that made us wonder if the Pill had caused the change in mood .
In the past year , on top of the depression , I had been experiencing intense anxiety and paranoia that over time developed into a constant sense of dread .
Explosions of rage came about from my unease , causing arguments with my boyfriend .
The smallest disagreement slipped me into a cycle of anger and hopelessness .
I felt I was losing my mind .
I was taking the brand Yasmin , which I had requested from my doctor after reading in magazines about its amazing skin- clearing and weight - loss side effects .
My sisters and many of my friends were also taking it .
Yasmin was marketed aggressively in the US , and news of its supposed benefits spread quickly to young women in the UK .
The New York Times recently described Yasmin as the “ go - to drug brand for women ” , which has been sold as a “ quality - of - life ” treatment .
Last year the American FDA , in a landmark move , ordered Bayer Pharmaceuticals to produce a retraction commercial that qualified its claims .
According to Dr Doug Bremner , author of Before You Take That Pill , Yasmin became the most complained - about drug on medications.com , which monitors the side - effects of popular drugs .
Its unique element , the synthetic progesterone drospirenone , which has been linked in 74 lawsuits held against the manufacturer to serious physical side - effects such as blood clots , could also cause extreme mood changes .
The concern over one popular brand had the benefit of provoking conversation between women and highlighting the complex impact of all brands of Pill on women ’s bodies .
I ’d always avoided Dianette , a type prescribed specifically for skin problems , as a few years earlier it had hit the headlines for increasing the risk of depression .
Now I am off the Pill , in retrospect I can see that each of the four kinds of Pill I ’d used had negatively affected my wellbeing .
All contain the synthetic oestrogen ethinyl estradiol plus one of a variety of synthetic progesterones .
All can have negative repercussions on mood as they stop ovulation , flatten natural hormone fluctuations to create a very low unchanging level , produce a deficiency in B vitamins and meddle with the workings of the pituitary gland .
I ’ve discovered mood changes can occur after six months , two years or a decade of taking it , as every woman responds differently .
The Pill enacts a very crude , wide - reaching impact on the body .
As Barbara Seaman stated in The Doctor ’s Case Against The Pill , it is “ like tinkering with nuclear bombs to fight off the common cold ” .
The reproductive system is shut down .
When we talk about the Pill preventing pregnancy , we should also mention it does this with a whole - body effect .
The monthly hormone cycle is integral to many of the body ’s central functions , including the metabolic , immune and endocrine systems .
After 10 years of Pill use , I showed signs of nutrient deficiency , low hormone levels and immunity suppression – with bleeding gums , urinary tract infections , hair loss , poor circulation , hypoglycaemia and rounds of flu - like fatigue , as well as the effect on my emotional state .
As Alexandra Pope and Jane Bennett state in , The Pill : Are You Sure It ’s For You ? : “ The Pill alters at least 150 bodily functions andaffects all your organs . ”
Pope calls the ensuing problems “ quality of life - threatening ” .
I ’d been popping a drug every morning for years knowing only what my doctor had said : the Pill “ regulated ” my periods .
I had always backed it up with condoms .
I had taken it through my teens when I was n’t having sex .
It was an unthinking habit .
It took one lastswitch to another brand , an eye - opening two month break , then six months back on the Pill to make me realise what it had been doing to my body and my mind throughout my adult life .
I came to understandwhy I felt so very sick .
There are only a handful of studies regarding its effect on mood , but they suggest potentially around half of all Pill - takers experience a negative impact .
A 1998 study from the University of North Carolina , a 2001 Kinsey Institute study , a 2005 Monash University study and 2008 Lakehead University research show dissatisfaction with the Pill is widespread .
There ’s research that reveals the health benefits of continuous ovulation , showing consequentially the dangers of cycle suppression .
Yet the Pill is prescribed and taken without care .
This drug accounts for close to half of the $ 16bn women ’s healthcare market and 96 per cent of birth control education for doctors in US medical schools focuses on it .
Last year the NHS introduced a pilot scheme in some London boroughs to provide the Pill without prescription .
Pill use is positively pushed .
At a time when we are more concerned about what we eat , wear and use to clean the toilet than ever , we are celebrating millions of otherwise - healthy women taking a powerful medication every day , for years .
James Balog is right : these women are not sick , they ’re fertile and for just a few days a month .
The Pill is on so high a pedestal that alternatives are undermined in comparison .
Pill - mania has eroded the fundamentals of reproductive rights – choice , freedom and education .
The Pill is handed out to women with acne , PMS , irregular periods , heavy periods .
The Pill has developed into a medication for the disease of being female .
In place of changing society , society decided to fix women .
On the 50th anniversary of the Pill we should stop celebrating the fictionalised revolution of the Sixties and turn our attention to the rebellion underway today .
Young women are ditching the Pill in droves .
They have come to see that the Pill can be harmful , as is the sugar coating used to make us swallow .
Alternatives to the Pill
The diaphragm , aka the cap
This method gave women sexual freedom long before the Pill and has seen a resurgence of interest .
The type currently available requires a doctor ’s appointment for a fitting , but there are two companies – Silcs and ReProtect – developing redesigned one - size - fits - all diaphragms .
The female condom
A new version of the female condom has recently launched in Chicago .
The material has been improved and the price lowered .
The male condom used with spermicide
The effectiveness of all barrier methods can be improved on by using spermicide at the same time .
There are many kinds of male condom on the market , including hypoallergenic .
The non-hormonal IUD
The IUD has gathered a bad reputation as a result of the problems surrounding the 1970s version , the Dalkon Shield .
But the modern design , the ParaGuard , is very popular within Europe for its high rate of effectiveness and convenience .

New Weapons Committe
PRESS RELEASE - 2010 May 11th Toxic and carcinogenic metals , able to produce genetic mutations , have been found in the tissues of people wounded in Gaza during Israeli military operations of 2006 and 2009 .
The research has been carried out on wounds provoked by weapons that did not leave fragments in the bodies of the victims , a peculiarity that was pointed out repeatedly by doctors in Gaza .
This shows that experimental weapons , whose effects are still to be assessed , were used .
The researchers compared the quantity of 32 elements present in the tissues through ICP / MS ( a type of highly sensitive mass spectrometry ) .
The job , carried out by laboratories of Sapienza University of Rome ( Italy ) , Chalmer University ( Sweden ) and Beirut University ( Lebanon ) , was coordinated by the New Weapons Research Group ( Nwrg ) , an independent committee of scientists and experts based in Italy , who is studying the use of unconventional weapons and their mid-term effects on the population of after - war areas .
The relevant presence of toxic and carcinogenic metals found in the wound tissues points to direct risks for survivors , but also to the possibility of environmental contamination .
Biopsies of tissues were performed by doctors of Shifa hospital , in Gaza city , who selected and classified the type of wounds .
Research was conducted on 16 tissue samples belonging to 13 victims .
Four biopsies were taken in June 2006 , during the operation " Summer Rains " , while the others were taken in the first week of January 2009 , during the operation " Cast Lead " .
All tissues were appropriately preserved and then examined by each of the three universities .
Some of the elements found are carcinogenic ( mercury , arsenic , cadmium , chromium , nickel and uranium ) , others are potentially carcinogenic ( cobalt and vanadium ) , others are also fetotoxic ( alluminium , copper , barium , lead and manganese ) .
The first ones can produce genetic mutations ; the second ones can have the same effect on animals , but they are not proven to do the same on people ; the third ones have toxic effects on people ad can affect either the embryo or the foetus in pregnant women .
All metals found in high amounts have pathogenic effects on human respiratory organs , kidney and skin and affect sexual and neurological development and functions .
" Nobody � says professor Paola Manduca , spokesperson for the New Weapons Research Group , genetics teacher and researcher at the University of Genoa � had never conducted bioptic analysis on tissue samples from wounds .
We have focused on wounds made by weapons that do not leave fragments , as the doctors from Gaza reported on them repeatedly .
We wanted to verify the presence of metals that remained on the skin and in the derma .
It was suspected that these metals were present in the weapons that leave no fragments , but it had never been demonstrated before .
To our surprise even the burns provoked by white phosporus contain high amount of metals .
Moreover , the presence of these metals in the weapons implies that they have been dispersed in the environment , in unknown amounts and range ; they have been inhaled by the victims and by bystanders , thus constituting a risk for survivors and for people that were not directly hit by the bombing . "
The research follows two previous studies conducted by Nwrg .
The former was published on december 17th 2009 and statued the presence of toxic metals in areas around the craters provoked by the Israeli bombing on Gaza Strip .
The latter was published on March 17th 2010 and it pointed out the presence of toxic metals in hair samples of Palestinian children of Gaza Strip area hit by Israeli bombings .
Both point to the presence of environmental contamination , aggravated by the living conditions on the ground and often in shelters exposed to wind and dust , due to the impossibility to rebuild housing imposed by the Israeli blockade to the entrance of needed building materials and tools .

One of the biggest trends to recently hit gardening , aside from organic gardening , is the use of heirloom seeds .
That may sound like an intimidating task best left for die - hard gardeners , but it ’s something anyone can do , and the fruit — or vegetables — of your labor will make you glad you gave it a try .
What , exactly , is an heirloom vegetable ?
There are probably as many definitions as there are vegetable varieties , but Bill Pioch of Nature ’s Heirlooms Farm in Lapeer defined it easily .
“ An heirloom vegetable is one that comes from a seed that has been saved and protected from genetic diversity for over 40 years , ” he said .
“ And we ’ve been losing that to bigger farms . ”
In their place , hybrid seeds have been taking over .
Hybrid seeds are created by crossing two selected varieties for a specific purpose , like a sturdier plant or bigger crop yield .
Heirloom vegetables , on the other hand , are old - time varieties , the seeds of which are saved and handed down through generations of families .
Virginia Knag of Thread Creek Farm in Grand Blanc enjoys some of the same fruits and vegetables grown by her great - great - grandmother .
She said her family has divided the rhubarb grown by earlier generations as well .
“ My grandmother used to say that rhubarb is like a spring tonic , ” Knag said .
“ Although it ’s a vegetable it has fruit traits .
We have several kinds of daffodils that she started , and a peony plant that has extremely strong stems .
It does n’t have any of the disease problems that peonies are prone to .
We call it Hannah ’s Favorite , after my great - great - grandmother . ”
According to Knag , heirloom plants “ possess a certain amount of traits the owner warranted saving .
It was n’t always an uncommon thing ; people saved their seeds , ” she said .
“ If you purchased the seeds to start with and saved the seed , you would n’t have to purchase them again .
If you saved the seed from those plants in your crop that are particularly robust and healthy , you will basically have a genome - type plant , particularly adapted to your own specified growing environment .
That ’s definitely a benefit as I see it . ”
Getting started
Check out Web sites like www.seedsavers.org.
“ They will tell you what countries particular vegetables came from , and they ’ll tell you stories about them , ” said Knag .
“ That 's particularly interesting to me , because I live in a place where my ancestor lived . ”
Perhaps the most common heirloom is the tomato .
“ Tomatoes were grown in many parts of the world , ” said Knag .
“ As ethnic communities established themselves here , they brought seeds from their old country that had a particular taste and trait .
It was part of their heritage . ”
Pioch said the best way to start growing your own heirlooms is to buy at least two or three varieties of a vegetable — a tomato for instance .
Once they ’re grown and eaten , save the seeds .
Saving tomato seeds is easier than saving some others .
“ Squeeze the seeds into a jar , adding a little water until they ferment , causing a nasty - smelling foam , ” he explained .
“ That takes about 10 days .
Put them onto a paper plate and dry them for about 30 days .
From there you can put them into an envelope to save for next planting season . ”
Other seeds that are easy to save are beans and peas .
Pioch said they can be left in their pods and cracked open for planting in the spring .
Lettuce is also very easy to seed , as are pumpkins and squash .
The only tricky part of growing heirloom vegetables is that you ca n’t always be sure of your success .
“ They have to be open - pollinated , meaning it comes true to plant when reproduced , ” Pioch explained .
The problem with hybrids , on the other hand , is when they ’re cross-pollinated , you ca n’t be sure of what you ’ll get as an end result , ” Pioch said .
“ Some , however , like the Burpee Big Boy tomato has been successfully cross-pollinated for a great tomato . ”
Once they take off , however , they do n’t require any special treatment .
“ Grow them the same as you would any other vegetable , that ’s it , ” Pioch said .
He recommends using compost and manure aged for one or two years as fertilizer .
The fruits of your labor
The biggest benefit of growing heirlooms is , hands down , their taste and variety .
“ They come in unique tastes , shapes and sizes , ” said Pioch .
“ A tomato can come in bright orange golds and burst like the Northern Lights .
And it has a great tomato flavor .
We all know Roma tomatoes , but look for the San Remo or San Marzano .
They ’re more like a tropical fruit . ”
After years of creating hybrids , taste and nutrient have been sacrificed .
Hybrids have been bred to be picked green and gas - ripened for shipping .
But instead of the old - fashioned juicy , tangy taste , we get a bland impostor .
In addition to easy shipping , higher crop yields have possibly compromised nutrition .
Research , as cited on Seedsaver.org , has shown that newer vegetables and grains are significantly less nutritious than their heirloom counterparts .
“ Every time we ’ve messed with Mother Nature , ” Pioch said , “ we ’ve been haunted by it . ”
GENEVA Ã¢â‚¬â€ 
The UN warned on Monday that “ massive ” loss in life - sustaining natural environments was likely to deepen to the point of being irreversible after global targets to cut the decline by this year were missed .
As a result of the degradation , the world is moving closer to several “ tipping points ” beyond which some ecosystems that play a part in natural processes such as climate or the food chain may be permanently damaged , a United Nations report said .
ADVERTISEMENT
The third “ Global Biodiversity Outlook ” found that deforestation , pollution or overexploitation were damaging the productive capacity of the most vulnerable environments , including the Amazon rainforest , lakes and coral reefs .
“ This report is saying that we are reaching the tipping point where the irreversible damage to the planet is going to be done unless we act urgently , ” Ahmed Djoghlaf , executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity , told journalists .
Djoghlaf argued that extinction rates for some animal or plant species were at a historic high , up to 1,000 times those seen before , even affecting crops and livestock .
( Picture atop article depicts the tiny Kihansi Spray Toad , which once numbered at least 17,000 in Tanzania )
The UN report was partly based on 110 national reports on steps taken to meet a 2002 pledge to “ significantly reduce ” or reverse the loss in biodiversity .
ADVERTISEMENT
Djoghlaf told journalists : “ There is not a single country in the world that has achieved these targets , we continue to lose biodioversity at unprecedented rate . ”
Three potential tipping points were identified .
Global climate , regional rainfall and loss of plant and animal species were harmed by continued deforestation of the Amazon rainforest , the report said .

Many freshwater lakes and rivers were becoming contaminated by algae , starving them of oxygen and killing off fish , affecting local livelihoods and recreation for local populations .
And coral reefs were collapsing due to the combined blow of more acid and warming oceans , as well as overfishing , the UN found .
ADVERTISEMENT
UN Environment Programme ( UNEP ) director general Achim Steiner underlined the economic value and returns of “ natural capital ” and its role in ensuring the health of soil , oceans and the atmosphere .
“ Humanity has fabricated the illusion that somehow we can get by without biodiversity or that it is somehow peripheral to the contemporary world , ” Steiner said .
“ The truth is we need it more than ever on a planet of six billion heading to over nine billion people by 2050 . ”

The report argued that biodiversity was a core concern for society that would help tackle poverty and improve health , meriting as much attention as the economic crisis for only a fraction of the cost of recent financial bailouts .
It advocated a new strategy to tackle the loss alongside more traditional steps such as the expansion of protected natural areas and pollution control .
They included attempts to regulate land consumption , fishing , increased trade and population growth or shifts , partly through a halt to “ harmful ” or “ perverse ” subsidies .
The issues raised by the report are due to be discussed at a UN biodiversity meeting in Japan in October .
They are clinging to the hope that senior Labour figures will find an emergency means of getting around the rules and installing a leader who is acceptable to them .
They were given hope yesterday by Lord Mandelson , who appeared to imply that a way could be found to install a new leader more swiftly .
Asked by Sky News if a Labour minority or coalition government that did not have Mr Brown as prime minister was inconceivable , Lord Mandelson said : “ Frankly there are quite a number of permutations .
I am not ruling out or ruling in anything . ”

The widespread toxin bisphenol - A ( BPA ) damages the intestines and may lead to a painful condition known as leaky gut syndrome , according to a study conducted by researchers from the National Institute of Agronomic Research researchers in Toulouse , France , and published in the The study " shows the very high sensitivity on the intestine of BPA , " the National Institute of Agronomic Research said .
BPA is used to make hard clear plastics for products such as water and baby bottles .
It is also used to make dental sealants and composites , and is in the liners food cans , beverages and infant formula .
More than 130 studies have linked the hormone - mimicking chemical to a wide variety of health problems , including cancers , birth and reproductive defects , obesity , early puberty onset , behavior disorders and brain damage .
In the new study , researchers exposed both living rats and human intestinal cells to a dose of BPA 10 times lower than that currently considered safe by most governments .
They found that the permeability of intestinal cells in both humans and rats decreased upon exposure to the chemical .
The intestinal lining developed damage characteristic of the condition known both as " poor intestinal permeability " and " leaky gut syndrome .
" Normally , a mucus lining prevents undigested substances from passing through the intestinal lining and into the bloodstream .
When this lining is damaged , however , toxic substances and foreign pathogens can enter the body more easily .
Because the intestinal lining also contains immunoglobin A , its disruption can affect the entire body 's immune system .
People with leaky gut syndrome often experience abdominal pain , digestive upset , rashes , hampered immune function and chronic muscle pain .
Damage to the intestinal lining can cause poor nutrient absorption , leading to vitamin and mineral deficiencies .
Adding to the body of evidence that BPA is particularly dangerous to developing fetuses and children , the researchers found that exposure to BPA in utero or immediately after birth significantly increased rats ' risk of developing severe intestinal inflammation as adults .

A Sydney woman has died after her Islamic head dress got caught in a moving go - kart in the New South Wales town of Port Stephens .
The woman in her 20s was driving the go - kart at Bob 's Farm in the town north of Newcastle when her head covering got caught in the axle and wrapped around her neck yesterday .
She suffered serious neck and throat injuries and was flown to Newcastle 's John Hunter Hospital , but she died .
The owner of the track says he warned the woman it was not wise to wear the head dress .
He says the track has been operating for 10 years with an unblemished safety record .
Police are preparing a report for the coroner .
A WorkCover inspector conducted preliminary investigations at the site yesterday afternoon .
WorkCover issued prohibition notices on two go - karts .
One was not registered and the other had insufficient guarding .
EDITOR'S NOTE ( April 9 ) :
The ABC was initially told the victim of the accident was wearing a burqa .
This story has been corrected to reflect police statements that the woman was wearing a head dress .
In the month since BP 's oil rig exploded in the US Gulf Coast , what has struck me the most is not , unfortunately , the magnitude of the spill , the damage caused that is likely to continue for decades , the inability of BP or federal agencies to clean up – much less stop – the spill , or the revelations of BP 's pre-explosion lobbying , which likely contributed greatly to the disaster taking place .
I have instead been most moved by the rapid , overwhelming and broad - based demand from people all across the US and the world for a fundamental rethinking of just how far they are willing to let Big Oil go in pursuit of the world 's remaining oil .
As I prepare for the annual general meeting of the fourth largest global oil company – Chevron ( BP is the third largest ) – I am confronted daily by people who are looking around their own communities and out across the world with new - found attention to the deep costs paid every day for our oil addiction .
A new alternative annual report for Chevron , The True Cost of Chevron , of which I am an author and the editor , will be released at a press conference on 25 May in Houston , Texas – just a few hundred miles from the sites where oil is washing up on shore following the explosion on BP 's rig .
Written by dozens of authors from 16 countries and 10 states from across the US who either live in , or advocate on behalf of , communities where Chevron operates , the report criticises Chevron 's record on human rights , the environment , the climate , public health , worker safety and treatment of indigenous populations .
From Chevron 's coalfields in Alabama to its oil wells in Indonesia , the report examines operations mired in accusations of human rights abuse ( Angola , Burma , Indonesia , Chad and Nigeria ) ; mass environmental and human health devastation ( including Ecuador , Kazakhstan and Canada ) ; toxic abuse of its neighbours ( including Alabama , California , Mississippi , Texas , Thailand and the Philippines ) ; abuse of its workers ( including Utah ) ; threats to endangered species ( including Australia and the US Gulf Coast ) ; and , in Iraq , intensifying the violent insurgency and putting the lives of US and Iraqi service members at greater risk .
There is also a powerful silver lining .
All of these authors are part of a global resistance movement bringing its message to Houston where Chevron is hosting its AGM .
It has likely been 40 years since the American public in particular , was so ready to hear and embrace this message .
In 1969 , a Unocal ( now Chevron ) oil platform off the coast of California experienced a massive blowout and the issue forced its way to the nation 's attention .
Activists organised against offshore drilling in their community , ultimately enlisting millions of supporters and advocates , spawning a massive environmental movement which , within just a few years , achieved the establishment of the US Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the US Clean Air and Clean Water Acts .
The communities most directly harmed by oil 's abuse are organised , networked and ready .
The public is roused , angered and ready to act .
The oil corporations are on notice : the true cost of their operations is simply too great to bear .
For as long as we continue to use oil , the operations of its providers will be restricted , reined in , regulated and , ultimately , retired .

Organizers of the Capitol Hill Block Party are scrambling today to muster community support for adding an additional day of rock n roll and hip hop to the 2010 edition of the annual music festival , according to a City of Seattle official .
According to Virgina Swanson who heads up the special events permitting process for the city , Block Party organizers came to her to request that a third day be added to the event ’s permit which currently allows for the festival to take over the streets in central Pike / Pine on Friday , July 23 and Saturday , July 24 .
Before the third date will be permitted , Swanson said organizers must show “ significant ” community support for the extra day .
“ We wo n’t permit it unless the majority of the businesses and residents sign off , ” Swanson told CHS .
Swanson said organizers must bring the city a sheet with collected signatures from people they have talked to indicating their support — or non support — for the addition .
According to Swanson , Block Party organizers Dave Meinert and Grady Chapman are out beating the pavement of Pike / Pine today in a rush to gather community support from businesses and residents that will be affected by adding a third day to the popular festival .
She said organizers have asked for a special meeting on Friday with her to discuss the third day because a major act ’s participation in the Block Party hinges on a Sunday appearance .
“ We ’re going to meet with them tomorrow and see what he produces , ” Swanson said of Meinert ’s signature drive .
“ They ’re up against a real tight timeline .
They ’re out there all over the community today . ”
One place they are not , however , is the Internet .
A search of the Fuzed Music and Capitol Hill Block Party marketing and communication sites and accounts does n’t turn up any mention of the community outreach .
And the group did n’t turn to Block Party presenter The Stranger to get the word out either .
CHS found out about the scramble from a person who attended a community meeting where Meinert made his pitch .
We ’ll contact Meinert and Chapman to ask them more about the Sunday addition and update this post when we know more .
If Meinert and Chapman do n’t make it your way , you can e-mail Swanson at virginia.swanson@seattle.gov with your message or support — or non support — for the Sunday addition .
Beyond concerns about impacts to the businesses and residents of adding a third day of street closures , crowds and noise , Swanson said she is also concerned about a plan for the extra day of the festival to go until 10 PM on a Sunday .
We wrote about some of the community gripes about CHBP last summer .
The summer party of loud music and good times on the streets of Pike / Pine draws more than 10,000 people to Capitol Hill to hear an eclectic mix of national , local — and local heroes gone national ! — acts .
It is organized by Meinert ’s Fuzed Music , a Hill based music management and consulting company and sponsored by The Stranger , KEXP , Caffe Vita , Miller Highlife and several other national and local brands .
Last year , advance tickets cost $ 22 per day .
There is no price information on the CHBP Web site for the 2010 festival and the links to vendor TicketsWest were broken .
UPDATE 3:58 PM :
CHS spoke with organizer Dave Meinert this afternoon about the effort to secure a permit from the city that will allow a third day for the annual Capitol Hill Block Party .
“ There ’s a demand to make the Block Party bigger , ” Meinert said .
“ We do n’t really want to make it bigger as far as booking bigger bands or taking up more space .
But adding a day accomplishes that . ”
Meinert told CHS he expects the third day would draw an additional 5,000 to 6,000 people to the Hill for the weekend pushing attendance over the 20,000 mark .
That would be a boon for the festival , local businesses that benefit from it — but also an increase in the negative aspects of the event like noise and trash .
Meinert said he has documented the support of 27 area business for Friday ’s meeting with members of the city ’s Special Events Committee .
Getting residential support ?
That ’s another story .
“ It ’s difficult to reach the people that live around here , ” Meinert said .
He gave an example of the condo building across the street where he was n’t even able to find somebody to buzz him in .
“ It ’s a challenge but we ’ve already had a dialogue with people who live in one building that will improve the experience . ”
Meinert said that after talking with a resident , he thinks there ’s a way to make adjustments to one of the three stages to reduce the impact of noise on residents in one particularly impacted building .
Meinert said he ’s also ready to go farther to make the Party work with mitigation solutions like offering up hotel rooms for the weekend , free tickets and freebies at local businesses .
“ A lot of the people who live here , go , ” Meinert said about residential support for CHBP .
“ We want it to work for people who do n’t . ”
Meinert might also face renewed opposition from businesses in the area that feel left out of the Block Party process .
We ’ve heard about a few business owners who plan to use this opportunity to have a better dialogue about their needs with festival organizers .
As for the scramble to document support this week , Meinert said he ’s been asking for the city to make a decision on the third Block Party day since March but that he had to push for a meeting this week as a decision on a big headliner loomed .
“ The decision is going to be made tomorrow , ” Meinert said , even if the city does n’t decide on the permit .
“ If we do n’t know tomorrow , we lose them . ”
Still , Meinert said , if the third day is n’t approved this year , organizers will work to include it in the plans for 2011 and beyond .
“ We do n’t want to be Bumbershoot .
We do n’t want to be Sasquatch , ” Meinert said .
“ But there ’s a demand for more . ”
You can read Meinert in his own words in the comment below for more .
He said he planned to contact CHS about the situation after talking to a local organization and residents that said they get their news about the neighborhood from the site .
We just beat him to it .

Will Big Companies Really Be Able to Resist Sprawl ’s Siren Song ?
Northrop Grumman ’s current offices in Virginia .

The Harvard Business Review piece about forward - thinking businesses moving to urban rather than suburban locations continues to attract hopeful attention around the Streetsblog Network .
But as some bloggers are pointing out , the trend — if it is one — is far from clear - cut .
First , FABB Blog ( the blog of Fairfax Advocates for Better Bicycling ) asks whether the Virginia county ’s recent withdrawal of support for bicycling infrastructure funding will make it less appealing to businesses in the future , in part because many young workers want to live and work in less car - dependent communities :
We ’ve seen this shift in the increase in people who are choosing bikes for transportation .
They are mostly younger people who are sick of being stuck in traffic , of paying $ 3 / gallon for gas , and who want better bike facilities .
Communities like DC , NYC , and Arlington County understand this shift and are changing their environment in response .
Older , less progressive communities like Fairfax are finding it difficult to move away from the older mindset of moving more people in more cars on wider roads .
FABB
Blog cites the example of a suburban office park that is vying to be the new headquarters of Northrop Grumman .
As discussed on Greater Greater Washington , the aerospace and defense technology firm ’s other option is in Ballston , a more transit - friendly community in Arlington County , Virginia .
But GGW is skeptical that employee desire for the better commuting options offered by the Ballston location will be a deciding factor — or whether the old - school benefits offered by sprawl will prevail :
In the immediate sense , employers do n’t directly benefit from reducing car trips or pay for increasing them .
Employees benefit through better transit or pay through worse traffic on commutes , but the traffic impact also gets spread out to all other users of the roadways .
The companies benefit in the long run , but often make choices based on short - term costs and benefits .
As a result , large employers like Northrop have strong economic incentives to choose sprawling areas with cheaper land , where they do n’t have to worry about sharing any space with pesky retail and only their employees , the region , and the company ’s long - term competitiveness lose out .
This dynamic often pits more walkable , inner jurisdictions like DC and Arlington against sprawlier ones like Fairfax , but not always .
As Fairfax builds Tysons Corner into a real city , they ’ll face similar issues within the County .
Will Metro be enough of an incentive for corporations to headquarter in Tysons , or will they continue to lean toward the easy yet harmful route of picking the sprawliest office parks ?

Google is being accused of double standards after a decision to censor the placement of ads for a dating site catering for " cougars " - older women who seek the company of younger men .
The internet company has taken an unusually moralistic standpoint on advertisements for the cougar dating website , refusing to serve the company 's ads into third - party websites because it deems them " unsafe for family audiences " .

The ads had been running since last October .
Comment : look here for an analysis of the new particle which was found in LHC .
The Higgs Boson belongs to a family of particles which , by definition , are massive , elementary and spinless .
So far it has been assumed that such particles really exist , and scientists even won Nobel prizes for allegedly finding a particle from this family .
Based on the knowledge existing today , this kind of particle has clearly not yet been found .
This fact has now become common knowledge , as illustrated , for example , by the Klein–Gordon equation or Higgs Boson entry in Wikipedia .
Are we about to witness the discovery of the first particle belonging to this family , as predicted by the Standard Model ?
Can spinless , massive elementary particles exist at all ?
Some definitions
There are particles which always travel at the speed of light , such as the photon , which have no self - mass because they are never at rest .
Another kind of particles is called “ massive ” , they rest or move at a speed lower than the speed of light , and their mass is defined as their resting mass .
Experiments show that there are some particles in nature , with a volume smaller than the experimental detection threshold , and they are assumed to be point - like particles .
These particles are called “ elementary ” , and the most famous of them is the electron .
Various measurements show that the quark , residing within the proton , is a point - like particle as well .
Today , there are 24 known point - like particles that have a mass : six quarks , three types of neutrinos , three types of electron - like particles , and their anti-particles .
All of these particles have spin 1/2 .
Some history
In the middle of the 1920s , Schrödinger tried to find an equation that would describe the electron ’s quantum behavior .
He used the experimentally well - known energy levels of the hydrogen atom to test the validity of his equation .
He first tried to use an equation later called “ The Klein - Gordon Equation ” but realized that it did not yield the desired results .
He thus developed the Schrödinger Equation , describing a massive elementary particle .
This equation , published in 1926 , was considered as a breakthrough , but had a few drawbacks : it did not take the spin into account , and was not coherent with the theory of Special Relativity .
In 1927 , Pauli published the Pauli Matrices , which extend the scope of the Schrödinger equation and treat the electron as a particle with spin .
A year later , Dirac published the Dirac Equation , describing an elementary particle , while being coherent with Special Relativity .
The Dirac Equation gave an excellent description of the electron , which was the only massive elementary particle known at the time .
The Dirac Equation explains the spin of the electron , as well as the magnetic moment associated to it .
Another outcome of this equation is the existence of an anti-particle for each of the particles the equation applies to .
This result is considered today as an inalienable asset of particle physics .
The Dirac Equation minimized Pauli ’s achievement .
It is , therefore , easy to understand why Pauli used to tease Dirac in different occasions .
He said about Dirac , who was atheist : “ There is no God and Dirac is his prophet ” ( [ 1 ] , page 138 ) , and following the publication by Dirac of an article about magnetic monopoles , Pauli named him “ Monopoleon ” ( [ 1 ] , page 343 ) .
In 1934 , Pauli and Weiskopf revived the Klein - Gordon Equation , describing spinless particles .
However , spinless particles were not known at that time .
When publishing the article , Pauli himself admitted that he did n’t find any use for the equation , but that he was happy that he “ can again cast aspersion on my old enemy – the Dirac theory of the spinning electron ” ( [ 2 ] , page 70 ) .
Dirac contested this equation , and published throughout his life several arguments explaining why it was invalid .
But the scientific community ignored Dirac , whether for relevant reasons , or because they attributed his position to his rivalry with Pauli .
Since the revival of the Klein - Gordon Equation by Pauli and Weiskopf , it has often been used to predict new elementary particles .
The Yukawa Particle
In his attempt to explain the “ Strong Nuclear Interaction ” , which is the force holding the protons together in the nucleus , the Japanese physicist Yukawa invented the idea of a particle carrying the force .
According to Yukawa ’s
Theory , published in 1935 , this force - carrying particle was elementary , massive and spinless , and therefore could be described by the Klein - Gordon Equation .
Yukawa also gave an evaluation of the particle ’s mass .
In 1947 , a spinless particle was found , whose mass corresponded to Yukawa ’s evaluation , and Yukawa won the Nobel Prize in 1949 .
But after the discovery of the quarks , it turned out that this particle , the pi-meson , is composed of a pair of quark and anti-quark , was not elementary , and could not carry the Strong Interaction .
Why can there be no Yukawa particle ?
When Yukawa constructed the quantum function for his particle , he used a “ real ” function as a solution to the Klein - Gordon Equation .
It is important to note here , that the notion of a “ real ” function was different from the admitted structure of Quantum Mechanics .
And in fact , Quantum Mechanics uses what mathematicians call “ complex functions ” .
These functions are used as solutions of the quantum equations and describe the physical properties of massive particles .
There is a profound reason for using complex functions in describing massive particles .
A massive particle can be at rest , so that a real function describing its state should be time independent .
On the other hand , in Quantum Mechanics , the particle ’s variation with time is related to its energy .
But for a particle which does n’t change in time , a quantum function of real numbers implies that the particle ’s energy ( and mass ) is zero .
For this reason , a massive particle cannot be described using a real function , which means that the mathematical structure of Yukawa ’s particle is wrong from the start .
This error may seem fundamental , and people may find it hard to believe that a major physicist such as Yukawa could have gone wrong .
It turns out , however , that not only great physicists can and do make mistakes , but that this specific error is taught as a valid theory up to this very day and it features in the textbooks .
A more precise and formal demonstration of this contradiction is brought in the first link on the page “ A challenge to physicists ” in the present website .
It would be plausible to assume that the source of the error was the application of calculation methods corresponding to the mass - less photon , to calculate a massive particle .
But this shortsightedness , discovered by Eliyahu Comay over 60 years later , proves that major errors may find their ways into basic textbooks and remain in the foundations of entire theories .
Comay admits that he himself took part in this shortsightedness for decades , and only after discovering additional contradictions in Yukawa ’s theories , he decided to thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of Yukawa ’s particle .
The Klein- Gordon Equation in the test of experiment
In 1934 , when Pauli and Weiskopf recycled the Klein - Gordon Equation , very little was known about elementary particles , and in this respect , theoretical physicists were groping in the dark .
Even Pauli admitted that his revived Klein - Gordon equation “ had little to do with reality ” ( [ 2 ] , page 70 ) .
In the 1940s , several such particles have been discovered , the most famous of which were a group of 3 particles called pi-mesons , or in short – Pions .
The discovery of these particles was followed by a major rush of physicists toward the work of Pauli and Weiskopf .
In the 1960s , the existence of quarks was recognized and established .
It turned out that these quarks actually compose the pions , among others , and that they were actually the building blocks of all the spinless particles discovered in experiments .
Hence , no spinless elementary particle is known today .
We are therefore back to point zero , when Pauli complained in 1934 that there are no known particles for which the Klein - Gordon equation can apply .
On the other hand – the point - like massive elementary particle family grew substantially , and it turns out that they all have spin 1/2 , as implied by Pauli ’s “ enemy ” - the Dirac equation .
The errors of the Klein - Gordon Equation
The problematic nature of the Klein - Gordon ’s Equation is not limited to the real functions used by Yukawa .
There are fundamental flaws in the complex solutions of the equation as well .
Some of these flaws had already been mentioned by Dirac .
Comay ’s article ( [ 3 ] , chapter 4 ) mentions at least 3 additional contradictions .
The most interesting of them shows how physicists , while being fully aware of the ensemble of Physics ’ laws , fail to understand the deep connections between these laws .
The point is this : the Lagrangian density and the Variational Principle yield a differential equation which constitutes a particle ’s equation of motion .
Another differential equation can be obtained from a quantity called “ Hamiltonian ” , which yields a first order differential equation in time .
A non-physicist reader should realize that Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are not simply the names of famous Armenian physicists .
These are physical and mathematical notions , which yield two differential equations describing the same particle .
Both are derived from the same original equation – but each of them is obtained from a different mathematical development .
Fortunately , it turns out , that with the Dirac equation , these two equations miraculously unite !!
The Klein- Gordon Equation was n’t as lucky .
The two equations deriving from it do not unite , and even end up contradicting each other .
Therefore , the Klein - Gordon Equation cannot be correct …
Another flaw specified in this article ( understandable only to physicists ) is that it is not possible to build a consistent inner product for Hilbert Space , because the density function of a complex Klein - Gordon particle depends not only on its wave function , but also on the potential defined by an external source .
This potential can vary with time and disrupt the definition of the Hilbert Space inner product .
One of the common features of natural laws , is that if a theory is wrong – nature has many ways to show it .
Why can there be no Higgs
The Higgs Boson is a massive , elementary , spinless particle as well , predicted some 50 years ago and not yet found .
Its existence is crucial for the Standard Model Theory .
Many billions of dollars have been invested until today in order to find it , and many billions are still expected to be spent for the same purpose in the few coming years .
The Higgs Boson Equation is a kind of an extension of the Klein - Gordon Equation .
Both equations describe a spinless particle .
And the flaws characterizing the Klein- Gordon equation apply to the Higgs equation as well .
The reliance of Physics on the Mathematical sciences is deep and fundamental ( cf. discussion of this issue in Mario Livio ’s book : “ Is God a Mathematician “ ? ) .
Therefore , the Higgs boson , predicted by a flawed mathematical instrument , does not exist .
The W and Z Bosons
The W and Z bosons are two spin -1 massive particles .
The Standard Model assumes these two are elementary particles that carry the weak force .
The Standard Model equations of the two particles suffer from similar problems as the Higgs boson equations .
The issue can be noticed once one considers the classical counterpart of these equations , namely the Proca Lagrangian .
The theory associated with this Lagrangian describes a massive photon .
The matter described by the Proca Lagrangian is fundamentally different than matter as is known to science [ 4 ] .
This casts doubt on its validity , and may be one theoretical reason behind the failure to find such matter .
Indeed , the experimental upper limit of the photon mass is 23 orders of magnitude lower than that of the electron .
Electrodynamics and the strong force are the domains of Comay ’s main scientific work , leaving the weak force domain to others .
However , as you may have noticed by now , he likes asking questions when he notices theoretical difficulties .
Comay recommends that the scientific community keeps an open mind when interpreting the W and Z bosons findings .
As an example , the theoretical issues described above stem from the assumption that W and Z are elementary particles .
Dropping this assumption opens the door to other interpretations , such as that W and Z particles are not elementary Bosons , but Mesons of the Top quark .
The fact that the Top quark is more massive than the W and Z particles serves as a positive sign regarding such a direction , and so is the absence of any Top quark meson from the PDG table of Mesons .
Comay believes that the last word has not yet been said regarding these questions , and it is worthwhile to leave it open for a further consideration in the future .

Et prosjekt har startet for å få Concorden i luften igjen etter den fatale ulykken i 2000 som kostet 113 mennesker livet .
Håpet er at flyet vil ta del i åpningsseremonien under OL i London i 2012 .
Franske og engelske ingenører startet denne uken undersøkelser av motorene for å se hva som må gjøres for at de skal fungere optimalt , skriver bbc.com
Prosjektet har en foreløpig prislapp på 15 millioner pund , litt over 140 millioner norske kroner .
Vil fly igjen
Entusiaster er klar på at Concorde vil fly igjen , det er bare et spørsmål om når .
- Vi har hele tiden hevdet at flyet skal kunne fly igjen , og resultatet fra undersøkelsene av motorene vil gi oss en pekepinn på hvor nærme vi er for å stå for våre påstander , sier vise - styreformann i British Save Concorde Group Ben Lord til bbc.com
Testingen av motorene vil kunne fastslå om det er sikkert å starte de kraftige Rolls Royce - motorene .
- Etter testen i dag vil vi vite nøyaktig hva som må gjøre med de fire motorene for å kunne ta prosjektet til neste steg .
Målet nå er å kunne gjennomføre en " ground taxi " , forteller Lord .
For syv år siden ble det supersoniske passasjerflyet pensjonert i kjølvannet av den eneste fatale ulykken flytypen opplevde .
Styrtet etter take - off
I 2000 styrtet superjeten like etter take - off .
Flyet kjørte over en titansplint fra et Continental Airlines ( CO ) fly som hadde tatt av like før Concorden skulle ta av .
En fransk aktor har tatt ut tiltale mot fem personer relatert til CO .
Rettsaken etter ulykken ble avsluttet fredag denne uken .
En kjennelse er ventet 6 . desember .

At the other extreme is the Olympic swimmer Dara Torres .
“ I do n’t need a ton of warm - up to be ready for my races , ” she said .
Her warm - up is just “ some light swimming , kicking and drills , ” followed by a few sprints .
Exercise researchers say they are not surprised by the lack of consensus on warming up .
There is a theory of why it should improve performance , but there is dearth of good research on whether it actually does .
The theory , said Paul Laursen , a performance physiologist at the Millennium Institute of Sport and Health , in Auckland , New Zealand , is that muscles contract better after they have already been contracting .
As a muscle warms up , the force of its contractions can be charted like a staircase : when it starts to work , the contractions may be only half as strong as they are after it has contracted a few times .
The explanation is that the contractions release calcium ions in the cells , enabling the muscle fibers to contract more forcefully .
At the same time , muscle enzymes , which work best when slightly higher than body temperature , heat up and become more efficient .
That may be why the elite male marathoners did well after their slow shuffles .
“ Despite the fact that they can go so fast , ” Dr. Laursen said , it will take only a few muscle contractions for their muscles to warm up effectively for their long duration event . ”
But the story may be different for shorter events .
Dr. Laursen said that athletes might do best with a high - intensity warm - up , the sort that Andy Hampsten did ; that can allow fast - twitch muscle fibers to contract more efficiently and can prepare the nerve fibers and the cardiovascular system for an all - out effort .
That , at least , is the theory .
What ’s missing is evidence showing actual effects on performance .
There ’s almost nothing credible , as Andrea J. Fradkin an exercise researcher at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania , discovered when she searched for published studies on warm -ups .
Most of the research was done in the 1960s and ’ 70s , she told me , and its quality was poor .
After a run to the conference finals in 2008 , the Dallas Stars have fallen on some down times .
The conference finals team was stocked with veterans , and those veteran players left the Stars shortly thereafter .
Jeff Halpern , Sergei Zubov , Stu Barnes , Philippe Boucher , Mattias Norstrom , and Antti Miettinen all left the Stars in 2008 - 2009 through free agency , injury , retirement or trade .
Dallas general managers Lee Jackson & Brett Hull chose to replace those veterans with an assortment of kids and then vastly overpaid Sean Avery .
The results were poor , to say the least .
Sound familiar ?
I asked NBC's Brandon Worley , Managing Editor of ProHockeyTalk , and long - time Managing Editor of Defending Big D here at SB Nation , about the situation .
" The Dallas Stars are going through the darkest period the franchise has had since moving to Dallas - two straight seasons of not making the playoffs .
Tom Hicks ’ financial woes have really handcuffed the team , " he said .

SB Nation 's Oilers vs Stars coverage
Defending Big D
The difference between the Stars and the Oilers is that the kids that were thrown into the fire were n't completely abandoned and they 've grown up well .
The core of the Stars team is now made up of a group of eight players between the ages of 21 and 26 , including four defensemen - Trevor Daley , Nicklas Grossman , Mark Fistric and Matt Niskanen - that have already combined to play 991 NHL games .
Yes , it was an error in management to expect those four to take the wheel from Zubov , Norstrom and Boucher , but the hard time has done them well and Grossman has grown into a top - pairing rock , Fistric is killing the soft minutes and Daley has played steady hockey for the entire year .
Only Niskanen took a step back this year , but he 's shown that he 's ready for the NHL , and should rebound next season .
Two of the forwards are well - known - James Neal and Loui Eriksson - and they 've continued to play at a high level this season .
Worley said " Neal and Eriksson are both wingers with incredible scoring and finishing ability . "
But the Stars have found a couple of more kids this year that sort of came from nowhere .
Jamie Benn was drafted in the fifth round ( #129 ) in 2007 and Tom Wandell ( #146 ) was drafted in the fifth round in 2005 , and both , as Lowetide loves to say have " covered the bet " and then some .
To Worley again , " Jamie Benn and Tom Wandell are two versatile centers who are just as solid defensively as they are playmakers on offense .
Benn has emerged as a phenom of sorts at a position he had never played before .
Benn was moved to center permanently after Wandell was lost for the season with a torn ACL , and after some bumpy starts has become a very capable No. 2 center on a team flourishing in them .
His size , tenacity and fearlessness have endeared him to fans , and his playmaking ability is making those around him better . "
The Stars have n't thrown the kids up front into the fire like they did to the defensemen , as they 've had veterans like Brad Richards , Jere Lehtinen , Mike Riberio and the never - ending presence of Mike Modano to handle the hard work while the kids have grown up .
The Stars are n't loaded with non-NHL players at this point , as last year was the first year that the Stars had a pick inside the top 25 since 1996 .
The one gem in the system is forward Scott Glennie , taken with that draft choice last season and now plays for the Brandon Wheat Kings .
Glennie is expected to challenge for the NHL roster next season .
The Stars have been down , but not out for the last two seasons and they 've not been able to follow any particular " model " like the Oilers seem to have such a proclivity for , but they 've set themselves up well for the future .
Either the scouts or the procurement have worked something of a miracle and delivered a nearly half of a roster full of real NHL players without the benefit of top 25 picks .
I do n't know that what Dallas has done can be called a " model " , but whatever it is , the Oilers should take a long look at what 's happened in Dallas in late - round procurement and player development and beg , borrow and steal whatever scraps of information happen to fall from the Stars ' pockets .

The Arizona Legislature has narrowed a controversial immigration law in response to allegations that the measure legalized racial profiling and forced police to determine the immigration status of everyone they encountered on the streets .
The initial law , signed by Gov. Jan Brewer last week , required police to determine a person ’s immigration status if officers formed a reasonable suspicion about their legality during any “ lawful contact . ”
That led to suggestions by some legal experts that police would be obligated to scrutinize even people who asked for directions .
A Phoenix police officer who patrols an area near a school sued , contending that it would require him to ask children he encounters during the day if they are in the country legally .
Lawmakers on Thursday night changed the language to require scrutiny only of people who police stop , detain or arrest .
They also changed a section of the bill that barred officers from “ solely ” using race as grounds for suspecting someone is in the country illegally ; opponents had argued that that would allow race to be a factor .
The legislators removed the word “ solely ” to bar race from being used by officers enforcing the law .
“ It absolutely clarifies what the intent was , ” said Paul Senseman , a spokesman for Brewer , who supported the changes and is expected to sign them into law .
“ It ’s undeniable now that this bill will not lead to racial profiling . ”

Opponents of the bill , who to date have filed three federal lawsuits against it and promise more , said the changes would make little difference .
“ They ’re nice cosmetic changes , ” former state Sen .
Alfredo Gutierrez said Friday during a news conference at which activists called for a boycott against Arizona and companies based in the state .
“ But they ’re insufficient . ”
The Arizona law , which also makes it a state crime to lack immigration papers , is the toughest measure against illegal immigration in the nation .
It has been denounced by a wide range of people , including President Obama and Colombian pop star Shakira .
In a Gallup poll , 51 % of Americans who ’d heard of the Arizona law supported it ; 39 % of those who had not heard of the law supported it .
Its backers say it is needed to stem the tide of illegal immigration into Arizona , the favored gateway across the Mexican border .
Arizona lawmakers said they acted only because the federal government had failed to secure the border .
“ We are defenseless , ” said state Rep. John Kavanagh , a co-sponsor .
“ We have no choice but to increase our enforcement . ”

Lawmakers on Thursday night also added a provision extending immigration enforcement to local ordinances , which critics warned could permit police to check the immigration status of people guilty of nothing more than a poorly tended lawn .
Latino groups hope the threat of boycotts will force a repeal of the law , much as it did the state ’s refusal to recognize the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 's birthday in the early 1990s .
A New York congressman urged Major League Baseball to move the 2011 All - Star game from Phoenix .
On Friday , the head of the baseball players union issued a statement harshly criticizing the law and saying the game ’s many Latino players and their families would run the risk of being harassed by police when in Arizona for games or spring training .
A group of activists in Los Angeles said they would target Arizona companies and other institutions in the coming weeks .
City officials in Los Angeles and San Francisco plan to research and reconsider their financial ties with Arizona .
The law ’s authors contended that , even with the original provisions , it would be used sparingly and only during stops or arrests .
But critics say it ’s easy for police to invent a reason to stop someone they believe is an illegal immigrant .
“ It can be a cracked windshield .
It can be a broken taillight .
Any pretext to stop somebody and ask for their status , ” said Lydia Guzman , an activist here who tracks complaints of racial profiling by police who enforce immigration laws in Arizona .

US scientists are warning that radiation from controversial full - body airport scanners has been dangerously underestimated and could lead to an increased risk of skin cancer - particularly in children .
University of California biochemist David Agard said that unlike other scanners , the radiation from these devices is delivered at low energy beam levels , with most of the dose concentrated in the skin and underlying tissue .
“ While the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body , the dose to the skin may be dangerously high , ” Dr Agard said .
" Ionizing radiation such as the X - rays used in these scanners have the potential to induce chromosome damage , and that can lead to cancer . "
Of further concern is that a failure in the device – like a power or software glitch - could cause an intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin .
The warnings come ahead of the planned rollout of the scanners in Australia next year as part of the Federal Government ’s crackdown on airport security .
David Brenner , the head of Columbia University ’s Centre for Radiological Research , says the concentration on the skin – one of the most radiation - sensitive organs of the body – means the radiation dose is actually 20 times higher than the official estimate .
Dr Brenner says the most likely risk from the airport scanners is a type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma , which mainly occurs on the head and neck and is usually curable .
The researcher was consulted to write guidelines for the security scanners in 2002 but said he would not have signed the report had he known the devices were going to be used so widely .
" There really is no other technology around where we 're planning to X - ray such an enormous number of individuals , " he said .
“ While individual risks will be extremely small , the population risk has the potential to be significant . ”
The research also shows children are more vulnerable to radiation damage , because they have more cells dividing at any one time than when fully grown and a radiation - induced mutation can lead to cancer in adulthood .
Officials from the US Transportation Security Administration and the Food and Drug Administration have tried to allay concerns by saying that it would take thousands of trips through the scanners to equal the dose from one X - ray scan in a hospital .
The recent concerns raised by Dr Brenner at the US Congressional Biomedical Caucus have not been officially addressed .
Dr Agard and fellow doctors John Sedat , a molecular biologist and the group 's leader ; Marc Shuman , a cancer specialist ; and Robert Stroud , a biochemist and biophysicist , addressed their concerns to Dr John Holdren , science adviser to US President Barack Obama .
The scientists are calling for more research to be undertaken before the use of the scanners becomes commonplace .
Dr Brenner believes millimetre - wave scanners that use radio waves instead of X - rays would be better to use because they have no known radiation risks .
Full - body scanners no stranger to controversy
The full - body scanners have already caused controversy , with privacy concerns including whether scanned images may breach child pornography laws in various countries .
They have also been criticised as ineffective , with warnings they would be unlikely to detect many of the explosive devices used by terrorism groups .
In other trouble earlier this month , a US airport security screener was suspended for assaulting a colleague who joked about him having small genitalia after he walked through a scanner .
And in March a UK airport security worker said she would sue her bosses after a colleague leered at her “ naked ” image in a scanner .

BANGKOK — Thai commandos staged a raid on Friday to capture some leaders of the anti-government protests that have gridlocked parts of Bangkok for more than a month , a senior government official said .
The official , Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban , said on national television that a special forces unit had surrounded the SC Park Hotel in downtown Bangkok , where some of the leaders have been staying .
It was the first military action since a failed attempt to disperse the demonstrators last Saturday resulted in 24 deaths and hundreds of other casualties .
Initial reports from the government and from protest spokesmen on Friday indicated that some of the leaders had been captured while others had escaped , one by sliding down a rope from the hotel .
“ As I am speaking , the government ’s special team is surrounding the SC Park Hotel where we have learned that there are terrorists and some of their leaders hiding , ” said Mr. Suthep , who is in charge of security .

People propose a toast , standing around a portrait of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin , in Stalin 's hometown of Gori some 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of Tbilisi March 5 , 2010 .
REUTERS / David Mdzinarishvili
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A Russian businessman who set up a museum dedicated to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin was electrocuted and bludgeoned to death on Friday , media reported .
Vasily Bukhtiyenko set up the Stalin museum in 2005 in Volgograd , previously called Stalingrad , about 560 miles southeast of Moscow .
“ He was resting at a tennis court .
That is where the murder happened , ” state - run RIA Novosti news agency quoted a spokeswoman for regional investigators as saying .
Police said a motive for the attack was unclear at present .
Volgograd newspaper “ Pervaya Gazeta ” reported that Bukhtiyenko was attacked by three men with electric shock devices and then repeatedly hit on the head , it said on its site pro-volgograd.ru .
The 1942 - 43 battle of Stalingrad between Nazi and Soviet troops during World War Two was considered a major turning point in the war , and Russians still mark the German defeat with enormous pride and sentimentality today .
As Moscow prepares for its enormous 65th anniversary of May 9 , known as Victory Day , an intra-government dispute over some efforts to rehabilitate Stalin has been brewing .
LOS ANGELES — Calling the experience " a true honor " and " the opportunity of a lifetime , " the infected synovial fluid recently drained from Kobe Bryant 's right knee told reporters Monday that there is no other basketball player it would rather have accumulated in .

Describing itself as humbled and privileged to have affected the NBA All - Star 's mobility for even so short a time , the contaminated collection of mucin and albumin said it would always cherish every moment it spent collecting in Bryant 's appendage , from the initial stages of infection to its last moments of arthrocentesis .
" Kobe Bryant 's is the knee all joint fluids dream of building up in , " the semi-viscous mix of blood and uric acid said during a press conference at the Lakers ' training facility .
" There were times , especially during the first two rounds of the playoffs , when I had to pinch myself and say , ' Holy crap !
You 're inflaming Kobe Bryant 's right knee !
Kobe Bryant .
Not some role - playing knee like Andrew Bynum 's knee , or Kendrick Perkins ' knee , but Kobe freaking Bryant's . ' "
Advertisement
" People have asked me if I would have rather built up in LeBron 's knee instead of Kobe 's , " the fluid added .
" And while it would have been exciting to help deteriorate LeBron 's articular cartilage , Kobe is an NBA champion . "
According to the infected fluid , it considered accumulating in the former MVP 's knee a " one - shot deal , " and tried to enjoy every wince and buckle it caused as if it were the last .
Advertisement
The fluid also personally thanked Oklahoma City forward Kevin Durant for pushing the Lakers ' first playoff round to six games , saying that the unexpectedly long series allowed it to really savor its time in Bryant 's knee .
" I knew they would n't let me build up forever , " the arthritis - induced fluid said .
" So when I saw that 20 - gauge syringe enter the joint capsule , I took comfort in the thought that I built up as best I could before I was sucked out . "
Advertisement
Doctors close to the 1.2 - ounce specimen said it began collecting in Bryant 's joint cavities toward the end of the season , but did n't become inflamed and straw - colored until the playoffs .
Beaming with obvious pride , the non-Newtonian pseudoplastic material noted that it was the same fluid that accumulated during Bryant 's 39 - point performance in Game 2 of the series against the Thunder , and that it went on to become the very thixotropic liquid that contributed to the swelling of Bryant 's knee throughout the Western Conference semifinals .
" Not bad for a fluid that just two months ago was nothing more than a subcutaneous element in a normal , uninfected synovial membrane , " the particulate - rich residue continued .
" Not bad at all . "
Advertisement
Calling it " a wild ride while it lasted , " the knee fluid said it would always have fond memories of its gradual buildup during plane trips to different cities , postgame interviews , and the Lakers ' four - game sweep of the Utah Jazz .
" How many aggravated lubricin compounds can say that they were building up in an MVP 's knee while he was leading his team to the next round of the NBA Playoffs ? " it said .
" Well , any fluid who follows sports will tell you there are only three : Willis Reed 's knee fluid in 1970 , fluid from Magic Johnson 's busted bursa sac in ' 85 , and Jordan 's fluid in 1997 . "
Advertisement
" Pretty good company , if you ask me , " the fluid continued .
While the diseased liquid admitted that it would have been able to build up even more hyaluronic acid had Bryant not sat out during between - game practices , and had the team 's trainers not been so meticulous in icing the knee down after games , the fluid said those were just minor setbacks in what was ultimately the experience of a lifetime .
Advertisement
" If my young , healthy , polymer - of - disaccharide self ever caught me actually complaining about harmfully building up in Kobe Bryant 's knee , then in about two seconds it would disperse me onto the connective tissues out of sheer disgust , " the cloudy sample characterized by an abnormal level of white blood cells said .
" Some fluids only get to build up in obese , office - softball - league players and that 's as far as they ever go .
I consider myself very lucky . "
" Now , would I like to be the fluid that is currently building up inside Kobe 's knee during the Western Conference finals ? " the fluid added .
" Absolutely .
I 'd be a lying specimen jar of medical waste if I said I would n't .
But I had my turn , and frankly , I 'm exhausted .
It 's time for another fluid to get its chance at glory . "
Another blow for Flash .
As Adobe is stating that they will make the best tools for HTML5 , another major website using Flash has announced they ’re switching over to HTML5 .
Scribd , which provides in - browser access to all sorts of documents and e-books uploaded by users , will ditch its Flash - based website in favour of a brand - new HTML5 version .
Scribd is the largest website of its kind , hosting tens of millions of documents uploaded by users ; a sort of YouTube for documents , if you will .
Scribd works by converting uploaded documents into a what was formerly called iPaper , a PDF - like document technology for the web , which would then be displayed inside users ’ browsers using Flash .
Supported source document formats include any Microsoft Office or OpenOffice.org format , PDF , PostScript , rich text , and plain text .
The Flash variant of Scribd looks like this – not at all very comfortable , in my view .
This is about to change , starting today .
“ We are scrapping three years of Flash development and betting the company on HTML5 because we believe HTML5 is a dramatically better reading experience than Flash .
Now any document can become a Web page , ” Scribd co-founder and CTO Jared Friedman told TechCrunch .
Initially ( which means today ) , only 200000 of the most popular documents will be made available as HTML5 , but eventually , everything on Scribd will be converted to the new format – turning them into actual , real - world web pages , instead of walled - off Flash elements .
“ Right now the document is in a box , ” Friedman said , “ a Youtube - type of experience .
There is a bunch of content and a bunch of stuff around it .
In the new experience we are taking the content out of the box . ”
TechCrunch has the first screenshots of the new reader , and it indeed looks pretty darn good .
It allows users to completely bypass the concept of an online e-book store , and no longer will users have to download PDF files onto their mobile devices or computers .
They can just go to Scribd to read Alice ’s Adventures
In Wonderland ( if you have n’t read it yet , shame on you , you ’re missing out on a vital experience ) as if it were a web page .
Scribd has partners such as The New York Times , New Yorker , Fortune , various publishing houses , as well as Ford , Accenture , and the FCC .
This news comes on the same day Adobe ’s CTO , Kevin Lynch , stated that his company will create the best tools for HTML5 .
“ We see whatever people are using to express themselves , ” he said , “ We ’re going to make great tooling for HTML5 .
We ’re going to make the best tools in the world for HTML 5 . ”
In other words , it seems like Adobe is considering creating software designers can use to create compelling HTML5 stuff – much in the same way they today use Adobe ’s software to do the same with Flash .
Earlier this week , the Pentagon announced the first Minerva Research Initiative awards , which will fund social science research on key strategic issues .
Seven projects were selected out of a total of 211 proposals .
The Pentagon will commit a total of up to $ 50 million to those research efforts .
That 's chump change , of course , compared to your typical Pentagon procurement .
Hell , it wo n't even buy you half an Osprey .
But it 's a lot of money for the world of academic research .
So it 's worth taking a closer look at the researchers who will lead the individual projects :
Susan Shirk of the University of California at San Diego .
Shirk will lead a project titled " The Evolving Relationship between Technology and National Security in China : Innovation , Defense Transformation and China 's Place in the Global Technology Order . "
Arizona State Religious Studies prof Mark Woodward .
His team will investigate " counter radical - Muslim discourse . "
( Read Woodward 's recent commentary on the Bush shoe - throwing incident here . )
Arms control expert Patricia Lewis , who is deputy director and scientist - in - residence at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies .
Her project will look at Iraqi perspectives on the U.S. wars in the Middle East .
Jacob Shapiro of Princeton University .
Shapiro studies the organizational aspects of terrorism ; his proposal was titled " Terrorism Governance and Development . "
San Francisco State University psychology prof David Matsumoto , who leads a project called " Emotion and Intergroup Relations . "
Foreign policy expert James Lindsay of the University of Texas .
He is leading an investigation into the effects of climate change on state stability in Africa .
MIT 's Nazli Choucri .
Her project will focus on " cyber international relations . "
Minerva has prompted a lot of debate within academia about the wisdom of accepting Pentagon funds .
In a way , that 's the point : As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ( himself a former president of Texas A&M University ) has said , Minerva is supposed to repair a rift between the military and the academy .
And as the initiative proceeds , it is bound to see more controversy .

In Austin last weekend , kind reader and friend Elisa Leal brought me an exquisite gift : a hand - made set of WIZARD CHESS .
Wizard Chess is something that Kris and I have talked about on Tweet Me Harder before , and Elisa somehow sat down and made it happen .
Each piece is hand - sculpted and hand - painted on top of existing wooden chess pieces .
( I ’ll post more pictures as I ’m able . )
Thank you so much , Elisa !
This is truly amazing and quite a delightful gift .
On Sunday , I was assisted at the booth by Sarah the Austinite , who seemed to know a bit more about Wizard Chess than I did .
I doubt this is the last we ’ll see of Wizard Chess .
Also it ’s not the first photocomic I ’ve made !
Longtime readers may remember the six - part epic from my 2006 New York trip with Chris Yates , master of photocomickry .
My first convention ever as an artist !
And a charming wee tale of sin and redemption :

Colorado College senior Mike Testwuide is on the verge of signing a free - agent deal with the Philadelphia Flyers .
The 6 - foot - 3 , 200 - pound right wing from Vail , Colo. , enjoyed a strong final season with Colorado College , recording 21 goals in 39 games .
Several NHL teams were vying to sign the 23 - year - old Testwuide , but he narrowed down his interests to a shortlist that included the Flyers , Washington Capitals , New York Rangers and Colorado Avalanche .
Testwuide may see action for the Flyers this season .
They say a hero is only as good as the villain they face .
The last Bond film , Quantum of Solace ( 2008 ) , really was not up to 007 par and a large part of this is explained by a weak villainous character , Dominic Greene .
Who ?
You ask .
Exactly .
If you look back at all the Bond films , the great and memorable ones have been the ones with a good villain played by an actor who has gravitas as well as a tough / interesting henchman .
The above feature fantastic villains and henchmen / women , but then compare with the Bond films that are not so hot .
gap
So , if they ever get around to making the next Bond film , they better have a good villain .
It is no secret that a majority of the peer - reviewed climate change literature lays blame for global warming on human greenhouse gas emissions .
But despite the abundance of research supporting anthropogenic global warming , there is a sizable community of qualified scientists who believe the so - called consensus view on global warming is completely wrong .
I wanted to find out why , so I contacted one skeptical researcher to ask .
Dr. Roy Spencer is a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville .
For many years he served as a Senior Scientist for Climate Studies at NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center , and his research has been published in peer - reviewed journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and The Journal Of Climate .
Dr. Spencer was kind enough to explain to me what convinced him that the consensus view on global warming is incorrect and what he believes is responsible for the rising temperatures we have observed .
I believe that most climate change is natural in origin , the result of long - term changes in the Earth ’s albedo ( sunlight reflectivity ) .
This alternative explanation for recent warming has seen almost no research , which is a curious situation if science is to progress .
Now , I will also say that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions must cause some warming , but that its warming influence is small compared to natural , internal , chaotic fluctuations in global average cloud cover .
As we have addressed in a previously published paper in The Journal Of Climate , and elaborate further on in another paper accepted for publication in The Journal of Geophysical Research , natural cloud variations in the climate system give the illusion of a sensitive climate system .
This is a relatively new finding , and it is taking time for other researchers to understand its significance to the global warming debate .
By way of background , most climate researchers today believe that global average temperatures are moderately to strongly sensitive to our addition of greenhouse gas emissions , and a large part of that sensitivity argument depends upon cloud cover dissipating somewhat with warming .
This is a relationship they see during natural climate variations : warmer years tend to have less cloud cover .
If that anomalous warming is indeed causing a decrease in cloudiness , then more sunlight would be let in , magnifying the relatively small amount of direct warming that increasing carbon dioxide produces .
This is called positive cloud feedback .
But what they have neglected to consider is the fact that a large part of that observed warmth was caused BY the decrease in clouds , not the other way around .
We have demonstrated with a simple climate model that warming can cause an increase in clouds , thus producing a strong brake on warming ( negative feedback ) , but the signal of that process is lost in the noise of natural cloud variations causing temperature variations .
It all comes down to mixing up cause and effect .
Negative cloud feedback is obscured by natural cloud variations causing temperature variations .
I consider it a highly speculative theory …. but possible .
There is so much we do n’t yet understand about natural climate change .
Most researchers today have virtually convinced themselves that there is no such thing .
In a way , the sunspot theory is the closest alternative match to my theory because it involves natural variations in cloud cover as the main forcing mechanism for climate change .
My new book , The Great Global Warming Blunder , lays out the case for clouds as the main cause of global warming .
The climate research community has become so inbred and financially dependent upon the continuing threat of manmade global warming that they have trouble even entertaining any alternative hypotheses .
So , since the issue is so easily explained , I am getting others out there involved in the physical sciences to look at the evidence .
I think it is very significant for public perception , but less significant to the climate research community .
Climategate has revealed that scientists at the core of the U.N. ’s case for humanity as the cause of warming are quite biased and intolerant in their dealings with scientists having alternative views .
Those of us who are skeptical that humanity has caused most of the warming have always known this bias exists , but now the public gets to see it on display .
No , since atmospheric carbon dioxide is necessary for life on Earth , I do not consider it a “ pollutant ” .
Considering this fact , it is amazing that there is so little of it : only 40 out of every 100,000 molecules of air are CO2 , and it takes 5 years to increase than number by 1 through the burning of fossil fuels .
It might well turn out that more CO2 is , on the whole , good for life on Earth .
Hundreds of scientific papers have demonstrated this for various types of plants , and we are beginning to see research that the same might be true for the oceans as well .
Command - and - control mechanisms for reducing CO2 emissions are doomed to failure because there are , as yet , no large scale replacements for fossil fuels .
Now , since fossil fuels are a finite resource , we do need to be working toward replacements .
But they can not be simply legislated into existence .
And if we punish the use of energy by making it more expensive , it is the world ’s poor that will be the first to suffer .
Since I do not receive any money from Big Oil , I can say that I will maintain this view even if the oil company executives change their minds and support cap - and - trade .
Such corporate decisions can be expected as oil companies position themselves for special favors from government if they think cap and trade is inevitable anyway .

Mohammad Ali Ahmad and Ilyas Iqbal : Blackburn Resistance was ' a joke '
" We were the A - Team generation .
We grew up watching The A - Team - and Rambo of course . "
As a little boy growing up in Blackburn , Ilyas Iqbal dreamed of becoming Mr T .
But now , at the age of 23 , he says his passion for action films has led to his conviction for terror offences .
In March this year , Ilyas was prosecuted along with his brother , Abbas Iqbal , and his best friend , Mohammad Ali Ahmad .
The three were accused of forming a terror cell known as The Blackburn Resistance .
If you watched that film Four Lions - that was us .
Except that we were n't doing any of the real - life stuff
Mohammad Ali Ahmad
But they say they were guilty of nothing more than having a laugh , comparing themselves with characters in Chris Morris ' film , Four Lions .
" All we were doing is messing around , " Ilyas Iqbal told BBC Radio 5 Live 's Donal MacIntyre programme .
Mr Ahmad , a 26 - year - old Muslim convert who changed his name from Paul Andrew Cryer in 2004 , added : " If you watched that film Four Lions - that was us .
" Except that we were n't doing any of the real - life stuff - we were doing strictly the playing around stuff .
Our definition of comedy is being blooper soldiers . "
Terror video
A key piece of evidence in the Blackburn Resistance case was a home - made film described in court as " al - Qaeda propaganda destined to be distributed abroad " .
The film featured Ilyas Iqbal and Mohammad Ali Ahmad crawling through a park in camouflage gear .
It was introduced by a voice saying : " They are fighting against oppression , they are The Blackburn Resistance . "
In the background a voice can be heard chanting : " I am the armour for those who believe in the unity of Allah .
I am the fire against the aggressor . "
The prosecutor in the case said the three men were " intoxicated by the evil of terrorism " as they prepared to join or carry out violent jihad .
He said the film was among material which Abbas Iqbal and an associate had intended to use to radicalise others .
All three men claimed that the film was a homage to their favourite action heroes .
During the court case , jurors were shown clips from the defendants ' favourite films - including Black Hawk Down , which features Somali fighters defeating American forces .
Abbas Iqbal was jailed for a total of two years at Manchester Crown Court for committing acts of terrorism and disseminating terrorist publications .
The 24 - year - old had stored weapons at the family home in Blackburn .
Prison sentence Ilyas Iqbal was jailed for 18 months for possessing a document likely to be useful to a terrorist .
Police found documents at Ilyas Iqbal 's home which detailed weaknesses in the US military .
They also found videos on his computer showing the beheading and an execution of soldiers and prisoners .
With regard to the video , Ilyas Iqbal says " we watched it , we did n't do it .
Kids are watching these videos .
You know why ?
It 's not because they 're terrorists .
It 's because they 're curious " .

Mr Ahmad , who spent part of his time on remand at Belmarsh high - security prison , insists that he and his friends were simply living out their boyhood fantasies .
" We wanted to make a video a bit like a Muslim A - Team , " he said .
" The Blackburn Resistance was nothing more than a title for that film .
" All this has done has given me a strong hatred for the so - called justice system .
I have been a victim to this so - called justice system . "
Police investigation Det Ch Supt Tony Porter , of the North West Counter Terrorism Unit , said : " We presented the evidence to the court and it was up to the jury to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for a conviction . "
Shuiab Khan , editor of Asian Image , a newspaper and website based in Blackburn , had some sympathy with the police .
He said : " When I saw their video , I thought straight away it was a joke .
But it 's very hard for the police to know for sure without investigating .
" In the present climate , to make a video like this is irresponsible .
Air rifles , knives , a crossbow and sword were found at the family home " Whatever their reason for making the video , most people in Blackburn would say they were asking for trouble .
" If they had done it in 1998 , nothing would have happened but to do it in the current climate was irresponsible . "
Alyas Karmani , an imam and psychologist who works with Muslims convicted under the Terrorism Act , says that although groups like the Blackburn Resistance seem comical , they do pose problems for the authorities .
He said : " The majority of the young men I work with are similarly naïve - with a distorted view of the world , which feeds into delusions of grandeur .
That can be a very dangerous mix because these people have the potential to be manipulated by charismatic individuals . "
Although Mr Ahmad attended the premier of Four Lions , Ilyas Iqbal has not seen the film .
Despite the fact that he makes constant references to Hollywood movies , he believes that cinema is forbidden in Islam .
He intends to appeal against his conviction and says his actions were misinterpreted .
" It was meant to be a joke and we had a good laugh about it - until we got to court and then it was n't funny any more . "

Has steampunk jumped Captain Nemo ’s clockwork shark yet ?
The genre — succinctly described as a mix of archaic tech ( either real or fanciful ) , the supernatural , and postmodern metafictional tricksterism , set in the consensus historical past or alternate timelines — was first christened in 1987 , a lifetime ago as cultural and literary fads are measured , in a letter to Locus magazine from the writer K. W. Jeter .
Of course , the actual roots of the form extend back even further , perhaps as early as 1965 , when a certain television show named The Wild , Wild West debuted .
Some literary styles and tropes wane with their cultural moment , but others have proved exceedingly long - lived , with writers continually discovering unexplored narrative possibilities within elastic bounds .
Perhaps the best example is the Gothic , still with us today , and flourishing , despite being a couple of centuries old .
But steampunk has exfoliated beyond the merely literary , into the daily lives of its fans .
Like Civil
War re-enactors or medievalist members of the Society for Creative Anachronism , “ steampunks ” now include those for whom the novels and stories have been superseded by cosplay , crafting , music , partying , artwork , manga , anime , feature films , and the creation of props or working hardware .
For every reader and writer of steampunk fiction , there are probably hundreds or thousands of other activists who gleefully embrace some non-written manifestation of the steampunk ethos .
Generally speaking , by the time a subculture such as steampunk secures the attention of major media , resulting in extensive coverage of the craze , said phenomenon is already on the way out .
But despite numerous and growing features about steampunk in the national press , such does not seem to be the case , at least in terms of fiction .
The juggernaut that is steampunk , like Dr. Loveless ’s giant mechanical spider in the 1999 film version of The Wild , Wild West , seems capable of crushing all naysayers .
Yet what of the literature itself — now transformed into something of an appendage — that spawned the movement ?
Has it exhausted all the radium bullets in its Gatling gun , or is fresh work still capable of surprising the reader ?
Well , the latter half of 2009 proved to be a fine period for steampunk , and 2010 seems to be starting out likewise , with a new novel that manages to do some uncanny things with the genre .
( As well , readers should be alerted to Steampunk Reloaded , a forthcoming anthology compiled by Ann and Jeff Vandermeer . )
First , the older material .
A decided treat for the eyes as well as a stimulating and joyous intellectual romp , Boilerplate : History ’s Mechanical Marvel , by Paul Guinan and Anina Bennett , is one of the proofs that steampunk is far from played out .
Published by art - book specialist Abrams , Boilerplate mixes a wealth of ingenious visuals with solid if relatively cautious text to produce the first steampunk mockumentary .
The premise : an inventor named Archie Campion , invaluably aided by his sister Lily and several other individuals , debuted the first working robot in 1893 in Chicago , at the fabled World ’s Columbian Exposition .
After this showcase , Boilerplate went on to an heroic and action - packed career , participating in many of the pivotal events of the next twenty years , before disappearing in battle during the First World War .
In support of this seamless and detailed robotic biography , we get innumerable Photoshopped depictions of Boilerplate at large : posing with Teddy Roosevelt , prospecting in the Yukon , fighting in Cuba , exploring the Arctic , and so forth .
Impeccably done , with precise calibrations of tone and style , these visuals are the highlight of the project , evoking the years 1893 - 1918 with a lusty , living nostalgia .
Boilerplate shares its bloodline with Zelig and Forrest Gump , with Jack Finney ’s Time and Again and Chris Ware ’s Jimmy Corrigan , the Smartest Kid on Earth ( the latter also involves the Columbian Exposition , and Ware ’s other work often depicts a robot who might be Boilerplate ’s brother ) .
Full of Edisonian verve and vigor , Boilerplate celebrates the American spirit of invention , yet not without a certain critical melancholy .
Thick - lensed goggles of funky brass and leather are a trademark signifier of steampunk .
But frequently , beyond a certain fashionableness their utility is negligible .
So when Cherie Priest goes to the trouble in her novel Boneshaker to provide a clever rationale for the existence and prevalence of such eye - gear , you know you ’re in for a meticulously conceived and executed ride .
Seattle , 1863 : the giant tunneling machine of mad inventor Levi Blue manages to destroy a sizable portion of the city and unleash a subterranean gas — the Blight — which zombifies all who inhale it .
( The gas is made visible through , naturally , those goggles . )
The citizens respond by walling off the infected district and leaving those trapped inside to die — or worse .
Sixteen years later , Blue ’s ostracised widow , Briar , lives in the ghetto just outside the wall with her teenaged son Zeke .
Intent on clearing his father ’s name , Zeke takes off one day across the wall , and Briar has no recourse but to follow .
Priest ’s steampunk wasteland is playfully and productively anomalous .
Generally , the genre likes to focus on intact and functioning societies , whether dystopian or mundanely civil .
Her depiction of the interzone as an outlaw realm of freedom , however dangerous , evokes the punk dream of life outside establishment strictures — a dream too often actually neglected in the genre that borrows half its name from that music .
The horror tropes are another entertaining divergence from standard steampunk templates .
Likewise , the parallel domestic quests of mother and son ( Priest divides the action in half between Zeke and Briar ) is a freshening of both motivation and character from the rote adventurers the reader often encounters in this type of tale .
Priest ’s small , carefully constrained sphere of action ( some widening dialogue pertains to the Civil War still raging back East , long after our version had ended ) does , however , feel claustrophobic and slightly unambitious at times .
But within that limited domain , she manages to impart a vivid sense of strangeness and adventure .
Cherie Priest ’s brand of steampunk featured an adolescent protagonist whose actions were circumscribed within a tiny venue , in a book that nonetheless sported a fully adult texture .
Contrastingly , in Leviathan , Scott Westerfeld ’s youthful , globe - hopping heroes star in a book staunchly aimed at a big - screen - friendly YA audience , mightily abetted by gorgeous B&W illustrations from Keith Thompson .
That ’s merely the beginning of the differences that serve to illustrate the wide range of steampunk .
Westerfeld paints his picture on a realpolitik canvas absent from Priest ’s domestic frame .
The year is 1914 , and war is imminent , upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife .
But aside from that , all is different in this alternate continuum .
The Germans and their allies , known as “ Clankers , ” have perfected super - mechanized craft of war .
The British , or “ Darwinists , ” rely on bioengineering : aerial whales , souped - up tiger draft beasts , and so forth .
Garnering our attention among the Clankers is Prince Alek , only child of Franz and commoner Sophie , on the run from the Austrian Emperor .
Among the Brits , Deryn , a young girl masquerading as a male midshipman in the imperial airforce .
Their personalities are fierce and real , their inevitable meeting staged nicely and with zest .
Cleverly overlaying Bruce Sterling ’s famous Mechanist / Shaper dichotomy upon twentieth - century history in a warping fashion , carefully allotting sympathy to both sides of the conflict , staging both small - and large - scale scenes with finesse and aplomb , Westerfeld steadily builds a world that we soon accept as totally real and palpable .
His inventiveness with the details of the competing imaginary technologies renders the rival paradigms sharp and bristly , with the complex stakes involved plain to see .
The first in a series , Leviathan , as the author says in his Afterword , does indeed truly utilize steampunk ’s ability to address both past and future simultaneously .
For certain readers , a lightbulb of recognition will likely flare during the opening pages of Dexter Palmer ’s eccentrically fantabulous debut novel , The Dream of Perpetual Motion .
Our hero , Harold Winslow ( currently imprisoned in an ever - aloft zeppelin ) , is introduced as a nebbishy writer of greeting - card sentiments whose pre-work anxiety forces him to ride a “ shrinkcab ” to the office ( “ Shrinkcab ’s fleet of drivers are all rigorously trained in clinical psychiatry and licensed to dispense prescriptions … ” ) amidst a landscape rife with mechanical men indistinguishable from humans .
Dexter Palmer has had the brilliant inspiration to meld Philip K. Dick with steampunk .
In a story that moves from one unpredictable moment to another ( the author himself even makes a metafictional appearance ) , Palmer deploys all the trademark Phildickian riffs with wit and grace : the manipulative , demiurgic industrialist ( Prospero Taligent ) ; the devouring love interest ( Miranda Taligent ) ; the put -upon Everyman accidentally at the center of the storm .
But the thrilling novelty is that they occur in a fully realized steampunk milieu ( with a refreshing 1930s veneer : take the kludgy teaching machines young Winslow is subjected to , for example ) evoking the creations of another off - kilter mind : Terry Gilliam .
The ex-Python gets too little credit as an outlier of the steampunk movement .
Films such as Time Bandits and , essentially , Brazil , certainly share affinities with hardcore steampunk , and Palmer echoes Gilliam ’s method , moving his characters through an insulting , humiliating , and needlessly complex and hostile environment — in this case , the city of Xeroville .
But , as in Gilliam ’s films , it ’s also an environment that offers glimpses of magic and wonder : consider the Nickel Empire , a vast amusement park where every astonishing treat and improbable ride costs precisely one five - cent coin , and where young Harold ’s destiny is first intertwined with that of the capricious Miranda .
Crafting his prose as finely and evocatively as Nicholas Christopher or Mark Helprin , Dexter Palmer conjures up a new flavor of steampunk , showing us that there ’s a tumble yet in the clanking , hybrid Victorian bawd .
Maybe what the Phoenix Suns basketball team needed during their historic sweep over the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference semifinals was a little courage and teamwork to stand up for what ’s right .
Joining the fray of criticism against Arizona ’s new anti-immigrant law , the Suns decided to wear “ Los Suns ” ( “ The Suns ” in Spanish ) on their jerseys in Game 2 against the Spurs on May 5 as way to protest the draconian measure .
The Suns went on to beat the Spurs 110 - 102 in Game 2 .
Suns owner Robert Sarver – with unanimous support from the players – said the team wore the jerseys on Cinco De Mayo “ to honor our Latino community and the diversity of our league , the state of Arizona , and our nation . ”
The team wore the jerseys to honor the Mexican holiday , widely celebrated in the U.S. , and to reflect their belief that signing the Arizona law was not the right way to handle the problem of immigration , said Sarver .
Sarver , born and raised in Tucson , Ariz . , told The Associated Press he ’s frustrated with the federal government ’s failure to address immigration reform , which he said led to the passage of “ a flawed state law . ”
“ However intended , the result of passing the law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question , ” the Phoenix Suns owner said .
“ And Arizona ’s already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when that state can ill afford them . ”
The law makes it a state crime to be in Arizona without proper documents and authorizes local police to check the legal status of anyone they suspect of being an undocumented immigrant .
These provisions are being widely assailed as unconstitutional and spurring extreme racial profiling .
Suns General Manager Steve Kerr said the organization felt it was their “ duty ” to address the issue .
“ It ’s hard to imagine in this country that we have to produce papers , ” Kerr told the Arizona Republic .
“ It brings up images of Nazi Germany .
We understand that the intensions of the law are not for that to happen , but you have to be very , very careful .
It ’s important that everyone in our state and nation understands this is an issue that needs to be explored .
So , we ’re trying to expose it . ”
The NBA and the league ’s players union supported the Suns decision to protest the law .
In a statement the players union , the National Basketball Players Association , said it welcomes the Suns decision and criticized the controversial law , calling it “ disappointing and disturbing . ”
“ We applaud the actions of the Phoenix Suns players and management and join them in taking a stand against the misguided efforts of Arizona lawmakers , ” said the union .
“ We are consulting with our members and our players leadership to determine the most effective way for our union to continue to voice our opposition to this legislation . ”
Suns co-captain Steve Nash , a South African - born Canadian who has a green card to work in the U.S. , said the idea to wear the jerseys and protest the law is “ fantastic . ”
“ I think it ’s very important for us to stand up for things we believe in , ” Nash said .
“ As a team and as an organization , we have a lot of love and support for all of our fans .
The league is very multicultural .
We have players from all over the world , and our Latino community here is very strong and important to us . ”
Nash , who wore a “ No war .
Shoot for peace ” T - shirt during 2003 All - Star Game interviews , said he has no problem expressing his political views under the basketball spotlight .
Speaking to the Arizona Republic , Nash added , “ I do n’t agree with the spirit of the bill or the message it sends , not only to people in our community but how it represents our community across the country and the world . ”
Nash said the Arizona law opens up the door for racial profiling and encourages racism .
“ I think it puts the police in an incredibly difficult position that is n’t fair to them , ” he said .
“ It ’s an infringement on our civil liberties to allow the possibility for inequality to arise in our community . ”
Arizona sports teams including Major League Baseball ’s Diamondbacks have become targets for national protests and calls for boycotts since the bill was signed .
Baseball fans and players have said they plan to boycott the 2011 All - Star Game , which is scheduled to take place in Phoenix , unless the law is repealed .
The Major League Baseball Players Association also opposes the measure .
The Suns decision to come out against the law is the first time a state sports entity has taken a public stand on the issue .
Speaking to reporters before Game 2 Phoenix ’s Amare Stoudemire said , “ It ’s going to be great to wear ‘ Los Suns , ’ to let the Latino community know that we ’re behind them 100 percent . ”
Many argue politics and sports just do n’t mix .
However others recognize the unity and solidarity displayed by the Suns players and their fans proves when it comes to social justice , standing up for what ’s right on or off the court – is truly a winning combination .
After sweeping the Spurs in four straight games the Suns have advanced to the finals where they will play the winner of the series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Utah Jazz .
As of Saturday , the Lakers lead that series 3 - 0 .
Civil rights activists note the movement for comprehensive immigration reform has found a new ally in the Suns basketball team .
They add the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. will be rooting for Phoenix .
And regardless of who takes home the grand trophy at the end of the NBA finals , the Suns will always be remembered as champions of the 2010 playoffs , they say .

The first encounter with w00tw00t.at. ISC.SANS .DFind : ) was for me around January 2010 .
I saw it in one of my server logs and didnt think about this very much .
Later , around the mid of February , the frequency began to grow and in march 2010 this wootwoot vulnerabilty scanner thing hit up to 20 times a day on my site .
And not enough : a minute or two later after each wootwoot hit , between 100 - 1000 requests hit in , searching for vulnerable joomla , phpMyAdmin , oscommerce or other PHP based software installations .
I do not run any PHP software ( PHP isnt even installed ) and I didnt need to worry , it made me very angry .
I was told from a lot of people to ignore it , but let me ask a question :
Would you ignore people , who throw small stones at your door twenty times a day , only to see if the door is vulnerable ?
Searching for a Solution
I have been searching for a long time to find an acceptable solution .
I tried to setup rewrite rules within Apaches config files .
No success .
I tried blocking this requests via some regex settings within my proxy server .
No success .
And I tried catching and redirect it within my web applications .
And again : No success .
On the other hand :
It helped me a lot to harden my server configurations and to close the small holes that exist in every setup .
And I have learned : every web server responds different to w00tw00t .
As I understand the HTTP Specification , a GET / w00tw00t.at.ISC.SANS.DFind :) should result in a HTTP 400 : Bad Request response from your web server .
This is the case if you use one or another ASP .
Net - Server .
The in one or another way preconfigured Apache servers from mass hosters return a HTTP 404 : Not found .
And last but not least :
Some application servers respond with a HTTP 500 : Internal server error , which is very bad if you are caching content in a reverse proxy because the proxy server delivers this error site to the next 20 - 30 requesting clients .
Finally I found a solution
I thought , I will never get rid of this % & ?§* message and the spam kids will always throw stones at my door .
Then I read about iptables and its ability to filter strings .
That was enlightening .
It took me 5 minutes to search the net and find a solution here .
A simple :
/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -d MY.IP .ADR.HRE -p tcp -- dport 80 - m string -- to 70 \ -- algo bm -- string ' GET / w00tw00t . '
-j DROP
Look Mam ! - it blocks ...
on my linux box made me sleep much better .
It is not a very sophisticated solution , one might say : brutal because it filters all incoming packages , but it works .
.... this w00tw00t thing
Because I do not have a high traffic web site , this setting does not cause any trouble to me .
If you are interested in a much smarter solution and a detailed explanation of w00tw00t have a look at spamcleaner.org , the site where I found my solution .
Good Luck !
Update [ 07/05/2010 ]
I posted this blog entry on reddit.com and a lot of people responded .
Many agreed with me , but a lot of people strongly disagreed .
Here are the essence :
If you are realy sure there is an automtic scanner behind this w00w00t messages , ignoring the log entries could be an option
messages , ignoring the log entries could be an option Deeper inspection of all incoming packets ( seraching for matching strings ) on port 80 is a complete overkill , using this on a daily basis is not reccomended
" This solution is like hitting a fly with a sledgehammer ... " , also auf gut deutsch : " Holzhammer - Methode ! "
If you are not sure these messages are send automaticly , use an intrusion detection system like snort
A funny guy send a request to this server with " /w00tw00t.hi.claudius " ( Claudius , thats -> me ) .
Hello stranger !
I adapted my iptables rule
rule
The last 24 hours this server was hit by around 300 w00tw00t packages .
In hight times ( before filtering it out ) this number was between 3500 - 4000
I would like to thank all people who read this entry and especially those who responded on reddit
Thou shalt not pray : Atheists ' bid to ban prayers before council meetings - because they breach ' human rights ' of non-believers
Militant atheists are trying to ban the age - old tradition of councils starting their meetings with Christian prayers by claiming it infringes the ' human rights ' of non-believers .
The National Secular Society has instructed lawyers to take a town council in North Devon to court for a judicial review of the practice .
If the test case succeeds , Christian prayers - or those of any faith - would become illegal at thousands of councils .
Councils have been starting their meetings with prayers for centuries
Religious groups called the legal move an attack by ' aggressive atheists ' on Britain 's Christian heritage , while one mayor described it as ' religiously correct madness ' .
It follows a succession of judicial rulings seen as undermining the Christian faith .
Last week Lord Justice Laws ruled that the sacking of a Christian relationship counsellor who refused to counsel homosexual couples on religious grounds was lawful because religious views cannot be protected by law .
And yesterday the Daily Mail told how preacher Dale Mcalpine was held in a cell for seven hours and charged a public order offence after telling a gay police community support officer that homosexuality was a sin .
The vast majority of councils choose to start meetings with Christian prayers .
A handful begin with those of other faiths .
Eric Silver , Mayor of Harrow Council says banning prayer ' seems like religiously correct madness '
A survey by the Daily Mail of 181 of the 422 largest councils in England and Wales found 118 start their meetings with a prayer - of which nearly all were Christian .
Only 63 had no prayers .
The NSS - which says it works to combat the influence of religion on governments - has instructed top legal firm Beachcroft to launch a judicial review against Bideford Town Council for starting its meetings with prayers .
The council has done so since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I .
But the NSS argues that prayers breach Article 9 of the Human Rights
Act which guarantees freedom of thought , conscience and religion for non-believers .
Keith Porteous
Wood , executive director of the NSS , said : ' If members of councils wish to pray before their meeting they can do it , preferably in another room .
' We 've no problem with that .
We are not infringing anyone 's rights to worship .
' It has also been suggested the non-religious should leave the room during prayers .
' But if you are elected to serve a public body , why should you leave the room ?
It 's an old - fashioned and inappropriate thing to do .
' The council is not there to promote religion , but to carry out services for the citizens of this country . '
Bideford 's annual budget is a fraction of that of larger councils , making it a soft target unlikely to engage expensive lawyers to fight the NSS .
Town clerk George McLauchlan said : ' The council is aware there is a potential judicial review .
' I do n't know why they have singled out Bideford .
This is a national matter not just a local matter . '
Andrea Williams , of the Christian Legal Centre , said : ' Religious freedom should be respected .
In a free and civilised society , councils and public bodies should be free to open meetings with prayer .
' It 's a fundamental freedom .
We are not a secular state and society as a whole benefits from Christian precepts . '
Mike Judge , of the Christian Institute , said : ' It 's a tradition that 's gone on for hundreds of years .
' This is really a move by aggressive atheism trying to shove Christianity out of public life .
' The council should n't back down .
It definitely is n't in breach of human rights law .
Parliament has prayers , is Parliament illegal ?'
Poll Should prayers be banned before council meetings ?
Yes No Should prayers be banned before council meetings ?
Yes 4429 votes
No 7045 votes
Now share your opinion
Prayers before meetings vary from an elaborate ceremony at Boston Council in Lincolnshire , to prayers praising the ' creator and sustainer of all things ' at Leicester and the three - word Latin prayer , Domine Dirige Nos - meaning ' Lord guide us ' - at the City of London .
A spokesman for Boston Council said : ' The mace bearer will knock on the door of the meeting so we all stand to attention , and then we all stand while the Lord 's Prayer is read .
It is a very old tradition and it would be a terrible shame to end it . '
At Tameside Council , Greater Manchester , a spokesman said : ' We have Christian prayers by a priest .
It is a Christian country after all .
I can't see why there would be a problem with it .'
Eric Silver , Mayor of Harrow Council , North London , which starts meetings with a prayer read by a rabbi , said : ' All councillors of many different faiths have enjoyed the tradition of prayers at full council meetings .
' To ban this activity just seems like religiously correct madness and to go against common sense . '
Society Hill
pimp
Allen E. Brown
got a little testy in court this morning and was sentenced to 18 years in prison by
Judge Kevin Callahan
in Hudson County Superior Court in Jersey City .
Brown , aka
Prince
, was shocked at the length of the sentence .
" 18 years ? " Brown blurted out in court when Callahan announced the sentence .
" This will take you to your 60th birthday until you see the light of day " said Callahan .
" The facts of this case are horrendous .
They are vast . "
Brown , 48 , who authorities say operating the ring out of a home on Lyon Avenue in the upscale development on the Hackensack River , was sentenced to 10 years for racketeering and eight years for extortion .
When Brown first walked into the courtroom he said to his lawyer , Adam Reisman , " I 'm tired of your bulls ---. "
His hair was styled exquisitely , with wavy strands curled on his forehead and a long thin ponytail hanging over his shoulders .
Even before he was sentenced Brown told the judge he did n't understand how much time he faced .
His attorney told the judge Brown refused to go over the sentencing materials with him .
Callhan said he was concerned because in Brown 's written statement Brown seemed to back away from some of the admissions he made when he pleaded guilty in early April .
Callahan sent the defense lawyer and Brown out to discuss the matter and when they returned Brown said he stood by his plea hearing admissions .
At the plea hearing Brown , who admitted he ran a human trafficking and prostitution ring , was told he faced from 12 to 20 years in prison .
Authorities say he enslaved women and girls , some as young at 17 , and forced them to turn tricks on the streets .
He even turned some into drug addicts , authorities say .
Authorities say the woman were forced to earn $ 500 on weeknights and $ 1,000 on weekend nights , or else they were denied entry back into the house , were denied drugs or were beaten .
Assistant Attorney General , Annmarie Taggert said Brown extorted a $ 600,000 inheritance from a woman who turned over the money because the woman feared for her and her niece 's lives .
Taggert added that one woman who refused become a prostitute was handcuffed to a bed and forced to take heroin until she became addicted .
Brown 's mother , Tecora Brown , and his sister , Veronica , attended the sentencing .
Tecora Brown pleaded guilty to promoting prostitution and is not expected to be given prison time .
Authorities say the Lyon Avenue home belonged to Tecora Brown .
" It 's all lies , " Veronica Brown said after the sentencing .
She said her brother was trying to help the women who were already drug - addicted prostitutes .
Brown said that her brother bought one of the women a computer and that woman now works at a hospital in South Jersey .

Nikon 300/2 ED -IF
Having the distinction of being the fastest production 300 mm lens ever made for 35 SLRs , the compact Nikkor 300/2 ED - IF AIS weighs in at a petite 16 lbs .
Sold complete in the CT - 300 Aluminum case with its custom TC - 14C Teleconverter and custom Hood Extension , the 300/2 IF was special order only .
It was sure to make any true photog 's heart go pitter - patter , at least until they found out about the $ 29,000 list price --- then it was heart attack time .
Some sources say there are two versions , but for all practical versions , there is only one .
Although announced in 1981 , this early 300 / 2 was apparently only produced as a prototype -- not a production lens .
The prototype has a separate lens hood and an optional small economical 160 mm protective optical flat .
Pictured is the production AIS version , with built in retractable hood , drop in 52 mm filters and a permanently mounted 160 mm optical flat protective filter .
The 300/ 2 has 11 elements in three groups , of which 3 of the first 4 are ED ( Extra Low Dispersion ) glass for maximum optical performance .
The 300/2 uses Nikon multi-coating , called Nikon Integrated Coating ( NIC ) on all air to glass lens element surfaces .
I 've been told that the 300 / 2 is sharper at f /2 than the superb 300/2.8 at 2.8 !
IF your work demands a 300 / 2 , this is your first , last , and only choice .
Both pics show the same lens !
Shown is the 300/2 with TC - 14C Teleconverter , mounted on a Nikon F .
The right hand shot shows no lens hood mounted .
The left pic shows the built in hood extended , as well as the supplementary HE - 1 ( Hood Extension ) mounted for maximum flare prevention .
What 's a Hood Extension ?
It 's a second lens hood added to the first one !
Built in amenities include a large 360 rotating tripod socket without detents , with two 1/4 tripod threads and one 3/8th tripod thread .
Also included are side mounted strap lugs for the ever convenient hand held shot .
Close focus is 13 feet or 4 meters .
Internal focusing helps explain the 300 / 2's compact size , with a diameter of only 183 mm and a length of only 339 mm ( without lens hoods ) .
The drop in filter drawer takes standard 52 mm Nikon filters .
The optics are designed to have a filter mounted in the drawer at all times .
Close up of the 300/2's custom TC - 14C 1.4
Teleconverter which was automatically included with the lens .
It turns the 300/ 2 into a 420/ 2.8 .
Specially designed for the 300/2 , Nikon describes the TC - 14C as having " outstanding resolution with virtually no loss in image quality . "
In practical terms , the fates often separate the 300 / 2 from its TC - 14C and CT - 300 case .
Note the robust solid construction .
Keeping in standard Nikon practice , the gold ring identifies this as a lens having ED or Extra Low Dispersion glass for superior optical performance .
There is only one gold ring , but three ED elements in the 300/2 .
A complete 300 / 2 second version includes 1 ) the lens 2 ) CT - 300 case 3 ) TC - 14C Teleconverter
4 ) HE - 1 Hood Extension 5 ) large vinyl drawstring front lens cap 6 ) drop in gelatin filter holder .
300/2 AIS production lenses started at 182121 .
The last reported serial number is 182561 , making for an estimated production of 450 .
Considering the 300 / 2's incredibly highly list price , I 'm that surprised that many were made , but a unique lens justified the big investment .
Very popular with Hollywood cinematographers , probably at least half were converted to motion picture mounts , further reducing the ranks even more for the Nikon photographer or collector with deep pockets .
Trivia : Pentax showed a 300 / 2 prototype in the late ' 70s , but it never made it to the production line .
BTW , a Pentax 300/ 2 Prototype was shown , but never made it to production .
Aspherical Element ?
Close examination of this particular lens has led several very knowledgeable Nikon people to conclude the 4th element is Aspherical !
While I am not absolutely sure , it does seem very likely because I trust their judgment .
What 's interesting is Nikon does n't publicly claim the 300/ 2 is Aspherical .
Whether standard production , or a limited prototype , is unknown .
If you have any information on the subject , please let me know .

Manufactured only on special order from 1983 to 1985 , no other production 300 has duplicated the Nikkor 300 / 2's phenomenal speed .

New York ( CNN ) -- A Long Island , New York , man was sentenced to 25 years in prison -- the maximum -- Wednesday for his role in the stabbing death of an immigrant from Ecuador .
Jeffrey Conroy was convicted in April of manslaughter as a hate crime in the death of Marcelo Lucero , an immigrant from Ecuador .
Upon hearing the sentence , Conroy 's father , Robert , cursed and yelled , saying " He was 17 , for Christ 's sake ! "
The elder Conroy was escorted out of the courtroom by guards and held in a private room until he regained control .
He would not speak to reporters .
Conroy was accused of having a hand in the death of Lucero , 37 , who was fatally stabbed in the chest on November 8 , 2008 , in Patchogue , New York .
Conroy was also found guilty of gang assault and conspiracy as well as of assaulting three other Latino men on Long Island .
He was found not guilty of murder as a hate crime , the most serious charge he faced .
Prosecutors say Conroy and six friends in 2008 targeted Latinos for assaults -- part of a sport they called " beaner - hopping . "
Several of the seven defendants pleaded guilty to various charges .
At the time of their arrest , six of the seven , including Conroy , were 17 .
The seventh was 16 .

Talk about " sticker shock . "
" When I saw it , I thought it was mistake , " said Sandra Rubio upon receiving a whopping $ 8,000 energy bill .
A few days later , she received a letter from CPS Energy telling her a clerical error had caused her to be underbilled for nearly five years .
The utility , owned by the city of San Antonio , Texas , apologized but said the mother of three would have to pay the bill in its entirety .
" It 's gonna be real hard , " said Rubio in an interview with CNN Radio .
" My boyfriend is the only one in the home who works .
There are days when it 's slow and he does n't work at all .
I have to pay it back no matter what and I feel cheated . "
The problem began when a new meter was installed at the Rubio home in 2005 , according to Theresa Brown Cortez , a spokeswoman for CPS Energy .
An office employee incorrectly entered a number , causing a multiplier to register as " 0 " instead of " 1 , " she said .
Rubio was not billed for any electric service even though the meter itself was properly tracking the usage .
CPS Energy supplies both natural gas and electricity to the home , Cortez said , and the utilities are billed together .
A bar graph on the bill shows how much of the amount owed is for gas and how much is for electricity .
Rubio was billed for gas consumption , as well as base charges for having gas and electric service , she said .
However , she was n't billed at all for electric consumption .
" The customer on their bill could have seen electric service was given to their home , however they had no consumption , " Cortez said .
But Rubio said she saw nothing unusual on her statements stuck out to her .
" We do n't know how to calculate those numbers and what those numbers mean , " she said .
" You trust that whatever they send you , whatever that amount is , that 's your bill . "
Rubio said CPS told her that for the next seven years she will have to pay $ 98 a month on top of her regular monthly bill to pay off the debt , She worries that unforeseen circumstances could make this payment plan very difficult on her .
" It 's already hard trying to pay three or four hundred dollars a month .
What if one month I can't pay my full amount ?
I 'm worried they 're going to turn my lights off , " she said .
Rubio plans on seeking some form of assistance to help her pay her debt , but she is n't optimistic .
" I know that anywhere I go they 're going to look at it and say it 's too much , " she said .
" I do n't even know what I 'm going to do .
I 'm just going to try and see what happens . "
" We regret that we have human error in this situation , " said Cortez .
" We 're going to do everything we can to work with this family to make this as manageable as possible to get this bill paid . "
Company policy calls for the utility to bring in all money owed for services rendered , Cortez said .
The company 's sales revenues support the city budget , she said .

By Giles Ji Ungpakorn
May 26 , 2010 -- Make no mistake .
We have a full military junta in Thailand with Abhisit Vejjajiva acting as a “ democratic ” mask .
The repression and censorship is worse than even after the October 6 , 1976 coup .
More people have been killed by the army than in any previous repression .
It is worse than during the Sarit dictatorship era in the 1960s and the reason is that the regime is trying desperately to suppress the biggest mass movement for democracy in Thai history .
Hundreds are being rounded up .
There is widespread censorship .
The regime is increasingly looking like China , Burma or North Korea .
The Thai military junta , headed by Abhisit Vejjajiva , is now responsible for at least 88 deaths since April 10 .
It has heavily censored all media and internet sites .
It is afraid of the truth and free debate .
All this is to avoid elections and to cling to power .
Abhisit , the military and his conservative royalist cronies are dragging Thailand back to the dark ages and the middle - class NGOs and most academics are supporting this cause .
The National Human Rights Commission is helping to prosecute the pro-democracy United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship ( UDD ) .
NGO senator Rosana and her band of right - wing friends were calling for the army to slaughter the Red Shirts .
Today the Thai junta blocked the independent internet newspaper Prachatai once again and banned all Red Shirt publications .
Many people who are in jail are being threatened with the death sentence .
While hundreds of Red Shirts are in custody for demanding democracy , the fascist yellow - shirted PAD [ People 's Alliance for Democracy , who shut down the international airports in late 2008 , have had any proceedings against them delayed ... yet again .
And what about the king ?
Many people may remember the Buddhist monks who chanted for peace at the Victory Monument just before the army moved in to kill civilians at Rajprasong on May 19 - 21 .
Compare that with the total silence of the king and the support for the junta shown by the queen and the crown prince .
What a useless and parasitic life these aristocrats live !
The junta ’s success in clinging to power by murdering the people is merely success built on sand .
They can kill hundreds and imprison thousands , but they will never win the hearts and minds on the people .
Thailand will never be the same again .

Police general Wanchai Srinuannat , chairperson of the Thai National Human Rights Commission ( NHRC ) committee on Rights in the Justice System , has urged the public to make complaints to the NHRC about being affected by the Red Shirt protests in Bangkok .
The NHRC will then bring prosecutions against the UDD .
Abhisit 's government and the military sent tanks and snipers in to crush the Red Shirt pro-democracy demonstration .
The NHRC has refused to confront the actions of the government , whether on state violence or on blanket censorship .
The NHRC has also refused to take up the issue of lese majeste , which is used to imprison government opponents .
So - called independent bodies like the NHRC were all stuffed with junta supporters after the 2006 military coup .
This , together with the installation of the Democrat Party government and PM Abhisit , are part of the expansion of power by the military and royalist elites .
The Senate is half appointed and the constitution was written by the military .
This is the regime supported by the middle class , the local NGOs and most academics .
[ Giles Ji Ungpakorn is a Thai socialist currently in exile in Britain .
He is a member of Left Turn Thailand and maintains a blog at http://wdpress.blog.co.uk/.]
May 25 , 2010 -- Socialist Worker ( USA ) --
Thai armed forces and police used tanks and live ammunition May 19 - 21 to clear an encampment of pro-democracy demonstrators , known as the Red Shirts because of their clothing , who had been demonstrating for weeks to demand that the unelected , military - backed government call new elections .
Giles Ji Ungpakorn is a Thai dissident who was accused of lese majeste -- essentially , not being loyal to Thailand 's king -- and forced to flee the country last year .
He has continued to provide a left - wing analysis of events in Bangkok .
He spoke to the US International Socialist Organization 's Lee Sustar in the aftermath of the crackdown .
What is the level of repression in Thailand ?
We have curfews in a number of areas .
I 'm not sure if they actually declared martial law .
But for some days now they have areas that were free - fire zones .
But since the demonstrations ended under such pressure , people have been setting fire to buildings in many places in Bangok and the provinces and so on .
They have been very carefully targeted , really .
There have been government buildings , provincial headquarters in the north and the northeast provinces .
They set fire to the stock exchange , luxury shopping malls and so on .
The death toll is now 80 - plus since April 10 .
But I 'm sure they have n't accounted for all of those killed .
Soldiers have the tendency to drag bodies away and try to hide them .
Was the government 's offer of early elections sincere ?
I think it was a ploy to give themselves some breathing space .
They were n't really sincere about coming to a compromise .
At the same time as they offered elections , they still had charges of terrorism and of trying to overthrow the monarchy leveled at the Red Shirt leaders .
The relatives of those killed on April 10 had pressed charges against the prime minister and deputy prime minister for murder .
The government side was brushing aside those charges .
This was quite significant , because in the last two years , there has been a complete double standard in the use of the law .
Demonstrators have closed down airports -- the Yellow Shirt fascists did that in 2008 [ when they functioned as a street force that helped the military oust a democratically elected government ] .
None of the Yellow Shirts have been punished at all .
But now , there are lots of Red Shirts in jail .
You 've described the Red Shirts as a class movement rooted in the countryside .
Can you tell us how the movement evolved during the demonstrations ?
The movement was started off by the leaders from the old party of Thaksin Shinawatra [ the prime minister who was ousted in a 2006 military coup ] .
They had a TV program called Truth Today .
Later , the program got banned from mainstream TV , so they decided to try to have a TV program in a football stadium , and about 100,000 people turned up .
It really grew from there .
People went back to their communities and to Bangkok as well , and started to build connections and organisation .
These groups help each other .
They raise money for travelling to protests .
They have ways that some people can access the Internet and get through the censorship through various computer programs .
They spread the news that way .
In many cases , they run community radio stations .
It 's a very grassroots movement .
As Marxists , we can understand that things can be contradictory .
The Red Shirts can be very supportive of Thaksin because he provided health care to the entire population and pursued pro-poor policies .
But at the same time , they are not being manipulated and used by him .
They have genuine grievances .
Their democratic rights have been stolen , and this is very much related to class issues .
Because the people who stole their democratic rights have insulted ordinary people , saying that they 're not fit to vote -- that they 're too stupid , too poor and uneducated .
Democratic rights went hand in hand with the benefits they got from the elected governments .
The struggle for democracy and class social justice are completely tied up .
In the beginning of March , the Red Shirt leadership started to use the language of class struggle .
They said that they were all serfs .
Lots of people made numerous speeches saying that they were the ordinary people , fighting against the entrenched elite , the rich , people who are bloodsuckers and so on .
Because of all the bloodshed and brutality , and the fact that the king has remained completely silent , and the queen has supported the Yellow Shirts , it is quite likely that the vast majority of the Red Shirts now completely hate the monarchy .
That is many millions of people .
It 's a new phenomenon .
What will become of the movement now ?
Quite a few of the high - profile leaders are in prison .
And the authorities are trying to capture some of the lower - profile ones .
Also , they 're going for provincial leaders and so on .
The movement will have to throw up new leadership .
If it is to remain strong , the way it was built in communities has to be strengthened .
And the groups have to coordinate with each other .
If it is to be strong , that leadership has to represent the different communities .
That 's something I 've been arguing for .
But whether or not that will happen is another matter .
Whar are the links between the Red Shirt movement and the left and trade unions ?
The existing left is really small , and those who were serious about building a left - wing movement formed a united front and became Red Shirts .
There were some who want to remain pure and did n't engage in the struggle , but in my opinion , they are quite irrelevant .
Trade union activists were on the Red Shirt protests .
But they did n't come in union contingents .
They did n't call for strikes .
There was discussion toward the end about the possibility of strike action , but it never happened .
The bus workers ' unions did come on stage during the protests and gave donations .
The local electricity distribution workers came on stage .
There were areas in Bangkok where roadblocks were set up by Red Shirts -- places where there are factories .
So there 's potential there .
But the Red Shirt leadership , because they 're not from the left -- and they 're not used to the kind of activism the left would do -- ignored this .
You wrote over the past few months about some of the NGOs that were blaming the Red Shirts equally with the government for the violence .
At the beginning , some would say that this was a dispute between Thaksin and the conservative elite .
They did n't understand the dynamics of the Red Shirt movement , and therefore they remained aloof .
Later , they became semi-sympathetic , but still would n't go in with the Red Shirts , so they remained irrelevant .
But the NGO movement had already disgraced itself during the military coup of 2006 .
They supported the coup .
They supported the Yellow Shirt fascists .
When they talked about the need to avoid bloodshed in recent weeks and months , they were saying that both sides need to avoid it .
But on the one side , we have a heavily armed repressive state , using tanks and armed troops against unarmed , peaceful demonstrators .
And they 're still saying that both sides need to take responsibility ?
This is n't the first time that troops have cracked down on demonstrators in Thai history .
What 's distinctive about this period ?
What 's historic is the Red Shirt movement -- that it 's so large , and made up of ordinary workers and small farmers .
It 's a mass movement that has been mobilised and active since late 2008 , and it 's growing .
Also , the protests were prolonged , and so was the bloodshed .
I think the body count was also unprecedented as well .
The official spin in the media about the 2006 coup against Thaksin was that it was a " relief " for Thailand .
It was a relief for the middle class , the right wing and the NGO types who were reactionary .
It was a shock and horror to millions of Thai people who voted for the government .
The journalists who talk about it being a relief were only talking to the middle class .
The middle class throughout this event took a very reactionary position -- anti-democratic and sometimes semi-fascist -- in the same way that the middle class took an extremely reactionary position in the military coup of 1976 .
But there have been other cases where the middle class has gone along with the democracy movement .
It vacillates all the time .
What has changed in the social base of the regime ?
If you look at 1970s , when the Communist Party of Thailand was strong , there were serious splits in Thai society , and the monarchy was not that popular .
I think the monarchy reached its pinnacle in terms of gaining hegemony when the CPT was crushed in the mid-1980s .
This crisis has its roots in the 1997 economic crisis , when the Thai economy collapsed and a lot of Asian economies went with it .
The response of the ruling class to the crisis of 1997 was to make the poor pay for it .
It did n't provide anything to the poor .
People who became unemployed were told to go back to their villages .
Along came Thaksin Shinawatra , a fairly modernist capitalist , if you like .
He saw that if Thailand was to become competitive in the world market and climb out of the crisis , he had to bring the majority of the population on board and make them what he called stakeholders .
He saw that if there were a decent health care system , education and all that , the capitalist system would be more efficient .
But this really rocked the boat .
Because it meant that the old ways in which the elite had ruled -- by offering the poor virtually nothing -- could no longer be used .
Plus , Thaksin became immensely popular .
The Thai ruling elite has traditionally used the monarchy to legitimise everything it does .
So if the army stages a coup , it claims legitimacy from the monarchy , and the monarchy is happy to go along with this .
The monarchy itself is quite weak , but it 's given the appearance of strength .
It 's used in an ideological way to back up everything the elites do , including the 2006 military coup against Thaksin .
Because of the coup , the use of the monarchy , and the way that the monarchy has been seen to be on the side of the military and the conservative elite , there 's now a deep crisis once again , like there was in the 1970s and the 1930s .
The popularity of the monarchy has gone up and down .
What we see now in Thailand is the division between the two sides : a conservative elite that uses brute force , allows democracy at certain times and uses the monarchy to legitimise itself -- versus Thaksin , who uses pro-poor policies to gain a mass base through democratic means .
Between those two choices , the people have chosen democracy .
That means in trying to struggle for democracy after the coup , they have come up against the ideology of the monarchy that is being used against them .
That is bringing the monarchy into crisis .
What is the potential to organise openly now ?
The censorship is very severe at the moment .
People are still playing cat - and - mouse games -- opening new web sites , having them closed down , and moving them .
Whar kind of factor will the economy be in the months ahead ?
Regimes can benefit if they can cling to power and the economy starts to grow .
But it 's much too early to say , since we still have the world economic crisis -- although the expansion of the economy in China is probably helping Thai economy .
On the other hand , the social unrest will have a negative effect .
It 's difficult to tell .
Are there splits in the ruling class that could give the popular movement room to come back ?
They wanted to delay the elections so that the Red Shirts would demobilise .
They were trying to buy time , and maybe hope that the longer they postpone elections , the more they could find ways to boost their popularity .
But the killings must have had an impact on the way people view the government .
There are splits in the ruling elite all the time .
But they are still united in their opposition to the Red Shirts .
They have a relationship with the movements from below .
If you have a lot of pressure from below , certain elements in the ruling class will say , " Right , we 're going to sacrifice the prime minister to save our own skins . "
But if the Red Shirts do n't mobilise , I 'm not sure we can rely on splits in the ruling class .
What can people outside Thailand do to support the pro-democracy movement ?
One issue that 's very important is that of political prisoners .
That 's something people in the US and Europe can help campaign around .
It is very important to see that all the prisoners are political prisoners , whatever the charges that they may face .
Some may face charges of terrorism or trying to overthrow the monarchy , some of blocking roads .
But all of these things have to be seen as political charges , and they all need to be opposed .
We need to pressure human rights groups , the Obama administration and other governments .
Next month , amid the usual hoopla , Apple is expected to officially unveil its latest gadget : the much - awaited iPhone 4G .
But halfway round the globe from the company 's California headquarters , a young worker who has spent months in an eastern Chinese hospital wants consumers to look beyond the shiny exterior of such gadgets .
" People should know what we do to create these products and what cost we pay , " said Bai Bing as she perched on a bed in her ward .
She is one of scores of young workers in the city of Suzhou who were poisoned by the chemical n- hexane , which they say was used to clean Apple components including iPhone touch screens .
Wu Mei – who , like the others , asked the Guardian to use her nickname – recalled her fear as her health suddenly deteriorated last spring .
At first , she thought she was simply tired from the long working hours at Wintek , a Taiwan - owned electronics giant supplying several well - known brands .
She was weaker than before and noticed she could not walk so fast .
" Then it became more and more serious .
I found it very hard to go upstairs and if I squatted down I did n't have the strength to get up .
Later my hands became numb and I lost my balance – I would fall over if someone touched me , " she said .
By summer , she was admitted to hospital , where doctors struggled to diagnose the cause .
" I was terrified .
I feared I might be paralysed and spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair , " she said .
Because she was using n- hexane directly , she was one of the first and worst affected .
But more and more workers from the same room were suffering headaches , dizziness and weakness , and pains in their limbs .
An occupational diseases hospital which saw several victims diagnosed the problem in August and Wintek stopped using the chemical .
But thanks to the previous months of exposure , at least 62 workers would require medical care .
Many spent months in hospital .
Some believe more employees left Wintek after being taken ill , before they realised what was wrong .
Prolonged over - exposure to n-hexane can cause extensive damage to the peripheral nervous system and ultimately the spinal cord , leading to muscular weakness and atrophy and even paralysis , said Paul Whitehead , a toxicology consultant and member of the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry .
It can also affect male fertility .
Recovery can take a year or more .
The chemical 's potential risks are well - known in industry , as are safe exposure limits .
But the Wintek manager who decided to switch from alcohol to n-hexane for cleaning – apparently because it dried more quickly – did not assess the dangers .
It was used without proper ventilation .
The change was obvious ; workers disliked the pungent smell of n-hexane .
But they had no idea it might affect their health .
" We had n't even heard of occupational illnesses before , " said Wintek worker Xiao Ling .
" I'm very , very angry , " added Wu . " I thought they behaved too badly . "
Asked if they knew what products they were working on , three of the affected Wintek employees said team leaders told them they were working for Apple .
They instantly recognised pictures of an iPhone and said they were cleaning touch screens , adding that items for other brands were not affected because Apple had isolated its production line .
A lawyer acting for 44 of the poisoning victims also said several had named Apple .
Wintek , which does not discuss its clients , said it had replaced the factory 's general manager .
It now notifies workers whose jobs may involve risk in advance , has tightened procedures for the introduction of new chemicals , and carries out medical checks .
It has paid medical fees for those affected and says it will pay compensation according to the law .
Given that the assessment and appeals process for compensation can take as long as a decade , lawyers hope the firm will pay quickly as well as fairly .
Other patients at the hospital say they too became sick while using n- hexane on Apple products .
Bai Bing said she and her colleagues were cleaning components including Apple logos – the kind that appear at the bottom of desktop screens – when she fell ill .
Her employer , Yunheng , could not be reached , but work safety officials in Suzhou have said eight employees were poisoned there as they carried out work sub - contracted by another firm , Surtec .
A Surtec employee confirmed that it made Apple logos , but a spokesman said it knew nothing about Yunheng or the poisoning .
Wintek has previously faced questions about its treatment of workers , with disputes in Taiwan and at another plant on the mainland .
The Suzhou case only grabbed public attention when lingering concern over the poisoning and anger over unpaid bonuses sparked a mass protest .
Wintek blamed a misunderstanding and said bonuses had been paid and the dispute – like the other conflicts – resolved .
It added that it had worked to improve communications with workers .
There is no suggestion that Apple was responsible for the use of n-hexane .
Apple declined to answer questions about the poisonings or about the firms involved , saying it does not reveal who it works with , although its spokeswoman added that Wintek had been " quite proactive " in discussing the issue .
Instead it pointed to its code of conduct , which sets strict requirements for working and environmental practices , adding that many suppliers say they are the only customer carrying out such checks .
But the 2010 audit shows that manufacturers are routinely breaching the code .
The majority – 54 % – broke the 60 - hour weekly work limit more than half the time .
Another 39 % failed to meet occupational injury prevention requirements ; 17 % failed on chemical exposure standards ; and 35 % did not meet wage and benefits requirements , with 24 of the 102 factories audited paying less than minimum wage for regular hours .
Three facilities used underage workers and three had falsified records .
Apple said it terminated the contract in one of the latter cases , and required suppliers to make improvements and submit to reviews following other breaches .
It has also trained more workers about their rights .
The firm argues that publishing the audits provides a level of transparency .
But until it identifies its manufacturers , outsiders have no way of assessing how well its policies are working and what action it is taking to deal with problems such as the n-hexane poisoning .
" Apple is the most paranoid about commercial and product secrecy .
That 's getting in the way of ensuring workers ' rights are protected , " says Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin , a Hong Kong - based organisation campaigning for workers ' rights .
The US giant – which last month reported quarterly profits of more than $ 3bn – could afford to monitor factories with serious issues " day in , day out " if it wished , he added .
" Apple products are not cheap and most Apple customers are willing to pay a premium – so why not add a tiny little bit extra to ensure working and environmental standards are met , as well as product quality ? " he asked .
In the meantime , while Wintek says most of the poisoned employees have returned to work , at least some are opting to protect themselves by leaving factory life .
" I want to be as far as possible away from chemicals and the electronics plants , " said Bai Bing .
" I want some job , safe . "
So now the real fight begins .
If , as seems almost certain , we are to have a hung parliament , the UK 's locked - down politics has suddenly been flung wide open .
For the first time in living memory , we have a chance to smash our antediluvian system .
If we can seize the opportunity a hung parliament offers , to deliver proportional representation and party - funding reform , we will change politics in the UK for ever .
Now we have the chance to be counted : metaphorically and literally .
Our votes need never be wasted again .
But it wo n't happen by itself : nothing ever does .
We will change this system despite most of the men and women who have just taken seats at Westminster , not because of them .
Radical constitutional reform will happen only if we demand it , so loudly and so doggedly that parliament and government , whatever their composition might be , can no longer fend us off .
The fight starts tomorrow , with rallies in London , Glasgow , Manchester , Bristol , Middlesborough , Oxford and possibly other cities .
It is being coordinated by the kind of wide - ranging coalition we 've needed for years , as almost all the major reform campaigns – Power2010 , Make Votes Count , Unlock Democracy , the Electoral Reform Society , Ekklesia , Compass , Hang 'em , Vote for a Change and others – have settled their differences and come together .
( The only name missing from the list is 38 Degrees [ see footnote ] , which appears to have decided that its real enemies are other democracy campaigns . )
Most encouragingly , some of the big environment groups – Greenpeace , Friends of the Earth , the New Economics Foundation – have joined the coalition , knowing that much of what they hope to achieve is impossible under the corrupt old system .
Greenpeace and FoE bring mass membership to the campaign , and their presence should encourage other NGOs to join .
So , now the UK has its own colour revolution .
The colour is purple ( my call for ginger sadly bit the dust ) .
A few hours ago , at midnight , the coalition launched its site – www.takebackparliament.com – and this time , we 're not expecting someone else to jump .
In 1997 , political reformers assumed they had got the result they wanted , and waited for the new government to reform our rotten system , as it had promised to do in opposition .
And waited …
Now we are n't waiting any longer .
Patience at times like these is no virtue .
We 'll beat down the doors of parliament until it gives us a fair , representative system , which is governed by the political choices of the whole nation , not just those of a few thousand swing voters in tight constituencies .
If you want your vote to count in future – in fact , if you care about any political outcomes – join up .
It 's the first chance we have had in generations .
And it could be the last .

The Hollow Euro Specter of Inflation Haunts Europe
If Europe 's single currency is really to be saved , fundamental reforms have to follow the emergency bailout by euro - zone members .
The biggest danger comes , however , from the European Central Bank , which has given up its role as the protector of price stability .
The risk of inflation is increasing .

BREAKING NEWS !
KEEP REFRESHING !
3:30 PM UPDATE !
Here ’s the latest news on this fast - moving story .
A deal was in place if NBC picked up the Law & Order flagship for a 21st season consisting of 16 episodes .
But insiders say Dick Wolf is now accusing the network of going back ( some use the word “ reneging ” ) on that arrangement made in March : “ He ’s so fucking angry , you have no idea . ”
As recently as the start of this week , even NBCU chief Jeff Zucker was privately telling people that L&O would get one more season .
That ’s certainly what Wolf and his longtime reps ( UTA and Ziffren Brittenham legal eagle Cliff Gilbert ) were led to believe from NBC suits Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin .
That is , until last night .
Wolf simply wanted NBC to live up to the deal that both sides had agreed to back in March .
According to that arrangement already in place , NBC / Universal Media Studios was supposed to go to TNT and negotiate a new deal ( the old one was up ) whereby the cable channel would finance some original episodes of Law & Order in order to continue getting runs of the show .
“ And , for whatever reason , NBC was unwilling to engage in a serious way with TNT .
They did n’t do it .
At the last minute , they said , ‘ We ’ll pick the show up and this is how we ’re going to do it ’ .
Which was ludicrous . ”
That ’s when NBC threw its agreement with Wolf out the window and demanded Wolf kick in to help “ finance the pickup of Law & Order out of all the money he ’s made .
And his reps said , ‘ Never going to happen ’ , ” according to an insider .
Another source explained the situation : “ Graboff broke off the negotiations last night when they fell apart based on Team Dick ’s unwillingness to make certain deal concessions deemed unreasonable . ”
But that ’s not all .
According to NBC insiders , immediately , Team Dick contacted Gaspin .
And that email exchange revealed that Gaspin did n’t realize the show had been cancelled .
Network sources say there was a lack of communication between Graboff and Gaspin , who did n’t know the negotiations had broken off .
But then Gaspin confirmed it .
This morning and afternoon , the producers began calling reps for the show ’s stars and telling them about the cancellation .
Now Wolf wants to try to make a deal to take the Law & Order flagship to TNT , the same place that John Wells and Warner Bros took Southland after it , too , was cancelled by NBC .
In that case , NBC tried to hold up the switch .
And that could happen this time as well , or even something much more complicated since Law & Order is a UMS show .
NBC so far has not issued any public statement confirming the cancellation .
It is possible , just possible , that this could be a game of chicken — and NBC come back to Wolf ’s reps honoring the deal made in March .
Do n’t be surprised if talks start up again .
Wolf , after all still has L&O : SVU , L&O : Criminal Intent , and now the newest spinoff , L&O : Los Angeles on NBC .
I hear the next test of wills may come immediately because Wolf wants LOLA ( the new show ’s nickname ) to be given the Wednesday 10 PM time slot right after L&O : SVU .
There may be more to report today , so stay tuned .
EXCLUSIVE 2 PM : This one is a shocker .
Veteran crime drama Law & Order will not get its shot at history after all .
I hear that after long deliberations , NBC has decided to cancel the long - running procedural , which will end its run at 20 seasons , tied with Gunsmoke .
This is very surprising as NBC brass had indicated lately that they would bring L&O for a record - breaking 21st season .
But with strong development , especially on the drama side , and soft ratings for L&O , NBC apparently opted not to keep the aging series , which spawned several successful spinoffs .
The latest , Law & Order : Los Angeles , will launch next season .
L&O ‘s renewal by NBC was also contingent on securing a sizable commitment from the series ’ cable home TNT whose off - network deal for the show was up at the end of this season .
Bideford 's mayor would like a moment 's silence to replace prayers A legal battle has begun in an attempt to stop prayers being said before a Devon council 's meetings .
The National Secular Society ( NSS ) is seeking a judicial review over whether prayers said at Bideford Town Council breach human rights legislation .
It said the " archaic practice " was " not appropriate in modern - day Britain " .
Mayor Andrew Powell said it was " a bit of an over - reaction " , to threaten legal action against the 16 - member council , which has voted twice to keep prayers .
The NSS , which believes religion should be separate from government , said the legal move was prompted by a complaint from atheist councillor Clive Bone .
Religious worship is a fundamental human right , but so is procreation and people do not take that into the council chamber
Councillor Clive Bone
Two motions by Mr Bone to end prayers before meetings have been rejected .
He described the prayer sessions as " embarrassing " , and added : " I support the right of people to express religion .
" It is a fundamental human right , but so is procreation and people do not take that into the council chamber . "
The NSS says prayers , which are said in hundreds of councils throughout England , a breach Article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights , which it says guarantees freedom of thought , conscience and religion for non-believers .
' Fire and brimstone ' NSS Executive Director , Keith Porteous Wood , said : " It is not appropriate in modern - day Britain for prayers to form an integral part of the council meeting .
" The majority of people in this country do not enter a church , except perhaps for weddings and funerals , from one year 's end to the next .
It would be obscene if this cost council tax payers money
Andrew PowellMayor of Bideford " It is also possible that some from other religions will not feel comfortable being expected to participate in Christian prayers . "
Clerk to the Council , George McLaughlin , said : " It is not a local matter - I do not know why they have picked on us . "
Bideford 's Mayor , agnostic Andrew Powell , said he would like to see a moment of silence before meetings to replace prayers .
He said : " I do dislike religions imposing their will on others , I do sometimes find the fire and brimstone a bit uncomfortable .
" Everyone has the right to pray , but they could pray in silence which would not be offensive to anyone . "
But he said the legal action was " a bit of an over - reaction " .
" I think there are far greater issues than whether we should pray before council meetings .
" It would be obscene if this cost council tax payers money .
We can not allow that to happen . "

To me , the prospects of a Euro currency surviving over the long term were not helped this week .
The markets have behaved as though some great solutions have been adopted but it seems to me the fundamental problems if anything are worse now .
It is true the short term is more stable .
But at what cost ?
Bailout Is ‘ Nail in the Coffin ’ for Euro , Rogers Says
The 16 - nation currency weakened for a second day against the dollar after rallying as much as 2.7 percent on May 10 , when the governments of the 16 euro nations agreed to make loans of as much as 750 billion euros ( $ 962 billion ) available to countries under attack from speculators and the European Central Bank pledged to intervene in government securities markets .
“ I was stunned , ” Rogers , chairman of Rogers Holdings , said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Singapore .
“ This means that they ’ve given up on the euro , they do n’t particularly care if they have a sound currency , you have all these countries spending money they do n’t have and it ’s now going to continue . ”
…
“ It ’s a political currency and nobody is minding the economics behind the necessities to have a strong currency , ” Rogers said .
“ I ’m afraid it ’s going to dissolve .
They ’re throwing more money at the problem and it ’s going to make things worse down the road . ”
This makes sense to me .
The problems with the Euro also explain why the dollar has n’t fallen more over the last few years .
The only significant alternative is the Yen .
The BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) are looking to increase the profile of their currencies supposedly – or even forming their version of the Euro ( I ca n’t see how that could happen ) .
Greece ’s budget deficit of 13.6 percent of gross domestic product is the second - highest in the euro zone after Ireland ’s 14.3 percent .
As part of the bailout plan , Spain and Portugal also pledged deeper deficit reductions than previously planned .
…
[ Rogers suggests ]
Investors should instead buy precious metals including gold or currencies of countries that have large natural resources , Rogers said .
Among other asset classes , he favors agricultural commodities as the best bet for the next decade as well as silver because prices have n’t rallied .
It is very difficult for the politicians in the USA , United Kingdom and other countries to behave fiscally responsible when their taxpayers will eventually have to pay the bill .
When you can hope to have others bail you out it seems that much less likely people will behave responsibly .
Then again I was skeptical the Euro would be created without first having more consolidation of European governments .
There are lots of good things about having the Euro , but in the long run there are very challenging issues to deal with .

NEW YORK , May 12 ( UPI ) -- American Eagle Outfitters says it has agreed to drop a rule that banned men from wearing women 's clothing and women from dressing as men .
The agreement was reached with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office after the activist group Make the Road New York complained about discrimination against transgender job hunters .

The retailer , without admitting any wrongdoing , signed a settlement deal promising to change its policies and employee handbook .
The changes include dropping the gender clothing rule while agreeing to train staff on transgender issues , such as which pronouns to use when addressing workers and customers , The New York Daily News reported Wednesday .
" We wholeheartedly believe that transgender individuals should be treated equally , " an American Eagle spokesman said in a statement .
The settlement is the first against a retailer under a state law barring employers from discriminating against applicants because of gender identity .
Accuracy is not the only metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a classifier .
Two other useful metrics are precision and recall .
These two metrics can provide much greater insight into the performance characteristics of a binary classifier .
Classifier Precision
Precision measures the exactness of a classifier .
A higher precision means less false positives , while a lower precision means more false positives .
This is often at odds with recall , as an easy way to improve precision is to decrease recall .
Classifier Recall
Recall measures the completeness , or sensitivity , of a classifier .
Higher recall means less false negatives , while lower recall means more false negatives .
Improving recall can often decrease precision because it gets increasingly harder to be precise as the sample space increases .
F-measure Metric
Precision and recall can be combined to produce a single metric known as F - measure , which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall .
I find F - measure to be about as useful as accuracy .
Or in other words , compared to precision & recall , F - measure is mostly useless , as you ’ll see below .
Measuring Precision and Recall of a Naive Bayes Classifier
The NLTK metrics module provides functions for calculating all three metrics mentioned above .
But to do so , you need to build 2 sets for each classification label : a reference set of correct values , and a test set of observed values .
Below is a modified version of the code from the previous article , where we trained a Naive Bayes Classifier .
This time , instead of measuring accuracy , we ’ll collect reference values and observed values for each label ( pos or neg ) , then use those sets to calculate the precision , recall , and F - measure of the naive bayes classifier .
The actual values collected are simply the index of each featureset using enumerate .
This confusion can easily be avoided if you pronounce the word intended aloud .
If it has a voiced Z sound , then it ’s “ lose . ”
If it has a hissy S sound , then it ’s “ loose . ”
Here are examples of correct usage : “ He tends to lose his keys . ”
“ She lets her dog run loose . ”
Note that when “ lose ” turns into “ losing ” it loses its “ E . ”

SHE may be the first presidenta in a long line of Costa Rican presidentes , but when Laura Chinchilla is sworn in on May 8th she is liable to disappoint advocates of women 's rights .
She supports her country 's restrictions on abortion and the morning - after pill , and opposes other liberal causes such as gay marriage and the disestablishment of the church .
Instead , her uncuddly passion is fighting crime .
Although Costa Rica is relatively safe , a recent increase in violence has led to panic .
The outbreak has been caused by growing inequality ( says the left ) and the spread of drug - trafficking gangs ( says the right ) .
Mrs Chinchilla promises to fight on both fronts , strengthening the police and getting more youths into classrooms .
To do this will cost money and there is n't much .
The government collects just 14.8 % of national income in taxes , and its deficit is 4 % of GDP .
Mrs Chinchilla says she hopes to increase revenues by taxing casinos and online gambling , which her officials hope would bring in an extra 1 % of GDP .
Deeper fiscal reforms will have to wait a year or two for the economy to regain strength .
Even then , to get her policies through , the new president will need to handle the legislature deftly .
Mrs Chinchilla , of the centrist National Liberation Party , was elected with a thumping 47 % of the vote in a crowded field of candidates , thanks in part to the popularity of her mentor and predecessor , Óscar Arias .
Her party is the biggest in congress , but holds only 24 of the 57 seats .
She will be reliant on a pact with the right - wing Libertarian Movement , whose leader , Otto Guevara , won 21 % of the vote in this year 's presidential election , compared with just 2 % in 2002 .
“ The door to negotiation has opened , ” says the confident Mr Guevara , flanked by portraits of his free - market heroes , Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman .
But in return for supporting the government , he wants tougher sentences for petty criminals and the publication on the internet of the names of all those who receive state benefits .
He vows to filibuster tax increases .
Costa Rica is richer , more democratic and more stable than its Central American neighbours .
But it faces a choice between a bigger state and more reliance on the market .
That dilemma was symbolised by the battle to approve the Central American Free - Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) with the United States .
Mr Arias campaigned hard for the accord , but only narrowly won a referendum on it in 2007 .
He also signed similar agreements with China and Singapore .
Central America has also concluded free - trade talks with the European Union .
“ We are inserting [ Costa Rica ] into the world economy , ” Mr Arias says .
His chief opponent , Otton Solís , accuses him of selling the national interest short both with CAFTA , which obliges Costa Rica to open up the state - controlled telecoms and electricity industries , and in cuddling up to China .
Mrs Chinchilla seems keen to change the subject .
She plans closer ties in South America , and has toured Central America , patching up relations with awkward neighbours such as Nicaragua 's leftist autocrat , Daniel Ortega , with whom Mr Arias was publicly frustrated .
One way and another , she may find her predecessor a hard act to follow .
Famously " troubled " by the Supreme Court 's allowing corporate cash to sway voters with attack ads , President Obama is fighting back with could be called the " Oz law . "
In his weekly Saturday radio and web address , Obama urged Congress to pass a simple , but potentially potent , reform :
Tear away the curtain from " shadowy campaign committees " by showing a picture of the CEO , lobbyist or wealthy political donor along with the attack ad .
Obama 's support of the Disclose Act ( short for " Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections " ) , introduced Thursday by House and Senate Democrats , comes as the Supreme Court last week argued another case of anonymity in politics : the ability of petitioners to avoid harassment by keeping their signatures secret .
So far , both unions and business interests are grumbling about the proposed law , arguing that it does n't adequate protect free speech and is a poorly veiled effort by Democrats to stall a Republican come - back in the November elections .
" The American people … have the right to know when some group like ' Citizens for a Better Future ' is actually funded entirely by ' Corporations for Weaker Oversight , ' " Obama said .
" [ W ] hat we are facing is no less than a potential corporate takeover of our elections .
And what is at stake is no less than the integrity of our democracy . "
In its Citizens United ruling , the Court essentially OK'd what has amounted to a flow of $ 45 million in soft money into political TV ads since 2000 .
But the court also asserted the right of government to force disclosure of top donors behind the ads .
Beyond forcing donors to " Say cheese , " as Sen .
Al Franken puts it , the proposed law limits spending by groups that have taken government bail - out money , as well as foreign donors to US elections .
Republicans ' willingness to either oppose or go along with the measure will test Washington 's political climate , especially as many Americans clamor for a crack down on Wall Street excesses .
But the President said Saturday he expects forceful opposition to the bill as it hits committee hearings this coming week .
Critics point out that the House sponsor , Chris Van Hollen , chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and the Senate sponsor , Chuck Schumer , is immediate past chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee – both fund - raising arms of the national party .
“ This should be seen by the American people – and will be seen by the American people – as nothing than that – an incumbent protection bill , ” Citizen United 's David Bossie , whose group won the Supreme Court case earlier this year , told Politico .
The bill also “ chills free speech .
And this is all about free speech , " Mr. Bossie added .
Yet corporations and wealthy donors are n't the only ones that would have to re-consider and possibly amend their campaign strategies if the bill becomes law .
It could affect Democratic Party politics in many states , as well as limit ubiquitous union attack ads .
In a vigorous debate over the issue of anonymity for petition - signers last week , Supreme Court Justices offered a few more clues on the issue of whether or not political participants should be able to hide behind a curtain .
" What about just wanting to know their names so you can criticize them ? " asked Justice Antonin Scalia .
" Is that such a bad thing for democracy ? "
Scalia added that a prerequisite for political participation is " civic courage . "

You will need 3 stackable bins with a lid for the top bin and a compost tea catching tray to go on the bottom .
You 'll also need some sort of raised platform between the 1st bin( bottom ) and 2nd bin( middle ) .
We used concrete bricks and this allows any excess moisture to drain .
You 'll also need a faucet connector and fittings to drain the compost tea when there is excess moisture .
The only hand tool needed is a drill , and lastly some red wiggler worms
First step : Drill in several holes into the bottom of your 3rd ( top ) bin .
This allows for the worms to be able to migrate up from the 2nd ( middle ) bin , once they have digested all the food in the 2nd bin and have left castings .
This takes up to several months depending on how many worms you have .
We have one and half pounds and will allow for 2 months .
Pay attention to see if there are any worm larvae left behind and wait for then to hatch before gathering the castings .

He then moved back onto the main fuselage of the second glider while the first rider turned upside down and flew overhead so that the skydiver could reach up and form a human link between the two planes .
The spectacular stunt was carried out by Salzburg skydiver Paul Steiner 2,100 metres in the air with both gliders travelling at 100 miles an hour above the mountains in Styria , Austria

Satallax is an automated theorem prover for higher - order logic .
The particular form of higher - order logic supported by Satallax is Church 's simple type theory with extensionality and choice operators .
The SAT solver MiniSat is responsible for much of the search for a proof .
Satallax generates propositional clauses corresponding to rules of a complete tableau calculus and calls MiniSat periodically to test satisfiability of these clauses .
Satallax is implemented in Objective Caml .
You can run Satallax online at the System On TPTP website .

Starting with this version , Satallax can call the first - order theorem prover E during search .
Also , there are many new modes and a new strategy schedule .
Brief Description
Satallax progressively generates higher - order formulas and corresponding propositional clauses .
These formulas and propositional clauses correspond to a complete tableau calculus for higher - order logic with a choice operator .
Satallax uses the SAT solver MiniSat as an engine to test the current set of propositional clauses for unsatisfiability .
If the clauses are unsatisfiable , then the original set of higher - order formulas is unsatisfiable .
If there are no quantifiers at function types , the generation of higher - order formulas and corresponding clauses may terminate .
In such a case , if MiniSat reports the final set of clauses as satisfiable , then the original set of higher - order formulas is satisfiable .
The theorem prover Satallax is spelled Satallax , as opposed to any of the following : Satellax , Satillax , Satalax , Sattalax , Satelax , Sattilax , and so on .

Arson Charge : Man Sets Own Home on Fire Because of Late Dinner
Guy Edward Jones just could n't wait to eat and that landed him jail on an arson charge .
Authorities say that when he came home for a late dinner and his wife did n't have it on the table , the 60 - year - old man got so angry he allegedly set his own house on fire .
According to the Associated Press , the West Virginia man was arrested and charged with arson .
The sheriff 's department said that he was angry that his wife , Beverly Jones , did n't have dinner on the table .
She said her husband of 7 years had returned home from a night of drinking with friends .
As a result , the couple fought and she ran next door to a neighbor 's house where she saw flames coming out of the basement and her husband exiting through the basement door .
In general , arson is the malicious burning or exploding of the dwelling house of another , or the burning of a building within the curtilage ( the immediate surrounding space ) of the dwelling of another .
Area police said the incident was unlike any case of domestic violence they 've ever seen .
Domestic violence can take a number of forms , including :
physical behavior ( slapping , punching , pulling hair or shoving )
forced or coerced sexual acts or behavior ( unwanted fondling or intercourse , or sexual jokes and insults )
threats ( threatening to hit , harm or use a weapon )
psychological abuse ( attacks on self - esteem , attempts to control or limit another person 's behavior , repeated insults or interrogation )
stalking ( following a person , appearing at a person 's home or workplace , making repeated phone calls or leaving written messages ) , or
cyberstalking ( repeated online action or email that causes substantial emotional distress ) .
In the end , Beverly Jones says her husband not only destroyed their home , but also their marriage .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The Android mobile operating system passed the Apple iPhone in terms of U.S. market share during the first quarter , according to a report issued Monday by the NPD Group .
According to the study , the Android OS -- developed by Google Inc. GOOG , +0.01 % -- ended the period with a domestic market share of 28 % .
That 's up from about 20 % in the December quarter , and is due mostly to strong sales of handsets such as the Droid and Droid Eris at Verizon Wireless VZ , +0.42 % , according to the report .
The Motorola Droid .

The iPhone from Apple Inc. AAPL , +1.50 % saw its U.S. share remain relatively flat at 21 % .
The leader in the U.S. remains Research In Motion RIMM , whose BlackBerry family of " smart phone " devices has about 36 % of the market , according to NPD data .
" Verizon is putting considerable effort behind promoting Android to its customers , " said NPD analyst Ross Rubin of the latest report .
A big part of the boost for the Android platform came from the launch of the Droid handset from Motorola MOT in late 2009 .
The device racked up strong sales and helped the platform 's market share surge from below 5 % in the third quarter to end the year around 20 % , according to NPD data .
The data are supported somewhat by a similar report issued from IDC on Friday .
Looking at the smart - phone market by vendor , IDC found that Motorola had about 11.7 % market share in North America in the first quarter , while HTC -- another big vendor of Android handsets -- had 9.2 % .
Combined , those numbers were ahead of the 17.2 % market share attributed to Apple .
See full story on IDC 's smart - phone report .
Rubin said much of the growth for Android is likely attributable to the fact that -- before the launch of the Droid -- Verizon customers had few alternatives to the iPhone at AT&T T , +0.74 % .
" Prior to launch of Droid , there had not been a lot of modern , touch - optimized smart phones available at Verizon , " Rubin said , who added that the majority of smart - phone sales at a carrier typically come from customers who are already signed up to that carrier .
Verizon is expected to put heavy promotion behind the latest Android device -- the Droid Incredible from HTC -- for the next several months .
The data may also indicate pressure on Apple to expand its base of carriers for the iPhone .
The device is still exclusive to AT&T in the U.S. market , despite persistent speculation that it might expand to Verizon later this year .
The company has never commented on any of these rumors .

Seeking Social Justice
Glenn Beck crossed the line when he told people to leave churches that promote " social justice , " said The New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good and Sojourners .
On his March 2 radio show , Beck told listeners :
I beg you , look for the words " social justice " or " economic justice " on your church Web site .
If you find it , run as fast as you can .
Social justice and economic justice , they are code words .
Now , am I advising people to leave their church ?
Yes !
If I 'm going to Jeremiah 's Wright 's church ?
Yes !
Leave your church .
Social justice and economic justice .
They are code words .
If you have a priest that is pushing social justice , go find another parish .
Go alert your bishop and tell them , " Excuse me are you down with this whole social justice thing ? "
I do n't care what the church is .
If it 's my church , I 'm alerting the church authorities : ...

Our good friend ( as if we know him ) William Shatner is known for his halting ... way of ... speaking and his quirky spoken word albums .
Oh , and the whole Star Trek thing .
With two albums in print , Apparently The Shat is trying to put together a set of songs for a third , but this time he 's pulling out all the stops .
According to a twitter post , Bill has recently gone into a recording studio and laid down a track covering Queen 's " Bohemian Rhapsody " .
“ Going to lay down a track : ‘ Bohemian Rhapsody ’ .
Perhaps as the beginning of a new record …
My best , Bill . ” was his tweet on Tuesday around 2:15 pm .
We would plop down a few bars of gold pressed latinum just to sit in on that session .
I can hear it now ..
" Momma ...
I just ... killed ... a man " .
At 79 years young , The Shat seems to be hitting his stride and that particular choice in song is pure genius .
I do n't know , maybe we 're biased .
He also called on his good friend Leonard Nimoy to come out of retirement and join him on the record .
“ Come out of ‘ retirement ’ , @ TheRealNimoy .
I got an exciting record I ’m working on .
You ’d be perfect to add another voice to it . ”
Not that it would happen , but The Shat & Spock covering an almost perfect rock classic would be EPIC !

Hereâ€™s another new track from UK grime rapper Dizzee Rascal , but this time he chooses to move away from his “ pop ” sound , back to something with a bit more substance .
Production for this track comes from Chase & Status , but i’m pretty sure you would be able to recognise that from the sound without me having to tell you .
Enjoy .

If someone breaks into your car and tries to hotwire it , they 're probably familiar with theft prevention measures like this one .
Therefore , it is important to conceal your switch .
There are a few ways you can do this ; if there 's a hiding place that 's easily reached from the driver 's seat , that 's one option .
However , this too is probably easily discovered by any but an amateur thief -- there are only so many spots one can hide the switch and still keep it accessible .
As such , I personally decided to hide the switch in plain sight .
My Celica has a button in the dash which prevents the passenger window from rolling down .
This is an entirely useless function -- but it 's a toggle - style switch which would not look at all out of place .
Other rarely used switches could also be used -- though I 'm not sure of the legal implications , one could use the emergency flasher button .
If you do n't have any switches you do n't use , consider wiring another switch to control the function of something you do use and assigning the original switch the killswitch function .
Since the whole point of installing this switch , for me , is that I often forget to remove the key from the car , betting that I will remember to turn off the toggle switch each time I leave the car seems imprudent .
I therefore decided to install a momentary switch as well -- even if I leave the toggle switch activated , the momentary switch still prevents theft .
If both switches are open , it 's a double line of defense .
Politico's Ben Smith reported yesterday that the James O'Keefe / Andrew Breitbart smear of ACORN , promoted so avidly by Fox News ( and particularly Glenn Beck ) , had finally taken its toll :
The embattled liberal group ACORN is in the process of dissolving its national structure , with state and local - chapters splitting off from the underfunded , controversial national group , an official close to the group confirmed .
" ACORN has dissolved as a national structure of state organizations , " said a senior official close to the group , who declined to be identified by name because of the fierce conservative attacks on the group that began when a conservative filmmaker caught some staffers of its tax advisory arms on tape appearing to offer advice on incorporating a prostitution business .
... " Consistent with what the internal recommendations have been , each of the states are developing plans for reconstitution independence and self - sufficiency , " said the official , citing ACORN's " diminished resources , damage to the brand , unprecedented attacks . "
The new organizations , he said " will be constituted under new banners and new bylaws and new governance , " he said , consistent with the recommendations of an outside panel .
Much of the group 's strength lay in its local chapters in places like New York , which appear to be continuing to operate as normal .
New York 's City Hall
News reported today that the local group there had re-emerged under the name " New York Communities for Change . "
However , as CBS ' Political Hotsheet reported , the reports of ACORN 's demise may be somewhat premature :
... Kevin Whelan , an ACORN spokesman , denied the reports Monday afternoon , telling The American Prospect that " it is not true that ACORN is closed for business all across the country .
It still exists . "
That does not mean there is n't something afoot :
In Brooklyn , a group called NY Communities For Change lists as its address the offices that had belonged to the Brooklyn chapter of ACORN .
In a statement late Monday afternoon , ACORN confirmed to Hotsheet that " today in New York a group of grassroots leaders and organizers who have worked with ACORN for many years announced today that they are establishing a new , state - based organization . "
" ACORN 's national leadership respects the decision of this dedicated group of community leaders who have done so much to help make their neighborhoods , cities , state , and the country a better and fairer place , " said Whelan , the spokesman .
" We know they will continue to do great work and we wish them well . " ...
In California , a group called Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment recently announced " the leadership and staff that were working with ACORN in California made the decision to break off from ACORN and launch a new organization . "
There are also reports that the Massachusetts chapter of the group has become " New England United for Justice . "
Still , while the dissolution of ACORN 's national structure may be occurring slow motion , the outcome is more or less the same : Returning community organizing to its local roots and focusing its strategies there .
While the national structure does not appear to be dissolved as of now , that process may effectively be underway .
Whelan told Hotsheet in a statement that " It 's no secret that ACORN has had to fight hard to survive a series of vicious right wing attacks over the past year and half and that this has made it harder for ACORN to raise funds and organize and serve its members . "
" We understand the desire of local grassroots leaders in some states to move ahead focusing solely on the fight to improve their communities , " he said .
On his show yesterday , Beck did n't exactly gloat over the victory for his team .
Instead -- as he did after Van Jones resigned -- he made clear he was just getting started .
Next in his sights will be those local community organizers .
And the bizarre thing is that the whole outcome is built on a lie .
Nevermind that an independent investigation found that O'Keefe and Co. had grotesquely manipulated their videos .
Nevermind that they perpetrated a huge hoax on the public by pretending that O'Keefe had worn an outrageous " pimp " outfit into the videotaped sessions ( he had n't ) .
The upshot is that Breitbart , Beck and the pro-corporate rightists whose agenda they 've been promoting in attacking ACORN have succeeded in demolishing the most effective national community - organizing apparatus .
And yes , Mr. Breitbart , you succeeded through innuendo and sleaze , by making it your mission to destroy people 's lives .
No irony there , eh ?
The lesson : Douchebaggery works .
And no one has less compunction about using it than right - wing , pro-corporate operatives .
There is one major reason the Right has so viciously attacked community organizers like ACORN :
They have become one of the most effective means of getting out the progressive vote , particularly in enrolling minorities as voters .
It was a major component of the 2008 tide that swept conservatives out of power .
Remember the GOP 's bizarre attacks on community organizing in the 2008 campaign , led by Sarah Palin ?
Well , they certainly did n't stop after the election .
The O'Keefe / Breitbart smear existed for one reason : to defund the Left .
( Breitbart was explicit about this being his mission last night on Red Eye . )
The ACORN attacks have muddied the funding picture for all progressive groups , and were ultimately enabled by the cowardly response of Democrats :
Few people would defend the mistakes , mismanagement , poor staff training , and lack of accountability that has marred Acorn practices in the past .
Indeed , the current leadership of the organization has acknowledged those shortcomings and is trying to do something about them .
But the critics have gone much further than Acorn deserved .
In the assault on Acorn , no lies have been spared , no accusations tempered by reason , and no acknowledgment has been made of the enormous good Acorn has done over the years .
Behind the attacks are a deep hatred of liberals and progressives — especially those in the Obama administration — and a lack of concern and respect for poor and minority constituencies .
It is part of a strategy to divert attention away from the important legislative efforts that many conservatives do n’t want to succeed : a health - care overhaul ; stiffer environmental standards ; tougher regulations for financial institutions ; and efforts to create jobs .
While lies , innuendos , and unproved accusations by conservative critics and politicians might have been expected , it is harder to explain why mainstream observers and progressive politicians have not questioned many of the anti-Acorn criticisms and allegations .
Only six Democrats in the Senate were gutsy enough to oppose the bill that prohibits Acorn from receiving any more federal money .
Their Democrat colleagues , including some of the allegedly most progressive senators , like Tom Harkin of Iowa and Charles Schumer of New York , ran for political cover and voted to support the measure , scared by the onslaught of right - wing broadcasts and newspaper articles .
Ironically , Senator Schumer had appeared two months earlier in Washington at an Acorn fund - raising event where he lavished praise on the work and accomplishments of the organization .
Those senators , as well as all but 75 members of the House , which passed a similar bill , accepted the substance of the allegations against Acorn without bothering to verify them or to ask Acorn and its supporters to present their side of the story .
Community organizers need progressives ' backs , not the backs of their hands .
It 's time to start fighting back , loudly , against these smears and lies .
Here at C&L , we 've tried to track the anti-ACORN douchebaggery , but so much of it has been buried in the nonstop onslaught from right - wing talkers that in many ways we too had a role in the failure to prevent this horrendous outcome .
Most of all , I think we failed to call out Democrats for their spinelessness .
Well , no longer .

The U.K. - based website www.breakingtravelnews.com reports that analysis of data on the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder from the Boeing 737-800 that crashed just beyond Mangalore International Airport ( IATA : IXE ; ICAO : VOML ) in India late last week shows the pilot was told by air traffic control to abort landing .
Discovery by investigators of the throttle in the forward position is consistent with this .
Mangalore International Airport is what is known as a “ tabletop airport , ” for its configuration near the edge of a high , steep hill .
Runway 06/24 at the facility is 8,000 feet in length , which is long enough for a plane the size of the one that crashed , to stop .
But the Boeing 737-800 touched down on runway 06/24 at Mangalore International , 2000 feet beyond the normal touchdown point .
It ran off the other end , and tumbled down a nearby hill .
There are eight confirmed survivors of the crash , and an estimated 158 dead from the crash .
Air India was founded in 1932 , and is the flag carrier of India .
Its hub is at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport ( IATA : BOM ; ICAO : VABB ) in Mumbai .
Air India ’s low - cost subsidiary Air India Express was founded in 2004 .

Taking in New Zealand 's scenery from the thermal spas in Rotorua
Nick Bryant reflects on New Zealand 's mix of controlled fury , subtle charm and social harmony , and asks why the rest of the world can't be more like it .
What can you tell about a country from the people you encounter at its point of entry ?
Alas , in this age of globalised uniformity , the truth is , probably not that much .
Most of the immigration and customs officials that you come across in those sunlight - starved arrivals halls are n't very sunny themselves , as they mechanically stamp your passport or grudgingly wave you through .
If anywhere on the planet there 's a more eloquent expression of controlled fury then I would dearly love to see it
But late the other night , I came across that rarest of bureaucratic beings - a middle - aged customs official with a sense of humour , a welcoming smile , blond dreadlocks which hung lazily over his shoulders , and a gloriously free spirit which he was delighted to share with a planeload of new arrivals from Australia .
He and his colleagues looked particularly kindly on us - a camera crew with almost as many bags as Imelda Marcos has shoes , which had arrived without one key item - the requisite paperwork to get us through customs .
" This need not be a major problem , " they said with their Kiwi twangs , as we were welcomed into New Zealand , a land of geniality in a far - flung corner of the world .
Controlled fury I confess that I have long been an admirer , even before I discovered that you could watch rugby union here morning , noon and night .
Whereas most countries these days have 24 - hour rolling news channels , with thumping music and explosive footage , New Zealand has round - the - clock rolling mauls , with thumping tackles and explosive footballers .
With a channel devoted solely to rugby , it also means that you never have to wait long before getting to view what is surely sports superlative pre-match ritual - the Maori war cry known as the haka .
New Zealand 's fabulous food and wine - and the sharp freshness of the air - make it one of the great lifestyle superpowers of the world
This , of course , is where the national team , the fabled All Blacks , face down the opposition with puffed out chests , sharp slaps of their thighs , lizard - like tongues and fuming eyes that look like they 're about to burst , like ping pong balls , from their sockets .
If anywhere on the planet there 's a more eloquent expression of controlled fury then I would dearly love to see it .
But for now , I 'm quite happy to be fed a steady diet of haka at breakfast , lunch and dinner .
Wherever you flick to on New Zealand television , it 's hard to avoid a rugby star dressed in black - and rarely does a commercial break go by without one of the big - name stars trying to sell you something .
It takes a brave consumer , after all , to say no .
Sadly , the All Blacks have never managed to translate the dramatic range of their hakas to the more humdrum task of flogging white consumer durables , and most of them have the acting abilities of stage - struck waxworks .
Lifestyle superpower
Of course , I would not want you to think that my fondness for New Zealand merely flows from my love of rugby .
No , there 's the fabulous food and wine , some of the most flavoursome coffee that you will find anywhere in the southern hemisphere - if not the world - and the sharp freshness of the air , all of which make it one of the great lifestyle superpowers of the world .
The Lord of the Rings turned Wellington into a world centre for film - making
There 's also a funky arts scene , and a deep - held love of literature - the Kiwis are very bookish .
And such has been the global success of its film industry - with global mega-hits like the Lord of the Rings trilogy - that Wellington is now known as Wellywood .
They 're even planning to erect giant capital letters high on a hill above the airport to spell out that success .
The irony is that the New Zealand film industry , under the tutelage of its most successful director , Sir Peter Jackson , is renowned for virtual reality .
This in a country where the real reality is so hard to beat .
Quaint fastidiousness
For all its attractions , there are times when it does feel like you are time - travelling in New Zealand .
Parts of it do feel like the land that the last four decades forgot .
But its old - fashionedness can also be part of its subtle charm .
Take its televised coverage of Test cricket , where the commentators convene during the tea interval at a picnic table on the boundary .
With quaint fastidiousness , they enjoy a pot of tea .
The stunning surroundings of Davies Park cricket ground near Queenstown
In other ways , though , New Zealand can be edgy and forward - thinking .
It was the first country to grant women the vote , and the first nation to see females occupy every high office of state .
It 's just about to launch the world 's most comprehensive emissions trading scheme to curb greenhouse gases , and some of its most senior civil servants are so with it , they look like they should be running organic supermarkets rather than the country .
Best of all , perhaps , is how non-indigenous New Zealanders live in such harmony with their indigenous compatriots .
Maori is taught in schools , a Maori chieftain adorns the country 's coat of arms , and the indigenous heritage is a shared national heritage .
I hope to return soon to explore the fiords and mountains of the South Island , perhaps even its ski fields , and sample some of the world 's finest Pinot Noir in the vineyards of Otago .
Next year it hosts the Rugby World Cup , but for now I will leave this country with my usual parting thought : " Why ca n't the rest of the world be more like New Zealand ? "

Populist lawmakers are failing to convert public outrage at Wall Street into tighter controls on the Federal Reserve .
Despite attracting blame for the financial meltdown and great recession , the central bank is emerging with its powers mostly intact and free of political interference .
ADVERTISEMENT
Instead of submitting to a chokehold by Congress , the Fed is walking away largely unscathed from fights with lawmakers from the left and right .
As Congress revamps Wall Street regulations , Democrats and Republicans have sharply criticized the Fed and its chairman , Ben Bernanke , for lapses in the run-up to the crisis .
They have lashed out at the bank for committing trillions in taxpayer dollars to bail out Wall Street .
In January , Bernanke received the fewest votes in support of his confirmation of any Fed chairman .
But a bipartisan consensus is emerging to protect the Fed ’s independence and shore up the private market ’s confidence in the central bank .
The Senate approved two amendments this week that are victories for the Fed , and lawmakers are on the way to passing legislation that houses a new consumer protection regulator at the central bank .
“ I think there is a broad recognition of the benefits of having an independent central bank , ” said Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson ICAP .
Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersDemocrats say Biden survived brutal debate — and that 's enough The Hill 's Morning Report - Fight night : Trump , Biden hurl insults in nasty debate Trump , Biden clash over health care as debate begins MORE ( I - Vt. ) last week scaled back a popular amendment requiring new audits of the bank , amid warnings from the White House and Fed that it would compromise the independence of the bank and threaten monetary policy .
On Tuesday , the Senate approved , 96 - 4 , the modified amendment , which would require a one - time audit of the central bank ’s emergency lending during the crisis but not provide broader audit power of monetary policy .
Shortly afterward , senators voted down , 37 - 62 , a much tougher amendment from Sen. David Vitter David Bruce VitterLysol , Charmin keep new consumer brand group lobbyist busy during pandemic Bottom line Bottom line MORE ( R - La. ) that mirrored legislation the House passed in December .
The Fed audit issue was a rallying cry for liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , a longtime critic of the bank and author of the recent book End the Fed , is the main supporter of heightened audits .
Paul criticized Sanders for modifying the amendment .
Rep. Alan Grayson Alan Mark GraysonFlorida's Darren Soto fends off
Dem challenge from Alan Grayson Live results : Arizona and Florida hold primaries The Hill 's Morning Report : Frustration mounts as Republicans blow up tax message MORE ( D - Fla . ) , the other main supporter of the House legislation , applauded the Senate for passing the modified amendment .
Grayson said he would push for the stronger version to be included in the final bill , but said the Sanders effort is a “ significant step . ”
On Wednesday , the Fed won its case for retaining broad supervisory oversight of roughly 5,000 banks .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) had pushed for limiting the Fed ’s supervision to bank holding companies with at least $ 50 billion in assets .
Dodd wanted to leave regulation of smaller banks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) .
The Senate overruled Dodd and approved , 90 - 9 , an amendment sponsored by Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) and Amy Klobuchar Amy Klobuchar3 reasons why Biden is misreading the politics of court packing Social media platforms put muscle into National Voter Registration Day Battle lines drawn on precedent in Supreme Court fight MORE ( D - Minn . ) that would retain the Fed ’s current power over smaller holding companies and roughly 800 state member banks .
Dodd opposed the amendment .
“ This is an amendment ensuring the nation ’s monetary policy is connected to Main Street , ” Klobuchar said on the Senate floor .
ADVERTISEMENT
Bernanke argued a similar case in congressional testimony .
“ We do n’t want to just be looking at Wall Street , ” Bernanke said in April before the Joint Economic Committee .
“ We need to look at the whole economy , and not only for monetary policy purposes , but also for financial stability purposes . ”
The Fed ’s argument was aided by vigorous lobbying from the American Bankers Association ( ABA ) , Independent Community Bankers of America ( ICBA ) and other financial groups .
“ This is of absolutely critical importance to the community banks , ” said Bert Ely , a banking analyst .
“ It ’s more than just the Fed . ”
After more than a year of wrangling , the Senate is also on the path to setting up a new consumer financial protection regulator housed at the central bank .
The Obama administration and full House both supported the creation of a standalone agency .
That idea met stiff resistance in the Senate , even as some Democrats continue to push the proposal .
Instead , Dodd outlined a bill creating a largely independent and autonomous consumer office inside the Fed .
Senators had also discussed placing the office at the Treasury Department or FDIC .
Crandall said the votes are evidence of a “ deep tradition ” of lawmakers recognizing the value of an independent Fed .
After we noticed Ann Taylor 's art department got trigger - happy with the vector tool , the airbrush tool , the liquify tool , and probably 84 other tools in the Photoshop toolbox , we hardly expected any response .
But today , the company is apologizing .

The real question is , though , what 's going to happen now ?
None of the images we linked to on Ann Taylor 's website — and there are many , many more pictures there that bear only an incidental relationship to the human form they were apparently at one point intended to represent — has yet been taken down .
And will Ann Taylor change its approach when photographing and retouching next season 's stuff ?
What about hiring some models in a range of sizes ?
There are great ones out there .
We live in a world where virtually every single picture we consume in women 's magazines , on the websites of fashion brands , and in store advertisements has undergone extensive post - production work .
( That 's in addition to all the heavily retouched movie posters , book covers , and occasional news photos . )
Anyone who 's ever seen an Avedon collage knows this is hardly a new phenomenon — the Adobe airbrush tool is named for the actual air brushes that photographers once used for retouching .
( Ditto the dodge and burn tools , which mimic darkroom techniques photographers from decades past relied on extensively for image correction . )
But digital photography has vastly increased the scope for and ease of image manipulation .
And occasionally , to use Ann Taylor 's word , an " overzealous " effort will result in some embarrassment .
Photoshop is n't in and of itself a problem — but using it to create and disseminate ridiculously unrealistic images of women kind of is .
We 'll take this statement as a pledge from Ann Taylor to do work differently in future .

The FIA is to be asked to consider introducing a one - off split qualifying session for next weekend 's Monaco Grand Prix because of fears about traffic problems at the street event .
With just one week to go ahead of Formula 1's blue riband event , a number of drivers have expressed some concerns that the large lap time differential between the frontrunners and backmarkers on the narrow track could cause dangers in the opening Q1 session .
HRT 's Bruno Senna , whose car will be one of the slowest in the field , has revealed that he plans to speak to FIA race director Charlie Whiting in Friday 's drivers ' briefing in Spain to put forward the idea of splitting the field up .
That would entail removing the frontrunners - who are all but guaranteed getting through Q1 - from the session entirely to minimise the possibility of a big name getting caught out or an accident taking place .
" We have to discuss this with Charlie , how are we going to do it - especially with qualifying , " said Senna in the HRT motorhome in Barcelona on Thursday .
" There are a few things we need to go through with Charlie tomorrow and perhaps in Monaco after first practice .
" The idea of splitting the field is not a bad one to be honest .
If they take six or eight cars from the group of the fastest cars , or slowest cars , and the other guys go in a different qualifying , it will probably be a good idea for both people .
" We do n't want someone much faster than us coming to overtake us , and they do n't want to be every lap getting someone slower .
Let 's see how the time schedules go .
I suppose it would be possible . "
The idea of a one - off to split Q1 is Lotus driver Jarno Trulli 's preferred option for sorting the situation out .
" From my perspective I think it 's very hard - for me that I 'm slow as well as for guys in front who are very quick , " he said when asked by AUTOSPORT about the situation .
" I would think that somehow the FIA should think to split us .
I do n't know how to approach it but I think 24 cars on track is going to be hard .
It 's really going to be hard .
We really have to manage it in a good way .
I do n't know if it 's right or wrong but maybe they should consider it . "
He added : " Split it any way you want , it 's not up to me , but if the teams can agree , let 's agree .
Because otherwise we 'll start complaining over that .
So it 's better to sort it out before than making a big mess after . "
Renault 's Robert Kubica reckons the traffic problems in Monaco would be greater this year than they had been in the past .
" Traffic is a normal problem , " he said .
" It has always been very difficult in Monaco in the past , although I have to say I was always lucky , or always in the position to set my lap time without any troubles in Monaco , which is not easy .
" But this year with three teams who are much slower pace , it will be much more difficult .
I have been racing in Monaco before with splitting qualifying and there are some advantages and some disadvantages , but for sure we will need some solutions .
" On the other hand , it will be very difficult to get everybody happy with one solution , so I think it is a bit of a difficult topic .
I think it will be quite tricky . "
THERE WASN’T much Martha Coakley could do about the massive pipe break that left dozens of Greater Boston towns without clean drinking water over the weekend .
So she kept herself busy instead lecturing vendors not to increase the price of the bottled water that tens of thousands of consumers were suddenly in a frenzy to buy .
“ We have begun hearing anecdotal reports of the possible price gouging of store - bought water , ’’ Coakley announced Sunday .
“ Businesses and individuals cannot and should not take advantage of this public emergency to unfairly charge consumers . . . for water . ’’
Inspectors were being dispatched , “ spot - checks ’ ’ were being conducted , and “ if we discover that businesses are engaging in price gouging , ’’ she warned , “ we will take appropriate legal action . ’’
Governor Deval Patrick got into the act , too .
He ordered the state ’s Division of Standards to “ closely monitor bottled water prices ’’ in the area affected by the water emergency .
“ There is never an excuse for taking advantage of consumers , ’’ he intoned , “ especially not during times like this . ’’
It never fails .
No sooner does some calamity trigger an urgent need for basic resources than self - righteous voices are raised to denounce the amazingly efficient system that stimulates suppliers to speed those resources to the people who need them .
That system is the free market ’s price mechanism — the fluctuation of prices because of changes in supply and demand .
When the demand for bottled water goes through the roof — which is another way of saying that bottled water has become ( relatively ) scarce — the price of water quickly rises in response .
That price spike may be annoying , but it ’s not nearly as annoying as being unable to find water for sale at any price .
Rising prices help keep limited quantities from vanishing today , while increasing the odds of fresh supplies arriving tomorrow .
It is easy to demonize vendors who charge what the market will bear following a catastrophe .
“ After storm come the vultures ’’ USA Today memorably headlined a story about the price hikes that followed Hurricane Charley in Florida in 2004 .
Coakley has n’t called anybody a vulture , at least not yet , but her office has dedicated a telephone hotline and is encouraging the public to drop a dime on “ price gougers . ’’
Before you drop that dime , though , consider who really serves the public interest — the merchant who boosts his price during a crisis , or the merchant who refuses to ?
A thought experiment : A massive pipe ruptures , tap water grows undrinkable , and consumers rush to buy bottled water from the only two vendors who sell it .
Vendor A , not wanting to annoy the governor and attorney general , leaves the price of his water unchanged at 69 cents a bottle .
Vendor B , who is more interested in doing business than truckling to politicians , more than quadruples his price to $ 2.99 .
You do n’t need an economics textbook to know what happens next .
Customers descend on Vendor A in droves , loading up on his 69 - cent water .
Within hours his entire stock has been cleaned out , and subsequent customers are turned away empty - handed .
At Vendor B’s , on the other hand , sales of water are slower and there is a lot of grumbling about the high price .
But even late - arriving customers are able to buy the water they need — and almost no one buys more than he truly needs .
When demand intensifies , prices rise .
And as prices rise , suppliers work harder to meet demand .
The same Globe story that reported yesterday on Coakley ’s “ price - gouging ’ ’ statement reported as well on the lengths to which bottlers and retailers were going to get more water into customers ’ hands .
“ Suppliers worked overtime , pumping up production at regional bottling facilities and coordinating deliveries , ’’ reporter Erin Ailworth noted .
Polar Beverages in Worcester , for example , “ had emptied out its plant in the city last night and trucked in loads of water from its New York facility . ’’
Letting prices rise freely is n’t the only possible response to a sudden shortage .
Government rationing is an option , and so are price controls — assuming you do n’t object to the inevitable corruption , long lines , and black market .
Better by far to let prices rise and fall freely .
That is n’t “ gouging , ’’ but plain good sense — and the best method yet devised for allocating goods and services among free men and women .

The above incident was recorded on March 3rd at the campus of the University of Maryland after Maryland defeated Duke in basketball .
In the video , students can be seen celebrating the win as officers in riot gear and on horseback are nearby .
Some students are holding up their cellphones , taking pictures or video of the officers and the celebration .
The video shows a student identified as John “ Jack ” McKenna skipping down the street and approaching two officers on horseback .
After a brief exchange , two officers on foot slam McKenna against a wall and he falls to the ground .
A third officer joins the first two , and the three strike McKenna with nightsticks while he is on the ground as other students scatter .
The officers deliver roughly a dozen blows as the student crumples to the ground .
McKenna had a cut on his head that required eight staples to close , said Sharon Weidenfeld , a private investigator working for McKenna ’s attorney , Chris Griffiths .
In addition , he had a concussion , a badly swollen arm and bruises elsewhere on his body .
John McKenna , 21 , was subsequently charged with “ felonies on suspicion of assaulting officers on horseback and their mounts . ”
Yes , you read that right : the police charged for assaulting police officers and their horses .
Luckily , charges were dropped after the video surfaced .
Currently , several police officers are under FBI investigation for the beating and subsequent fabricated charges .

Swinging and poly : what 's the darn difference , anyway ?
A lot of people responded to my article on the conflict between swingers and polyamorists ....
I want to address the issue honestly , and try to come to an understanding .
Some folks reacted in exactly the way I was attempting to problematize in the article : " But we 're poly , not swingers !
We 're not the same !
Polyamory is an identity , swinging is an activity !
Not that there 's anything wrong with that ... " and so on .
To these folks I say : yes , I know , I know ....
I pointed out many of the differences between the general cultures in the article , and was merely trying to say that perhaps we could do better at working together , as we are both sexual outlaws ....
The real problem ... is that it 's easy to pigeonhole and stereotype each group .... [ Nevertheless ]
I 'm going to lay out some generalized differences .
Please note that these will very likely be incomplete , inaccurate on an individual level , and possibly insulting .
I 'm simply trying to lay out some of the differences as they tend to exist ....
Swinging is about sex ; poly is about relationships .
By and large , this is true ....
The problem :
In making this distinction , there is often an implied condemnation of sex for sex 's sake .
What some poly people seem to forget is that really , sexuality is the main distinction between having multiple romantic relationships and just having a bunch of close friends .
Swingers tend to shun gay and bisexual men ; poly communities embrace them .
This , unfortunately , also tends to be true ....
The problem ?
Where do I start ?
... From many anecdotal reports , it seems that the usage of barriers for sexual interaction in swinger communities is a lot less de rigeur than it is in poly communities .
While I 'm betting that most couples who swap will throw on a condom for intercourse , things like the " glory hole " parties at Choice Social Club suggest that barriers for oral are n't exactly the norm .
... Polyamorous communities are not immune to this problem either : there are definitely more bisexual women than men in the Boston community , and gay and lesbian folk do n't tend to hang around much at all .
There is a growing movement toward making safer spaces for male - male sexual interaction within the Boston community , however .
People 's personal codes of safer sex conduct differ as well , though there 's a strong tendency toward safety .
Swingers tend to be more mainstream in their everyday lives ; polyamorists tend to be more alternative ....
The problem :
By living too far outside the mainstream , polyamorists can isolate themselves in ways that can be harmful ....
On the other side , swingers can find themselves in positions of hypocrisy ....
As one commenter pointed out on my previous article , it 's difficult for swingers and polyfolk to be allies if swingers are unwilling to live their non-monogamy publicly .
Readers : please feel free to comment and argue away about any of this , and remember : these are blanket statements that encompass not necessarily the truth of what currently goes on in either community , but the larger view of what the differences between the communities are .

Michael Geist sez ,
Months of public debate over the future of Canadian copyright law were quietly decided earlier this week , when sources say the Prime Minister 's Office reached a verdict over the direction of the next copyright bill .
The PMO was forced to make the call after Canadian Heritage Minister James Moore and Industry Minister Tony Clement were unable to reach consensus on the broad framework of a new bill .
With mounting pressure from the U.S. – there have repeated meetings with senior U.S. officials in recent weeks – the PMO sided squarely with Moore 's vision of a U.S. - style copyright law .
The detailed provisions will be negotiated over the coming weeks by the respective departments , but they now have their marching orders of completing a bill that will satisfy the U.S. that comes complete with tough anti-circumvention rules and no flexible fair dealing provision .
For those wondering what can be done , my only answer is to speak out now .
Write a paper letter to your Member of Parliament and send copies to the Prime Minister , Moore , Clement and Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff .
No stamp is required – be sure to include your home address and send it to the House of Commons , Ottawa , ON , K1A 0A6 .
Once that is done , join the Facebook group and the Facebook page and be sure to ask others do the same .
You may have spoken out before , but your voice is needed yet again .
What a goddamned disaster .
The Tories have shown — yet again — their utter contempt for public opinion and Canadian culture and small business when these present an invonvenience to more windfall profits for offshore entertainment giants .
Remember : thousands of us responded to the Tory inquiry on copyright law , and overwhelmingly , we said we did not want a US - style copyright disaster at home .
Remember : hundreds of thousands of us wrote and called our MPs.
Remember : Canadian artists ' coalitions fought against the imposition of a DMCA in Canada .
Remember : America 's copyright war has been an absolute trainwreck , with tens of thousands facing lawsuits , competition and innovation eroded by DRM , free speech challenged by copyright takedowns , and no improvements for creators or creativity .
There 's only one thing stupider than being the first country to enact the DMCA , in spite of its obvious shortcomings : enacting the DMCA after the first country has spent a decade showing how rotten and backwards this approach to copyright is .
PMO Issues The Order : Canadian DMCA Within Six Weeks
As Western powers look for an end game in Afghanistan , that country ’s role as a planned transit route for natural gas from Turkmenistan deserves scrutiny .
The long - planned pipeline , named TAPI after the initials of the four participating countries ( Turkmenistan , Afghanistan , Pakistan and India ) , has been prominently discussed in the Asian press but rarely mentioned in the West .
The TAPI pipeline is geopolitically significant , but has major challenges that have not been widely discussed .
A Gas Pipeline Framework Agreement , signed by representatives of the four participating nations on April 25 , 2008 in Islamabad , envisaged construction to start in 2010 , supplying gas by 2015 .
The announced 1,000 - mile route would follow the ancient trading route from Central to South Asia , extending from the Dauletabad gas field in Turkmenistan along the highway through Herat , Helmand and Kandahar in Afghanistan , to Quetta and Multan in Pakistan , and on to Fazilka in India .
Participating countries have held numerous high - level planning meetings during the past eight years , with Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) sponsorship and multilateral support .
When construction will start is uncertain because security in Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan remains a problem .
Proposed TAPI Gas Pipeline

Afghanistan and the TAPI pipeline
The TAPI project has been documented at major conferences on Afghanistan .
In 2006 , at a donor meeting in New Delhi , countries promised to accelerate planning of the pipeline and to help Afghanistan become an energy bridge .
In 2008 , at a meeting in Paris , Afghanistan ’s National Development Strategy ( 2009 - 2013 ) was presented to donors .
This strategy mentions ongoing planning for the TAPI gas pipeline and Afghanistan 's central role as a land bridge connecting energy - rich Central Asia to energy - deficient South Asia .
In 2009 , the Afghan government referred to the proposed pipeline again in documents relating to the First Afghan Hydrocarbon Bidding Round .
The invitation to foreign companies to bid for exploration in the north of the country stated that “ the TAPI project ... could be one of the export routes . ”
The ADB completed a feasibility study in 2005 that was updated in 2008 .
Details were outlined at the April 2008 meeting of the four participating countries .
The ADB reported that the estimated capital cost was $ 7.6 billion , and said it would consider financing for the project .
Turkmenistan promised independent certification of the gas available for the pipeline .
Plans called for the line to be built and operated by a consortium of national oil companies from the four countries .
A special - purpose financial vehicle would be floated , and international companies would likely join in laying and operating the pipeline .
According to press reports , the Afghan delegation informed the meeting that more than 1,000 industrial units were planned near the pipeline route in Afghanistan and would need gas for their operation .
They said 300 industrial units near the pipeline route had already been established , and the project 's early implementation was essential to meet their requirements .
Several bilateral meetings took place in 2009 .
In April , a Pakistani delegation visiting Ashgabat , Turkmenistan , suggested a new TAPI route that would skirt the war - torn area and add a spur to Gwadar , a Pakistani deep - water port .
Turkmen officials stated they would offer gas from the Yasrak field , instead of the planned Dauletabad field , and they provided a reserves certification for Yasrak .
In September 2009 , the foreign minister of India , S M Krishna , visited President Berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan for discussions that included terms of the TAPI pipeline project .
If the pipeline goes ahead successfully , it could be Afghanistan 's largest development project .
According to the Ambassador of Afghanistan to Canada , transit revenue could amount to US$ 300 million per year .
That would represent about one - third of the domestic revenue ( US $ 887 million in 2008/09 ) budgeted for development efforts .
Transit fees could help pay for teachers and infrastructure .
Even so , Afghanistan 's domestic revenue is dwarfed by aid .
Foreign donors contribute about 90 percent of total funding for the development budget , and they call the shots .
TAPI is expected to boost the economies of all four countries .
In 2008 , Pakistan 's Prime Minister described the pipeline as a vital project for the development and progress of the region .
Further , pipelines are potentially good for peace .
As President Berdimuhamedov of Turkmenistan said : “ The pipeline between Turkmenistan , Afghanistan , Pakistan and India will be a weighty contribution to the positive cooperation on this continent . ”
US policy recognizes the importance of Central Asia ’s energy resources and the economic possibilities they offer in world markets and in the region itself .
Richard Boucher , US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia , said in 2007 : “ One of our goals is to stabilize Afghanistan , ” and to link South and Central Asia “ so that energy can flow to the south . ”
In December 2009 , George Krol , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia , told Congress that one US priority in Central Asia is “ to increase development and diversification of the region ’s energy resources and supply routes . ”
He said , “ Central Asia plays a vital role in our Afghanistan strategy . ”
The TAPI Pipeline : Long in Planning
The US has promoted the TAPI pipeline since the 1990s .
When the Taliban was governing Afghanistan , two consortia vied for the right to take on the project , one led by Unocal ( an American firm ) and the other by Bridas ( an Argentinean firm ) .
The US government supported the Unocal consortium .
US negotiators participated in the Six - plus - Two conferences ( the six countries bordering Afghanistan plus the US and Russia ) from 1997 to 2001 .
The aim was to convince the Taliban to form a government of national unity .
At the time , the Taliban controlled 90 percent of Afghanistan but not the area held by the Afghan Northern Alliance .
Unocal testified to Congress that the pipeline " cannot begin construction until an internationally recognized Afghanistan government is in place .
For the project to advance , it must have international financing , government - to - government agreements and government - to - consortium agreements . "
The Bush Administration urged the Taliban regime to form a government of national unity that would include the northern tribes .
Bridas took a different approach — they negotiated separately with different tribes .
The president of Bridas spent eight months visiting tribes along the pipeline route and reportedly had secured their cooperation for the venture .
Negotiations with the Taliban broke down in July 2001 , just before the attacks of September 11 .
In October , the US ousted the Taliban , with the assistance of the Northern Alliance .
The Pashtun — roughly 40 percent of the population — are a major source of Taliban insurgents , and the pipeline route goes through the Pashtun area in both Afghanistan and Pakistan .
There are about 30 million Pashtuns on both sides of the Afghan - Pakistan border .
It ’s an artificial border — the so - called Durand Line that was imposed by British India in 1893 .
It was drawn intentionally to break up the Pashtun tribes .
In fact , Pashtuns in Kandahar were independent from Kabul for ages , and , until recently , Pashtuns in Pakistan were relatively independent from Islamabad .
After the 2001 invasion , planning of the pipeline continued .
Interim President Karzai met with President Musharraf in Islamabad in February 2002 , where they announced their agreement to cooperate on the proposed pipeline .
In May 2002 , the heads of state of Turkmenistan , Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to cooperate on the project , and a steering committee of oil and gas ministers was established to oversee project development .
In July 2002 , the steering committee requested the ADB to finance project - related studies through the provision of regional technical assistance .
In subsequent years , steering committee meetings were held at frequent intervals .
India participated in the tenth meeting in 2008 , and the four countries signed the Gas Pipeline Framework Agreement .
The next steering committee meeting was scheduled for November 2008 in New Delhi .
The agenda was important .
Price negotiations were to be advanced .
Afghanistan was to report on physical security along the pipeline route , including the clearing of landmines and Taliban activity .
Turkmenistan was to present the gas reserves certification .
However , the meeting ’s timing coincided with the Mumbai bombing , and was thus postponed .
It was rescheduled for April 2009 , though there was no subsequent press announcement to show it took place .
This was hardly surprising , with the US surge underway in Afghanistan and animosity prevailing between India and Pakistan .
Turkmenistan : How Much Gas ?
Understanding the significance of the TAPI pipeline requires shining the spotlight on Turkmenistan , the source of the gas .
Turkmenistan is one of five Central Asian states that became independent in 1991 when the Soviet Union broke up .
Disagreement exists on how much gas the country actually holds .
According to the BP Statistical Review 2009 , Turkmenistan has the world ’s fourth largest reserves of natural gas , 7.94 trillion cubic meters ( TCM ) , exceeded only by Russia , Iran and Qatar .
Turkmenistan ’s 2009 ranking represents a sharp upgrade from 2008 ( 2.43 TCM ) .
The new estimate follows the 2008 audit of the huge South Yolotan - Osman field in western Turkmenistan , conducted by the UK auditing firm Gaffney , Cline & Associates .
The audit estimated the reserves of this field alone to be between 4 and 14 TCM of gas , making it the world 's fourth or fifth largest field .
Other fields remain to be audited , and Turkmen officials predicted in 2008 that the final results would be much higher .
Since then , two publications have cast doubt on the audit results , relying on information obtained from unnamed Russian and Turkmen sources who suggest that Turkmen officials may have provided false data to exaggerate the size of the reserves .
Gaffney , Cline & Associates refutes these allegations .
Meanwhile , President Berdymukhamedov has dismissed various top energy officials .
Whatever the truth of the matter , Turkmenistan ’s gas reserves are huge and there is a titanic struggle underway .
The geopolitical stakes are high .
Turkmenistan and Pipeline Politics
Turkmenistan is far from the world ’s oceans , so it must rely on pipelines to get its gas to market .
Like railway lines in the 19th century , pipeline routes are important because they connect trading partners and influence the regional balance of power .
Until recently , Turkmenistan ’s gas flowed only north through Russia .
With the collapse of the Soviet Union , competing world powers have vied to move the gas in other directions .
The rivalry is sometimes called the New Great Game , an update of the 19th century Great Game in Central Asia between the Russian and British Empires .
Turkmenistan offers a hub for pipelines to export natural gas in all directions .
President Berdimuhamedov is committed to multiple export routes : north to Russia , east to China , south to Pakistan and India via Afghanistan , and possibly west to Europe via the Caspian Sea .
Significantly , in April 2008 at the NATO Summit in Bucharest , Romania , he met with President Bush to discuss gas export policy , and with President Karzai to review the TAPI project .
Proposed Central Asian Gas Pipelines
Source : Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives .
Turkmenistan is concerned about pipeline security .
It co-sponsored a Resolution on Reliable Energy Transit ( 63/210 ) that was passed by the UN General Assembly on December 19 , 2008 .
The Resolution recognized the need for international cooperation to ensure “ the reliable transportation of energy to international markets through pipelines and other transportation systems . ”
In April 2009 , Turkmenistan convened a high - level conference on the topic , where President Berdimuhamedov re-iterated his position on multiple export routes .
Russia remains a key player today .
In 2007 , it signed an agreement with Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan to build a new gas pipeline that would parallel an older one and add to its pipeline network .
Russia is the world ’s largest producer of natural gas and is a major supplier of gas to Europe .
Currently , Russia is building pipelines ( South Stream and North Stream ) that would link its network to various points in Europe .
From Russia ’s viewpoint , they provide diversity , adding to the existing pipeline through Ukraine .
In December 2009 , China tapped into Turkmenistan ’s gas reserves , opening a new pipeline from Turkmenistan that travels 1,833 km through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to reach western China .
There it connects with the Chinese line east to Shanghai .
Pipelines allow Turkmenistan ’s gas to flow all the way to western Europe via Russia and east across China to Shanghai — enormous distances .
The US and European Union support Turkmenistan ’s policy of multiple export routes .
They promote a pipeline project under the Caspian Sea to bring Turkmen gas west to Azerbaijan , where it would connect with the recently - built South Caucasus pipeline to Turkey .
In Turkey , it would link with Nabucco , a planned pipeline to Austria .
Russia , a littoral country on the Caspian Sea , objects to construction of the trans - Caspian link .
Since Azerbaijan does n’t have enough gas to fill the Nabucco pipeline , Turkey is exploring alternatives , including gas from Iran .
The US objects to supplies from Iran .
Iran has its own interest in gas from Turkmenistan .
It imports Turkmen gas into northern Iran to supply local markets that are far from its own gas fields .
In 2009 , a second pipeline was completed to augment existing imports .
That raises the question : Could this pipeline be used to route gas from Turkmenistan to Turkey — and on to Europe through the Nabucco line ?
Iran Offers an Alternative to TAPI
For several years , India and Pakistan have been negotiating with Iran for another pipeline project to bring Iranian gas to their countries .
With an estimated capital cost of $ 7.5 billion , the pipeline would be similar in cost to the TAPI project .
Petroleum ministers of India and Pakistan met in Islamabad in April 2008 ( just after the TAPI meeting ) to resolve a pricing issue and clear the way for signing agreements ; and President Ahmadinejad of Iran visited Islamabad and New Delhi the following week for talks on the pipeline .
Since then , India has oscillated on the project and has stayed largely on the sidelines following a period of tense India - Pakistan relations .
However , in December 2009 , India ’s petroleum minister , Murli Deora , said his country was discussing important issues relating to the pipeline with other participating countries .
Proposed Iran- Pakistan - India Pipeline
In May 2009 , Iran and Pakistan went ahead and signed an initial agreement , without India .
Russia ’s Gazprom expressed willingness to help build the line , most recently in January 2010 .
The same month , US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke met with Pakistan ’s petroleum minister Syed Naveed Qamar , and , according to a Pakistani newspaper , he offered incentives to Pakistan to abandon the Iranian project .
Subsequently , the petroleum minister told journalists that Pakistan and Iran would sign a technical agreement soon ; he had met with the US ambassador and officials of US Overseas Private Investment Corporation who had expressed no objection to the project .
In 2008 , Iran and Pakistan proposed that China join the project .
The foreign minister of China , Yong Jiechi , informed Pakistan ’s foreign minister , Shah Mahmood Qureshi , that China was seriously studying this proposal .
Iran ’s foreign minister , Manouchehr Mottaki , affirmed in February 2010 that China is keen to join the project .
The demand for energy imports is strong and the stakes are high .
Moves by various countries to gain access or control are closely watched —
The Grand Chessboard , as Zbigniew Brzezinski called it .
TAPI and Security Concerns
After the TAPI agreement was signed in April 2008 , the Afghan government reportedly told the steering committee that , within two years , the pipeline route would be cleared of landmines and Taliban influence .
Whatever may have been anticipated then , the planned route remained insecure at the beginning of 2010 .
Companies are unlikely to make investments within a war zone .
The prospect of building the pipeline under armed guard and then defending it for decades is formidable , in terms of both manpower and cost .
How many NATO countries would be willing to make long - term commitments to support pipeline security in Afghanistan ?
In Western countries , official comments on the TAPI pipeline are few .
One exception is Canada .
In June 2008 , the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives released a report entitled “ A Pipeline Through a Troubled Land : Afghanistan , Canada and the New Great Game . ”
The report received widespread attention , including front - page headlines in the Globe and Mail newspaper .
Reporters followed up by asking questions about the role of Canadian forces in Afghanistan .
A senior government official — who spoke on the condition of anonymity — told The Globe and Mail that Canada broadly supports the Afghan effort to build a legitimate and stable economy , including projects like the TAPI pipeline , but “ Canada has not been promoting the pipeline as part of a broader geopolitical agenda , as the Americans have . ”
Canada ’s Minister of National Defence , Peter MacKay , observed that Canadian troops were “ not there specifically to protect a pipeline across Afghanistan , ” but added , “ If the Taliban were attacking certain places in the country or certain projects , then yes we will play a role . ”
In January 2009 , Jaap de Hoop Scheffer , then NATO Secretary General , said , “ Protecting pipelines is first and foremost a national responsibility .
And it should stay like that .
NATO is not in the business of protecting pipelines .
But when there 's a crisis , or if a certain nation asks for assistance , NATO could , I think , be instrumental in protecting pipelines on land . ”
These comments suggest that NATO troops could be called upon to assist Afghanistan in protecting the pipeline .
Since pipelines last 50 years or more , this could auger a very long commitment in Afghanistan .
In 2008 , when the pipeline came to light in Canada , the Afghan Ambassador , Omar Samad , asserted that TAPI is a project of the four participating countries , and is not seen as falling within the framework of the Canadian mission to his country .
His statement ignores the reality that several countries with troops in Afghanistan — including the United States , Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Netherlands and Norway — are also active members of the Asian Development Bank , the sponsor of the TAPI project .
Any Bank financing for the project would require the approval of member countries , and a project as sensitive as this would require the early blessing of the US and Japan , the two major shareholders .
As well , with such a heavy military presence , US / NATO influence on Kabul is obvious .
Discussions of NATO support for TAPI pipeline security raise questions about the links between military and development decisions .
While the focus has been on whether NATO countries are willing to support pipeline security in Afghanistan , an equally valid question is :
Are the Afghan people willing to have foreign troops in their country in perpetuity ?
Development cannot take place at the end of a gun .
As a noted Canadian , Claude Castonguay , observed : “ No society changes because of an outside pressure , and certainly not by force of arms . ”
Conventional thinking around the pipeline may include long - term US bases in Afghanistan , and assistance in training the Afghan National Army to defend the pipeline route .
Is the Afghan National Army a viable protection force inasmuch as 70 percent of its officers are Tajik and most of its troops are northerners ?
It too may be seen by the Pashtun as a “ foreign ” army .
Indefinite occupation is a recipe for ongoing bloodshed and disruption in a country that has long been hostile to occupiers .
Geopolitical Significance
The planned TAPI pipeline offers benefits to all four participating countries and would promote cooperation .
For Turkmenistan , it would provide revenue and diversification of export routes .
For Pakistan and India , it would address energy deficits .
In Afghanistan , it would provide revenue for development and gas for industrial enterprises .
The potential for export to other countries through the Pakistani port of Gwadar is a further advantage .
TAPI is consistent with the US declared policy of linking Central and South Asia and diversifying export routes for Turkmen gas .
For a number of countries , TAPI could provide business opportunities in construction and operation of the pipeline .
Since the TAPI route passes through areas with major insurgencies , security is clearly an issue .
In both Afghanistan and the tribal area of Pakistan , people along the route have long histories of independence from central and foreign powers .
Unless their cooperation is sought and the benefits to them are clear , pipeline security will be an expensive nightmare for years to come .
Peace is essential .
Pipeline construction cannot begin until the killing stops and all stakeholders , including the Pashtun , participate in the project .
Both Afghanistan and Pakistan are complex countries .
Their mix of ethnic groups , long - standing tribal traditions , and history of minimal governance create major challenges .
Such challenges require political , not military solutions .
The strategy of national reconciliation offered at the London conference on Afghanistan in January 2010 is a beginning .
TAPI is geopolitically significant , but encumbered with many difficulties that will challenge all participants in the years ahead .

That 's when Penn State grad student Andrew Barnard used 11 sound meters to record crowd noise at three home games :
What he found : that when opposing teams had the ball , the noise level in the stadium hit 110 decibels — 50 times the volume as when Penn State was on offense .
Not surprising on its own , but the info enabled Barnard to find the spot where the raucous student section could be most effective :
When the stadium was empty , he searched for the best spots for an audible assault by carrying a noisy speaker around to 45 different seats and measuring how loud it sounded on the field ...
For seats on the sidelines , closer was better .
Students sitting in the highest rows contributed very little to the overall sound .
But the situation was reversed behind the end zone .
Higher seats could be heard better than field - level seats because of a trick of the stadium 's architecture , said Barnard .

The move is expected to cut the range of a quarterback 's voice by an additional six inches , meaning more false starts , more penalties , and more opportunities for the Nittany Lions .
So remember , kids : acoustic mapping may not get you more dates , but it can definitely improve your home field advantage .

I think we were all caught a little off guard when Sony announced The Tester , their shot at a reality show that grants the winner a job as a game tester for Sony Entertainment .
As most of you probably know , a career as a QA tester for any company is not as fun as it seems .
Sure you get to play videogames all day , but the days tend to be long and the games you play are usually broken .
Nonetheless ,
Sony received thousands of audition tapes and after choosing 11 contestants , put together eight episodes with one challenge a piece to see who is bad enough to rescue the president become the next Sony game tester .
If you have seen any of the reality shows that often appear on vh1 or MTV starring the cast of The Real World , Bret Michaels or any of those other colorful characters then you will immediately recognize the formula used for The Tester .
In every episode the contestants will participate in a challenge that is based around a skill that is necessary to be a game tester , or just a living , breathing person .
However , the skills are often tested in ways that are completely out of context .
For example , one of the skills is “ taking direction ” and instead of the potential testers receiving a series of directions and completing them from memory or something similar to that , they are tasked with knocking down targets on a field .
Most of them are blindfolded and put into hamster balls while the remaining cast tells them which direction to go by yelling at them through megaphones .
The only part of the show that does not conform to most reality shows seen on television is the run time .
Thankfully , each episode of The Tester is only about 20 minutes long .
Sony must have had a field day when it came to choosing the contestants for this show .
Just about all of the politically correct bases are covered , and almost every contestant is the epitome of a certain geek stereotype .
You have the overweight , funny one , the emo / goth hybrid with a good amount of piercings , the overly dressed know - it - all , and yes , even the guy with the neck beard .
The contestants who did not fit into any widely known stereotype were generally axed within the first couple episodes because they just faded into the background .
Also , instead of using their real names they use what are presumably their Playstation Network names .
Nicknames are a common practice for reality shows like this , but at least real names would have made them seem more like real people and less like cartoon characters .
Additionally the other cast members are Meredith Molinari , who stars as the attractive host who supposedly plays video games , and two judges who appear in every episode .
The first is Brent Gocke , the 1st party release manager for Sony , so that makes sense .
The second is Hal Sparks who has “ Actor / Comedian / Gamer ” under his description on the official Tester site .
He is obviously just there to pull in more viewers since his role on the show is to judge which contestant is the best for a job in a company he is not a part of .
The last panelist slot is reserved for guest panelists who are always other people from Sony , the most notable person being David Jaffe , the director and lead designer of God of War .
Overall the cast does not bother me too much .
However , some of the things they do defy logic and generally do not make too much sense .
There are two big things that drove me nuts .
The first is when a few of the contestants decided to form an alliance .
This would be all well and good except for the fact that the contestants have absolutely no power in deciding who goes home .
The judges decide who leaves and usually disregard any input from the prospective testers .
Speaking of the panelists , some of their decisions threw me for a loop .
The most prominent one being carrying one of the contestants through almost the entire series even though that person was consistently performing poorly during the challenges .
All the while other contestants who messed up once got the boot .
I know it is a reality show and I should not think too much into it , but those kinds of things still drive me crazy .
When I first started watching The Tester I was planning on giving it a “ worth trying ” since it comes at the low , low price of free .
After reflecting on the series and writing about it there is no way I can recommend it .
While some of the cast members that were chosen make sense for the context of the show , others were shamelessly brought in to pull in more viewers and some of the decisions they made were pretty ridiculous .
The challenges are also run of the mill and usually uninspired .
The only redeeming factors are the runtime of around 20 minutes and the fact that the person that won seems to know what he / she is getting him / herself into and actually wants to work towards something larger within Sony instead of just being a tester forever .
I am not going to say who the winner is , but if you have not found out yet and really want to know , just look it up on the Internet and save your hard drive space .
Data plans announced by Telstra and Optus tailored specifically for the Apple iPad will both start at $ 20 a month .
Both carriers announced details of some of their data plans today ahead of the May 28 Australian launch of Apple 's new tablet computer .

Three of the iPad models are equipped with slots for micro SIM cards and can be used - like smartphones - to check emails and surf the web when users are on the road .
But they require users to purchase new data plans as the iPad are not designed to use wirelss broadband USB modems and cannot piggyback off a mobile phone data plan .

Well , a lot has happened since the last news item , this could be considered a little overdue .
Firstly , Matthias Lanzinger ( melpo ) has ported the Arch Linux initscripts to Arch Hurd .
There is just something amazing about seeing Hurd boot up with the familiar - looking boot output ...
Whilst not yet working perfectly due to missing things elsewhere in Arch Hurd , this is still a great achievement .
Secondly , an update to the Hurd allows ext2 partitions bigger than 2 GB to be used .
Obviously , this is of great use to everybody , especially packagers or others who work with a large amount of files .
Along with initscripts came multi-user mode by default .
Multi-user mode allows some niceties , such as a VGA console , similar to virtual consoles in Linux .
Additionally , with the inclusion of shadow in core , users can now have passwords and adding more users is simple .
Coming to the end of the to - write list ; Arch Hurd now has over one hundred packages .
Considering that there are only three developers currently , this is a huge achievement .
But there does n't need to be only three , you can contribute too !
The Arch Hurd Wiki was started recently , and already has a fairly good installation guide with troubleshooting , sure to be useful for those trying to install Arch Hurd for the first time .
And finally , Alexander Preisinger ( giselher ) has managed to run Arch Hurd on his laptop .
This is , as far as we 're aware , the first use of Arch Hurd outside a VM , so this is definitely a huge milestone !
A photo can be seen on his user page in the wiki .

In a statement , the Fed said the currency swaps were intended to make it easier for European companies , institutions and governments to borrow dollars when they need them , “ and to prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers . ”
The statement said the action was taken “ in response to the re-emergence of strains in U.S. dollar short - term funding markets in Europe . ”
The statement added : “ Central banks will continue to work together closely as needed to address pressures in funding markets . ”
The program announced Sunday night is broadly similar to one that the Fed introduced in December 2007 , as the United States entered a recession caused by the collapse of its housing market .
Under that program , the Fed provided dollars to central banks in exchange for an equivalent amount in foreign currency , based on prevailing exchange rates .
The parties agreed to make the same exchange in reverese at a later date — anywhere from one day to three months later — using the same exchange rate as in the initial transaction .
The swap operations do not carry any exchange rate risks or credit risks , the Fed said .
The Fed would not be a party to whatever dollar - denominated loans the European Central Bank may make to European financial institutions .
( An equivalent program was announced in April 2009 to give the Fed the ability to provide liquidity to American institutions in foreign currencies , but the Fed did not end up having to use that program . )
The Fed actually made money from the previous dollar swap program .
The foreign central banks paid the Fed interest equivalent to what they made from lending the dollars .
The Fed , however , did not pay any interest on the foreign currencies it took in exchange , having agreed to hold them instead of lending them out or investing them in the private markets .
The new program is designed the same way .
N ova Scotia born , with family roots in New England , Captain Slocum commanded some of the finest tall ships that ever sailed the seas .
On April 24 , 1895 , at the age of 51 , he departed Boston in his tiny sloop Spray and sailed around the world single - handed , a passage of 46,000 miles , returning to Newport , Rhode Island on June 27 , 1898 .
This historic achievement made him the patron saint of small - boat voyagers , navigators and adventurers all over the world .
T his web site was an attempt to encourage other sailors , maintain a complete record of all single - handed circumnavigators , to popularize the legendary first solo circumnavigator , Captain Joshua Slocum , and offer membership in the Joshua Slocum Society International .
The web was the ideal place to record , and to keep up - to - date , the growing list of the heroic sailors who have accomplished the feat of sailing around the world alone and to document the details of their vessels and voyages .
The Society 's mission was to honor all solo long distance sailors that accomplish these epic voyages .
T he Joshua Slocum Society International ( JSSI ) was unfortunately disbanded in July 2011 .
This site is being maintained for historical reasons .
As its last measure the present parliament will approve its silliest .
It will " ban " a recently discovered party drug called mephedrone .
MPs will declare next week that , while they may have been venal , spendthrift and corrupt , at least their final act will have protected thousands of young innocents from the devil .
They will have well and truly banned something .
They will feel much better , and go off whistling into the night .
They are the only ones who will feel better .
The reason for their contentment is that they have responded to a headline of a tear - stained family pleading for a drug to be banned after the sad death of a daughter after taking it .
If nowadays the public wants something banned – other than alcohol and cigarettes , which MPs enjoy – then it will be .
Perhaps the outcome will be no different , indeed a sign is that MPs will declare they are merely " sending a signal " .
But something will have been done about a headline , the only stimulus to action known to the Home Office .
The shenanigans now enveloping drug classification and scheduling under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act have become absurd .
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs , set up under the act to advise ministers on harm classification , has valiantly tried to honour its mission .
But since its advice is purely advisory and can be overruled , its work is polluted .
Its members have acquired the aura , in some cases unfairly , of Soviet scientists ordered to doctor their disciplines to toe the party line .
That is why the council 's David Nutt was sacked last year as its chairman , after questioning aspects of government drugs policy .
He accepted that ministers were entitled to do whatever they liked , but they could hardly object if he expressed his own opinion , in this case in an academic lecture .
Six members of Nutt 's committee resigned and a seventh , Polly Taylor , went this week .
She was ordered to sign an Orwellian statement that could only have been penned in home secretary Alan Johnson 's bunker , that she " should not act to undermine mutual trust " between herself and Johnson .
Paranoia has driven British government to this pass .
The irony is that the rump council was about to recommend just what the home secretary wanted , that mephedrone be made illegal within the terms of the 1971 act and placed in class B with other amphetamines .
It would attract a prison sentence for possession and a maximum of 14 years for dealing .
There are now two drugs regimes operating in Britain , each divorced from the other .
One is " policy " , as presented before parliament and in the pages of the press , fought out among government advisers , spin doctors and MPs , rising and falling with public hysteria .
This policy believes that it has now eradicated a menace from the face of Britain , saving tens of thousands of young people from death and degradation at the hands of their worst natures and an army of pushers and dealers .
The other regime is the real one – that of drug users , their desperate parents and friends , together with teachers , social workers , police , club owners , dealers and their suppliers , all in chaotic and lawless relationships with each other .
To them the government 's decision will have one consequence .
It will reportedly take mephedrone from roughly £ 2 a go to £ 40 .
The fallacy , indeed fantasy , of drug legislation is that prohibiting supply prohibits demand .
Not only is the foolishness of this thesis staring MPs in the face , from four decades of statutory failure , it applies to the hundreds of new " offences " parliament declares every year that are virtually unenforceable , usually in response to some headline .
Yet each measure has an effect .
It drops the marker dye of criminality into the economic blood stream .
It distorts the pattern of demand and supply and , in its ineffectiveness , subverts respect for authority .
Nobody I know who is conversant with the drugs scene , even those in favour of a " clampdown " , regards the present law as anything other than an out - of - date nuisance .
Britain has no workable drug laws , merely legislation that randomly fills jails with those unlucky enough to get caught , and ruins thousands of families more completely than the impact of the drugs themselves .
If the evidence of other amphetamines is any guide , the classification of mephedrone will impose a high - risk premium on the supplier , and thus a cost on the user .
Where the drug produces an addiction that is left untreated , users will turn to crime to pay the premium , vastly increasing the profit to the supplier , and thus increasing supply .
There is no mystery about this .
Thanks to the 1971 act Britain has wide experience of the impact of criminalisation on the drugs economy .
As Nutt himself said in response to Johnson 's ban : the criminals will be " rubbing their hands " .
That drugs , legal and illegal , are dangerous should not be an issue .
Enough is known about mind - affecting substances for sensible people not to use them , and certainly not too much of them .
That some drugs , such as marijuana , can be used safely by some people , in the same way as alcohol , cannot detract from the risk attached to them .
But that applies to many things people use , especially young people .
Over 7,000 each year die of alcohol " overdosing " and tens of thousands from nicotine poisoning .
Amphetamines kill something like 100 a year , but barely a dozen deaths have been attributed to mephedrone – far less than paracetamol .
There is anecdotal evidence that users of more dangerous drugs , such as heroin and cocaine , switched to mephedrone not because it was legal but because it was cheap .
Some researchers were studying its burgeoning use in the hope of seeing whether such " legal high " chemicals might be quality controlled and supplied under licence with health warnings , reducing dependence on more serious drugs .
It was thus possible that mephedrone might have offered a guide to a route out of the hell that feeble home secretaries have inflicted on millions of people .
No one can claim any amphetamine is safe but , if it is legal , it is easier to control .
Alan Johnson has closed off that possibility .
In driving the supply of a popular drug underground , he has reinforced the failed policy of prohibition , a policy that made interwar Chicago an economy ruled by crime .
Like cocaine and heroin , mephedrone will now suffer adulteration .
While fewer users may be able to afford it , those who like it will turn to crime to pay for it , and to the health service when they need to recover from overdose or adulteration .
Two years ago the UK Drug Policy Commission concluded : " There is little evidence … that drug policy influences either the number of drug users or the share of users who are dependent . "
A year ago Transform , a drug policy thinktank , used the government 's own figures to calculate that drugs prohibition is costing Britain £ 14bn in health , crime , imprisonment and family breakdown , a cost that legalisation and control could save .
It is a cost that Johnson has just increased .
I bet this is one cost no politician will propose saving at next month 's election .
Venezuelans are starting to fall out of love with their president .
Will they be allowed to vote him out of power ?
WITH his bellicose bombast , theatrical gestures and dodgy jokes , Hugo Chávez , Venezuela 's president for the past 11 years , has turned himself into one of the world 's most recognisable and controversial rulers .
His fans salute him as a saviour for the downtrodden of the planet , a man who is leading a grass roots revolution against American imperialism and its local sepoys .
But to many others , including this newspaper , he has come to embody a new , post - cold - war model of authoritarian rule which combines a democratic mandate , populist socialism and anti-Americanism , as well as resource nationalism and carefully calibrated repression .
This model has proved surprisingly successful across the world .
Versions are to be found in countries as disparate and distinct as Iran , Russia , Zimbabwe and Sudan .
In one way or another , these regimes claim to have created a viable alternative to liberal democracy .
In Mr Chávez 's case , that claim has been backed up above all by oil .
On the one hand , he has deployed oil revenues abroad to gain allies , and to sustain the Castro brothers in power in Cuba .
On the other , having kicked out Western multinationals , he has signed investment deals with state - owned oil companies .
Last month China agreed to lend Venezuela $ 20 billion , mainly for oil development .
Mr Chávez has armed his revolution with Russian jets , tanks and rifles ( albeit bought on tick ) .
Meanwhile , a Spanish judge accuses his government of sheltering members of ETA , the Basque terrorist group .
Intercepted e-mails from leaders of Colombia 's FARC guerrillas suggest that they have received help , and possibly arms , through Venezuela .
Of course Venezuela 's government denies such claims .
So just how much of a menace is Mr Chávez , and what , if anything , can be done about him ?
Venezuela 's dark age
Certainly his threats against Colombia — which include a total trade embargo if Juan Manuel Santos , a former defence minister , wins this month 's presidential election — and the evidence of his veiled support for the FARC are troubling .
They are a constant , if so far manageable , source of regional tension .
And his efforts to build a block based on self - proclaimed “ revolutions ” , anti-Americanism and managed trade in the heart of democratic Latin America have served to undermine the very cause of regional integration that he claims to champion .
But rhetoric aside , his influence in the region peaked a couple of years ago .
He lost one ally , albeit in regrettable circumstances , when Honduras 's president , Manuel Zelaya , was overthrown last year .
Several others are on the defensive .
Much more important is the damage Mr Chávez is doing to his own country .
His “ 21st - century socialism ” is a precarious construction .
The brief fall in the oil price of 2008 - 09 was enough to sink Venezuela 's economy into stagflation — even as the rest of Latin America is enjoying vigorous economic recovery .
Venezuelans are suffering declining real wages , persistent shortages of staple goods ( meat is the latest to become scarce ) and daily power cuts .
The blackouts are in part the result of drought .
But they are also the most dramatic sign that the bill for a decade of mismanagement of the economy and of public services is now falling due ( see article ) .
There are plenty of other ugly portents .
In one of the world 's biggest oil exporters hard currency is running short : to buy a dollar in the tolerated parallel market now requires almost twice as much local currency as the official exchange rate ( and three times more than the privileged rate for “ essential imports ” ) .
Investors rate the country 's debt as the riskiest of anywhere .
Crime and corruption are flourishing .
The coming choice between Chávez and democracy
Awkwardly for Mr Chávez , all this is happening when he faces a legislative election in September , the prelude to a vital presidential ballot in December 2012 .
That points to the contradiction at the heart of his project .
He sees his revolution as permanent and irreversible .
But he derives his legitimacy from the ballot box .
He has been elected three times , and won four referendums .
He has hollowed out Venezuela 's democracy , subjugating the courts , bullying the media and intimidating opponents .
But he has been unable , or unwilling , to disregard or repress opposition to the same degree as Iran 's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or even Russia 's Vladimir Putin , let alone the Castro brothers in Cuba .
Public opinion still matters in Venezuela .
Remarkably , opinion polls show that two Venezuelans out of five still support Mr Chávez ( higher than the proportion of the British electors who voted for the Conservative Party , the senior partner in the country 's new coalition government ) .
That is tribute to his skill in convincing the poor that he is their champion , to the opposition 's mistakes , to years of record oil prices and to the ruthlessness with which he ransacks the economy for the short - term benefit of his supporters .
It means he is unlikely to fade away .
But provided that the opposition comes up with a plausible alternative , it is not fanciful to imagine that in 2012 Venezuela will face a stark choice : Mr Chávez or democracy .
All the evidence is that Venezuelans , including many chavistas , are democrats and want to remain so .
But Mr Chávez is pushing on regardless with his revolution , nationalising ever more businesses , expropriating private properties and selectively locking up or harassing his opponents .
So the question increasingly being asked in Caracas is whether Mr Chávez 's rule will end peacefully or not .
The answer will lie largely with Venezuelans themselves .
But outsiders , especially in Latin America , can play their part , by urging that the opposition receive guarantees that it can take part both this year and in 2012 on equal terms .
That goes particularly for democratic Brazil , whose president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , has embraced Mr Chávez far more than is desirable for his own country 's long - term interest .
Mr da Silva has helped entrench prosperity , freedom and democracy in Brazil .
He should hope the same happens for Venezuela .
Mr Chávez , unfortunately , is not the man to bring that about .
' Flowers for Kim Il Sung ' Vienna Exhibition Provides Rare Glimpse of North Korean Art

Republican blogger Will Folks , in an e-mail to The Daily Caller , said records of e-mails , text messages and phone records will prove he had an extramarital affair with South Carolina gubernatorial candidate Nikki Haley .
“ In the end , I think the record of communication here will end up speaking for itself , ” Folks told The Daily Caller .
On Monday , Folks — a former spokesman for Gov. Mark Sanford — claimed he and Haley were romantically involved .
Haley , leading a pack of Republicans vying for a win in the June 8 primary , categorically denied that an affair took place , saying she ’s “ been 100 percent faithful ” to her husband of 13 years .
She blamed her primary opponents for stirring up the rumors .
Sarah Palin , who endorsed Haley several weeks ago , came to her defense , calling Folks ’s bluff .
“ Nikki categorically denies the accusation that was spewed out there by a political blogger who has the gall to throw the stone , but then quickly duck and hide and proclaim he would not comment further on the issue .
Quite convenient . ”
But Folks says he can prove the claim with a record of correspondence that started in November 2005 with an email sent from Haley to Folks complimenting him on an article he had written on her .
“ That four - and - a - half year record of correspondence ended on Saturday , May 22 , 2010 – three days ago – with a text message sent from Folks ’s cell phone to Haley ’s cell phone at 1:04 p.m. alerting her to the fact that he had been placed in a position where he felt that he had no choice but to address the rumors regarding their relationship on his website , ” the blog said .
“ Those are the bookends … but what happened in the interim ? ”
The blog speculates that the reason Haley ’s team have not pursed any legal remedies against Folks is because subpoenas would result in the publication of the damning records .
Folks declined to answer questions posed by The Daily Caller , and instructed this reporter to contact a spokeswoman working on his behalf for additional information .
Palin , who spoke with Haley Monday afternoon , reiterated Haley ’s argument in her Monday Facebook posting that the accusation is a last minute attempt to thwart the campaign in the final weeks of the race : “ As I said to Nikki this morning , ‘ Hang in there .
I ’ve been there .
Any lies told about you will strengthen your resolve to clean up political and media corruption .
You and your supporters will grow stronger through things like this . ’”

After collecting cobwebs in a studio vault for the better part of a decade , an unreleased documentary on the 2003 hacking scene leaked onto the Pirate Bay Thursday .
Narrated by actor Kevin Spacey , the 90 - minute Hackers Wanted follows the exploits of Adrian Lamo , who pleaded guilty in 2004 to cracking the internal network of The New York Times .
The film was produced by Spacey 's Trigger Street production company , and includes interviews with Kevin Rose and Steve Wozniak .
Lamo says the film had been bogged down by conflicts among the producers and crew .
" It 's ironic that a film about overcoming barriers , about new technologies , about thinking differently , had to come to the public eye by being hacked out of the hands of people who , after making a film about the free flow of information , tried to lock away that information forever , " says Lamo .
" The truth tends to itself . "
Lamo adds that he had nothing to do with the leak .
Lamo made his mark early in the decade with a string of brazen hacks against large companies , characterized by a flair and sense of humor that appear quaint in today 's era of for - profit hacking and multi-million credit card theft .
In 2001 , when he was 20 , the hacker snuck into an unprotected content - management tool at Yahoo's news site to tinker with a Reuters story , adding a made - up quote by then - Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Lamo went on to stage other hacks , alerting the press to each one and often working with the hacked company to close the security holes he exploited .
His targets included Microsoft , Excite@Home , Worldcom and The New York Times , which pressed charges .
Unemployed and prone to wander the country by Greyhound , Lamo gained the appellation " the Homeless Hacker . "
When he surrendered to face charges for the Times hack , the Trigger Street camera crew was in tow .
He was ultimately sentenced to six months home confinement at his parents ' house and two years of probation .

The FCC has set a 4 M bps download target for universal US broadband — but how to get those ( modest ) speeds to underserved areas ?
According to a new report ( PDF ) from the Commission , we can forget about fiber — it costs too much .
Underserved areas would be served best by DSL , some 4G wireless coverage , and satellite service for those who truly live in the boondocks .
But the price for all this non-cutting - edge tech is still steep : $ 23.5 billion .
We 're going to fund ...
DSL ?
Network builders today all say that fiber is the future of wireline — Australia has just committed to run fiber to 93 percent of its homes , assuming that it will provide a next - gen Internet platform for decades .
As the federal government thinks about doling out universal service cash , though , fiber is at the bottom of the list , and the issue is immediate cost .
" While end - users are likely to demand more speed over time , the evolution of that demand is uncertain , " says the FCC 's report .
" Given current trends , building a future - proof network immediately is likely more expensive than paying for future upgrades . "
This is in large part a measure of density .
As Australian consultants found out when they examined the feasibility of the government plan , reaching the last 7 percent of the population was dramatically more expensive when using fiber .
Australia opted for fixed wireless and next - gen satellite , but that 's in part because it mandated reasonable 12 M bps connections for everyone in the country .
DSL generally has no problem hitting 4 M bps , even over long loop lengths , and all US homes already have a phone line , so it became the tech of choice for the FCC .
4G wireless tech is a better choice in the eastern two - thirds of the country , where population densities are much higher — but those regions are largely served by 4 M bps + broadband already .
( The map below shows which parts of the country are best served by DSL and which by 4G wireless . )
DSL vs. 4G ( source : FCC )
According to the FCC 's model , 7 million housing units in the US can't hit the 4 M bps target .
They also wo n't be getting faster speeds soon , since it costs more money to roll out service to those areas than will be recouped in revenue .
This difference , called the " investment gap , " can be plugged with $ 23.5 billion to cover buildouts and ongoing expenses .
The broadband investment gap ( source : FCC )
One might expect that these underserved users would be served not by the major US telcos but by small regional companies operating far out in the hinterlands .
According to the FCC , however , " 52 percent of unserved housing units are in census blocks where one of the three Regional Bell Operating Companies , or RBOCs , ( AT&T , Qwest or Verizon ) is the dominant local exchange carrier . "
Problems
But after throwing billions of dollars at the problem , will we have solved it ?
The FCC is n't sure — in fact , it can't be sure .
Carriers have always balked at releasing helpful data on their deployment footprint and the speeds available to customers , so the government has finally launched its own broadband mapping effort .
Until that 's complete , though , the FCC simply does n't know how accurate its numbers are .
" Unfortunately , there is a lack of data at the required level of granularity , both in terms of availability — which people have access to what services — and of infrastructure — which people are passed by what types of network hardware , " says the report , a finding echoed numerous times in the report 's pages .
The other problem is that 4 M bps may not really " solve " the problem of slow broadband by the time it 's rolled out , and the FCC knows it .
" The growth rate in the speed of broadband in recent years of approximately 20 percent suggests that broadband networks might be called upon to deliver speeds higher than 4 Mbps ( downstream ) and 1 Mbps ( upstream ) across the next decade or more .
Simply put : if required speeds continue to double roughly every three years , demand will outstrip the capabilities of 4G and 12,000 - foot - loop DSL . "
Still , going directly to fiber would cost over $ 60 billion , and the FCC argues that an incremental approach — getting decent DSL , then extending fiber to the node , then all the way to homes — is a better long - run plan .
TIGER Woods ' wife has upped the ante in their divorce battle , with reports claiming she is demanding as much as $ US750 million .
In addition to the money , Elin Nordegren has abandoned her bid for joint custody and now wants to be the sole legal guardian of their two young children , US reports say ...
Swede Nordegren , who has hired a London law firm to fight it out with Woods ' Florida attorneys , wanted $ US750 million ( $ A900 m ) from the split , the Chicago Sun -Times reported .
It would make the split the most expensive celebrity divorce , eclipsing the $ 600 million settlement expected in actor Mel Gibson 's divorce , which is still being finalised .
Woods ' fortune was valued as high as $ 1.2 billion in 2008 .

Here at The Politics Blog , we 've spent pretty much every one of our first thirty days covering this alleged activists - take - control revolution " sweeping " America .
( At least on Twitter . )
But after the bloodletting from Arizona and other state governments , after the hedged bets of potential presidential candidates , and certainly after what we 've seen from Rand Paul and this week 's primary elections , we thought it best to let the facts — beyond those voting numbers from Kentucky — stand for themselves .
This deep into Campaign 2010 , is there really all that much for the Tea Party to " take back " from America ?
This long after the bailouts , has the new administration really compiled some sort of abnormally large war chest ?

How there 's a bit of Neanderthal in all of us : DNA link to cavemen revealed
Neanderthal man is alive and well - and living happily in Britain , scientists say .
A study has found that our ancestors could n't resist the charms of the Neanderthals tens of thousands of years ago .
As a result , Neanderthal genes have been passed down to us today .
In fact up to four per cent of the DNA of people living in some parts of the world comes from the short , stocky cavemen .
Family : New research shows modern Asians and Europeans have one to four per cent of Neanderthal DNA
The discovery emerged from the first attempt to map the complete genetic code , or genome , of Neanderthals - an offshoot of the human family tree that died out 30,000 years ago .
It found that we have much more in common than previously thought .
It also raises questions about what it means to be a human being .
' It 's so exciting because the Neanderthals are our closest evolutionary relatives , ' said Dr Svante Paabo , from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany , who led the international project .
' If we want to define genetically what makes all human beings that live today unique - not only relative to our closest living relatives the chimpanzees but to our closest extinct relatives the Neanderthals - we can now begin to do so . '
Three Neanderthal bones recovered from Vindija cave , Croatia , ( left ) which scientists used to map the Neanderthal genetic code .
Dr Svante Paabo , pictured right with a reconstructed Neanderthal skull , spearheaded the research
The findings are the result of a four - year study in which researchers analysed 1.1 billion fragments of DNA taken from 40,000 - year - old Neanderthal bones discovered in Russia , Spain , Germany and Croatia .
The team - who publish their findings in the journal Science - were able to decode around 60 per cent of the entire genome of the extinct species .
They compared the results with the complete set of DNA from five people in southern and west Africa , China , Papua New Guinea and France .
The results showed that up to 4 per cent of the DNA of non-African people alive today is Neanderthal .
Experts believe that Neanderthals and modern humans shared a common ancestor in Africa .
Around 400,000 years ago early Neanderthals left Africa and headed for Europe and Asia .
However , our ancestors stayed behind , and evolved into modern humans .
Then , 100,000 years ago , they too left Africa in a wave of migrations .
The two species lived alongside each other in Europe and Asia until the Neanderthals vanished around 30,000 years ago , possibly driven to extinction by the smarter and more competitive modern humans .
Past studies have cast doubt on the chances of interbreeding between the two groups .
But the new research shows modern Asians and Europeans have between one and four per cent of Neanderthal DNA .
Professor Paabo said : ' Since we see this pattern in all people outside Africa , not just the region where Neanderthals existed , we speculate that this happened in some population of modern humans that then became the ancestors of all present - day non-Africans .
' The most plausible region is in the Middle East , where the first modern humans appeared before 100,000 years ago and where there were Neanderthals until at least 60,000 years ago .
' Modern humans that came out of Africa to colonise the rest of the world had to pass through that region . '
No one knows how common interbreeding was .
Neanderthal genes could have been passed on to our ancestors if a group of 1,000 modern people bred with just 20 to 40 Neanderthal women .
Researchers are unsure whether the Neanderthal genes are important or what role they perform .
British Neanderthal expert Professor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum hailed the research as a ' phenomenal technical achievement ' .
He said : ' It means I have to accept that I have a small amount of Neanderthal DNA in me . '
Evidence of interbreeding now exists : A skeleton of a Neanderthal compared with a skeleton of a modern human ( Homo sapiens )
Today is an important anniversary for me .
Exactly two years ago , I published an article in the Guardian about the British Chiropractic Association and its bizarre belief that spinal manipulation could help children with colic , ear infections and asthma .
It was National Chiropractic Awareness week , so I thought I would also spread a little awareness .
I explained that in my opinion it was reckless of this professional body to " happily " ( ie blithely ) promote such " bogus " ( ie ineffective ) treatments .
The BCA took exception to the criticism and sued me personally for libel .
Defending my article has taken up most of my time since the spring of 2008 , but the good news is that the BCA no longer promotes these treatments on its website , many of its members no longer advertise spinal manipulation for these childhood conditions , and last week the BCA dropped its case against me .
Moreover , the BCA will now have to cover its own and my legal costs and the original article is available once again on the Guardian website , so parents can at last look at my arguments and decide whether or not they want to waste their money taking their children to see a chiropractor .
All of this seems like a good reason to celebrate , but it has been hard to raise a glass of cola ( I am teetotal ) when our libel laws continue to be the most anti-free speech in the democratic world , and while they can be used to silence honest views and serious criticism .
Journalists , academics and others could still just as easily be dragged through the libel courts for years in order to defend an article that turned out to be accurate and fair all along .
Indeed , right now the consultant cardiologist Dr Peter Wilmshurst is being sued for libel and risks bankruptcy simply for raising concerns about the data surrounding a new heart device .
If anything deserved to be celebrated last week , it was not my victory , but rather the fact that every single major party published its manifesto , and each one included a commitment to libel reform .
This has been the result of a campaign that has grown over the last year , which was initiated by the charities Sense About Science , Index on Censorship and English PEN .
The campaign was propelled by massive grassroots support from bloggers and scientists , and then it was endorsed by everyone from the astronomer royal to the poet laureate .
The Lib Dems , particularly Evan Harris , have been strong supporters of libel reform , and their manifesto promises that they will " Protect free speech , investigative journalism and academic peer reviewed publishing through reform of the English and Welsh libel laws – including by requiring corporations to show damage and prove malice or recklessness , and by providing a robust responsible journalism defence " .
The Labour manifesto is a little more coy : " To encourage freedom of speech and access to information , we will bring forward new legislation on libel to protect the right of defendants to speak freely . "
However , having set up a working group on libel reform and having backed its findings , it seems that the justice secretary , Jack Straw , is genuinely fired up and wants to act rapidly if Labour is returned to power .
The Conservatives make a similarly brief manifesto promise , but it is a big step forward after months of silence .
More significantly , the shadow justice secretary , Dominic Grieve , has publicly promised a libel reform bill in 2010 if the Tories win the election .
It sounds promising , but there are two major reasons why those who care about scientific debate and free speech more generally need to maintain the pressure on politicians .
First , there are major vested interests , such as large corporations , foreign billionaires and libel lawyers , who will attempt to scupper reform .
Second , any reform needs to be radical , not merely tinkering .
There are several issues that need to be addressed , such as the current lack of a public interest defence , the unfair burden of proof on defendants , libel tourism and so on .
And each problem needs to be tackled properly .
For example , one concern is that the cost of a libel trial is so horrendously expensive that journalists , bloggers , scientists , local newspapers and even national newspapers cannot afford to defend themselves .
Politicians have muttered about cutting the costs in half , which might seem like a bold move – but libel trials typically cost in excess of £ 1 m , so reducing costs to £ 500,000 still makes it impossible for the majority of writers to defend their ideas .
A recent Oxford report pointed out that English libel costs are 140 times more expensive than those in Europe , so there is no reason that our libel costs cannot be reduced by a factor of 10 at least .
Before I forget , it is worth mentioning that this year 's Chiropractic Awareness
Week has only just ended .
For some reason it seems to have been a more low - key affair this year , but I am keen to do my bit .
I have taken the chapter about chiropractic from Trick or Treatment ? , a book I co-authored with Professor Edzard Ernst , and made it available online for free .
Three cheers for even more chiropractic awareness in the years ahead .

I have never seen an orange salad on a menu or been served one at someone ’s house .
And now that I have tasted one , I ’m outraged .
Moroccan orange salad is one of the best salads in the world — sweet citrus juices countered with pungent onion and dueling kicks of spices and acidity .
Some cooks add olives and paprika , as Craig Claiborne did in The Times in 1980 .
He kept his accessible with a little garlic , cayenne , olive oil , vinegar and parsley .
It grabs you , shakes you , then lets you enjoy the sweet fruit .
In Paula Wolfert ’s “ World of Food , ” she seasons the orange slices with the spice mixture ras el hanout , orange - flower water , lime and lemon zest , dates and mint .
Wolfert devotes an entire section to orange salads in her book “ Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco , ” one with radishes and cinnamon , another with grated carrots and orange - flower water and one very much like Claiborne ’s with olives and paprika .
She even wrote , “ Olives and oranges are one of those miracle combinations , like lamb and garlic , before which I sometimes feel I should bow in gratitude . ”
I sent Claiborne ’s recipe to Andrew Carmellini , the chef and an owner of Locanda Verde in Manhattan .
Claiborne ’s salad immediately reminded him of the citrus salads served along the Amalfi coast and on Sicily , where orange - and - lemon salad is commonplace .
Cooks there also use oranges , wild oregano and green olives to make sauce Agrigento , an accompaniment to black bass or scallops .

Obama 's plan is to destroy Israel , and to do it by pushing Israel to the edge of the cliff and then over the cliff , says the writer .
If you agree with this persuasive analysis , you can - or must - try to do something about it .

If there 's one thing that the Carter Administration can be given credit for , it 's creating the new wave of Islamist terrorism , both Sunni , operating out of Afghanistan , and Shiite , operating out of Iran .
The Carter Administration cracked down on Israel and put its " faith " in Muslim terrorists , who then went on to wage war on America , even while Carter was in office .
28 years after Carter was removed from office , we 're in reruns again with the Obama Administration , which is not only following the Carter line , but whose plans greatly exceed it .
28 years ago , Wahhabi Sunni and Shiite terrorists were generally an afterthought when compared to the standard
Iran is to be our new best friend under this arrangement , Israel is to be our new best enemy .
USSR backed Marxist terrorist groups , such as the PLO .
Today , thanks in part to the Carter Administration , they control several countries and have designs on several more .
From Pakistan to Afghanistan , from Gaza to Lebanon , from the Middle East to Southeast Asia , the threat is very real and bigger than ever particularly as the race by both Sunni and Shiite groups to build and deploy nuclear weapons continues .
Like Carter before him , Obama has chosen to cut backdoor deals with the Mullahs in Iran , offering them power over Iraq and Afghanistan , in exchange for quieting things down enough to let him hang up a Mission Accomplished banner and pull the troops out .
" Peace with honor " , preferably before the next election .
The rape law for Shiites in Afghanistan , the push for a US funded Hamas / Fatah Unity government in the territories and the rising expansion of the Taliban are all fruits of this arrangement .
If Iran is to be our new best friend under this arrangement , Israel is to be our new best enemy .
Obama stacked the deck by deploying Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State in a position that gave her an important title , but absolutely no power to go with it , while stacking the National Security Council and even the Pentagon with oil appointees in the pockets of the Saudis or his own left wing radical friends .
Israel electing a conservative government really put the ball into play , freeing up even more resources for attacking Israel .
The strategy runs something like this .
The Obama Administration has broken down the Israel problem into two subsections , Israel itself , and American Jews .
Obama 's people have studied the problem and understand where Carter went wrong .
Obama does not want to have the same image problems as Carter in the Jewish community .
Should that happen , the Beloved Leader and his lapdog press are fully prepared to unleash a Chavez style hate - on targeting American Jews .
But that would be inconvenient and messy .
Even with the changing face of America , there are significant differences between the average American and European or Venezuelan , and what kind of ugliness they are willing to tolerate .
So Obama 's people have split their attention in handling the two factors as two different problems .
American Jews - Obama has been clever about putting his Jewish appointees front and center .
Like many minorities , some American Jews suffer from self - esteem problems that are soothed when they see a seeming acceptance .
Of course what they fail to realize is that exploitation is not acceptance .
And that Obama 's appointees are creatures of his backers , Nazi collaborators like Soros , who have nothing but contempt for Jews , individually or collectively .
While outwardly courting Jews , Obama 's people have also been quietly shoving Jewish organizations and their leaders into a corner .
Within the Jewish organizational world there has been a silent but deadly takeover of major Jewish groups by left wing radicals .
Former alumni of the far left wing and anti-Israel groups like Breira or Coname in the 70's have been elevated to key positions in such organizations as the UJA Federation .
Behind the scenes any Jewish leaders who expressed even doubts about Obama during the primaries
The Beloved Leader and his lapdog press are fully prepared to unleash a Chavez style hate - on targeting American Jews .
were intimidated and silenced .
Much as with conservatives , a list has been drawn up of those figures who can be won over , and those who cannot .
The ones who can be won over are described as " moderates " , the ones who can not be won over are described as " extremists " .
Meanwhile a bevvy of left wing Jewish In Name Only groups have been organized to play their part .
Key among them is the Soros funded J Street , a group created as an anti-Israel lobby meant to eventually replace AIPAC .
Meanwhile AIPAC itself has been kept on the ropes with such things as the well timed Harman leak .
The message once again is fairly clear , cooperate and keep quiet , or we 'll destroy you .
The multi-layered approach to American Jews can then be summed up as follows ;
1. ) Co-opt existing Jewish organizations and swing them to the left using old school 70's leftists .
2. ) Create new " progressive " organizations to appeal to a younger generation of ethnically Jewish youth detached from any actual identity .
Have these organizations generate attacks on the Israeli government and pro-Israel Jews , while creating phony polls indicating that most American Jews are behind them and Obama .
3. ) Silence and intimidate remaining Jewish organizations and leaders behind the scenes .
The overall idea is to keep a happy face pasted on American Jewry while the knives are out in the dark .
Israel -
The basic understanding in the Obama Administration is that Israel Must Go .
In the worldview of the more moderate Obama appointees , Israel is a destabilizing factor in the Middle East .
To the more left wing Obama advisors , Israel is a Western imperialist colonialist state that must be destroyed in the name of revolutionary justice .
To the Islamist mindset , Israel is a Kufir state that has no right to exist in the Dar Al Islam .
While intractably hostile to Israel , the Obama Administration wants to avoid the kind of public confrontations that marked the Carter and Bush Sr administrations .
Instead they would much rather model the way that the Clinton Administration waged a quiet war against Israel , removing one government , and forcing extensive concessions to terrorists , all the while keeping a happy face pasted on the whole affair .
On the one hand that means avoiding harsh public attacks on Israel , but keeping the pressure up for Israel to make extensive far reaching one sided concessions , to accept Saudi and Arab League " peace plans " , to legitimize Hamas as the new government of the Palestinian Authority , and to insure that Israel does not reply to any rocket or terrorist attacks .
There are two forms of quiet leverage that the United States has on Israel , the first is financial and the second is military .
On the financial side , the goal will be to bring down the Netanyahu government coalition by destabilizing Israel economically .
This is the surest and most direct path to bringing down Israel 's conservative government and replacing it with a left of center coalition .
The Obama Administration has a wide variety of tactics at its disposal for doing so , from the overt , such as targeting Israeli exports and imports , to the covert , that would involve targeting the Shekel .
Additionally fundraising in the US could be investigated and groups such as the Jewish National Fund , prevented from raising money in the US .
All of these have been in play before at one time or another .
On the military side , Obama 's people will make their non-existent efforts to stop Iran 's nukes conditional on more concessions to terrorists .
Since Israel will never be able to make enough concessions and since Obama is working with Iran , rather than working to stop Iran 's nukes , this is a hollow charade .
Furthermore while Israel has already been locked out of the military technology pipeline for anything cutting edge , it still remains dependent on US military equipment for parts and supplies .
The decades of US foreign aid have also served to create dependency .
Unlike many other countries , including even Sweden , Israel does not have its own jet fighter .
Israel 's Air Force is heavily dependent on US weapons , parts and equipment .
Cutting Israel off , would leave the Israeli military dangerously vulnerable in the case of a war .
This is an effective chokehold that has been used before to prevent Israel from attacking Saddam Hussein during the Gulf War , as well as preventing Israel from carrying out a preemptive strike against its enemies before the Yom Kippur War .
The overall Obama policy will be to push Israel to the brink , using financial and military blackmail against the Netanyahu government , while maintaining control over American Jews to prevent any protests or backtalk .
... American Jewish groups will support Obama ... some because they were created precisely for that purpose , and others because they have been hijacked , cowed or subverted .
The more Israel will offer , the more the Obama Administration will tighten the screws .
No offer will be good enough , and Israel will be blamed for every breakdown in talks and every bit of violence that takes place .
The media will portray Israel and particularly Netanyahu as extremist and intransigent .
Hamas will be slowly whitewashed in the media , the same way that Arafat 's goons were , ( assuming that they prove more willing to cooperate in creating a positive media image of themselves than Ahmadinejad is . )
The plan is to destroy Israel , and to do it by pushing Israel to the edge of the cliff and then over the cliff .
Israel 's enemies will be getting top of the line US military equipment .
Israel will not .
Israel will be squeezed economically until the Netanyahu government collapses , leaving a weak left wing leader like Livni in charge of Israel , and in charge of acceding to the new Pharaoh 's demands .
Meanwhile so - called American Jewish groups will support Obama all the way , some because they were created precisely for that purpose , e.g. J - Street , and others because they have been hijacked , cowed or subverted .
That is the game plan and some of it's coming .
The rest is already here .
After reading about my own relationship with money , I wanted to do a quick roundup around the blogosphere to know how bloggers see money .
Here are the answers I got :
Kyle @ Amateur Asset Allocator
I ’m pretty indifferent to money , and I find myself caring less and less about it as I get older .
I used to be cheap , but now I ’ve begun to realize I can get much more accomplished if I focus on what I ’m good at and pay somebody to do the rest .
Life is much more enjoyable when you do n’t have to take a day off work to paint .
As for how I deal with money , I save a fixed percentage of income in my 401k , max out my Roth , and save as much of the rest as I can in taxable accounts .
If I do n’t manage to save much extra in any given month for whatever reason , I do n’t sweat it .
Since I have an overly - large emergency fund and a few alternative sources of income , I ’m pretty secure in my financial life at the moment .
If I had less money , I might care about it a lot more .
Mike @ Money Smarts Blog ( aka Four Pillars )
I love money .
The more the better .
I think that if you do n’t have enough money to do the basic things you want then that can create unhappiness .
Of course there are limits – I would love a Ferrari but I doubt that owning one would make me happier .
I ’m happier when I am financially secure compared to when I do n’t have enough money which can be stressful .
Craig @ Free From Broke
Money and I dated for a while , and like many new relationships I was totally enamored .
Money did n’t really care though so I tried to do what I could to get Money ’s attention , like buy all sorts of stuff .
That never works in a relationship though , does it ?
It just left me in a whole lot of debt .
So Money and I had a falling out of sorts .
I still always thought about it but it reminded me of all the pain I went through .
Yeah , I even resented it a bit .
We ’ve reconciled somewhat , and agreed to be friends .
I ’ll always need Money and Money always wants to be spent .
We have a mutual thing going on where we acknowledge each other but I try to not go crazy about it anymore .
Money is important in my life , but its not my entire life .
Phil @ PT Money
I currently have a healthy obsession with my money .
Not necessarily spending it .
I ’m more concerned about controlling it .
Making it do what I want it to .
There are times though when I get burnt out on the relationship .
I check out and try and forget about money for a while .
Then , a few days later I ’m back in the drivers seat telling money what to do .
This on / off thing seems to work well for me and my money .
Peter @ Bible Money Matters
I have of a wary attitude towards money .
I ’m not particularly obsessed with it , and I do n’t think I love it , but I do know that I have to be careful about it , and pay attention to it .
I have realized in the last few years that if I do n’t pay attention to it , and tell it what to do , it will quickly disappear , never to return .
I enjoy talking about money , and learning more about how to use money as a tool , and growing my money to use towards a variety of ends .
In the end I hope to be able to have enough money to do the things I love more , and to be able to give generously to others .
Ruth @ Mrs. Micah
Money makes me sad because we owe a lot of it .
I ’m not scared because I ’m pretty sure we can pay it off , but some days the math makes me feel sad because we ’ll be paying it off for a while .
Madison @ My Dollar Plan
My relationship with money has changed dramatically since we switched from accumulating money to spending it .
I still have a lot of the same habits , but I feel differently now about spending .
It ’s taken some time to adjust .
I also keep a very close eye on how our children portray our spending and try to show them whenever I can the value of money and how hard we had to work to earn it .
I want them to grow up with a hard work ethic and learn how to use money as a tool .
Jeff @ Good Financial Cents
I have a unique relationship with money in that I help other people manage their own and all the emotional aspects that come with it .
In my position , I have the advantage of hearing all the great financial successes that my clients have experienced and all the shortfalls .
Hearing those stories has helped better my own financial situation as well as being able to pass those valuable lessons on to others .

Snug shoes with the attendant support they offer may not be the best answer for foot problems .
A barefoot stroll down a sandy beach may be good for the soul but also for the sole - and the rest of the foot as well .
About 25 percent of the bones in our bodies are in our feet ;
But what all those bones , joints , ligaments , muscles and tendons are getting up to as we walk has long been a mystery .
Now UWO researcher Tom Jenkyn , an associate professor of biomechanics , departments of mechanical engineering and school of kinesiology at the London Ontario university , is discovering “ what the foot is doing inside the shoe . ”
His research is challenging a lot of accepted beliefs .
For instance , he has discovered that even properly fitted shoes can weaken some smaller muscles in the foot .
Shoes supply support , reducing the demands made on certain foot muscles .
With less use , less exercise , these muscles weaken just as one would expect .
According to the UWO professor of biomechanics , walking barefoot for even part of the day is beneficial .
Even simply loosening the shoelaces to allow some movement of the feet inside the shoes helps .
Traditionally the wear pattern on the soles of our shoes offers clues to the movement of our feet while walking or running .

When buying athletic footwear it has been important to determine whether one was a pronator , overpronator or oversupinator , also called an underpronator .
It sounded complicated but it was n’t .
All pronation refers to is the inward roll of the foot , particularly the heel and arch , while walking or running .
Overpronators tend to wear down their running shoes on the inside of the shoe towards the toe area , while oversupinators ( underpronators ) do the opposite – wearing down the outside of the shoe instead .
Considering the complexity of the foot , this three divisions approach sounds a little too neat , too simple , but according to Jenkyn , “ We had no way to contradict it . ”
Now , researchers at the UWO are using two methods for measuring joint movement in feet during walking and solving a technically tricky problem .
Some shoes are believed to decrease running injuries by encouraging changes in foot motion .
To test this , reflective markers are affixed to the foot via windows cut in the shoe .

If x-ray fluoroscopy rings a bell , it should .
Jenkyn smiles as he admits that this is , “ exactly what they were doing in the shoe stores ” in the ‘ 50s .
The big difference is the university is using two highly sophisticated fluoroscope units producing images which are mated with information gleaned from a previous CT - scan of a subject ’s feet .
This approach results in 3 - D images with more in common with George Lucas Industrial Light and Magic than the Buster Brown stores of yesterday .
The complete movement of each bone in the foot can be tracked in three dimensions , and all while the foot is still inside a shoe !
If x-rays and CT - scans sound like each subject is getting a lot of radiation , they are n't .
For instance , the CT - scan is done at one thirtieth the usual dosage .
The information is read only by a computer and not by a radiologist ;
Therefore , clinical contrast is not necessary .
Jenkyn is discovering there is not only a huge amount of variability in foot movement between people but even from footstep to footstep in each individual .
These differences are “ subtle but significant . ”
So what does this research mean to the average person ?
It means a rethinking of the traditional approach to foot problems .
Injure your shoulder and the last thing a physiotherapist will do is brace your arm , prevent movement and leave it that way .
But that approach , so wrong for a shoulder , is the one taken when it comes to feet .
It is possible that in certain cases foot problems such as fallen arches and Morton ’s neuroma could be corrected with orthodics designed to exercise the foot , to strengthen it , to encourage healing .
So , what shoe does Tom Jenkyn wear ?
At home , he likes a backless pair of Crocs ;
These allow his forefoot to spread and they exercise his foot muscles .
He says any backless sandal which a person finds comfortable and which does not confine the foot should work – and make the foot work , too .
You are what you wear , at least when it comes to your feet and shoes according to Tom Jenkyn , an associate professor at the University of Western Ontario ( UWO ) .

Role Players are the Key May 10 , 2010
Role Player : A team athelete who plays mainly in specific situations .
In other words , somebody who gets strictly limited playing time and only performs a few functions , whether that is to be a pesky perimeter defender , a large body in the paint , a three point shooter , or whatever else .
These are the guys that are essential to every team , and if coaches play them smartly then these are the guys that can make all the difference between a good team and a great team .
But really , how important are these players ?
I mean , they ’re do n’t play big minutes , they generally jump in and out of the rotation , and they certainly do n’t put up big numbers .
Your Glen Davis , your Mikael Pietrus , even your Sasha Vujacic , these guys do not put up big numbers or minutes .
In the grand scheme of things , they are just players with enough marginal talent to fill in for the stars who need to take a breather …right ?
Ironically enough , these players are actually extremely vital to teams , especially those with hopes of making deep playoff runs .
I ’ve said this before to no avail , but now this 2010 postseason is surefire proof of how important these role players are .
These guys who could barely make the rotation are now stepping up when it counts , and it ’s definitely no coincidence .
See , you know what you get with role - players .
Coaches , especially the great ones , know exactly when and in what context to put in a role player where they can be a spark off the bench and surprise the other team .
Case in point : the Celtics - Cavs game this Sunday .
As much as I have been disgusted with his ‘ rebel without a cause ’ attitude these past few seasons , we all have to admit that Rajon Rondo ( 29 points , 18 boards , 13 assists ) was going off for an amazing triple - double performance that just destroyed the Cavs ’ hope for an easy series ( but that ’s a whole different story ) .
The point is , role - player Tony Allen was inserted by Doc Rivers for 25 huge minutes off the bench while Rondo was tearing i t up .
Now , Tony Allen ( ‘ the other Allen ’ , as I so fondly like to describe him ) has been jumping in and out of Doc ’s rotation for years ( did you know he ’s been a Celtic for his whole 6 - year career ? ) , and Doc knows exactly what he can and cannot do .
He ’s a slasher and an energetic defender , and that ’s about it .
But Rivers brilliantly used his talents to its maximum potential as he commanded T - Allen to slash and cut and create energy .
Sure enough , with most Cavs defenders keeping their eyes on Rondo Tony Allen got some huge points off then bench for the Celtics .
At one point , Paul Pierce was kneeling on the sideline to come back into the game and Doc actually got up and pulled him back to the bench in order to keep Allen in the game .
Good call .
Honestly , I do n’t think the Celtics win without Tony Allen .
Yes , Rondo ’s game is one for the ages , but this Sunday Tony Allen was the second best player .
His impact of 15 points felt like a lot more , given that he scored mostly late in the game .
The Cavaliers , heavily favored coming in , dropped another game and a huge reason for that is an unheralded role - player .
We can see Doc Rivers ’ brilliance not only in that game , but also two years ago when the then - nearly unheard of Leon Powe went off against the Lakers in the NBA finals .
And this is just the tip of the iceberg .
Last Friday ( May 7th ) Goran Dragic of the Suns went off for 26 points in 17 minutes against the Spurs , leading the charge in a huge comeback win .
Goran - fucking - Dragic ?
Who even knew his name last week other than some Suns fans and hardcore basketball nerds like me ?
Pietrus on the Magic is also a huge player whose stats do n’t reflect his impact on the game .
In addition to being an extremely annoying defender who frequently takes turns guarding the other team ’s best player , he ’s hit big threes almost every game this postseason , even with limited playing time .
He is also able to contribute while Carter or Lewis are resting , which is a huge and often underrated factor .
Back in LA , the Lakers ancient 35 year old point guard Derek Fisher is having an amazing postseason once again ( this Saturday he hit three huge threes against the Jazz and created 20 efficient points of unexpected offense ) .
It ’s the same story every year with a lot of these role players .
People see their sub -par stats and their small impact in the regular season and they cry out that these players are no good and that their previous accolades were somehow flukes .
This could not be further from the truth .
In reality , good coaches know exactly what they can get out of their players and play them accordingly .
Doc Rivers knew that Tony Allen ’s skillset would fit the game on Sunday .
Phil Jackson knows that Fisher hits huge shots in the postseason and turns it up another gear .
Stan -Van knows that Pietrus can reliably hit the triple and give his stars valuable rest for solid stretches .
If you compare some other teams who are supposed to be at the elite - level , they are noticeably lacking important role - players , these building blocks that are both vital and at the same time unheralded on elite teams vying for a championship .
Look at Atlanta .
Their bench players not named Jamal Crawford ( who is n’t really a bench player ) do n’t have the skills that helps their team win .
Even on the supposedly - deep Cavaliers , the role players are not getting any time to do what they do ( Moon , Powe , and Hickson all have very different and useful talents that are not being showcased this postseason by Mike Brown ) .
In the end , it ’s that instant offense , that pesky D , that offensive rebounding , that corner three , or whatever else your local role player does that makes him so important .
And that , ladies and gentlemen , is the real difference between teams that are great and teams that are just pretty good .
The doctors behind BioWare , the hallowed game studio behind Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age : Origins , were telling Kotaku last week that their plans to add content to their recent games is flexible .
More vehicle missions are possible .
More sex ?

" People actually do ask : ' Why do n't you do more relationships ? ' "
Greg Zeschuk told Kotaku as he sat next to studio co-founder Ray Muzyka during an interview in a hotel suite in San Francisco last week .
Kotaku had asked if there could be more sex or romance added to the game , partially as a lark , riffing off of Zeshuck 's comments that the studio would consider making more missions involving the new Hammerhead vehicle being added to Mass Effect 2 , if fans say they enjoy using it .
Some fans have complained that Mass Effect 2 was more restrained in its depiction of romance and sex than its predecessor , which had taken heat for a sex scene it included in a widely - publicized segment on Fox News .

While the suggestion that BioWare could accede to such requests to just add more sex via downloadable content was made tongue - in - cheek , Zeschuk said that the idea of adding more dating and love to the game after the fact is an idea he likes .
He thinks of such possible content as , in his words , " a romance pack , " something that has nothing to do with combat and everything to do with relationships .
" You know , It 's possible , " he said .
Mentioning a character from Dragon
Age , he suggested there could be a " Take Leliana on a date pack . "

" That is a pretty good idea , " Muzyka chimed in , sounding as if this was the first he'd heard of it .
" I 've mentioned it to the guys , " Zeschuk told me and Muzyka .
" And maybe we will . "

The offer was made to Deborah Wilson in front of her son Jay
A woman has claimed she was approached near a health centre in Glasgow by three women who offered her £ 200 if she agreed to be sterilised .
Deborah Wilson said the offer was made as she left Possilpark Health Centre with her nine - year - old son on Friday .
Ms Wilson said the women told her they were from Project Prevention , a US group which pays drug addicts to be voluntarily sterilised .
Police advised anyone approached in a similar way to contact them .
Ms Wilson , a mother - of - two , said she was shaken by the incident .
" As we left the health centre I saw three ladies coming out of a car and they told me there was this new scheme , offering £ 200 , " she said .
" Then I saw a bit of paper in her hand and it had drug addicts written on it .
" I 'm not a addict .
I think I was approached because I was in the Possilpark area - it 's a well - known area for drugs - but that 's where my doctor is based . "
Ms Wilson said she was particularly angry because the women had asked her in front of her son .
" I 'm very hurt and angry that someone could approach me in the street and ask me those sorts of questions at all , let alone when I had my nine - year - old with me , " she said .
An argument
" I asked her to leave me alone but she kept going on and on so I had an argument with her and got on the bus to go home .
" My son knew they were asking me questions , and he asked me what it meant to be sterilised . "
Ms Wilson , who said she also saw the women approaching others after she had left , said she contacted Strathclyde Police when she returned home .
A Strathclyde Police spokesman said they believed it had been an isolated incident but advised anyone similarly approached to contact their local police station .
Project Prevention 's website states that its aim is to reduce the number of " substance - exposed " births to zero .
The group was not available for comment .

In his 1776 work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , Scottish moral philosopher Adam Smith identified the cause in a single variable : “ the propensity to truck , barter , and exchange one thing for another . ”
Today we call this free trade or market capitalism , and since the recession it has become de rigueur to dis the system as corrupt , rotten or deeply flawed .
If we pull back and take a long - horizon perspective , however , the free exchange between people of goods , services and especially ideas leads to trust between strangers and prosperity for more people .
Think of it as ideas having sex .
That is what zoologist and science writer Matt Ridley calls it in his book The Rational Optimist : How Prosperity Evolves ( HarperCollins , 2010 ) .
Ridley is optimistic that “ the world will pull out of the current crisis because of the way that markets in goods , services and ideas allow human beings to exchange and specialize honestly for the betterment of all . ”
Sex evolved because the benefit of the diversity created through the intermixture of genomes outweighed the costs of engaging in it , and so we enjoy exchanging our genes with one another , and life is all the richer for it .
Likewise ideas .
“ Exchange is to cultural evolution as sex is to biological evolution , ” Ridley writes , and “ the more human beings diversified as consumers and specialized as producers , and the more they then exchanged , the better off they have been , are and will be .
And the good news is that there is no inevitable end to this process .
The more people are drawn into the global division of labour , the more people can specialize and exchange , the wealthier we will all be . ”
In the teeth of the recession and the reality of more than a billion impoverished people in developing countries today , this thesis sounds ripe for skepticism , indeed almost blindly Pollyannaish .
But Ridley systematically builds a case through copious data and countless studies that “ the vast majority of people are much better fed , much better sheltered , much better entertained , much better protected against disease and much more likely to live to old age than their ancestors have ever been .
The availability of almost everything a person could want or need has been going rapidly upwards for 200 years and erratically upwards for 10,000 years before that : years of lifespan , mouthfuls of clean water , lungfuls of clean air , hours of privacy , means of traveling faster than you can run , ways of communicating farther than you can shout , ” and with more access to “ calories , watts , lumen - hours , square feet , gigabytes , megahertz , light - years , nanometers , bushels per acre , miles per gallon , food miles , air miles , and of course dollars than any that went before . ”
Trade does something even more important than enrich our lives .
It makes people behave more fairly .
In a March 18 article in Science entitled “ Markets , Religion , Community Size , and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment , ” University of British Columbia psychologist Joseph Henrich and his colleagues engaged nearly 2,700 people in 15 small communities around the world in two - player exchange games in which one subject is given a sum of money ( the equivalent of a day ’s pay ) and allowed to keep or share some or all of it with another person .
You would think that most people would just keep all of the money , but in fact the scientists discovered that members of hunter - gatherer communities shared about 25 percent , whereas members of societies who regularly engage in trade gave away about 50 percent .
Although religion was a modest factor in making people more generous , the strongest predictor was “ market integration , ” defined as “ the percentage of a household ’s total calories that were purchased from the market , as opposed to homegrown , hunted , or fished . ”
Why ?
Because , the authors conclude , trust and cooperation with strangers lowers transaction costs and generates greater prosperity for all involved , and thus concepts of fair trade emerged as part of a larger process of social evolution to maintain mutually beneficial exchanges even when the participants were not bound by kinship , status or other social ties .
In other words , our ancestors had sex with people they knew , but their ideas had sex with strangers , and this form of trade led to trust and prosperity .
The director Michael Moore says that a federal judge ’s ruling to allow Chevron to subpoena footage from the documentary “ Crude ” could have dire consequences on the documentary filmmaking process , and urged that film ’s director to resist the subpoena if he can .
On Thursday , Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of United States District Court in Manhattan said that Joe Berlinger , the director of “ Crude , ” would have to turn over more than 600 hours of footage from that documentary .
The film chronicles the Ecuadorians who sued Texaco ( now owned by Chevron ) saying an oil field contaminated their water .
Chevron said that Mr. Berlinger ’s footage could be helpful as it seeks to have the litigation dismissed and pursues an international treaty arbitration related to the lawsuit .
In a telephone interview on Thursday night , Mr. Moore , whose films include “ Bowling for Columbine ” and “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” said that he had never heard of such a ruling .
“ If this is n’t overturned , it would make a lot of documentary filmmakers afraid , ” Mr. Moore said .
“ People are going to have to start getting rid of all their extra footage now , right ? ”
Should the decision of Judge Kaplan be upheld and a subpoena be served for Mr. Berlinger ’s footage , Mr. Moore said , “ The chilling effect of this is , someone like me , if something like this is upheld , the next whistleblower at the next corporation is going to think twice about showing me some documents if that information has to be turned over to the corporation that they ’re working for . ”
Mr. Moore said that in making his documentary films like “ Roger & Me , ” he has spoken in confidence to corporate employees who have revealed sensitive information or shared internal documents .
“ I ’ve never had to deal with any corporation suing me to find out how I gather this information , ” he said .
“ Obviously the ramifications of this go far beyond documentary films , if corporations are allowed to pry into a reporter ’s notebook or into a television station ’s newsroom . ”
Mr. Moore said he hoped the judge ’s ruling would be overturned on appeal , and said that if it is not Mr. Berlinger should resist the subpoena “ if he can . ”
“ I think that he ’ll find that he ’ll have the support of hundreds of filmmakers who will back him in this , ” Mr. Moore said .
“ Documentaries are a form of journalism , ” he added .
The lawyers for Mr. Berlinger said they would ask Judge Kaplan to stay the subpoena while they appeal the decision .
According to Net Index , a new website operated by Seattle - based Ookla ( the people behind Speedtest.net ) , the United States is falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to wired broadband speeds .
Based on user test info generated over the past 30 days , Net Index ranked the US 26th in the world for downlink speeds with an average downlink speed of 10.16 Mbps .
Such speeds might not seem all that bad at first glance , but considering that the global average is 7.67 Mbps , it ’s clear that US ISPs have a lot of ground to make up .
South Korea finished first with an average of 34.14 Mbps , followed by Latvia , the Republic of Moldova , and Japan at 24.29 , 21.37 and 20.39 M bps respectively .
Moving to uplink speeds , South Korea once again led the pack with an average of 18.04 Mbps while the US ’s 2.21 Mbps was barely above the world average of 2.10 Mbps .
In an attempt to keep things as even as possible , Net Index only counted results from nations in which tests were taken from at least 75,000 unique IP addresses .
And though the results are by no means scientific , they will no doubt provide a lot of talking points for those currently engaged in the ongoing battle between advocates of net neutrality and ISPs whose interests are best served by imposing caps on data speeds and usage Results from colleges and businesses were excluded from the results .

( The Awakening Conference was sponsored by the Freedom Federation and held April 15 - 16 at Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg , VA .
Truth Wins
Out ’s founder Wayne Besen reports live from the event )
If the Religious Right fringe one day establishes a theocracy in America , no one will be able to credibly claim that they did not explicitly broadcast their dubious intentions .
Having just spent two days at “ The Awakening ” conference at the late Rev. Jerry Falwell ’ Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg , Virginia , one message was unmistakable : Many key Religious Right figures vehemently reject separation of church and state and believe America is a fundamentalist Christian nation .
“ The Bible is the government of the people , by the people and for the people , ” thundered Cindy Jacobs of General ’ International from the stage .
“ I believe there is an awakening to do just that . ”
What ’ frightening is that many leaders on the Religious Right hold a basic belief system that is seemingly incompatible with democratic forms of government .
Their central tautological argument is that liberty originated from God and so the only way to be truly free is through a theocratic system that honors the creator of freedom .
Huh ?
Exactly .
According to this mindset , God has ordained the faithful to be in positions of leadership , rendering any form of government that does not elevate these “ chosen ones ” or reflect their extreme views as illegitimate .
The Saturday night rally began with a surprising controversy .
Lou Engle ( pictured ) , the constantly rocking , intense , mustachioed cleric of The Call with the booming voice of a professional wrestler declared , “ We are here to honor all denominations .
There will be no tongues tonight . ”
This left many in the audience offended , and well , tongue - tied .
In a huff , several people stormed out of the main chapel .
Sensing a gaffe , Engle soon reappeared on - stage and happily declared , “ I apologize , we can speak in tongues ! ”
At this heavily advertised event , there was no shortage of the paranoid and prejudiced .
But , one pleasant surprise was that attacks on LGBT people were on the decline .
The crowd was more riled about President Barack Obama ’ healthcare plan , which the Family Research Council ’ Tony Perkins referred to onstage as “ a socialistic time bomb . ”
The big news at the conference came from Engle .
While sitting in the audience during the “ LGBT Agenda ” breakout session , he spoke up and conceded that the next generation of evangelical Christians is largely supportive of LGBT rights ( but not abortion ) .
Engle said that when he preaches against gay people , the Christian youth often “ rage against him . ”
Engle , a giant in right wing circles , said that the far right has lost on this issue barring a miracle , such as an intercession at a 500,000 strong youth rally .
When he floated this idea to the activists on - stage , The Liberty Counsel ’ Matt Barber said they should privately discuss such a rally after the forum .
Good luck with that idea , considering the breakout session at Falwell U. drew only 15 people .
Virtually everyone in the small crowd was a hardcore anti-gay activist from groups such as Parents and Friends of Ex - Gays ( PFOX ) .
Clearly , gay bashing was an issue that was not motivating many young people , as it has been in the past .
( Although , it seems Engle ’ group , The Call , may already be testing his intercession plan in Uganda )
I was not “ undercover ” at the event as right wing sources have erroneously claimed .
After all , I had signed up under my own name .
But , I was trying to keep a low profile so I would n’t get thrown out of the conference .
To not look conspicuous , I grew some facial stubble and used no hair gel .
The plan worked until The Traditional Values Coalition ’ Andrea Lafferty ( daughter of Lou Sheldon ) spotted me at the LGBT Agenda breakout session , which made me as comfortable as a fly landing on a porcupine .
She asked me if I had any questions .
I looked around the room and saw no movable middle in this bunch , so I declined .
I preferred to plead the 5th to ensure I could attend the big revival that was planned that evening .
While the sheer number of anti-gay attacks had decreased from conferences I had attended in past years , the remaining rhetoric was vicious and vile , as our desperate opponents see they are losing the battle of public opinion .
Lafferty , for example , said if we pass The Employment Non-Discrimination Act , a bill in congress to protect LGBT Americans from job discrimination , we are on a slippery slope to protect those who have sex with amputees , children and animals .
( see video via Kyle at Right Wing Watch )
She seemed to have an unusually acerbic reaction to transgender people .
Lafferty said , “ they are actually she - males … .
We need to talk about how truly troubled they are ….
Do we want them in the classroom ? ”
The Liberty Counsel ’ Matt Barber chimed in , saying that transgender Americans are the “ ultimate act of rebellion against God . ”
He justified persecuting LGBT people claiming , “ The ultimate act of hatred is to help someone foster a self - delusion . ”
Barber defended teenage bullies in school by saying , “ Kids need to have a First Amendment right to defend Traditional Values . ”
As far as legislation or policies opposing school bullying against LGBT students , Barber said , “ The government picking sides is de facto viewpoint discrimination . ”
Just to let everyone know his heart and soften his vitriolic presentation , Barber kindly added , “ We are not homophobic . ”
At the breakout session , Rena Lindevaldsen , A law school professor at Liberty University , revealed the anti-gay lobby ’ strategy to defeat ENDA , saying the key message is , “ letting people see how the kids are affected … it ’ an unhealthy lifestyle . ”
Lafferty seconded this strategy by saying that the Religious Right will show how , “ ENDA will affect every public school in America . ”
She backed up her point by asking in utter horror , “ Imagine having a transgender gym teacher . ”
After the seminar , I photographed Barber , Lindevaldsen and Lafferty ( left ) .
As I left the room , Lafferty pulled me aside to introduce herself .
With a friendly smile she shook my hand and told me that the demeaning lies against LGBT people “ were n’t personal attacks . ”
During the evening revival , Bishop Harry Jackson explained why he fought against marriage equality in Washington , DC , saying , “ If you redefine marriage you have to redefine the family .
There is a generation that wants to pervert children at 7 , 8 , and 9 years old . ”
During his speech , Jackson claimed that he was a college athlete who smoked marijuana and took psychedelic drugs .
One evening , when a man he was getting high with pulled a bayonet on him , Jackson realized he was “ in a room of crazy people . ”
He alleged that this experience was his “ first step toward the Lord ” and helped lead to his successful marriage .
Surely , some of the students in the revival crowd in Lynchburg must have wondered why family life , faith and stability were good and necessary for Jackson , but not for LGBT people in the District of Columbia .
They must have questioned why he felt his marriage depended on discrimination that kept other people from experiencing the same joy and happiness he gained from his own relationship .
If Lou Engle is wondering how his movement lost the current generation of youth , it is because of the hatred and hyperbole of people like Lafferty , Barber and Jackson .
Their biblical bromides and disjointed Jeremiads are simply incongruous with reality .
Many teenagers , including evangelicals , have friends who come out of the closet at early ages .
They listen to the slurs and the slander at such conferences and know , based on real life experience , that they are hearing lies .
Such cognitive dissonance is costing evangelical leaders credibility and explains why the anti-gay seminar earlier in the day was a bust .
But make no mistake — while homophobia is in decline , it is still a potent issue to be exploited and milked for every last ounce of remaining value .
The Family Research Council ’ Tony Perkins said that the Obama Administration ’ , “ forcing the military to embrace homosexuality must stop ” and said that the President was using America ’ armed forces as “ guinea pigs for a social experiment . ”
A noticeably effeminate African American “ ex - gay ” singer , Eddie James , danced on - stage during the revival to proclaim he had left homosexuality .
There was also a young student who claimed she was “ raped by a woman and a man ” , ended up in a homosexual relationship and was eventually “ delivered from homosexuality . ”
A teenager who said a man molested him followed her .
As a result of the trauma , he thought he was destined to be bisexual .
He then loudly professed that had “ broken the spirit ” of homosexuality .
Of course , there are countless heterosexuals who were sexually abused as children , as there are many LGBT people who grew up in model homes .
Dishonestly , anti-gay activists continue to conflate the two issues of abuse and sexual orientation .
But , this whole charade unfolding onstage represented the underbelly of evangelicalism .
At its worst , it exploits such vulnerable and desperate people such as these abused youth in a shameless bid to make a circumstantial case in support of its ideology .
Watching these two young people , who were obviously still in pain , yet paraded like carnival acts , seemed like crass opportunism and emotional exhibitionism .
There was nothing conservative or pro-family about this cruel sideshow .
It was clear by the amount of effort put into the stage set that conference organizers were expecting a packed house .
Indeed , the main revival hall was nothing short of Biblical Broadway and Holy Hollywood .
It featured rock concert lighting and two mammoth screens projecting the Big Show .
There was a seven - piece band that included a violinist who was wearing a yarmulke .
Eight lively crooners , including the ex-gay activist , fronted the band .
Despite the glitz and a “ who ’ who ” of right wing stars , the revival hall was at least a quarter empty ( See Pic , Left ) .
The organizers of the conference must have been disappointed by the sagging turnout — particularly with midterm elections around the corner .
Still , the people in attendance were excitable and enraptured by the high - energy , high - tech circus that spared few of the predictable targets .
Despite a notable attempt to be inclusive of minorities , Liberty University ’ Rev. Johnnie Moore expressed his desire that , there would be revival in the Muslim world and that “ Hindus would trade in their idols ” for Jesus Christ .
Dr. Ergun Caner , Dean of the Liberty Baptist Theological Seminary and Graduate School , said , “ The greatest threat to America ’ survival is nominal Christianity … we need a fire to awaken the church . ”
Perhaps , these reasonable and rational ( or nominal ) Christians may represent a threat to Caner ’ unthinking brand of reactionary fundamentalism .
But , how are they a threat to America ?
When I open up the newspaper each morning , the root of much worldwide instability and pain comes from angry fundamentalists and zealous ideologues from various religious sects .
I ca n’t remember the last time I read an article about “ nominal ” Christians , Muslims , Buddhists , Hindus or Jews harming anyone .
Moving along , Rev. Samuel Rodriguez , of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference , boldly predicted that , “ You will see Roe vs. Wade overturned . ”
There was general unanimity that the far right was outperforming the left in winning the battle for hearts and minds on the abortion issue .
I tend to think they are correct , with pro-choice forces lazily depending on the existence of Roe vs.
Wade , or using tired slogans , instead of making powerful arguments in favor of legalized abortion .
If they do not change this imbalance soon , the fundamentalists will seize a decisive advantage on this issue .
In terms of abortion , new arguments were made that were not heard at past right wing conferences that I had attended .
Throughout the two - day affair , virtually every African American preacher attacked abortion as “ the leading cause of death in the black community . ”
It was also jarring to see a “ patriotism deficit ” in a group that is accustomed to wrapping itself in the flag .
When I began covering right wing conferences in the early 90′ , the participants luxuriated in America , sang patriotic songs and worshipped the Republican Party with gusto .
With Obama in office , this gathering was seemingly not as enamored with America .
Overall , the speakers and crowd were fervently anti-government ( you know , the people who run this country ) and held the GOP in contempt for not being extreme enough to satisfy the true believers .
Energized by the Tea Party , many people in Lynchburg pledged not to automatically give their votes to Republican candidates without assurances that they would champion rigid conservative positions on social issues .
“ We are not Republicans or Democrats , ” shouted Engle , summing up the mood , “ But subjects of a higher king . ”
Dr. Richard Land , president of the Southern Baptist Convention ’ Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , echoed Engle ’ admonition to the GOP saying , “ Our loyalty belongs to Jesus Christ , not to any party . ”
Land added in a breakout session that , “ The black community has been used and exploited by the Democratic Party . ”
He continued that , “ the goal is to make sure Christians are not exploited by the Republican Party . ”
While conventional wisdom has the energy on the far right helping Republicans , it could easily backfire and split the GOP .
Republicans are playing with fire by thinking they can control the combustible right wing activists that I observed .
Speaking of Dr. Land , he succinctly explained how the Religious Right viewed its role by claiming it was , “ a purifying agent ” and “ a moral disinfectant in society . ”
An enjoyable storyteller with a mellifluous voice and a deep southern drawl , Dr. Land also spoke of a moralistic foray into an Adult Bookstore , where nosey church members harassed patrons .
“ We went to the worlds largest adult bookstore .
I do n’t know why they call it an adult bookstore since they are childish and puerile .
We were there for two hours with cameras .
I want you to know that during those two hours , nobody went in and no one came out .
Now , cars circled the block , waiting to see if we were going to leave .
And there were guys inside looking out of the glass door , looking to see if we were going to leave .
But , while we were there with the camera , nobody went in and nobody came out .
Because men like darkness better than light because their deeds were evil . ”
Of course , Dr. Land never considered that the men frequenting the store wanted their anonymity and privacy and had no desire to become poster boys for “ sin ” in Southern Baptist churches .
Additionally , under his logic , porn stars are beacons of light because they very publicly engage in wild sex acts .
There is also the reality that many Americans would rather be filmed at an adult bookstore than be videotaped coming out of Dr. Land ’ church , which has been spewing hateful political pornography for decades .
Whether it is supporting slavery , gay bashing or demanding that women submit graciously to their husbands , the Southern Baptist Convention has enthusiastically embraced things far more shameful than naughty pictures .
Finally , there is the possibility that the men in the Peep Show did not want to come outside because they were members or employees of Land ’ church .
If fundamentalists have proven one thing over the years , it is that they do not always practice what they preach .
By far the most revealing aspect of my visit to the conference occurred at the breakout panel discussion , “ Pastors and Political Activity . ” Rev. Rick Joyner , of Morningstar Ministries , personified the gloom and doom of the right when he declared , “ Our country has fallen to one of the lowest states of depravity that the Bible says a nation could . ”
Joyner is a big supporter of “ The Oak Initiative ” , which wants fundamentalists to control the “ seven areas of dominant influence ” , which are listed as : Government , business , media , arts and entertainment , education , family services , and the church .
Joyner is fond of military references and believes that only a few well - organized men can accomplish the goals of the Oak Initiative .
“ One hundred people can impact a city of one - million , ” Joyner said .
“ Let ’ concentrate on those twelve who are true force multipliers . ”
Joyner ’ militaristic words became a bit chilling , when he said he was collaborating with retired Lieutenant General William G. “ Jerry ” Boykin .
In October 2003 The Los Angeles Times published a controversial story quoting a Boykin speech about hunting down a terrorist in Mogadishu :
“ He went on CNN and he laughed at us , and he said , ‘ They ’ll never get me because Allah will protect me .
Allah will protect me . ’
Well , you know what ?
I knew that my God was bigger than his , ” said Boykin .
“ I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol . ”
The panel became particularly interesting when the topic turned to public education .
Dr. Land proclaimed that he would not , “ put my first grader in the hands of pagans . ”
Vision America ’ Dr. Rick Scarborough complained about the difficulties of getting into public schools claiming that fundamentalists have been “ shut out by the ACLU ” .
A brash twenty - something young man sitting with friends who looked like over - the - hill skateboarders , spoke up during the Q&A period and claimed that the panelists were not trying hard enough .
He claimed that through his youth ministry , “ we ’ve been to 330 schools and only two asked us to leave . ”
Upon hearing this , Scarborough cheered these youth and said , “ We need more special forces like yourself ” , and then spoke of the importance in engaging in “ guerilla warfare ” .
Joyner chimed in that fundamentalists should “ come in undercover . ”
For example , a fundamentalist could go in to speak “ as an athlete ” , but really be in the schools to push a sectarian message .
The panel included a nasty swipe by Dr. Land at mega- church pastor Joel Osteen , who appeared to quietly mutter that Osteen was “ that simpleton from Houston . ”
He also blamed weak - kneed Catholics for electing Barack Obama .
“ It was the Catholic pro-lifers who caved , ” and voted for Obama .
Before he left to catch a plane , Dr. Land offered one more nugget of advice .
“ Winning this war is a generational process .
It took two generations to get into this mess and it will take us one generation to get out . ”
I ’d like to add a brief note on Virginia ’ controversial Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli , who is articulate and hugely popular in right wing circles ( he got one of the few standing ovations at the conference ) .
He is worth watching and has a shot to be on the shortlist for the GOP vice presidential pick .
Cuccinelli and Mitt Romney would make a compelling ticket because both men are attractive , and Cuccinelli would help dispel lingering suspicions about Romney ’ Mormon religion .
Having covered religious extremism for nearly two - decades , I can say without hesitation that today ’ religious right , because of changing times , shifting demographics , the global economic meltdown and the election of Obama is more delirious and desperate than ever .
This paranoia is exploited and exacerbated by a right wing media bubble that makes these individuals feel like a silent majority suppressed by evil outside forces .
There are fringe elements that believe wresting control of the federal government is the only way to “ reclaim America . ”
Fighting against a hostile fundamentalist takeover , in my view , is the most important role of the LGBT movement .
If they ever gain total control , LGBT people will lose everything .
Many of these individuals have no respect for our love or our lives .
While such a hostile takeover is unlikely , ( particularly with more supportive Christian youth ) we must remain vigilant and continuously monitor America ’ religious extremists to ensure their frightening vision of America never comes to fruition .
As I drove out of town on Jerry Falwell Parkway , I hoped progressives would be the ones who had the “ awakening ” .
If the people at this conference had their way , all of America would be forced to drive on an interstate highway named after the late founder of The Moral Majority .
Why do most zippers say " YKK " on the pull - tab ?
YKK is a huge company that makes zippers !
Here is a bit of zipper history .
The " clasp locker " as it was called , was invented in 1891 by Whitcomb L. Judson .
The clasp locker was an assemblage of hooks and eyes that Judson thought would save people time and sore backs fastening their shoes with one hand .
Later , in 1913 , Gideon Sundback of Sweden developed the predecessor of today 's zipper that used metal teeth , and patented it in 1917 .
Sundback 's design was the first design that saw practical use .
Sundback 's " separable fastener " had more fasteners per inch than the earlier clasp locker .
Later , the B.F. Goodrich Co. used the separable fastener in some rubber boots and came up with the name " zipper " because the boots could be fastened with one hand .
Today , zippers are also made of plastic as well .

Founded in Japan in 1934 , YKK was called Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha , but 60 years later the company changed its company name to match its brand name .
The privately held YKK Co. is headquartered in Japan and is made up of 80 companies at 206 facilities in 52 countries .
YKK makes the entire zipper including the dyed cloth and the brass used to make the zipper .
YKK zippers are found in :
Clothing
Furniture
Automobiles
Luggage
Sports equipment
A YKK factory site in Macon , Ga. , produces 7 million zippers a day , in a total of 1,500 styles in more than 427 standard colors .
It 's the largest zipper factory in the world .
The Macon site produces its own brass to make the teeth and slider parts of a zipper .
The same factory also produces and dyes the yarn that is woven into the fabric portion of a zipper .
And YKK also produces the machines that make the zippers !
YKK has leveraged its knowledge of working with metals to form an aluminum building products division that now accounts for two - thirds of YKK 's worldwide sales .
HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER AUTISM AT A GLANCE AUTISM AT A GLANCE Autism is an umbrella name for a family of disorders that begin in childhood , last a lifetime and disrupt a person 's social and communication skills .
Prevalence
• 1 in 110 U.S. children is diagnosed with autism .
Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism .
• 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have an autism spectrum disorder Diagnosis
• Less than a decade ago , the disease was diagnosed at age 3 or 4 .
Now it is routinely diagnosed at 2 .
• Symptoms range from mild to severe .
Many people with autism display rigid routines and repetitive behaviors .
Treatment
• There is no single treatment for children with autism .
Most respond best to structured behavioral programs .
Cost
• Lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism : $ 3.5 million to $ 5 million
• Annual U.S. cost : $ 90 billion Source : Autism Society of America and Autism Speaks AUTISM BEHAVIORS AUTISM BEHAVIORS
No single behavior is enough to diagnose autism , researchers say , but here are some signs to watch for at age 14 months : • Lack of gesturing , vocalizing and eye contact to initiate communication .
•
An inability to pick up cues from watching facial expressions .
If a parent is looking at a stuffed toy , a typical child will follow the parent 's gaze to the toy .
A child with autism often does n't do that .
• Unusual play patterns .
A typical child given a toy fork will pretend to eat with it .
A child with autism may repeatedly tap it on the table or pick it up and drop it .
•
Fewer words , gestures and sounds than typically developing children .

One in four U.S. parents believe some vaccines cause autism in healthy children , but even many of those worried about vaccine risks think their children should be vaccinated .
Most parents continue to follow the advice of their children 's doctors , according to a study based on a survey of 1,552 parents .
Extensive research has found no connection between autism and vaccines .
PSYCHIATRY : Proposed changes to autism diagnosis may reduce numbers VIDEO : Your Money : Autism laws and insurance U.S. STUDIES :
Show autism is more widespread , but why ?
" Nine out of 10 parents believe that vaccination is a good way to prevent diseases for their children , " said lead author Dr. Gary Freed of the University of Michigan .
" Luckily their concerns do n't outweigh their decision to get vaccines so their children can be protected from life - threatening illnesses . "
In 2008 , unvaccinated school - age children contributed to measles outbreaks in California , Illinois , Washington , Arizona and New York , said Dr. Melinda Wharton of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Thirteen percent of the 140 who got sick that year were hospitalized .
" It 's fortunate that everybody recovered , " Wharton said , noting that measles can be deadly .
" If we do n't vaccinate , these diseases will come back . "
Fear of a vaccine - autism connection stems from a flawed and speculative 1998 study that recently was retracted by a British medical journal .
The retraction came after a council that regulates Britain 's doctors ruled the study 's author acted dishonestly and unethically .
The new study is based on a University of Michigan survey of parents a year ago , long before the retraction of the 1998 study .
However , much has been written about research that has failed to find a link between vaccines and autism .
Mainstream advocacy groups like Autism Speaks strongly encourage parents to vaccinate their children .
" Now that it 's been shown to be an outright fraud , maybe it will convince more parents that this should not be a concern , " said Freed , whose study appears in the April issue of Pediatrics , released Monday .
Some doctors are taking a tough stand , asking vaccine - refusing parents to find other doctors and calling such parents " selfish . "
A statement from a group practice near Philadelphia outlines its doctors ' adamant support for government recommended vaccines and their belief that " vaccines do not cause autism or other developmental disabilities . "
" Furthermore , by not vaccinating your child you are taking selfish advantage of thousands of other who do vaccinate their children ...
We feel such an attitude to be self - centered and unacceptable , " the statement says , urging those who " absolutely refuse " vaccines to find another physician .
" We call it the manifesto , " said Dr. Bradley Dyer of All Star Pediatrics in Lionville , Pa. Dozens of doctors have asked to distribute the statement , Dyer said , and only a handful of parents have taken their children elsewhere .
" Parents have said , ' Thank you for saying that .
We feel much better about it , ' " Dyer said .
The new study is based on an online survey of parents with children 17 and younger .
It used a sample from a randomly selected pool of nationally representative participants .
Households were given Internet access if they did n't already have it to make sure families of all incomes were included .
Vaccines were n't mentioned in the survey invitation and vaccine questions were among others on unrelated topics .
Twenty - five % of the parents said they agreed " some vaccines cause autism in healthy children . "
Among mothers , 29 % agreed with that statement ; among fathers , it was 17 % .
Nearly 12 % of the parents said they 'd refused a vaccine for their children that a doctor recommended .
Of those , 56 % said they 'd refused the relatively new vaccine against human papillomavirus , or HPV , which can cause cervical cancer .
Others refused vaccines against meningococcal disease ( 32 % ) , chickenpox ( 32 % ) and measles - mumps - rubella ( 18 % ) .
Parents who refused the HPV vaccine , recommended for girls since 2006 , cited various reasons .
Parents who refused the MMR vaccine , the shot most feared for its spurious autism link , said they 'd read or heard about problems with it or felt its risks were too great .
The findings will help doctors craft better ways to talk with parents , said Dr. Gary S. Marshall of the University of Louisville School of Medicine and author of a vaccine handbook for doctors .
" For our children 's sake , we have to think like scientists , " said Marshall , who was not involved in the new study .
" We need to do a better job presenting the data so parents understand how scientists have reached this conclusion that vaccines do n't cause autism . "

The west 's proudest export to the Islamic world this past decade has been democracy .
That is , not real democracy , which is too complicated , but elections .
They have been exported at the point of a gun and a missile to Iraq and Afghanistan , to " nation - build " these states and hence " defeat terror " .
When apologists are challenged to show some good resulting from the shambles , they invariably reply : " It has given Iraqis and Afghans freedom to vote . "
As British electors don democratic finery and troop to the polls next month , elections in both war - torn countries are looking sick .
Last month 's poll in Iraq , blessed ( or cursed ) with a Westminster - style constitution , has failed to yield a coherent government .
It appeared to show the incumbent prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki , just beaten by his predecessor , Ayad Allawi .
If so , it would be a remarkable case of a developing world democracy actually ejecting a sitting leader .
In that respect , Iraq would be ahead of Britain , where the opposition must lead by at least 10 percentage points to be certain of power .
For the time being , Baghdad 's government has been in abeyance .
The Sunni militias , reportedly backed by al ‑ Qaida , have returned to the streets , and the death rate is again soaring .
Kurdistan is all but a separate country , and the odds are on the Sunnis being forced back into a semi-autonomous region .
Tens of thousands of Iraqis have died and millions been driven from their homes – including almost all Iraq 's ancient population of Christians .
The import of democracy has so far just inflamed local tension and fuelled fundamentalism .
Like precious porcelain , elections were exported without instructions on their care .
In the absence of adequate security , they are little more than tribal plebiscites .
At least in Iraq western troops are leaving the country to its fate .
The west 's guilt at the mayhem left behind will start to diminish with time .
People will blame George Bush and Tony Blair , leaving them , as they wish , to render their account not to the Iraqis but only to God .
In Afghanistan , a similar saga has been running for nine years , and is growing ever more tragic .
Last year saw the deaths of more Afghans ( 2,412 ) and more western troops ( 520 ) than since the 2001 invasion .
Nato is locked in a struggle to hold Helmand province for the government of the president , Hamid Karzai , against insurgents who can wait as long as they like to defeat the hated invaders .
Nato is only now seeking control , nine years on , of the country 's second city of Kandahar , in which the Taliban is dominant and the president 's brother , Ahmed Wali Karzai , is the power broker .
Karzai is said to have told local elders that there will be no assault on Kandahar " without their permission " .
If Nato can not negotiate a deal over the city , rather than reduce it to rubble , its mission is surely doomed .
The fact that Hamid Karzai was elected , by whatever dubious means , seems to infuriate western leaders .
Barack Obama , Gordon Brown and their respective foreign ministers rage and telephone and pay visits and expostulate .
The repetitive criticism hurled at Karzai for being corrupt and in the pocket of drug lords has become near comical , not least because of his eccentric response .
Last week he threatened privately to swear allegiance to the Taliban himself ( which might solve many problems ) .
The west is constantly telling Karzai to " clean up his act " or , as the New York Times harrumphs , " stop doing whatever he and his aides choose " .
This is not because there is any likelihood of his obeying , but to help make the domestic case for the war look less shaky .
As the joke in Kabul goes , as long as the west pretends to uphold his regime , Karzai must " pretend to be Swedish " .
He is America 's exhibit A for world democracy .
The idea that he might regard himself as the elected representative of the Afghan people , warts and all , with a future to consider and his neck on the line , is beyond consideration .
Democracy in both America and Britain is coming under scrutiny these days .
Quite apart from the antics of MPs and congressmen , it is said to be sliding towards oligarchy , with increasing overtones of autocracy .
Money and its power over technology are making elections unfair .
The military - industrial complex is as powerful as ever , having adopted " the menace of global terrorism " as its casus belli .
Lobbying and corruption are polluting the government process .
In a nutshell , democracy is not in good shape .
How strange to choose this moment to export it , least of all to countries that have never experienced it in their history .
The west not only exports the stuff , it does so with massive , thuggish violence , the antithesis of how self - government should mature in any polity .
The tortured justification in Iraq and Afghanistan is that elections will somehow sanctify a " war against terrorism " waged on someone else 's soil .
The resulting death and destruction have been appalling .
Never can an end , however noble , have so failed to justify the means of achieving it .
The high - minded attacks on corruption in Muslim states from London and Washington is futile .
In most countries corruption is the lubricant of power .
Nor is the west that clean .
Britain showered corruption on the Saudis to obtain arms contracts .
The activities of American firms in " rebuilding " Iraq were wholly corrupt .
In 2001 the British in Kabul – in the person of Clare Short no less – were put in charge of suppressing Afghan opium , fuel of most of that country 's corruption .
Britain allowed it to continue , when the Taliban had been in the process of stamping it out .
The Tories and Liberal Democrats are dishonest to say that the Afghan war is justified " provided " Karzai ends corruption , stops rigging elections , and trains his army and police .
None of this will happen , and is merely cover to avoid saying what these politicians know to be true – that British soldiers are dying for a dud hypothetical .
As Britons go the polls , they should challenge their candidates to justify what is being done in their name .
A system of government that they have spent two centuries evolving and still not perfected is being rammed down the throats of poor and insecure people , who are then hectored for not handling it properly .
Why should they ?
The invasions of their countries was not their choice .
They did not ask to be a model for Britain 's moral exhibitionism .
They did not plead for their villages to be target practice for western special forces .
Karzai is told he will lose Nato protection if he continues to associate with drug dealers and warlords – many of whom appear to be his relatives .
He knows – as we know – that this is bluff .
There can be no counter - insurgency without a client regime .
Obama and Brown need him as much as he needs them .
Amid this bluff the only certainty for Karzai is that , one day , Nato will get fed up and leave him to his fate , as it is now leaving Maliki in Baghdad .
If he wants to live , he must make his peace with Afghans , not Americans , and that means on Afghan terms .
Free and fair elections and a stop to corruption will have no part to play in that survival game .
Democracy has been greatly oversold .
The sign apparently garnered enough complains that the local news station , WBMG - CBS 42 , broadcast an interview with Chuck Biddinger , the store 's owner ( I 'm hunting links for the interview at this moment , and I 'll post it if I find it , as I 'd kind of like to hear how he explains himself ) .
The store is something of a fixture in the area partially because of this marquee sign , which often posts silly or unusual jokes .
I feel a little uneasy posting this here because I know Biddinger IRL ; he also hosts a forum for the local community , where I used to post until the commentary became so overwhelmingly verbally abusive and intolerant that I 've all but withdrawn from the conversation .
My objectivity in this case is n't so hot , to say the least .
While in my personal experience with this guy I 've witnessed him saying a lot of sexist horsecrap in the relative privacy of the internet , this is the first time I know that he 's used his marquee to publicly display his ass - haberdashery .
I 'm trying to get over my rage in order to think of a constructive lead - in to a discussion .
This is not a small town , and this man is an established businessman .
How deeply entrenched is sexism in this environment when this sign can be displayed without serious consideration for how it 's going to affect one 's business ?
How blatant is the disregard when one can make the assumption that the people who are going to get offended by such a sign are business one does n't want anyway ?
Due to Jerry Coyne , I encountered an interview in the Guardian with Colin Blakemore : “ Colin Blakemore :
How the human brain got bigger by accident and not through evolution . ”
The headline is a misnomer , as Blakemore is not denying evolution , he is denying selection .
But Blakemore ’s argument is based completely on a false presentation of the facts .
Consider :
The question is : why is it so big compared to the brains of our predecessors , such as Homo erectus ?
Until 200,000 years ago , there had been a gradual increase in brain size among hominins , starting three million years ago .
Then , abruptly , there was a remarkable increase of about 30 % or so .
That ’s Blakemore .
Now , here ’s a chart of endocranial volumes of Pleistocene human fossils :
As you can see , there ’s no sudden jump 200,000 years ago , or at any other time .
The data , such as they are , are consistent with a single pattern of increase over time , as pointed out by Sang - Hee Lee and Milford Wolpoff ( 2003 ) .
Heck , it ’s the lack of a sudden jump that has gotten all the attention .
Because if “ modern ” humans suddenly showed up in Africa 200,000 years ago , and all of a sudden had vastly larger brains than any other hominins , would n’t that be a simple and tidy story ?
Do n’t you think we ’d all be talking about the sudden origin of modern humans as reflected by their larger brains ?
It just did n’t happen .
Well , it ’s one thing to be empirically wrong .
That ’s a simple error that ’s easily corrected .
But Blakemore , relying on the erroneous assumption of a single shift in brain size , asserts that neutral macromutations must be an important mode of human brain evolution :
Genetic studies suggest every living human can be traced back to a single woman called " Mitochondrial Eve " who lived about 200,000 years ago .
My suggestion is that the sudden expansion of the brain 200,000 years ago was a dramatic spontaneous mutation in the brain of Mitochondrial Eve or a relative which then spread through the species .
A change in a single gene would have been enough .
I hope that the empirical pattern is enough to convince you that this hypothesis is false .
The “ sudden increase ” simply did not happen .
But in case you need more persuasion :
Blakemore here assumes that the increase in brain size had no negative consequences .
Otherwise it could n’t proceed neutrally .
Here is his argument :
The environment of early humans was so clement and rich in resources that this greedy new brain , which would have absorbed even more of the body 's energy , could be sustained without danger .
Later , when times got hard , during droughts or climate changes , it helped us deal with these crises , which could otherwise have killed us off , by dreaming up novel ideas to problems .
You see the outline : Life was easy , and humans could grow fat - brained , like so many sheep .
Fortunately , our fat brains were then useful when times were tough .
Blakemore describes this as somehow different from the idea that brains were adaptive – it ’s in fact just another adaptive story for larger brains .
But it falls apart , when we consider that assumption – life was easy .
I put it to my students this way : Suppose you lay a lot of sugar beets out on your land .
What will happen to the deer population ?
The answer is not that the deer will grow fat - brained and later evolve to conquer humanity .
The answer is that there will be a lot more deer .
Population growth is much faster than adaptation , and it ’s hundreds of times faster than a neutral gene can transit through the population .
Humans in the past were not a static population , living in peace with an abundant environment .
They were repeated faced with Malthusian crises – on submillennial timescales .
That ’s why a close understanding of climate variability is so relevant to our evolution .
The fact that tools and behaviors change so slowly in the Middle Pleistocene is informative – it shows that humans were n’t coming up with dramatically new ways to track shifting ecologies .
And that means that the selection pressures of the energetic and life history constraints on the brain were repeatedly imposed on human populations .
A substantial increase in brain size should have immediately been disadvantageous – if it had no compensatory benefits to fitness .
What remains is testing the hypotheses about those benefits to fitness .
Blakemore actually is presenting one such hypothesis – that a larger brain mostly was adaptive because of its ability to transmit traditions .
That ’s testable , and is consistent with the greater transfer of information apparent in recent archaeological traditions compared to Middle Pleistocene ones .
But there are other hypotheses as well , and it is quite difficult to compare them with the available record .
That ’s why it ’s so important to state the empirical record accurately .
UPDATE ( 2010-03-29 ) : A reader points out that Malthusian crises , in terms of resource or food availability , may have been avoided by warfare or predation – people kill each other instead of starving .
I see that point , particularly where we consider the way that epidemic disease can relax competition for food until population growth resumes .
Performing well under predation or competition would be one way that brain size might have had compensatory benefits to fitness beyond its energetic and life history costs .

The Liberal government has shot down an opposition motion to place an immediate moratorium on wind turbines until their health effects are further studied .
Nearly 250 people descended on Queen ’s Park Wednesday to protest the presence of the turbines near residential areas .
They claim the turbines cause low - frequency noise and have sickened nearly 106 Ontario residents , causing a variety of health ailments ranging from hypertension to sleeplessness and nosebleeds in children .
People are suffering and their concerns are being dismissed , Dr. Robert McMurtry told the protesters .
“ I see their lack of energy and things they are feeling , ” the London - area surgeon said .
“ But the thing I ca n’t tolerate … is the steadfast denial of the complaints . ”
The Progressive Conservatives brought forward a motion Wednesday afternoon calling for an immediate moratorium on the turbines until health studies are completed .
The motion was defeated by the majority Liberals .
A moratorium is unnecessary , Premier Dalton McGuinty said .
“ Wind turbines have been up and running for decades in dozens , if not hundreds , of jurisdictions , ” he told reporters .
“ We are relatively late coming to electricity generation by means of wind power . ”
Ontario has some of the most rigorous standards in North America in terms of wind power and the province is funding a university research chair to study the long - term effects of the turbines , he added .
The world needs to figure out new ways of generating clean energy , the premier said .
“ There are no real easy decisions in all this .
We ’ve decided it would be a good thing to get rid of coal .
It makes our kids sick and contributes to global warming , ” he said .
During Question Period , PC MPP Joyce Savoline ( Burlington ) asked the premier why people are blocked from having a say in the placement of industrial wind farms , but are allowed to voice opinions on where shopping malls are built .
“ Why does the premier think Dalton knows best when it comes to putting large industrial wind turbines in place ? ” she asked .
Energy Minister Brad Duguid said there is “ plenty of room for consultation ” on the projects and that municipalities are involved in the decision making .
On the front steps of the Legislature , protesters accused the Liberals of fast - tracking renewable energy projects in the name of the Green Energy Act – legislation passed last May to bolster the green economy .
They say the province has bypassed planning powers of municipalities .
“ There appears to be significant scientific uncertainty of how close you can have industrial turbines to where people live , ” said Eric Gillespie , an environmental lawyer .
He is representing Ian Hanna , a citizen whose application for judicial review of the Green Energy Act as it applies to wind turbines will be heard in September .
Currently , the turbines must be set back 550 metres from homes but Gillespie said to be safe it should be nearly 2 km .
“ If you are going to have industrial turbines , you need to cite them in locations you can say with some degree of certainty , are safe . ”
U.S. approves first off - shore wind farm
BOSTON — The Obama administration has approved what would be the United States ’ first offshore wind farm , off Cape Cod , inching the U.S. closer to harvesting an untapped domestic energy source — the steady breezes blowing along its vast coasts .
U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced his decision Wednesday in Boston , clearing the way for a 130 - turbine wind farm in Nantucket Sound on the East Coast .
Cape Wind was in its ninth year of federal review , and Salazar stepped in early this year to bring what he called much - needed resolution to the bitterly contested proposal .

According to blogs in the legal academy , women did not fare well this year in the law school lateral hire market , with the majority of lateral moves being made by men .
Further , Supreme Court clerkships are weighty credentials among academics and aspiring academics , yet it appears that neither Justice Scalia nor Justice Kennedy hired a female law clerk this past hiring season .
Why is this ?
The reality is that the people doing the hiring – the Supreme Court Justices and hiring committees at law schools – are people who are well - schooled in the value of diversity and are people who recognize that it is unlawful to discriminate on the basis of gender , so I am at a loss to understand why hiring in the lateral market and hiring by Supreme Court justices does not work out well for women .
Maybe someday Larry Summers will opine on this issue .
( The argument that women are not willing to move to D.C. to clerk or for prestigious lateral moves does not hold weight .
As the former chair of the AALS Section on Women in Legal Education , I personally know many women who would have moved if asked , and the reality is that women who make it through top law schools with top grades and honors such that they are credible candidates for S.Ct.
clerkships or law school hiring tend to be women who are willing to sacrifice to some degree personally to bolster a career . )

Part 5 - Hydraulics Modeling .
Matching known downhole well information with surface flow characteristics of a blowout via computer allows selection of the most efficient kill method
Paul Smestad and Ole B. Rygg , Hydraulics Specialists , Well Flow Dynamics , Sandvika , Norway
John W. Wright , Blowout Advisor , John Wright Co. , Houston
All well control design functions depend on construction of an accurate computer hydraulics model of the blowout at hand .
Such a model incorporates all available downhole data on characteristics of the reservoir , well effluent , pressure , temperature etc. , and factors influencing the surface flowpath of the blow .
In turn , the hydraulics data allows development of a blowout model and , finally , a workable well kill model that will indicate the most efficient kill / control method to use .
The first step in blowout control is to survey and assess the situation .
For complicated blowouts , this may be difficult and a poor survey may result in mobilization of excess or incorrect equipment and other resources .
On some projects , relief wells are started only after much time is spent on techniques that failed .
A suspect contributor to such failures is lack of a good survey that prevents definition of an optimum control plan .
Proper hydraulic modeling matches known downhole well data to a description of the flowpath , identifying possible interpretations and eliminating those that cannot exist .
Need for further data collection will also be indicated .
Usually , more data is available than is immediately obvious .
Portable computers now can handle complicated simulators , besides being used for presentations and plots of collected data .
Hydraulics evaluations thus can be produced and analyzed onsite .
Even if data is limited , this exercise is useful since it can only improve understanding of the problem .
For blowouts to surface , reasonable estimates of flowrate and type of liquid can be made by measuring size , height , width , color etc. of the fire .
Exit conditions are indicated by direct observation of the wellhead area or via ROVs or minor excavation .
Comparing well mechanical conditions with an estimate of formation productivity even allows simulation of wildcat blowouts .
If more data can be gathered ( pressure or temperature of flowing fluids , etc. ) scenarios can be further narrowed .
Steady state conditions exist for blowout simulations and vertical flow models used in production engineering may be used for modeling .
For gas wells flowing high rates of condensate , oil wells with high GOR , or high water flows , it is important to use PVT and two - phase flow correlations .
Models also must be able to handle changes in flowpath , flow regimes and friction correlations .
Often , engineers familiar with the area where the blowout occurs can be used to manipulate the model .
For complex projects , blowout specialists supplying special hydraulics models and simulators may be called on .
Blowout modeling can provide surprisingly accurate results .
In producing fields , good data may be available and kill operations can be planned with confidence .
On underground blowouts , annulus and pipe pressures , temperatures , downhole flow measurements etc. may be obtainable .
These parameters then can be matched in a simulation , improving the well kill operation .
Blowout simulations provide a range of possible kill simulations and resource planning .
Better definition of blowout rates also help in defining pollution containment needs and possible diverter design for sales or flaring .
The main questions to be answered by well kill modeling are :
Can the well be killed ?
What size equipment and capacities , and volumes of bulk material are needed ?
These can then be evaluated in terms of :
Logistics and mobilization times
Cost efficiency of alternative methods
Safety and risk analysis .
As a method is chosen and developed , detailed engineering can provide :
Pumping schedules ( rate , time , power )
Kill fluid types and volumes
Pressure and temperature predictions
Monitoring program .
Hydraulics kill simulations are applicable to all blowouts .
To describe the modeling procedure , dynamic kill modeling as applied to a relief well kill , or top kill through tubing or snubbing pipe , will be discussed .
Theoretical aspects of dynamic kills have been covered in writings by Blount and Soeiinahl , and others .
They describe dynamic kill as a technique using flowing frictional pressure drop to supplement static pressure of the kill fluid being pumped up the annulus of the blowing well .
Water is often used in dynamic kills and is a good choice as an initial kill fluid if reservoir pressure is not far above hydrostatic .
Water also is well adapted for evaluating communication and kill effectiveness , or while waiting on mud supplies .
Known proper ties make it easy to model and predict behavior of a kill operation .
Dynamic kill principles are applicable to both heavy and lighter fluids .
The modeling process can be split into two phases :
Establishing kill rates for different fluids , and maximum pressure and power requirements Defining an operational kill plan and schedule .
Establishing maximum rates , etc. , can be done with steady state calculations .
But dynamic ( time based ) calculations are needed to obtain kill volumes .
Manually stepping a steady state simulator may also provide volumes .
But they may not be accurate enough when required mud or specialty fluid volumes become large and logistics more critical .
When fluid weights and rates are determined , and allowances made for losses , a dynamic kill can be simulated based on equipment limitations ( maximum pump rate , pressure and power ) and pressure monitoring .
Often , it is necessary to also compute pressure downhole to prevent exceeding fracture pressure , tubular burst pressures , etc .
Results can be presented as tables or plots showing flow and pump rates , pressures etc. vs. time or cumulative volume , as best suited for a particular kill .
Fig. 9 shows pump rate and cumulative volume vs. time for an off - bottom intersection of a gas blowout with a relief well .
Plots with different scenarios / options then can be used to monitor kill effectiveness and losses .
Together with monitoring of BHP when possible , plots can also be used to pick the correct model when uncertainties exist .
2
Modeling results of blowout scenarios should be available as hard copies before the kill operation .
Time seldom allows updating simulations during a kill , but comparing displays of collected data against models may be useful .
All data such as pressures and rates should be collected on disk during kill operations for later analysis .
At times more than one kill attempt may be needed due to uncertainties downhole and analysis of prior kill attempts may be required for success .

Fig. 10 .
Predicted vs actual pressures during a dynamic kill down tubing of an underground blowout from a high pressure / temperature reservoir flowing through the tubing and three casing strings .
The model required for well control planning and operations will depend on circumstances and the stage of the operation .
Often , hand calculations or solving empirical equations via spread sheets or similar calculation methods may be sufficient , especially if correlated with experience from similar situations .
An overview of well pressures , flowing and static pressure gradients , and ratings of pipe and equipment may be all that is needed in the case of predictable operations such as cap ping production wells .
Equipment , supplies , people , etc. , available on site may be insufficient and mobilization of more resources may be necessary .
The ability to quickly assemble a logistical plan is important .
Hydraulics modeling will define equipment needs by setting upper and lower limits on kill rates , pressures and volumes .
Often a well kill is described in terms of its main contributing element ( dynamic kill , bullheading , volumetric kill , momentum kill , plugging , etc. ) .
Calculations then can be made using a model or equations designed for the particular purpose .
Results can be used to obtain densities , rates , pressures , volumes , etc. needed to regain static control of the well .
For example , maximum pressure transients to be expected when shutting in a well at surface will be the fluid gradient back to reservoir pressure .
A PVT calculation with reservoir inflow modeling provides an upper limit to the answer .
Such calculations can be performed by a reservoir engineer familiar with the area using software in daily use .
This can be improved by dynamic calculations of pressures using a reservoir model with wellbore storage considerations , superimposing whatever fluid is pumped into the well etc .
Estimating an upper limit for the required rate for dynamic kill calculations can be made using published formulas or spreadsheet calculations for steady state flow , particularly if water is the kill fluid .
As complexity or accuracy requirements increase , completeness of the modeling process becomes more critical .
Modeling requirements also become more demanding when equipment and supplies will not fit in space available , as offshore , or if more pumps or more fluid are needed than available , or if pressure ratings at surface or down hole are exceeded temporarily .
It may then be necessary to tune weight , viscosity , pumping pressure etc. against each other and against time , indicating a dedicated dynamic well kill model will be required .
This model should include all physical processes included in the control operation , such as fluid properties , friction , flow characteristics , interaction with changes in reservoir inflow behavior , etc.
Dynamic means time - based , so pressure , flow and pump rate characteristics can change vs. time .
Importance of time - based models or simulators becomes obvious when considering , for example , buildup behavior when shutting in a well .
For most reservoirs , BHP will be sharply drawn down during a blowout .
And the initial buildup period can be used to pump kill fluid more efficiently than after pressure has increased .
This effect will be the same in any kill operation .
Similarly , physical processes involved ( friction , momentum , weight , etc. ) all contribute to the kill process , so that kill requirements will be lower if all effects are considered together rather than one at a time .
Even the most sophisticated model will not work if input parameters are incorrect , or if the wrong options are chosen in actual calculations .
Experience in such work is required , as well as a good quality control system including verification by engineers from several disciplines .
All models have limitations because experimental data may not exist to verify them for extreme conditions .
Examples of modeling discrepancies are pressure losses for high rates through tubulars of non-Newtonian fluids such as muds .
Models exist for these conditions , but they may not be applicable over the range found in well kill operations .
Published equations taken out of context can end up being used outside of their applicable range if proper care is not exercised .
Fig. 11 . Flowpath scenario in blowout was derived from production logging after a long , unsuccessful snubbing job .
Relief well kill requirements were determined based on dynamic kill modeling and good match was made between predicted , actual kill rate used .
Traditional use of well hydraulic modeling is in the area of production well design and optimization , where accurate reservoir , fluid , pressure , temperature and flow characteristics are available .
One might assume that modeling is difficult for a wildcat blowout , where minimal data is available .
But even limited data may provide enough information to start defining equipment requirements .
Useful pressure and temperature data in this context can be obtained if access to the wellhead is available .
Then , blowout flowpath and rates can be determined .
For example , fluid flowing up tubing or drill pipe in a blowing well will have a different temperature from fluid flowing up the annulus for a given surface rate and pressure .
If fluid composition can be determined , an accurate analysis can be made , especially for light fluids .
Reservoir pressure is an important parameter in these calculations , especially in wildcat blowouts .
However , mudlog data can be used to analyze inflow behavior , pressure , depth and type of fluid .
Kicks that develop into blowouts often occur when work is focused on other operations such as workovers , etc .
A pressure buildup that has gone unnoticed for some time may be reported as instantaneous , even though pit level , circulation rate and pressure data show it occurred over several minutes or hours .
That results in a different inflow evaluation with corresponding decreases in required kill rates .
Pressure , temperature and other production logging techniques provide data useful for modeling underground blowouts .
3 Fig. 11 shows a flow path scenario derived from production logging after a prolonged snubbing effort , and mechanical data .
Coupled with dynamic kill modeling , relief well kill requirements were determined and a good match was made between predicted and actual kill rates .
Two categories of blowout contingency plans require hydraulic analysis :
Well design , especially with respect to casing programs Contingency planning for blowout control .
Basic well design is adequately covered in the literature .
Special applications may require kick analysis and evaluation of killing an under ground flow from the rig .
3
This assessment is becoming more critical as operators try to cut costs by eliminating a casing string .
Blowout contingency planning is needed for critical wells and structures such as offshore platforms to check on feasibility of killing wells and resources needed , especially for remote areas .
Well design may also be affected when drilling program changes reduce risk of a kick developing into a blowout .
Post analysis of kick handling is important to see if transient dynamic pressures or forces temporarily exceeded pipe pressure ratings or shoe strengths , in spite of static calculations indicating system integrity .
This analysis can also help in determining if data used in the initial analysis was correctly interpreted .
Underground blowouts .
The underground blowout is among the most common and the most difficult to detect and kill .
The next article presents the issues and methods employed in underground blowout detection and control .

Bill Clinton praises Lincoln , claims unions trying to manipulate voters to ‘ terrify ' Dems
So , when I see headlines such as the one above , it reminds me of all of the flaws of the sellout / DLC sponsored / triangulating ways of Bill Clinton .
Clinton sold out the working classes while president with his multiple trade deals which , in effect , left workers in a weaker position .
For the poor , Clinton signed off on welfare reform , in spite of the many flaws of the legislation , and unadressed problems of welfare - to - work programs .
The Clinton years may have been years of economic growth , but at a hidden cost of unadressed wealth and income inequality , a trend to grow much worse under George W. Bush , a president who no longer pretended not to be representing the interests of plutocrats and corporate elites .
So , when I read such clueless quotes , and on behalf of arguably one of the two worst , most corporatist , Democratic Senators ( along with Ben Nelson ) as this ,
Reading from a Washington
Post article that quoted a national labor union leader saying that forcing Lincoln to " fight this kind of fight " might make other senators " think twice about it , " Clinton said that national labor unions had decided to make Lincoln " the poster child for what happens when a Democrat crosses them . "
" In other words , this is about using you and manipulating your votes to terrify members of Congress and members of the Senate from other states , " Clinton told the crowd .
" Now if you want to be used that way , have at it . "
The 42nd president continued to rip labor unions , which have largely supported him in the past .
" They admit here , they do n’t necessarily favor her opponent .
They want to make her a poster child .
They want you to be something besides a voter for your children and your community and your future .
They want you to help them make a poster , " Clinton said .
" If you want to do that , go back to grade school , " he added .
" If you want to be Arkansas ’ advocate , vote for somebody who will fight for you .
Vote for Blanche Lincoln , " he added .
Clinton summed up the tough tactics from unions as " Washington games . "
I get thoroughly disgusted .
Clinton here helps to spread the Republican meme of " corrupt , moblike , threatening " unions ( when the fact of the matter is that unions are not nearly as powerful as they once were , given the nature of active opposition to them by conservative business interests , ( who would like to abolish unions , and perhaps return us to the era of slave labor ) ) .
And to think , I voted for Clinton twice and volunteered for his campaign in 1992 .
I also spent countless hours defending him against the ludicrous impeachment charges by a witchhunting GOP ; truth be told , by acting like an egotistical douchebag intoxicated by power , he handed ammunition to his political enemies , which then required a whole lot of effort and energy by progressives to rally to his defense .
I 'm a member of the American Federation of Teachers , and a proud union member .
I am done with Bill Clinton .
I 'll give no money to his foundations or causes .
I 'll stop arguing on behalf of his merits as president .
I will not support candidates that he endorses , unless they are true progressives who fully support workers .
And I will support those who work to dismantle the DLC .
ZAZI PLOT DETAILS EMERGE ….
For all the talk about Abdulmutallab ’s unsuccessful terrorist plot on Christmas , I continue to think the Najibullah Zazi case is an under - appreciated victory for the United States .
A deadly attack was thwarted ; intelligence was collected ; and justice was served .
No torture , no military commissions , no need to stray from the legal process .
The legal system was followed to the letter , and it not only worked beautifully , it saved a lot of lives .
We learned more about the Zazi plot this week , and the details are chilling , to put it mildly .
Zazi and his two Queens friends allegedly planned to strap explosives to their bodies and split up , heading for the Grand Central and Times Square stations — the two busiest subway stations in New York City .
They would board trains on the 1 , 2 , 3 and 6 lines at rush hour and planned to position themselves in the middle of the packed trains to ensure the maximum carnage when they blew themselves up , sources said .
During Zazi ’s brief visit to Queens from his home in Denver last September , he rode the subway multiple times to the Grand Central and Wall St. stations , scouting where to best spread death and mayhem , the sources said . [ … ]
The attack was to take place on Sept. 14 , 15 or 16 – as soon as the bombs had been assembled – with Sept. 14 the most likely date , sources said .
A fourth man , who helped plan this intended attack , has been quietly arrested in Pakistan , following Zazi ’s cooperation with authorities .
I realize conservatives do n’t want to talk about this story , which is probably why major media outlets are n’t paying much attention to it .
But that ’s a shame because when it comes to counter - terrorism , this is a big f’in deal .
Here we had a serious terrorist threat — arguably the most important since 9/11 — and an al Qaeda recruit who was poised to kill a lot of people .
Obama administration officials thwarted Zazi ’s plan , took him into custody , read him his rights , and gave him a lawyer .
And the results could n’t have been better for the United States .
Zazi will spend the rest of his life behind bars , but only after cooperating with federal officials and becoming a valuable source of intelligence .
If Republicans really want to debate the efficacy of Obama ’s counter - terrorism policies , we can start right here .

In a move that may end up drastically scaling back what Facebook had hoped last month would be a redefinition of the Web itself , the social service will soon begin rolling out simplified privacy controls , according to a blog post today from CEO Mark Zuckerberg .
The new controls may make it easier for Facebook users to limit the extent to which the system shares their personal information with others , especially including other Web sites .
Continuing to deflect criticism , the CEO said that Facebook had always offered a multiplicity of privacy controls , but " if you find them too hard to use then you wo n't feel like you have control .
Unless you feel in control , then you wo n't be comfortable sharing and our service will be less useful for you .
We agree we need to improve this .
" We 've reduced the amount of basic information that must be visible to everyone and we are removing the connections privacy model , " Zuckerberg announced .
" Now we 'll be giving you the ability to control who can see your friends and pages .
These fields will no longer have to be public . "

Although Zuckerberg describes the new privacy control as a " single " switch , an examination of the screen shot he provided for the new controls reveals that one of the settings causing users the most headaches appears to be compartmentalized behind a subheading , " Applications and Websites . "
As Facebook originally planned for its Open Graph API -- a.k.a. , " Like " -- other Web sites can share information about content that their users have " favorited , " or voted up , with Facebook .
That way , Facebook can assemble new links to its own content that has the same or similar subject matter .
But that system would require an implied open sharing status between Facebook and those other sites , one which many users might not readily trust if its presence were plainly explained to them .
A check of Facebook 's updated privacy page does show , however , that the service did make one switch out of several :
If a user turns off Facebook 's ability to receive shared " Like " data from other Web sites , she also shuts off her ability to use Facebook applications .
( No more lunchtime harvesting , in other words . )
This process is referred to by Facebook as " turning off platform . "
As an alternative , the user may opt to turn off individual applications ' and Web sites ' access to Facebook data on a per-app basis , which is the more " granular " option that already existed , and that Zuckerberg said he had thought users would have preferred .
The new Applications and Websites panel , reads the new privacy page , " controls what information is shared with websites and applications , including search engines ( applications and websites you and your friends use already have access to your name , profile picture , gender , networks , friend list , user ID , and any other information you share with everyone ) .
You can view your applications , remove any you do n't want to use , or turn off platform completely .
Turning off platform means you wo n't be able to use any platform applications or websites and we wo n't share your information with them . "
Users will still see " recommended " privacy settings , however , which may still guide novice users into making relaxed , less stringent choices -- a fact which may not extract Facebook from the hot water it finds itself in today .
In an op - ed piece for the Washington Post last weekend , Zuckerberg showed reluctant acceptance for the notion that some people simply must have their privacy , even if they 're joining a social network .
Today , he went a step further , literally but politely telling users that this is the last privacy upgrade they 'll be getting for a long while , so they 'd better be happy with this one .
" Finally and perhaps most importantly , I am pleased to say that with these changes the overhaul of Facebook 's privacy model is complete .
If you find these changes helpful , then we plan to keep this privacy framework for a long time .
That means you wo n't need to worry about changes , " the CEO wrote .
And if you had any doubt that he was biting his tongue a bit when he wrote that , he then added , " ( Believe me , we 're probably happier about this than you are . ) "
At the time of this writing , the new privacy settings were not yet made available to those Facebook accounts to which we have access .
Forty - nine percent of likely Iowa voters said they would reelect the veteran GOP senator , compared to 40 percent who said they would support Roxanne Conlin , a Democratic attorney running against the senator .
Eleven percent of Iowans said they were undecided in such a match - up .
Grassley has won reelection with 66 percent of the vote or more in each of his bids since first being elected in 1980 with almost 54 percent of the vote .
The poll puts Grassley beneath the 50 percent threshold that is considered healthy for incumbents running for reelection , though Grassley 's favorable rating is somewhat higher : 58 percent of Iowans say they have a favorable view of the five - term senator , while 37 percent have an unfavorable impression .
During his almost three decades in the Senate , Grassley has risen to become the top Republican on a number of committees , serving currently as ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee , on which he spearheaded negotiations toward a bipartisan solution on healthcare .
But while some of Grassley 's Senate GOP colleagues have faced an uprising in their Republican base back at home , 85 percent of Iowa Republicans say they 'd support the incumbent senator over Conlin .
The Iowa Poll , conducted by Research 2000 from May 3 - 5 , has a 4 percent margin of error .

A promising and skilled scoring forward who had originally committed to play for Maine in the NCAA , Austin Watson changed his mind and went the Major Junior route after being drafted by the Windsor Spitfires of the OHL .
Stuck behind guys like Dale Mitchell , Greg Nemisz , and Justin Shugg on the Spits ' depth chart , Watson changed his game to become one of the best defensive forwards and shot blockers in the OHL , playing an important role in their run to the 2009 Memorial Cup .
Stuck in the bottom six , he welcomed a chance to be traded to Peterborough for Zack Kassian , where he would get a chance to prove himself with a bigger role on the team .
Though an ankle injury in the CHL top prospects game caused him to miss much of the second half of the season , he returned to the Petes in time for the playoffs , scoring two goals in their first round exit , then followed it up by joining Team USA in the U18 World Championships and playing a big part in the defeats of both Team Canada and Team Sweden on their way to a gold medal , raising his draft stock considerably .
2009 - 2010 Regular Season Stats *
GP G A PTS +/- PIM 52 20 34 54 16 22
( 42 GP played w/ Windsor , 10 GP w/ Peterborough )
Scouting Report : ( Bruins 2010 Draft Watch )
Watson is a decent skater with good hands and offensive ability , but has shown himself to be a well - rounded player in the OHL who can play effectively on special teams .
A solid citizen , he is coachable and puts the team first .
He got a rousing ovation from the Windsor faithful when he was introduced at the top prospects game , even though he was already a member of the rival Petes .
Fans are usually a pretty good indicator of a player 's worth ; when someone ceases to wear the colors and hooks on with someone else , it 's saying something when they embrace the former player like the Spitfires fans did for Watson .
Why He'd Be A Good Fit In Columbus :
Did you ever hear the story about the grasshopper and the ant when you were a little kid ?
The complaint of the grasshopper about the ant was , " All he ever does is work ! "
That 's what I keep thinking about when I look at Watson .
He 's got good hands , but not exceptional .
He 's got good skating ability , but he wo n't make a move and disappear on the defense .
He can't blow you up and take you out of the play with his body .
But he works , and works , and works , and works .
He 's not afraid to block shots , he 's not afraid to get into a scrap , he 's willing to pay the price to make a play and he 'll go like hell when you give him an opportunity - in those 10 games after coming back from his broken ankle , he racked up 20 points !
Several of the scouting reports on Watson compare him to Jordan Staal , and I think that 's a fair comparison .
Should Watson drop back into the second round , or the Jackets choose to move back in the first round as part of a draft day deal , I would n't sleep on this kid .
Watson In Action :
Salary of members of the United States Congress : $ 174,000 .
Average annual Civil Service Retirement System benefits for retired members as of 2007 : $ 63,696 .
But the profits they can make by trading on inside information ?
Priceless .
Ever since we discovered Goldman Sachs ' marketing so - bad - they 'll - probably - fail investments , investors have wondered whether certain players in the stock market are playing by the same rules as the rest of us .
Leading the criticism of lapses in disclosure this year are , of course , our honorable people in Congress :
They of the feigned outrage and pithy sound bites .
But could it be that some of these politicians are just as guilty of engaging in financial shenanigans as the bankers they love to castigate ?
It could be .
And in fact , it is .

Now , no one 's ever accused the U.S. Congress of being pure as the driven snow .
But every year when spring rolls around and the weather starts to warm , an especially putrid scent begins to waft down from Capitol Hill .
It 's the odor of malfeasance .
And its source just might be your friendly neighborhood congressman .
Here 's how the story unfolds :
The U.S. stock market is designed to offer a level playing field , right ?
Everyone 's free to buy and sell as they like , and ever since Regulation FD passed nearly a decade ago , everyone 's supposed to do their trading based on the same information .
The problem is that " everyone " apparently does n't include members of Congress .
You may be surprised to learn this , but the laws forbidding trading on insider information -- the ones Congress passed to keep the rest of us on the straight and narrow -- generally do not apply to Congress itself .
That means that lawmakers can generally trade on information they obtain by virtue of their status as guardians of the republic .
They just have to report their holdings once a year .
And what do these reports tell us , you ask ?
As The Wall Street Journal discovered , they show some of our elected representatives :
Shorting U.S. Treasuries -- through buying the ProShares UltraShort 20 +
Year Treasury exchange - traded fund ( NYSE : TBT ) -- at the very time they were bailing out AIG , adding tens of billions of dollars to the federal debt , and weakening our national balance sheet in the process .
exchange - traded fund -- at the very time they were bailing out , adding tens of billions of dollars to the federal debt , and weakening our national balance sheet in the process .
Shorting the housing market , as one congressional spouse reported buying puts on homebuilders such as Beazer and Hovnanian on at least 34 separate occasions in 2008 , betting the stocks would fall .
and on at least 34 separate occasions in 2008 , betting the stocks would fall .
Shorting the whole dang stock market , by purchasing ProShares UltraShort QQQ ( NYSE : QID ) -- an ETF designed to give you 2 % gains for every 1 % the Nasdaq declines .
Worst of all , to this Fool 's eye , was congressional cynicism in the face of financial catastrophe .
As TARP and other bank bailouts wended their way through Congress , the very people shaping the bills bet on their effect as they traded tens of thousands of dollars worth of stock in Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) , Citigroup ( NYSE : C ) , Bank of America ( NYSE : BAC ) , and JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) , according to their own financial disclosure reports .
The more things stay the same , the more they stay the same
Shameful ?
Certainly .
But it 's also lucrative .
In 2004 , Professor Alan Ziobrowski of Georgia State University examined the performance of more than 6,000 separate trades by members of the U.S. Senate and their relatives .
His conclusion :
On average and over time , senators outperformed the overall market by about 12 percentage points annually .
Now , I certainly understand the temptation to profit from what you see happening in the future .
And because members of Congress have a clearer view than most of where things are going , perched up there on Capitol Hill , the temptation must be enormous .
But still , it 's sad to see our elected representatives succumbing to the temptation .
Politician , legislate thyself
Sadder still , it did n't have to be this way .
Four years ago , Representatives Brian Baird of Washington and Louise Slaughter of New York tried to pass a law that would change the rules , remove the temptation , and subject Congress to the same restraints it imposes on the rest of us .
The " Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act , " better known as the STOCK Act , would forbid lawmakers from trading on nonpublic information .
And just to be safe , when they did trade , they'd have to disclose trades publicly within 90 days of settlement .
The problem is that these ideas were n't particularly popular with the politicians ' peers .
Only 14 representatives signed on to the proposed legislation when it was introduced .
Four years later , this year 's version of the bill has attracted six signatures .
And support in the Senate ?
That would be precisely nil .
Titanic hypocrisy , and ...
Words fail me as I struggle to describe my outrage at learning these facts .
Titanic hypocrisy sounds too tame .
" A betrayal of public trust of truly epic proportions " barely scrapes the surface .
But however you choose to describe it , one thing is clear :
This must not stand .
A modest proposal
We 've said for years here at the Fool that investing in the stock market is the best way to build individual wealth .
I would not deny members of Congress that privilege , just because they choose to pursue public service for the modest sum of $ 174,000 per year plus pensions in perpetuity .
But even the STOCK
Act does n't go far enough .
Although most members of Congress balk at the modest requirement of disclosing their trades once per quarter , that does n't come close to what we should demand of them .
In my humble , Foolish view , members of Congress should take a page from what we do here at the Fool .
Rather than disclose their stock trades once per year , or even once per quarter , after the fact , they should do what our real - money portfolio services do : Announce their intent to trade beforehand .
Make it public .
Reveal their cards before playing them .
I think that 's financial disclosure that even Caesar 's wife could support .
Editor 's note : A previous version of this article said that the transactions related to homebuilders were put sales rather than put purchases .
The Fool regrets the error .
Last week , while describing what she thought her Baby - Sitters Club characters would be up to today , author Ann M. Martin admitted that she had no " strong feelings " about Mallory Pike .
Incensed as ever , Mallory Pike wrote in to respond .

Dear Ms. Martin ,
It has come to my attention that you recently admitted that you have no " strong feelings " about my future .
Well thank effing Christmas crackers , because you did n't do me any favors in the past !

For years I 've waited for the opportunity to give you a piece of my mind , but I had to go through a decade of intensive therapy before I could even get my mind together enough to figure out what I was going to say .
Do you have ANY idea what my childhood was like ?
Oh wait !
Of course you do !
YOU CREATED IT !
Let 's break this down a bit , shall we ?
In creating a life for me and my friends , you decided that you 'd let Claudia be the one who eats whatever the frig she wants and still stays beautiful , that Stacey would have diabetes , but still be super fashionable and cool , that Jessi would be both beautiful and supremely gifted as a dancer , that Kristy would be athletic and business - minded , that Mary Anne would be adorable and shy and loved by boys , that Dawn would be a hippie chick who could wear smocks and look cool simply because she was from California , and that I , Mallory Effing Pike , would be a frizzy Ginger with glasses and braces who bitched all of the time and literally had to share a house with like 900 red - headed step children .

ONE OF THESE KIDS IS DOING HER OWN THING !
ONE OF THESE KIDS GOT MAJORLY SCREWED !
I am convinced , Ann M. Martin , that you are anti-Ginger .
Who was the only other Ginger kid in the series ?
Jackie Rodowsky , the worst effing baby - sitting client in Stonybrook .
And now I come to find that you 've imagined great success and happiness for all of my fellow members , but have no " strong feelings " about me ?
Well I have some strong feelings for you , lady friend !
And they 're not good ones !
No they are n't !

If you must know , post - therapy , I turned my life around and am now the head of a Fortune 500 company called " Pike 's Tykes . "
Maybe you 've heard of it ?
We specialize in daycare for the multi-sibling family .
We have an exclusive contract with TLC alone , and are currently providing daycare services for shows like " I Have 94 Siblings " and " My 290 Red Headed Children . "
I 'm writing this note on a computer that 's encrusted with real diamonds .
Claudia and Stacey never made earrings out of those , now did they ?
No . I did n't think so .
Though this note may seem a bit harsh , I want you to know that I forgive you .
Being pushed around and written as a whiny , pathetic jerk during the formative years of my life forced me to face myself in ways I never thought I would .
I decided that I needed to be my own person , outside of the club , and to be more successful than everyone else , so I could rub it in their faces , which I have several times since the club disbanded .
Kristy called me a jackass last Christmas .
I said , " That 's President Mallory Jackass to you . "
She got so mad !

The point is that I do n't need your " strong feelings " anymore , Ann M. Martin .
I have feelings of my own .
Good feelings .
And you can't take them away from me .
However , if you could write a book that 's all about that gorgeous Ben Hobart coming back into my life and taking me to Sandals for a week , I 'd really appreciate it .
God , I miss him .

Responses to “ CSS Mini Reset ”
What is CSS Reset ?
CSS
Reset usually aims to reduce browser inconsistencies by evening up the CSS default settings in all browsers .
The most used CSS Rests areLast week I spotted " CSS Reset – a simpler option " by Russ Weakley .
Russ made few smart observations : we do n’t always need complete CSS reset because CSS Reset file can become very large and we often forget to set all the styles .
Also in my opinion we do n’t always use all the CSS and HTML tags , when was the last time when you used “ address ” tag ?
In many cases the complete CSS Reset makes perfect sense like in the case of some CSS Framework .
I used Eric Meyer Reset for my CSS Framework ( Emastic and The Golden Grid ) .
In other my project complete CSS reset does n’t make sense ( Malo 1 line CSS Framework ) .
My point is different projects ( sites ) can be approached differently , and not always we need complete CSS reset .
I wanted to make Mini CSS Reset who will focus on the main CSS features like Divs , Tables and Forms who are also the most used CSS ( HTML ) elements .
And here is the result :
You can compare : You can use CSS Mini Reset when you actually do n’t want to reset everything just the fundamental HTML elements .
Any suggestions ?

Late on May 3 , five days before his fight against Lyoto Machida Mauricio “ Shogun ” Rua realized he had a problem .
A big problem .
Frantic calls were placed to Las Vegas .
Contact was made with his supplier .
The lab verified they had Rua ’s bio-statistics on file , a rush order was placed and within 48 hours the custom - made product was dispatched .
To mitigate the risk of interception by Canadian customs , a UFC staffer snuck the package into Montreal sequestered in his luggage ; before nightfall the delivery was made .
The title fight could go on -- Rua had his mouthguard .
The importance of mouthguards has not been debated among fighters since 1927 , when boxer Mike McTigue , well on his way to winning his bout for a shot at the heavyweight title , was stopped by a punch to the mouth that caused a fight - ending upper lip laceration .
By that time mouthguards , known as gum shields , had been in existence for 40 years .
Originally made of gum rubber , the devices served to protect a fighter ’s upper lip from being torn open from punches to the maxilla .
These lip lacerations not only stopped fights , they led to scarring that affected speech and appearance .
Nevertheless , until the 1927 Sharkey - McTigue bout , when their value was demonstrated inescapably , mouthguards were illegal in professional boxing .
Ten years later they were required .
Over time , technology led to improved mouthguard design .
Non-malleable mouthguards have been done away with :
They were held in place by biting down , interfered with breathing and had the rare but troublesome tendency to fall into and block the airway of an unconscious fighter .
Devices made of thermoplastic rubber -- the popular and cheap Boil and Bite models -- mark a substantial design improvement .
They marginally conform to the upper teeth and fit the occlusal surface of the lower teeth , offering improvements in passive retention and mandible fixation .
The drawbacks of these guards are that they may become too thin during the “ bite ” fitting process , and the thermoplastic material does not have ideal protective properties of cushioning and rigidity .
The current state - of - the - art in dental protection is a dentist - fit , custom - made mouthguard .
These guards hold themselves in place on the maxillary teeth and have appropriate thickness anteriorly ( 4 - 6 mm ) and along the occlusal surfaces ( 3 - 5 mm ) .
Importantly , they are more comfortable to wear :
The worst mouthguard is one left in the gear bag because the fighter views its use as a burden .
A custom guard is more expensive , but not excessively so -- less than $ 100 .
Advances in mouthguard technology have been matched , perhaps overtaken , by claims of their pluripotent utility .
Over the past 30 years , published studies -- and Internet marketing come - on ’s -- have claimed , with wildly disparate levels of certainty and supporting evidence , that mouthguards enhance strength , speed auditory and visual reaction times , improve balance , sharpen concentration , modulate the stress response , treat spinal injuries , improve endurance and mitigate the risks of concussion and chronic traumatic brain injury .
The majority of these reported benefits fall in the realm of bad science , ethically suspect marketing and outright myth .
The fact that some of these exorbitant claims are used to promote $ 2,000 mouthguards does nothing to lower the threshold of disbelief .
There are , however , two claims -- that mouthguard use might improve endurance and minimize brain injury -- that bear further scrutiny :
They are supported by both legitimate proposed mechanisms and intriguing supportive science .
A recent study used CAT scans to show mouthguards produce significant widening of the oropharynx : an average diameter of 28.3 mm with guards , 25.9 mm without .
As resistance to fluid flow is proportional to the inverse fourth power of radius ( Poiseuille 's Equation ) , a widening of 2.4 mm represents -- theoretically -- an almost 40 percent decrease in airway resistance .
Muscles of respiration require approximately 10 percent of a maximally active athlete ’s oxygen demands , therefore a decrease in the work of breathing might translate into better endurance and faster recovery .
Clinical studies designed to see this effect , measuring athlete ’s blood lactate levels during exertion in the lab , have been ambiguous .
At best the studies show use of a fitted guard does not decrease cardiovascular performance -- the winded fighter who spits his mouthguard out is not helping himself anymore than if he threw away his cup .
Science and research also suggest that modern mouthguards may protect the brain from injury .
The only connection between the jaw and the cranium in which the brain resides are the temporomandibular joints , where the mandibular condyles sit in their cranial fossae , and the contact of lower mandibular teeth on upper maxillary teeth .
A recent study in Dental Traumatology posits that mal - alignment of these condyles may increase transmission of punch force and skull torque .
This may be the physiologic cause of “ glass jaw syndrome ” and , excitingly , the article suggests that the infamous glass jaw can be corrected by dental orthotics -- an extremely specialized form of mouthguard .
The preliminary study is intriguing , but a larger study on dental orthotics is needed .
A more well - studied mechanism of brain protection involves the innate elasticity of rubber .
Wearing even a simple mouthguard pulls the condyles out of place and separates the teeth ; this insures that any force applied to the jaw is cushioned by the mouthguard before affecting skull and brain .
The extent of this cushioning has been assessed in a number of studies using cadavers or models :
They have shown decreases in cranial force after a blow to the jaw of as much as 50 percent .
The ideal in vivo confirmatory study -- taking a large cohort of football players and fighters at a young age , depriving them of mouthguards for many years and measuring the number and severity of injuries they sustain -- cannot ethically be done .
The in vivo studies that have been done , often methodologically compromised , show intriguing evidence supporting the neuro - protective benefits of mouthguards .
It bears explicit statement that none of the “ higher end ” mouthguards being marketed have demonstrated clinical superiority over the standard dental fit guard .
Certainly the UFC finds the data regarding the benefits of mouthguards convincing .
For the last two years they have hired the FightDentist , Dr. Adam Persky , a world expert in the field , to make custom mouthguards for all of their fighters .
For the known and potential benefit -- certainly when balanced against the risks -- the UFC ’s money could not be better spent .

To be fair , it 's not like Nvidia has actually updated their GPUs since the 8000 series .
Every GPU apart from Fermi ( lol 90 ºC at load ) has effectively been a re-name of the same hardware .
Click to expand ...
You are right but there is quite the selection available all around that could have met thermal and power needs and be more powerful .
They could have really gone wild with ATI but I suspect they have a contract with Nvidia .
Its just an issue to me of whats being given GPU wise is well under the power that should be acceptable in 2010 even for non gamers .
Star Trek and Fringe star Leonard Nimoy got his start in the 1952 serial Zombies Of The Stratosphere .
We talked to him on a conference call the other day , and he raved about how science fiction has improved since then .
Advertisement
During the conference call with reporters , someone asked Nimoy how he felt science fiction had changed during the nearly 60 years of his acting career , and he responded :
Science fiction has become much more sophisticated and complicated than the science fiction that I worked in many , many years ago .
My first science fiction work was in a series of short films called " Zombies of the Stratosphere " in which three of us came from Mars , landed on Earth , and stole a pick - up tuck and a couple of revolvers and announced we were going to take over Earth and knock it out of its orbit because Mars has an orbit of lesser equality .
We want the orbit that Earth has .
It was a very simplistic , fantastic notion .
What we 're dealing with today is much more nuanced , and much more sophisticated .
The writers are doing fascinating work .
The scripts show it .
The production values are much more complex and much more sophisticated than what we used to be able to do , because of the advancement in the technology .
Advertisement
Most of the call , of course , was about Fringe , which has its season finale on Thursday featuring Nimoy in his most prominent role to date .
We had heard that the producers had planned a much bigger arc for William Bell this year , but had to scale it back dramatically when Nimoy was cast in the role , because Nimoy was only willing to do a few episodes .
We asked Nimoy if this was true , and what sort of things the writers had originally pitched for Bell to do .
He responded :
This is actually news to me .
I have n't heard this before .
I do n't think it 's accurate .
I was asked to do five episodes .
I did .
So , I do n't know where that information is coming from .
It 's true that , in the first three episodes that I did for them , or even the first four , I would say that my involvement was minimal .
In this final one , coming up next week , I 'm heavily involved .
I do n't know of any other plans that they had , or anything about scaling back .
I do n't think it 's accurate .
They asked me to do five episodes , and I did .

Nimoy was very excited about Thursday 's episode , because he gets to go toe - to - toe with John Noble for a lot of the episode .
There are " very strong scenes " between William and Walter , and a really terrific resolution to their relationship .
And he talked a bit about William Bell 's character :
He 's disarmingly unpredictable .
He keeps saying , " Trust me , " but then you 're not quite sure if you should .
That is probably the most interesting thing about him .
He 's obviously a man of great intelligence and a powerful figure , but most intriguing is what his intentions are .
What is his agenda ?
What is he really after ?
What 's he trying to accomplish ?
We 'll find out more about that next Thursday .

And no , he 's definitely not going to be in the next Star Trek movie — or anything else , since he 's retired from acting .
The Fringe season finale airs on Thursday at 9 PM on Fox .
Today , Wal - Mart cut the price of the 16GB iPhone 3GS to $ 97 , less than half its normal price .
In case you 're still on your first coffee of the day , that the the 3GS , not the already discounted 3G .
There are two ways to read this , both of which presume a new iPhone announcement at the Jobsnote on June 7th .
One is that Wal - Mart has lots of excess inventory it wants to shift before the iPhone 4G kills sales .
The second , and more likely , is that the 3GS will take the place of the 8GB 3G as the entry - level iPhone for the next year .
In this latter case , Wal - Mart would simply be the first to jump , and the first 3G iPhone would be no more .
Apple needs a $ 99 iPhone to hit the magic impulse - purchase price - point , the same reason the iPod Touch starts off at $ 199 ( and features slower hardware and less memory to get it in under $ 200 ) .
The likelihood of it keeping an old model into its third year , and having a confusing lineup of three different handsets is very un -Apple .
So if you 're planning on grabbing a cheap iPhone , and do n't care for anything new that might come in June , head to Wal - Mart .
Or just wait until it costs $ 100 everywhere .

WASHINGTON — Federal regulators responsible for oversight of drilling in the Gulf of Mexico allowed industry officials several years ago to fill in their own inspection reports in pencil — and then turned them over to the regulators , who traced over them in pen before submitting the reports to the agency , according to an inspector general ’s report to be released this week .
The report said that investigators " could not discern if any fraudulent alterations were present on these forms . "
The report , which describes inappropriate behavior by the staff at the Minerals Management Service from 2005 to 2007 , also found that inspectors had accepted meals , tickets to sporting events and gifts from at least one oil company while they were overseeing the industry .
Although there is no evidence that those events played a role in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , the report offers further evidence of what many critics of the Minerals Management Service have described as a culture of lax oversight and cozy ties to industry .
The report includes other examples of troubling behavior discovered by investigators .
In mid-2008 , a minerals agency employee conducted four inspections on drilling platforms when he was also negotiating a job with the drilling company , a cover letter to the report said .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The damaging effects of the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico will be felt all the way to Europe and the Arctic , a top scientist told a congressional panel Friday .
Other scientists and researchers -- invited to brief members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- warned that the thousands of barrels of oil still gushing into the Gulf are contributing to a potential ecological disaster of unknown proportions .
The briefing was part of an ongoing effort to draw on a broad range of expertise for what has been , in the eyes of many observers , a frustrating and ineffective cleanup effort .
" This is not just a regional issue for the wildlife , " said Carl Safina , the president of the Blue Ocean Institute .
Noting common migratory patterns , he warned that multiple forms of marine life from across the Atlantic Ocean " come into the Gulf to breed . "
Safina blasted BP , the company in control of the well responsible for the spill .
" I think asking BP for answers is the wrong place to look , " he said .
" They seem to have cut corners on some critical junctures .
We keep asking their permission to go down and measure the oil that 's coming out .
...
This mystifies me , because they are on our property now . "
BP , he said , " blew it in a really huge way .
Unfortunately , it 's now up to all of us to figure out exactly what to do next . "
The National Geographic Society 's Sylvia Earle said that asking for BP to play a leading role in containment efforts was akin to " relying on the foxes to look after the chicken coop . "
" The lack of knowing [ the extent of the spill and the damage ] is something that we should fear , " she said .
There is a " lack of understanding what the consequences of this action really will be to the ocean and then back to ourselves . "
The researchers disputed the value of trying to break up the spill by injecting chemicals into the column of pressurized crude oil erupting from the seabed floor .
" We do n't know effects of dispersants applied a mile underwater .
There 's been no laboratory testing at all , " Earle noted .
" Adding the dispersants ... is causing other problems " because the quantity used is likely to be toxic to marine life , she warned .
Researcher Carys Mitchelmore of the University of Maryland agreed that there is a risk of doing more harm than good with the chemicals .
" I 'm very concerned , because I do n't know , " she said .
" There are so many unknowns .
We can't see these organisms dying and dropping to the sea bed . "
Mitchelmore noted that both the crude oil plume and the chemicals used to counteract it are " so hard to follow .
It 's much easier to see a surface slick . "
Safina argued that BP was using the dispersants as a public relations tool , so cameras can't see the extent of the oil slick .

At last , it seems that AT&T will allow you to share your iPhone 's internet data connection with other devices .
The screen captures you see above come from the newly released iPhone OS 4 beta 4 , and show the option to enable internet tethering .
This would allow you to share your connection to either your computer ( over USB ) or an iPad or other mobile device ( via Bluetooth ) .
Huge , right ?
Especially as AT&T promised us the option to tether would be available by the end of last year .
But not so fast .
We 've been here before , over a year ago in fact .
When iPhone OS 3 was in its beta stages , developers found that they could switch on tethering and use it .
When the final version was released to the public , it was gone .
All iPhones have the software for tethering built in .
It is then up to the individual carriers if they will support it .
AT&T does n't , yet , but pretty much anywhere else in the world you can share your data as you like .
While the screen - grabs above are almost certainly legitimate , having a feature flash up in a beta release is not the same as having it actually launch to the public .
I 'm skeptical .

Facebook 's CEO came up with a way of predicting who a given user would be dating one week in the future , according to a new book about the social network .
And he did it for fun .
CEO Mark Zuckerberg found it entertaining to dive into user data and look for patterns , according to an excerpt from Fortune columnist David Kirkpatrick 's The Facebook Effect .
Hey , everyone 's got hobbies , right ?
From the excerpt published on All Facebook :
As the service 's engineers built more and more tools that could uncover such insights , Zuckerberg sometimes amused himself by conducting experiments .
For instance , he concluded that by examining friend relationships and communications patterns he could determine with about 33 percent accuracy who a user was going to be in a relationship with a week from now .
To deduce this he studied who was looking which profiles , who your friends were friends with , and who was newly single , among other indicators .
This kind of predictive capacity could be used for some pretty creepy targeted advertising opportunities : flower delivery , restaurant reservations , advice books , sexual products of various sorts .
If you do n't think Zuckerberg is interested in systematizing this sort of data mining , consider that he 's created an entire " data science " team to find interesting patterns .
That includes , as we wrote previously , which life events make men and woman happy vs. disgruntled .
And we 're guessing the patterns identified deep in the bowels of Facebook only get more interesting from there .

I like to think that when people funded my sabbatical , this was the sort of thing they wanted .
During ROFLcon , there was a showing at the local movie theater of a rather rare , rather bizarre little computer film .
I ’d have thought I ’d seen most films with computers in them .
Or , at least , heard of them .
Not so with this little gem ; a film called Computer Beach Party , released in 1987 .
Presented by the Found Footage Festival , the audience was subjected to this horrible computer - and - sex romp as well as being highly entertained by the commentary , skits , trivia , and all - around show by the members of the FFF .
I ’ve internally debated about the use of a commercial product in a commercial tour , and all I can say is that they cut the movie up into sections , have enormous amounts of additional material they add to the showing , conduct audience prizes , and constantly add MST3K - quality commentary throughout .
( This is n’t entirely surprising when you find out one of the cast worked on MST3K , and they ’ve also worked for The Onion and Late Night With David Letterman . )
All taken into consideration , it really is a whole new show with the movie mixed into a goulash .
But the moral debate aside , something about this movie just fascinated me .
As a person with film production experience , as well as computer history experience , I was in a rather odd position to take the movie into more of a full context than most .
I know how south things can go with a film production , and I also can appreciate using computers in a film in the mid 1980s and the unique approaches everyone was taking back then .
That said , I must make clear : this movie is awful .
Not just awful like “ missed the mark ” awful , or awful like “ did n’t feel very well made ” awful .
I mean that it ’s functionally broken , full of inconsistencies , utilizes a plot that would n’t have worked even if filmed to perfection , and wastes your time .
It actually wastes your time .
The fact it has computers in it , for me , meant that there were periods of dim interest , like finding out the person who kidnapped and is beating you went to the same college as you did .
Interesting , yet besides the point .
It is absolutely terrible .
Do n’t see it , unless you ’re attending the aforementioned Found Footage Festival , at which point you will have a great time , because you will be watching a show that ’s funny and well - done , which contains this awful thing at the core of it to power the we ’re - all - in - this - together feeling with other members of the audience .
The plot is not particularly challenging or hard to recount , although it sounds as stupid as it was .
In Galveston , Texas , two sail - buggy buddies who love to use the local beach for racing discover that the mayor wants to close the beach and chase everyone out so he can dig for long - lost treasure .
Serving as the mayor ’s muscle are two incompetent henchmen , one of whom is dating the mayor ’s daughter .
Our heroes utilize computer technology , friends , and lots of partying to best these enemies and , in the case of one of them , win the heart of the mayor ’s daughter .
Along the way , there ’s partying , random sex , and dancing .
There ’s a sub - plot involving the local sheriff being waylaid by a taunting chicken car , but let ’s not get ahead of ourselves – the film starts to sound like it ’s competent .
It ’s not – the scenes do n’t always end predictably , there are missing sequences ( as in , there are sequences they really should have added but never filmed , so they do their best to get by ) , and an awful lot of the movie seems like it was shot in a single take .
Two things make this movie stand out : the dubbing and the computers .
In the case of the dubbing , this movie ’s sound construction is absolutely beyond belief .
People are dubbed with new voices all the time , in some cases being delivered by voice actors who are intentionally sounding cartoonish .
Sometimes the dubbing of the voices does n’t sync with the video .
In one case , they dub the sound of a dog , and make the dog talk .
That ’s pretty crazy , and it ’s absolutely jarring .
Any time you might start to watch the film for being a film , the dubbing comes back to ruin it for you .
Much of it sounds , literally , like people are screwing around with the footage by recording hammy voices over them .
Not exactly the best cinematic experience .
And then there ’s the computers .
Throughout this film , computers are used to forward the plot – but in weird surreal ways that do n’t make logical or dramatic sense .
In the beginning , they want to have a party , so they utilize the computer to get together a party .
If you flip through the footage ( and I have , more than I should have ) , you can see the computer is sort of doing an instant message or groupware invitation system so that you indicate how many people you want to attend and what type , but it ’s instantaneous and hugely illogical ( you can request the sex and age of your attendees ) .
It ’s not even explained how they do this , or where they get this ability or access – they just do it .
In fact , almost none of the characters have a backstory , so they ’re completely flat – they ’re just words delivered by meat .
Computers are everywhere in this movie , hence “ Computer Beach Party ” .
Seriously , computers are everywhere in this flick .
They ’re in the background while the main couple get to know each other .
They provide horoscopes , they link to that mysterious party database I mentioned , and they affect the performance of vehicles .
Yes , that ’s right , there ’s a sequence where a computer in a glove compartment makes a car go faster .
No , I do n’t get it either .
The Found Footage guys indicate that the writer seems to consider the computer a “ magic black box ” , filling plot holes or logic jumps by just being a computer .
This is the sort of thing that can work in a fantasy setting ; the movie Weird Science comes to mind , and that John Hughes film is considered a sort of classic , or at least a fun touchstone .
Not so here .
They ’re just stuck in everywhere , and are sort of meaningless .
Also , if you sit back and consider the film ’s plot ( and I do not suggest this ) , then you realize all they do with the computer is cheat .
They use it to win races , for example , races that have no particular bearing on the main plot .
They just win the race , either making a car run faster or , in one case , making a windpower - based vehicle ( a sail buggy ) move better .
With a computer .
An awful lot of the film has appearances by a band called “ Panther ” .
All told , they contribute a couple dozen songs to this film .
And they look , for all that , like a perfect 80s hair metal band :
They regard the camera directly , as do a lot of other people during the party scenes .
The party scenes appear to have all been shot at once , because the lighting and performances are similar .
But there I go , trying to apply cinematic rigor in analysis to this film .
What a waste !
When the film was over , a few of us die - hard folks wanted to know more , anything , everything , about how this film came to be .
How did the organizers find it ?
How was this thing ever paid for ?
Where did it come from ?
What were they trying to accomplish with this thing ?
The festival guys said they ’d only seen two tapes of this movie in 15 years of going through piles of VHS discards .
They said they ’d reached the lead actress , and she ’d become a fitness and exercise guru , and wanted money for an interview .
They said they ’d never found out who owned it now , who the other people were , or the story behind this movie .
I said that , given the movie ’s content , I could find out everything one would want to know about the film in a week .
I was wrong .
It took 2 hours .
Before I tell you absolutely everything about this movie , let me say that Annalee Newitz reviewed this movie for Wired , it has an IMDB entry , and I ’m not the first person to write long ranty speculation about the film .
So while a lot of what I ’m about to say may be new to the Internet at large and I may ( shudder ) become the go - to weblog entry about this film and the reasons behind it , there are plenty of people who have discussed this film and thrown around images and speculation and insights and all the other wonders of online writing .
I ’m coming very late to the computer beach party on this one , but I hope I brought some good pizza for you .
Research is what I do .
Cold calling is also what I do .
I did both .
The initial thought I had on this movie was it must have functioned as a drug laundering scam .
Do production on a film , make it cost too much , lose the money in the right amount of ways , token release it , and then consider the money properly dispensed .
I was being unkind – all indications are that this film was an honest attempt to do an actual movie , with real actors and a real plot , with the usual nods to low - budget filmmaking and a gratuitous amount of nudity and crude humor to get to the summer audience .
The director , editor and writer of Computer Beach Party , Gary Troy , is pretty easy to find .
Here ’s his resume page , including his official headshot :
Just a glance over his resume page shows some of the ways one can have a full life as an entertainer without it all appearing on IMDB .
Band player , news editor , casting director … you name it , Gary ’s been a part of it .
Obviously , though , we care about the films , and the theme when you look at the films directed by Gary is that they tend to be low budget and they tend to be pretty , well , schlocky .
His directing debut ( as far as IMDB goes ) is wonder called Teenage Bride , whose description reads “ Buxom nudist mistress Marie wants her lover to hire a private detective to tape the lover ’s wife with the lover ’s college dropout stepbrother .
But while the men ’s secretaries seduce them , Marie seduces the stepbrother by herself . ”
This is not high art , here .
Well , maybe to be fair , let me give you another promotional blurb of this film , from a different source :
“ Young Cyndee Summers is married to a beefy old loser , so she gets her kicks with her hubby ’s younger step brother , Dennis .
It turns out that everyone is making whoopie !
Even Cyndee ’s boring husband is bopping her best friend , and his personal secretary , just to name a few .
And Dennis , a horny little bugger himself , starts having hot , steamy affairs with all of Cyndee ’s friends and foes .
A genuinely erotic movie that will tease you and keep your hand over your remote control to press the slo - mo button over and over again . ”
… oh well .
I began doing research on the names in the credits list of the movie .
In case you ’re wondering , the credits list looks like this :
A good place to start , it turned out , was the ADR / Re-Recording director , who would have been responsible for the crazy dubbing and top - flight craziness in the soundscape of the film .
He was listed as “ Rusty Smith ” , who I nailed as R. Russell Smith .
A top - flight ADR guy , he ’s done work for so many films it ’s ludicrous , not to mention his work with television series such as The Simpsons , Deadwood , Big Love , Northern Exposure , and The Practice .
In other words , Rusty is the friggin’ man when it comes to sound work .
The movie was shot , according to other sources , around 1985 , but was released on video in 1987 / 1988 , via Vestron Video .
This indicates to me that the movie drops into Rusty ’s lap at the beginning of his career , when he ’s having a certain amount of good time with playing around with stuff .
( Like everyone else I tracked down , I submitted this auspicious credit to Rusty ’s IMDB entry . )
It ’s not hard to speculate that the movie , in whatever shape it was in , was handed over to Vestron , who then utilized Rusty ’s studio to clean things up .
The process of doing this was wild and wooly enough that the ADR guys felt no gumption or guilt about giving people odd voices , or in one case imitating a dog talking .
The seven ( seven ! ) “ re-recording artists ” in the credits also point to quite a bit of post - production work .
How much Gary Troy was involved in this , is not currently clear .
So , in my opinion , there ’s two groups involved here : the primary , production - on - the - ground film crew , and then the secondary , post - production crew .
While it ’s easy to point fingers in one direction or another , credit must be given to both crews – the primary created a somewhat incomplete film , and the secondary really screwed around to have fun fixing up the resulting film .
Between them , what could have been merely dull becomes a sort of bizzaro - world movie experience .
But incomprehensible to normal moviegoers .
To be honest , I ’m much more interested in the process that led to the film than the process that resulted in crazy - 0verdubs and weird editing .
I want to know what got this Computer Beach Party started .
I tracked down the creator of the computer graphics in the film , Larry Fly , who is now a website developer .
Here ’s his answers to the questions I asked him about the project and his part in it :
“ I hope that if you are documenting this that it pertains to how “ not ” to do a movie .
I do n’t think is was done very well nor did it go anywhere to my knowledge .
I was contacted via a friend of someone who knew the Production company – I believe it was Southwest Motion Pictures .
I was writing graphics applications for the IBM PC at the time .
The movie was shot in 1983 - 84 timeframe .
Galveston , Texas .
I did only the computer graphics ( on screen ) , no movie titles or post production stuff .
I did these screens and graphics based on drawings given to me by the production team – at their specific direction .
They shot the graphics directly off the computer screen .
By the way , I was supposed to get paid for this but never received any money .
A terrible learning experience for me .
I used a computer they provided – I believe it was a IBM XT , 256 kb , 10 mb HD , with 4 Color ( CGA ) graphics , Joystick for drawing ( Mouse did not exist ) .
I wrote Pascal and IBM Basic programs to accomplish drawing the graphics , performing animations , and screen transitions and overlays , etc .
I did get a VHS copy of the movie from an online source about five years ago .
I do not recall it being shown in a theater anywhere .
I thought I read somewhere it went to video only . ”
Already , things become more obvious .
The production company did ask for stuff and plan things – but they had issues with followthrough .
The computers were meant to play a good part in things , and certain scenes definitely were planned , as they asked him for items like the car graphics and love graphics , although they used them very weirdly .
This did n’t sound like drug laundering at all !
Someone was trying to make a movie !
The crew of the festival indicated they had already contacted the female lead , Stacey Nemour – and it ’s not that hard to find her .
After all , she ’s a black belt in Karate and has an entire website for promotion and videos .
The crew said they ’d tried to talk to her but she wanted to be paid to be interviewed .
She did indicate that production was about two weeks and the script was mostly improvised .
They decided not to pay for the interview .
I decided that being the second internet moron facility to contact Ms. Nemour would be a bit much and needlessly harassing , so I have not contacted her .
Update : Stacey Nemour has shown up to indicate that in fact she was asked to attend a midnight screening of the movie , and do a Q&A , not simply answer questions over the phone .
Sorry to imply any other situation – this is how it was described at the show .
I did , however , track down the male lead , specifically the computer programming nerd .
In the movie , he ’s called Hank Amico , but a little investigation reveals his real name to be Hank Amigo .
He ’s now a drama teacher in Woodland Hills , California .
I ’ve left a message for him , but have n’t talked to him yet .
Here ’s what he looks like these days :
I was able to find citations in Google Books to Computer Beach Party , especially pre-production press by Gary Troy , in which he promises he will be creating a “ high - tech teen romp ” .
Again , an indication the film was meant to go somewhere .
A production company was set up , was doing the work , hired actors , and so on .
My last big breakthrough came by looking up the production manager for the movie , Sanford Hampton .
Mr. Hampton has had a long and varied career , and through some luck and rustling around , I got his cell phone number .
Do you know how strange it is to call someone who has had a nice career , and essentially ask him , out of the blue and over the phone , what he remembers about a terrible sex and computer comedy from 25 years ago ?
He was unbelievably kind , all things considered .
And amazingly , he could recall details about the production off the top of his head .
His memory told him the budget for this film was about $ 100,000 .
Production was about three weeks .
He believes the lead actress was dating the director .
And the band , “ Panther ” , was headed up by the actresses ’ brother .
( I have found Roger Nemour ’s Myspace page , which includes photos from Computer Beach Party .
Nemour calls it a “ shitty film ” .
His career seems to have been long and varied and full of many good works as well . )
Hampton recalls it as “ a great party that allowed us to make a film on the side ” .
He said he ’d never known the film actually got released in any form , and my phone call was the first he ’d heard of it since he ’d wrapped production .
He had nothing but great things to say about Gary Troy , and that he was a wonderful and warm guy .
No specific memories of hard times or unpleasantness came up on initial looking back .
He also thought Galveston was a great place to spend time in .
That the final work had missing scenes , problematic sound , and a really ludicrous plot was ancillary to the experience for Hampton .
I do n’t know how the movie was for others involved in the production , of course , but in all , it sounds like a film that got made and just did n’t quite have all the chips together when it was finished .
I ’ve seen movies like these before – they just do n’t tend to have computers play such a big part .
Finally , the ownership question .
Vestron Video , who bought out the movie and put it on VHS and in video stores , itself went out of business and had its film library purchased by Lion ’s Gate Entertainment .
Lion ’s Gate , without a question , renewed the copyright on this film in 2005 , along with the copyright of over 3,400 movies it had acquired from 20 - 30 now - defunct film companies .
For what it ’s worth , Computer Beach Party had its copyright renewed in the same document ( V3521 D236-256 P1-116 ) as The Blair Witch Project , Pi , and Candyman 3 : Day of the Dead .
Nothing specific or personal , in other words … just a perfunctory legal move done by a company protecting its acquired library of works , at least one of which is really really awful and has a talking dog .
So now we know the story of Computer Beach Party , or at least , as much as the average person could ever want to know for the rest of their lives .
For everyone who gave me contributions for my sabbatical , I ’ll bet the dividends are just blowing you away , are n’t they ?
So why “ Part One ” ?
Well , I have a few calls / e- mails out to a number of other parties associated with this film , and if what they bring me warrants another entry , I ’ll do it .
Otherwise , like many low - budget films , I ’ll leave the entry at Part One , with a sequel never forthcoming , and anyone looking over Part One knowing exactly why .
Update : And now , Part Two .

CNBC 's Melissa Lee and the Fast Money traders look at the day's top trades and discuss what they 'll be watching tomorrow .
“ Nothing About Us Without Us ” — what a great insight , brought to us this past week by the feminist Mormon housewives .
Reese Dixon wrote the post comparing the situation of disabled people with the situation of women in the LDS church : in both cases policy decisions are made for them , by others .
It also seems to fit some of the other discussions I saw around blogspace this week , talking about other groups when you could be talking with them .
For example , check out this BCC article ( containing lots of speculation about former Mormons , including that gem that former “ Mormons become shell - shocked and bitter , and go into therapy to become professional ex-Mormons ” ) .
Scott B. might have considered watching
In the Shadow of the Temple ( reviewed here by the Swearing Elders ) .
Meanwhile Andrew is reduced to posting his responses elsewhere since he ’s not welcome on BCC .
By contrast , Tim advises Evangelicals not to just talk to other Evangelicals if they want to know what Mormons believe and are like .
And Ms. Jack is going the extra mile by actually having the LDS Missionaries over for dinner .
And MoHoHawaii presents a great insight about advice , namely who it ’s really for / about .
Sadly , we still have reports from all over of straight people making shockingly ignorant assumptions about gay people .
On a completely different note , both Todd and Runtu have posted interesting points about post - modernism .
And speaking of debating the existence of objective reality , Jon discusses global warming skeptics — as Phil notes , you ca n’t resolve away climate change .
And let ’s close with a couple of announcements : Madame Curie is starting a feminist cyber book club .
And do n’t forget that you ’ve only got another day or so to vote for the Brodies ( if you have n’t already ) or encourage your last few friends to vote for you ! 😀

UBC researchers have proffered a new mathematical model that seeks to unravel a key evolutionary riddle -- namely what factors underlie the generation of biological diversity both within and between species .
Evolutionary biologists have long recognized that the emergence of rare traits within a population can spur diversity .
For example , being one of a few under - sized predators in a population dominated by larger - sized predators can offer advantages -- access to an abundance of small prey -- and increase the likelihood of that trait prospering in the population .
" But existing mathematical models that incorporate these ' rare type ' advantages tend to have some serious shortcomings , " says Michael Doebeli , a researcher at UBC's Biodiversity Research Centre and professor with the departments of Mathematics and Zoology .
" They rely on single traits -- like body size -- and predict that the advantage offered by that trait has to be very significant in order to maintain large amounts of diversity . "
So Doebeli and research associate Iaroslav Ispolatov applied a new model to the riddle , which they outline in the journal Science .
Building on classical competition models for single traits , they designed their mathematical theory to gauge the evolutionary impact of multiple traits in concert , and found that adding this layer of complexity significantly lowered the threshold for the maintenance of diversity and the evolution of new species .
" When you model one trait at a time - - in isolation - - you often find that ecological interactions are n't strong enough to drive divergence .
But with many traits acting in concert , even very weak interactions can generate diversity .
Our approach mirrors the complexity of reality more closely -- if you think about it , all living organisms have at least dozens , if not hundreds , of ecologically relevant traits , " says Doebeli .
Mathematically , the biological phenomenon is reflected in fundamental properties of eigenvalues of quadratic forms .
The theory would help explain the extraordinary amount of diversity found in many ecosystems , for example in the microbial world of oceans .
In fact , the initial proving ground for the model might well be microbial populations .
" It would be interesting to to test whether at the genetic level , pathways controlling different traits are regulated in concert to enable the inheritability of diversifying traits along multiple phenotypic axes . "

A small Syrian - backed terrorist group in Gaza said its activists blew up a donkey cart laden with explosives close to the border with Israel on Tuesday , killing the animal but causing no human casualties .
Abu Ghassan , spokesman for the terrorist group , said more than 200 kilograms of dynamite were heaped on the animal - drawn cart .
He added that the explosives were detonated 60 meters from the concrete security barrier that separates the territory from Israel .
The donkey was killed in the blast , but there were no reports of human casualties .
Israeli troops routinely patrol the border , and impoverished Gazans often gather rubble in the area .
The Israeli military confirmed the blast , but had no further comment .
The IDF said Gaza terrorists also fired two mortar shells into Israel on Tuesday , which fell in the Netiv Ha'asara area without causing damage or casualties .
Earlier this week , masked gunmen from an Islamist group torched a UN - run summer camp for children and teens in Gaza .
The head of UNRWA in Gaza , John Ging , said the assailants tied up the guard , burned tents and vandalized bathrooms at the campgrounds .
UN officials said the attackers left behind three bullets and a note threatening to kill Ging and others unless the UN cancels its activities for some 250,000 Gaza children .
Two days before the incident , the previously unknown " The Free of the Homeland " group issued a statement criticizing the camp 's organizer , the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , for " teaching schoolgirls fitness , dancing and immorality . "
Home Secretary Theresa May ( Getty )
Theresa
May has been appointed home secretary and minister for equality , replacing Chris Grayling who was dubbed ‘ homophobic ’ by gay rights groups after suggesting that bed and breakfast owners should be able to ban gay couples .
But analysis by PinkNews.co.uk reveals that Mrs May has voted consistently against gay and transgendered rights .
Mrs May ’s voting record on LGBT rights is mixed .
In 1998 she voted against equalising the age of consent and in 2000 , she voted against the repeal of Section 28 , legislation that banned the ‘ promotion ’ of homosexuality by local government and schools .
In 2001 and 2002 she voted against gay couples jointly adopting children .
In 2004 , like much of the Conservative front bench , Mrs May did vote in favour of civil partnerships .
But in the same year , Mrs May did n’t attend Parliament for any of the four votes that led to the Gender Recognition Act .
In 2008 she voted in favour of a defeated bill which said that IVF rights should require a male role model - effectively discriminating against lesbian fertility rights .
Stonewall , the lesbian , gay and bisexual lobbying group , declined to comment on Mrs May ’s voting record or her suitability as minister for equality .
Instead , a spokesman said : “ Both coalition parties made a number of promises to lesbian and gay voters during the campaign .
We look forward to working with Teresa May to see them fulfilled . ”
But David Henry of gay rights group OutRage !
claimed that Mrs May was “ the wrong person for the job ” .
He told PinkNews.co.uk : “ She has n’t really made a lot of comments on homosexuality in the past , although she is a strong advocate for family .
“ She ’s always been against gay rights since I can remember .
I ’m pretty sure she ’s opposed almost every gay rights measure . ”
PEMBROKE PINES , Fla .
—A male South Florida high school student who ran for prom queen in drag has been suspended from the dance because of a parking violation .
Flanagan High School 's principal had two meetings with senior Oscar Bonilla because administrators were concerned about his safety if he wore a dress to prom .
Officials say that when he came to the second meeting , Bonilla parked in a visitor space and ignored orders to move .
Broward schools spokeswoman Nadine Drew says Bonilla was suspended for two days for the parking problem , which kept him from attending Friday 's dance .
Bonilla says he was running late and did n't hear a security guard tell him to move his car .
The student , who finished second in voting for prom queen , says he was trying to encourage closeted students to abandon their fears and be themselves .

It was 21 years ago that the Exxon - Valdez leaked oil and unleashed torrents of environmental hysteria .
Rothbard got it right in his piece “ Why Not Feel Sorry for Exxon ? ”
After the BP - hired drilling rig exploded last week , the environmentalists went nuts yet again , using the occasion to flail a private corporation and wail about the plight of the “ ecosystem , ” which somehow managed to survive and thrive after the Exxon debacle .
The comparison is complicated by how much worse this event is .
Eleven people died .
BP market shares have been pummeled .
So long as the leak persists , the company loses 5,000 — 10,000 barrels a day .
Green Gone Wrong : Ecop ... Paul Taylor Best Price : $ 4.55 Buy New $ 9.94 ( as of 10:47 EST - Details )
BP will be responsible for cleanup costs far exceeding the federal limit of $ 75 million .
The public relations nightmare will last for a decade or more .
In the end , the costs could reach $ 100 billion , perhaps wrecking the company and many other businesses .
It should be obvious that BP is by far the leading victim , but I ’ve yet to see a single expression of sadness for the company and its losses .
Indeed , the words of disgust for BP are beyond belief .
The DailyKos sums it up : “ BP : Go f*** yourselves . ”
Obama ’s press secretary , Robert Gibbs , said that the government intended to keep " its boot on BP ’s neck . "
How about reality ?
The incident is a tragedy for BP and all the subcontractors involved .
It will probably wreck the company , a company that has long helped provide the fuel that runs everything from our cars to our industries , and keeps alive the very body of modern life .
The idea that BP should be hated and denounced is preposterous ; there is every reason to express great sadness for what has happened .
The Deniers Solomon , Lawrence Best Price : $ 1.70 Buy New $ 30.98 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
It is not as if BP profits by oil leaks , or that anyone reveled in the chance to dump its precious oil all over the ocean .
Its own CEO has worked for years to try to prevent precisely this kind of accident , and did so not out of the desire to comply with regulations , but because it is good business practice .
In contrast to the families and others who are weeping , we might ask who is happy about the disaster : the environmentalists , with their fear mongering and hatred of modern life , and the government , which treats every capitalist producer as a bird to be oiled and plucked .
The environmentalists are thrilled because they get yet another chance to wail and moan about the plight of their beloved swamps and other supposedly sensitive land .
The loss of fish is sad , but it is not as if they will not come back : after the Exxon - Valdez trouble , the fishing was better than ever in just one year .
Green Hell : How Enviro ...
Milloy , Steven Best Price : $ 1.25 Buy New $ 8.10 ( as of 05:10 EST - Details )
The main advantage to the environmentalists is their propaganda victory in having yet another chance to rail against the evils of oil producers and ocean drilling .
If they have their way , oil prices would be vastly higher , there would never be another refinery built , and all development of the oceans would stop in the name of “ protecting ” things irrelevant to human life .
The core economic issue concerning such a spill is liability .
In a world of private property , if you soil someone else ’s property , you bear the liability .
But what about a world in which government owns vast swaths , and the oceans are considered the commons of everyone ?
It becomes extremely difficult to assess damages .
There is also a problem with federal limits on liability .
The liability for damaging people or property should be 100 % .
Such a system would match a company ’s policies to the actual risk of doing damage .
Lower limits would inspire companies to be less concerned about damage to others than they should be , in the same way that a company with a bailout guarantee will be more reckless than in a free market .
The Politically Incorr ... Christopher C. Horner Best Price : $ 1.28 Buy New $ 7.79 ( as of 05:35 EST - Details )
But such a liability rule presumes ownership , so that owners themselves are in a position to enter into fair bargaining and there can be some objective test .
There is no objective test when the oceans are collectively owned , and where the coasts are government owned .
“ Every American affected by this spill should know this : your government will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes to stop this crisis , ” Obama says .
Are we really supposed to believe that government is better able to deal with this disaster than private industry ?
The government and its army of bureaucrats is only a hindrance .
And meanwhile , the Obama administration must be thrilled to have an old - fashioned change of subject , so that we do n’t have to notice every single day that its economic stimulus has been an incredible flop , with unemployment higher today than a year ago , and the depression still persisting .
Why , by the way , when every natural disaster is hailed by the Keynesian media for at least having the stimulative effect of rebuilding , is nothing like this said about the oil spill ?
At least in this case , losses seem to be recognized as losses .
The abstraction called the “ ecosystem " — which never seems to include humans or their civilization — has done far less for us than the oil industry .
So let us not forget that the greatest tragedy here is BP ’s and its subsidiaries ’ and subcontractors ’ , and the private enterprises affected by the losses that no one intended .
If the result is a shutdown of drilling and further regulation of private enterprise , people will lose .
And that is what counts .

The emergence of six declared candidates for Labour leader is refreshing after the non-contest last time .
Let 's hope that the Parliamentary Labour Party enables enough of them to be nominated , so that members get to make a meaningful choice about the future policy and ideological direction of the party .
It is a shame , in that sense , that Jon Cruddas is not running , meaning that there is a gap , with four candidates from a broadly New Labour heritage ( representing variants on the Blarite and Brownite strands within it ) and two from the hard left , but no one from the soft - left tradition in the party .
But this is n't just a debate about policy and ideology : the party leader is also our " campaigner - in - chief " .
And , as a candidate for Labour 's National Executive Committee , I am also judging the candidates on their ability to connect with voters -- particularly the C2 skilled working classes , where our vote collapsed this time -- and to inspire and motivate activists and recruit members .
I want to know what their ideas are for regenerating a battered and tired party and turning it back into the formidable fighting force it was in 1997 .
The next leader needs to demonstrate that he or she appreciates the role of party members .
We need a balance of rights and responsibilities .
If you expect members to work their socks off for a Labour victory , then their rights in matters such as candidate selection and shortlisting need to be respected .
We need a new leader who sees the union link not as an embarrassing yet useful source of big money , but as a way of tapping in to the ideas , energy and campaigning skills of millions of ordinary union members .
Our organic link with the unions should be a huge source of strength -- used properly , it would enable us to reconnect with many of the people who felt we had stopped understanding their aspirations at this election .
We need a new leader who has n't given up on the idea of a mass - membership party , and one that genuinely reflects society rather than being dominated by the metropolitan chattering classes , as it is now .
Eighteen thousand new members since the election is a great start , but not enough .
We need imaginative thinking about how to make membership accessible -- £ 39 a year is prohibitive for the people we were set up to represent -- and worthwhile , offering something back beyond the right to deliver leaflets in the rain .
And we need a new leader who is committed to making us a truly national party again .
Politically , he or she needs to be able to appeal to voters in the south outside London , where we are a weak third and have only ten MPs .
Organisationally , he or she needs to be prepared to put resources in this early part of the electoral cycle into suburban and rural areas we had written off -- so that there are functioning constituency parties everywhere and Labour councillors on every council -- and into safe seats where we have let the party atrophy .
In an era when the Lib Dems have forfeited the right to any anti-Tory votes , where coalitions are based on a mandate defined as the total national vote you get , and where we may be heading towards a new electoral system , there can be no " no - go areas " for Labour .
My judgement is that Ed Miliband is the candidate most likely to rise to these challenges of reconnection with voters and regeneration of our party , but I am pleased to say that at least four of the six " get it " .
And that leads me to be very optimistic about Labour 's potential for recovery .

The deadly blast on board an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was caused by an exploding bubble of methane gas , according to a US media report .
Workers on the rig described hearing " screaming and hollering " and said people leapt into the sea to escape .
The accounts came from a BP report into last month 's blast , which has led to thousands of barrels of oil leaking .
Eye - witnesses also said that safety mechanisms did not function and that workers were taken by surprise .
The fresh details about the blast were revealed in interviews with oil rig workers carried out by BP during an internal investigation , Associated Press reports .
The revelations came as a giant funnel was lowered over the oil well in a bid to contain oil leaking from it .
BP said it might take up to 12 hours for the steel - and - concrete containment device to settle in place , but that everything appeared to be going as planned .
It is hoped it will be able to collect as much as 85 % of the leaking oil and begin funnelling it to ships above by Monday .
Oil from a slick caused by the leak has washed ashore on islands off Louisiana .
' Tears of anger '
Fresh details about the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig emerged on Friday .
One worker rescued from the rig , Micah Sandell , reportedly said : " There was people screaming and hollering .
There was people jumping off the side .
I 've never seen nothing like that .
Never . "
Another , Dwayne Martinez , said : " Everybody was scared to death .
Nothing went as planned like it was supposed to . "
Mr Martinez continued : " No kind of alarms .
We did n't hear any kind of alarms until there was one explosion . "
The accounts , from BP 's own investigations into the blast last month , describe how the blow - out was triggered by a bubble of methane gas that escaped from the well and shot up the drill column , AP reports .
It rapidly expanded as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding , the documents say .
Details of the documents were revealed by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor , who has worked for BP as a risk assessment consultant .
BP spokesman John Curry would not comment on the events described in the internal documents .
" We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation , " he said .
' Good progress ' US officials announced on Friday that they had closed Breton National Wildlife Refuge to the public after a silver sheen of oil reached the shoreline .
" The refuge closure is important to keep the public safe , to minimise disturbance to nesting colonial sea birds , and to allow personnel conducting cleanup operations and recovery efforts to work safely and efficiently , " the US Fish and Wildlife Service said on Friday .
The BBC's Rajesh Mirchandani , on Dauphin Island , an inhabited barrier island three miles ( 5 km ) off the coast of Alabama , says there is a faint but distinct smell of oil in the air .
Some scientists say the oil may be spread more widely .
Small , black particles have been found in samples taken from below the surface , away from the visible slick , our correspondent adds .
An estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day has been leaking for 18 days from the well , 50 miles off Louisiana , since an explosion destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig last month , killing 11 workers .
Although the rig was operated by Transocean , it was leased by BP , which is responsible for cleaning the 3 million gallons that have so far leaked , creating a slick covering about 2,000 sq miles ( 5,200 sq km ) .
The company hopes the 98 - tonne containment device , once operational , will allow it to collect oil leaking out of the well while it attempts to stop the leak altogether by drilling relief wells nearby .
HOW THE OIL FUNNEL WORKS
The funnel is a 40ft tall iron box , weighing 98 tonnes
It will be placed over the leak , 5,000 ft down on the seabed BP hopes it will collect 85 % of the leaking oil and pipe it to the surface
Earlier , remote - controlled submersibles guided the 40ft ( 12 m ) funnel above the wellhead , some 5,000 ft below the surface .
The technology has only ever been used in shallow waters .
" It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , " BP spokesman Bill Salvin told the Associated Press .
" Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . "
Now that the containment device is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it is stable before the submersibles can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker .
" We are essentially taking a four - story building and lowering it 5,000ft and setting it on the head of a pin , " Mr Salvin added .
If the box works , another will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak .
Experts warn that there is still a risk that any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse .
It is also possible for the pipe to the surface to become clogged with ice , and for the subsequent separation of the oil , gas and water to cause an explosion .
Fears are growing for the safety of the area 's manifest wildlife
In the meantime , residents of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida await news of when the oil will reach their shores .
BP said emergency teams had been sent to Freemason Island , a favourite fishing spot for recreational anglers some 30 miles off Louisiana 's coast , to deploy inflatable booms to protect its prime marshland .
Fears are growing that sea life may have been severely affected in the area , which includes vital spawning grounds for fish , shrimp and crabs .
The attempt by BP to lower the funnel comes as Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar called for a halt to permits for new exploratory drilling in the US , pending a 30 - day investigation into the cause of the oil spill .
Some environmentalists are now calling for a permanent ban on offshore drilling as a result of the spill .

The world of dating - while - feminist can be a challenge .
What if I took it to Craigslist ?
Advertisement
For me , it is a prerequisite that my potential date identifies as a feminist , or at least is interested and can hold a conversation about feminist subjects .
I also subscribe to ye olde adage " Just say no to sex with anti-choicers . "
These prerequisites can make it difficult to find a contender .
As Jaclyn Friedman puts it , " If I had a hardcore litmus test , the pool of men I could date would be so tiny .
And then when you weeded out men who are gay , the men I do n't find attractive , the men already in monogamous , committed relationships - really , I would never get laid again . "

I recently pondered , " Ca n't someone invent a feminist dating service ?
What would happen if men I tried to date knew up - front that I 'm a feminist and were glad to hear it ? "
So I posted a Craigslist personals W4M ad to test my theory , which consisted of this :

Honestly , I did n't really expect to find any good candidates , but I figured putting the word " liberal " in the headline might deter any unwanted conservatives / freaks and was pleasantly surprised by the outcome .
Out of 68 replies , only four were spam , two included pictures of penises , and two or three were anti-feminist :
Real men do no like left wing feminists .
Just saying .
Feminists killed Marriage and Trust between men and women .
That 's why there 's so many divorces and single parents in the western world .

I hope this one was a joke :
I hope you wrote that ad from the kitchen , where you belong .
Some were frankly honest :
Hi ,
Liked your ad .
But first things first , I may be what you consider a creeper .
I 'm 45 .
But I do n't act my age or look it .
It 's not my expectation you 'll jump in bed with me , or possibly ever be more than friends , but I liked your ad and would at least like to try talking ?

Um , no .
But thanks for the warning , dude .
Others said they were feminist but obviously did n't understand what it meant :
I am a single white college educated 27 year old male who is a strong believer in Female Surpremacy [ sic ] and Feminism .
I love everything about it .
Well , I 'm definitely a feminist : I make sure they pay their own way , that they make the first move a fair share of the time , allow them to drive and make a fair share of the plans and decisions , even !

This one may have been the creepiest :
I am 27 with 4 sisters and was always last in evertything [ sic ] next to them , youngest of 5 kids .
I have been conditioned to know ladies are always right and mostly guys are just jerkoffs , i like ladies that share this opinion .

And then it went on to say some other creepy things about pleasuring himself while talking about women being better than men .
There was even a conservative anti-choice reply :
I know I 'm not " your type " or what - have - you , that being because I'm a Republican who does n't support abortion , I think we'd get along pretty well because I have a better understanding of where you 're coming from than those other nasty Conservatives .

Astonishingly , the majority of replies actually sounded sincere and sweet .
There are real men on Craigslist who like indie bands , are vegetarian , have good grammar and identify themselves as feminist .
Who knew ?
I 'll talk more about them in my next post .
What are your tactics for dating while feminist ?
Do you have criteria ?

Federal authorities investigating allegations that Lance Armstrong and other top cyclists engaged in doping are considering whether they can expand the investigation beyond traditional drug distribution charges to include ones involving fraud and conspiracy , according to two people briefed on the investigation .
The authorities , who are in the early stages of their investigation , are seeking to determine whether Armstrong , the owners and managers of his former cycling teams and his teammates conspired to defraud their sponsors by doping to improve their performances and garner more money and prizes , one of the people said .
In particular , the authorities want to know whether money from the United States Postal Service , the main sponsor of Armstrong ’s team from 1996 to 2004 , was used to buy performance - enhancing drugs , one of the people said .
Fraud charges can carry longer sentences than charges of drug distribution .
The two people briefed on the investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize their access to delicate information .
Armstrong , through his manager , Mark Higgins , did not immediately respond to an e-mail message seeking comment .
Armstrong has repeatedly denied any allegations about doping .
Nancy Marks , a psychic from Lafayette , Colorado , was arrested for fraud after telling clients their " money [ was ] evil " and that she'd take their cursed cash so " the money would suffer " instead .
Marks made at least $ 290,000 using this scam .

Marks - who runs a psychic reading business creatively named Psychic Readings - warned victims that malicious spirits were haunting their bank accounts and that she would take the evil assets off their hands .
Her scam would 've continued had a whistleblower named Linda not contacted police .
According to Linda ,
For each evil spirit that was supposedly around me , she told me a certain number of thousand of dollars that I needed to bring to her [...]
She told me if I did n't give her more and more money , that something terrible would befall my mother .

Marks is charged with two counts of Theft Over $ 20,000 and one count of Criminal Impersonation .
If Marks told you Vigo the Carpathian was exercising demonic influence over your bank account , you can contact detectives at ( 303 ) -665-5571 .

This tart was amazingly good !
I made it for the crowd I feed at the barn , and it was devoured quickly ... always a sign that it 's a hit :)
I used what I had in the house , so it was frozen strawberries , raspberries , and blueberries .
I thawed them , drained all the juice off into the saucepan to simmer with the marmalade .
I did n't have berry liqueur , but had Midori , so I used that ... and reduced it all to 3 Tbsp .
It was beautiful when I first put the berries on , but it soon bled on the mascarpone , and did n't look as pretty .
Next time I will add the berries just prior to serving .
The mascarpone cream was delicious with the berries !
definitely will do again !
( next time with fresh berries )

The oil well spewing crude into the Gulf of Mexico did n't have a remote - control shut - off switch used in two other major oil - producing nations as last - resort protection against underwater spills .
The lack of the device , called an acoustic switch , could amplify concerns over the environmental impact of offshore drilling after the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig last week .
The accident has led to one of the largest ever oil spills in U.S. water and the loss of 11 lives .
On Wednesday federal investigators said the disaster is now releasing 5,000 barrels of oil a day into the Gulf , up from original estimates of 1,000 barrels a day .
U.S. regulators do n't mandate use of the remote - control device on offshore rigs , and the Deepwater Horizon , hired by oil giant BP PLC , did n't have one .
With the remote control , a crew can attempt to trigger an underwater valve that shuts down the well even if the oil rig itself is damaged or evacuated .

With Memorial Day on Monday many of you may be planning to host or attend a celebratory cook out or barbecue to usher in the start of the summer season .
Besides hamburgers and hot dogs there is nothing more essential for a great barbecue that a some refreshing beverages .
Here ’s our recommendation on five tasty brews that will go great with your next barbecue :
1. Pilsner –
When most people think of pilsners they think of thin , watery beers like Coors or Budweiser .
Although those might technically be considered in that style , they ’ve been diluted and watered down so much that hardly resemble any real beer , let alone a traditional pilsner .
It ’s a shame , because a true pilsner can be just the thing too cool off while you fire up the grill .
Real pilsner is light and refreshing with a clean , crisp hop flavor and notes of pine or grapefruit .
Probably the most well known American craft pilsner is Prima Pils from Victory brewing out of Philadelphia .
The Brooklyn Brewery also makes a mean pilsner and lager , which is slightly lighter .
2. Rauchbier – German for “ smoke beer , ” as you might expect , this beer tastes dark and smoky , much like barbecue .
While it might be a bit intense for some , this brews taste makes it the perfect companion for slow cooked barbecue or anything else grilled over an open flame .
Rauchbier remains a rare style , so you may have some trouble finding it , but if you can get your hands on one , it will be like no other beer you ’ve had before .
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Märzen is by far the most popular version of this style and most readily available .
For Collins Brewery , Flying Dog and Victory have all made versions of this style in the past , but they have mostly been one offs and seasonals .
3. Brown Ale –
With their subtle maltiness and light but full - bodied flavor brown ale can be a perfect companion to grilled food .
Personally I think the brown ale is one of the most underrated styles around and is also great way to introduce someone new to craft beer to a darker , more complex taste .
Newcastle is of course the undisputed king of this style , but there are plenty other versions out there worth your time as well .
Samuel Smith is another British brewer who makes a mean brown ale , with of course their signature buttery or diacetyl taste .
Ellie ’s Brown Dog from Avery is a great American brown ale and Smuttynose Old Brown Dog is also worth a taste .
That ’s really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to brown ale , leave us a comment below with your favorites .
4 . Wheat beer –
As I ’ve said before beers made with wheat instead of barley are simply fantastic brews to have around the summer season .
They are full bodied while still being light and crisp with fruity flavors often associated with warmer weather .
Personally I like to go with a nice Hefeweizen like Paulaner or Julius Ecter but a wit can be enjoyable too , like Avery ’s White Rascal , or the infamous Blue Moon .
Whatever wheat beer you choose this weekend , you wo n’t regret it .
5. Saison –
This style is often referred to as farmhouse ale , due to it ’s origins as a thirst quencher on the farms of southern Belgium .
While most farm hands probably no longer toss saison back while plowing the hand , there is no reason why you ca n’t enjoy some while firing up the grill .
Saison is light and spicy , but it gets its peppery flavor not from hops but from real live spices , frequently coriander and grains of paradise .
It ’s one of the few traditional styles that makes extensive use of spices for flavor rather than just hops .
The body is usually crisp , sweet and light , although much more full bodied than say a pilsner .
Saison Dupont is the most well known of this style , and it ’s a great place to start if you have n’t had many saisons in the past .
Hennepin from Ommegang is a really wonderful American version worth a try , as it the Bam Biere from Jolly Pumpkin
Whip
It - Let the good times roll
Paul Dale and Paul Gallagher
31 March 2010
Drew Barrymore ’s directorial debut , Whip
It , is the high - octane story of indie- rock misfit Bliss Cavendar ( Ellen Page ) who escapes small town family life by joining the US roller derby circuit .
But does the film get close to capturing the real excitement of the sport ?
In the spirit of our Glasgow vs Edinburgh issue we ’ve asked old rivals ( actually firm friends ) the Glasgow Irn Bruisers and the Auld Reekie Roller Girls to pass comment .
Interviews by Paul Gallager and Paul Dale .
Irn Bruisers
What did you think of the film ?
Lethal Loulou : I think it ’s brilliant and I think everybody should go and see it !
It ’s really feel - good , and shows why roller derby is so awesome ; how it lets you put such confidence in yourself .
That ’s what the whole film ’s about , because everyone ’s trying to force Bliss into being a beauty pageant queen , and she secretly goes off and plays roller derby and ‘ finds herself ’ and then has the guts to say ‘ this is who I am ’ .
Coco Pox :
If it was a film about a boys ’ sport , we ’ve all seen that kind of thing before , but this is a women ’s sport , where a woman is the hero and the romance stuff takes a back seat .
And she does n’t go off into the sunset ; she goes off to the derby !
Poison Delight :
It is Hollywood - ised , definitely , but there are some elements that are quite true , like the reasons people get into roller derby , and that feeling you get when you ’re with a bunch of girls that you have a lot in common with .
Sarah McMilan :
It was n’t as good as Juno , but it was a step above the generic sports film .
I saw the trailer for it the other night and shivered again ; every time I hear her say ‘ I ’m in love with this ’ I get goosebumps .
Was it a fair representation of the roller derby scene ?
Lethal Loulou :
It was really good for showing what it ’s like in America .
It ’s growing in popularity .
Hundreds of people support teams and they have special warehouses where they can go and train and play games .
We ’re starting to get there and hopefully in a couple of years that might be us getting our own warehouse .
Sarah McMilan :
The age range of the players in the film is great .
You have people like Juliette Lewis and Drew Barrymore who are my age – mid 30s – and that ’s very representative .
Our team ’s ages go up to 43 , and that ’s the wonderful thing about roller derby , it ’s for all women of all shapes and sizes and ages .
Was there anything in particular that you wished it had included ?
Sarah McMilan : I think some bits in it were unnecessary .
But it ’s a Hollywood film , so it ’s a good idea to make it look glamorous and exciting and a bit offbeat .
We do n’t punch people though !
Do n’t get me wrong , it ’s a full - contact sport , but you do n’t punch anyone .
Coco Pox : [ tongue - in- cheek ]
That ’s for the after - party .
Do you think the actors could survive on a Glasgow track ?
Lethal Loulou : Yeah I do .
I think they could give us a good run for our money !
A lot of the skaters in the film are actually real skaters , so it ’s a real representation of the girls who play derby .
Coco Pox : I think that backs up the tag line , ‘ Be your own hero . ’
It ’s not cartoon superheroes , it ’s real people , and there they are on - screen .
And you can tell the actresses from the real skaters from the thickness of their thighs !
Who would play you in a roller derby movie ?
Coco Pox : Sarah would be played by that Gladiator , Jet !
Lethal Loulou : I think it would be hard to find an actress tall enough to play me .
Coco Pox : Maybe Lucy Lawless , from Xena : Warrior Princess ?
Poison Delight : I would need to be someone short …
Sarah McMilan : Ellen Page , perhaps ?
Poison Delight :
Well she can skate already , so yeah !
Coco Pox : Meryl Streep for me , because I ’ve got a weird accent and the same nose as her .
And she ’s about 60 , proving you do n’t have to be young to play roller derby !
Auld Reekie Roller Girls
What did you think of the film ?
Bruise Leigh :
To be honest I did n’t like the film .
It was a kind of chick flick with roller derby in it , which is n’t really my thing .
But apart from that I did n’t think it was very accurate .
There was a lot of bitchiness and cattiness in Whip
It which is the antithesis of what roller derby is about .
This the most open and welcoming group of girls and we have a policy of no bitching , no back - stabbing and that ’s totally the way it is .
On the plus side I suppose it did n’t make it glossy ; all the outfits were still really shoddy and they got the DIY aspect of the sport right .
And the line where one of the characters says ‘ I ’m in love with this ’ rings true .
Was it a fair representation of the roller derby scene ?
Candy Savage :
If you see it for what it is – an American - made , Hollywood type film – it ’s fine .
It ’s a sort of fun Sunday afternoon film .
In the film they play more the derby that was played in the 1970s with a banked track .
They could have portrayed it as it ’s played now because it ’s just as dramatic .
I did , however , love Juliette Lewis in the film , she was awesome .
The film ’s pretty funny and has got some kick - ass girls .
Armalite Angie : I ’m a bigger girl and roller derby is one of those sports where bigger girls can be included as long as you are physically able to take part and the film did n’t really reflect players like me .
There ’s also no upper age limit .
Roller derby is predominantly a female sport but we have committees set up and there is never any internal fighting and there is no discrimination .
Girls do n’t pick on girls or do any of that kind of stuff that happens in the film .
What happens on the track stays on the track .
The depiction of hedonism and extra curricular activities in the film is pretty accurate though .
We have themed parties and really let our hair down after a tournament .
Was there anything in particular that you wished it had included ?
Candy Savage :
The real story should have been how we all find our inner roller derby girl .
I ’m Hannah in real life , but here I ’m Candy Savage .
I stand differently , sit differently … living out that persona is a big part of the sport .
They could have just showed that story .
They did n’t have to use the whole beauty pageant storyline .
I ’m surprised the film has got such a big release .
It needed a bit more bite .
Barrymore was playing it safe .
Do you think Whip
It will raise the profile of the sport ?
Armalite Angie : I ’m hoping the film is going to make people more aware .
I speak to people every day and they have no idea what we do .
They think we line skate and play hockey basically .
The sport is the same but they play on a banked track and you can go over the top but for us the only way is to go down .
Whip
It is on general release from Fri 9 Apr .

Granted , the cardinal rule would be to look for toilet paper before locking yourself up in that particular booth , but we guess naika_tei was in a real tight spot at that point in time .

Image caption Francineide Da Rocha : Cash handouts are small but make a big difference
In the countryside in Maranhao , one of the poorest states in Brazil , life moves slowly in the stifling morning heat .
At her home , not far from the capital Sao Luis , Francineide Da Rocha nurses her baby son Josue , born just 15 days ago , and she stops only to drink water from a freshly - cut coconut .
In this region , some 50 % of the local population such as Francineide are on a form of family income support , known as Bolsa Familia , literally the Family Grant .
The cash transfer scheme puts money directly into the hands of some of Brazil 's lowest income homes .
Across the country , some 12 million families receive the benefit .
It is sometimes described as the largest programme of its kind in the world .
The money is generally given to mothers , who get up to $ 115 ( £ 80 ) a month , depending on their income and how many children they have .
The aid is conditional .
In return , children must attend school and receive the proper vaccinations .
Commercial success
" I think it is good and it helps a lot , " says Francineide .
" When the money comes it is always better because there are many families in Brazil that depend on it , and even though it is a small amount , it makes a big difference . "
My life is different because today I have the means to buy the goods I need Ruti Cunha ( left ) , Clothes shop owner
The new baby is Francineide 's second child , and the monthly assistance she receives from Bolsa Familia will now rise to $ 66 .
It helps to supplement the meagre income she gets from selling vegetables .
Further up the road , her father Joao works on a small plot of land and also receives a helping hand from the state in the form of low interest loans .
Critics say the family grant his daughter receives offers financial help , but no clear route to escape from poverty .
Now Bolsa Familia is being tied in to existing projects which target small investors in both the countryside and the city .
Joao is using the money , which he gets from a scheme known as AgroAmigo administered by the state - run Bank of the North - East , to buy the materials he needs .
" It helps me to get water , to buy seeds , " he says .
" In the past we used to collect them but you can't do that any more .
And this money helps to make things better . "
In nearby Sao Luis , the district of Liberdade is often in the headlines for its high rate of crime and other social problems .
The challenge here is also to give people the means to improve their lives , a chance that some are eager to seize .
Ruti Cunha 's husband is disabled and she is now the lead provider for her family of three .
The main thing is that it is a very small fiscal cost .
That is the big advantage of Bolsa Familia Marcelo Neri , Getulio Vargas Foundation
She already receives the Bolsa Familia grant to help her raise the children .
But after her husband was obliged to stop working , they opened a small clothes shop to make ends meet .
A financial adviser from the Bank of the North - East arranged a low interest loan under the scheme CrediAmigo , and the money helped to refurbish the store .
" My life is different because today I have the means to buy the goods I need , " says Ruti .
" I sell by credit card , or offering credit deals - things that I used to dream of , and now I am able to do it .
I started with a loan of $ 340 and now I have $ 2,800 . "
Bank officials say few people fail to make repayments on these low interest loans while many - especially women - have gone on to commercial success .
At the local market in Liberdade , the results of some of this investment can be seen .
Stall owners who , with a bit of a support , have managed to start out their own business , however small the venture .
' Small fiscal cost '
However the picture is not universally positive .
A short distance from Ruti's home , thousands of families live in what are called " palafitas " , houses built on stilts to keep them above water level .
Image caption Brazil is finding new ways to confront old problems
The families have little access to even basic sanitation or water , and there is a strong smell from the waste that culminates below the fragile wooden houses .
Children play amid the dirt and heavily - armed police officers can be seen patrolling the unpaved lanes .
Nearly 300 families were recently moved out of the area to brightly - painted and newly - constructed flats , but the local residents ' association claims this project has stalled , at least for the moment .
They also complain that in an area like this it is hard to get access to Bolsa Familia .
But analysts say , despite enormous challenges , Brazil is becoming a more equal society .
Bolsa Familia in particular is a cost effective way of helping the poor , says Marcelo Neri , chief economist for social policies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation .
" The main thing is that it is a very small fiscal cost , " he says .
" That is the big advantage of Bolsa Familia .
You spend 0.4 % of GDP , and reach 25 % of the population , which are the poorest .
" Since they are the poorest , a little money can really make a big change in these people 's lives . "
In this year , when Brazil will elect a new president , there seems to be a fairly broad consensus in support of such initiatives , with the only argument about who should get the credit for projects , some of which have been in existence for many years .
The government of President Lula insists the investment is much bigger now , and that in recent years 20 million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty .
It remains all too easy to find evidence of the poor social conditions which disfigure large parts of Brazilian life , such as can be found in parts of Liberdade .
But a picture is also emerging of a country confronting old problems in new ways , helping to improve the lives of many of its citizens .
Is enough being done to protect us from chemicals that could harm us ?
Watch " Toxic America , " a special two - night investigative report with Sanjay Gupta M.D. , June 2 & 3 at 8 p.m. ET on CNN .
( Health.com ) -- Children exposed to higher levels of a type of pesticide found in trace amounts on commercially grown fruit and vegetables are more likely to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than children with less exposure , a nationwide study suggests .
Researchers measured the levels of pesticide byproducts in the urine of 1,139 children from across the United States .
Children with above - average levels of one common byproduct had roughly twice the odds of getting a diagnosis of ADHD , according to the study , which appears in the journal Pediatrics .
Exposure to the pesticides , known as organophosphates , has been linked to behavioral and cognitive problems in children in the past , but previous studies have focused on communities of farm workers and other high - risk populations .
This study is the first to examine the effects of exposure in the population at large .
Organophosphates are " designed " to have toxic effects on the nervous system , says the lead author of the study , Maryse Bouchard , Ph.D. , a researcher in the department of environmental and occupational health at the University of Montreal .
" That 's how they kill pests . "
The pesticides act on a set of brain chemicals closely related to those involved in ADHD , Bouchard explains , " so it seems plausible that exposure to organophosphates could be associated with ADHD - like symptoms . "

Environmental Protection Agency regulations have eliminated most residential uses for the pesticides ( including lawn care and termite extermination ) , so the largest source of exposure for children is believed to be food , especially commercially grown produce .
Adults are exposed to the pesticides as well , but young children appear to be especially sensitive to them , the researchers say .
Detectable levels of pesticides are present in a large number of fruits and vegetables sold in the U.S. , according to a 2008 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture cited in the study .
In a representative sample of produce tested by the agency , 28 percent of frozen blueberries , 20 percent of celery , and 25 percent of strawberries contained traces of one type of organophosphate .
Other types of organophosphates were found in 27 percent of green beans , 17 percent of peaches , and 8 percent of broccoli .
Although kids should not stop eating fruits and vegetables , buying organic or local produce whenever possible is a good idea , says Bouchard .

" Organic fruits and vegetables contain much less pesticides , so I would certainly advise getting those for children , " she says .
" National surveys have also shown that fruits and vegetables from farmers ' markets contain less pesticides even if they 're not organic .
If you can buy local and from farmers ' markets , that 's a good way to go . "
A direct cause - and - effect link between pesticides and ADHD " is really hard to establish , " says Dana Boyd Barr , Ph.D. , a professor of environmental and occupational health at Emory University .
However , she says , " There appears to be some relation between organophosphate pesticide exposure and the development of ADHD . "
This is the largest study of its kind to date , according to Barr , who researched pesticides for more than 20 years in her previous job with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but was not involved in the study .
Bouchard and her colleagues analyzed urine samples from children ages 8 to 15 .
The samples were collected during an annual , nationwide survey conducted by the CDC , known as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .

Do you have adult ADHD ?
The researchers tested the samples for six chemical byproducts ( known as metabolites ) that result when the body breaks down more than 28 different pesticides .
Nearly 95 percent of the children had at least one byproduct detected in their urine .
Just over 10 percent of the children in the study were diagnosed with ADHD .
The kids were judged to have ADHD if their symptoms ( as reported by parents ) met established criteria for the disorder , or if they had taken ADHD medication regularly in the previous year .

The link between drugs , alcohol and ADHD
One group of pesticide byproducts was associated with a substantially increased risk of ADHD .
Compared with kids who had the lowest levels , the kids whose levels were 10 times higher were 55 percent more likely to have ADHD .
( Another group of byproducts did not appear to be linked to the disorder . )
In addition , children with higher - than - average levels of the most commonly detected byproduct -- found in roughly 6 in 10 kids -- were nearly twice as likely to have ADHD .
" It 's not a small effect , " says Bouchard .
" This is 100 percent more risk . "
To isolate the effect of the pesticide exposure on ADHD symptoms , the researchers controlled for a variety of health and demographic factors that could have skewed the results .
Still , the study had some limitations and is not definitive , Bouchard says .
Most notably , she and her colleagues measured only one urine sample for each child , and therefore were n't able to track whether the levels of pesticide byproducts were constant , or whether the association between exposure and ADHD changed over time .
Health.com :
What if my child begins showing ADHD symptoms ?
Long - term studies including multiple urine samples from the same children are needed , Bouchard says .
She suspects such studies would show an even stronger link between pesticide byproducts and ADHD .
EPA spokesman Dale Kemery said in a statement that the agency routinely reviews the safety of all pesticides , including organophosphates .
" We are currently developing a framework to incorporate data from studies similar to this one into our risk assessment , " Kemery said .
" We will look at this study and use the framework to decide how it fits into our overall risk assessment . "
Kemery recommended that parents try other pest - control tactics before resorting to pesticide use in the home or garden .
Washing and peeling fruits and vegetables and eating " a varied diet " will also help reduce potential exposure to pesticides , he said .
" I would hope that this study raises awareness as to the risk associated with pesticide exposure , " Bouchard says .
" There 's really only a handful of studies on this subject out there , so there 's room for more awareness . "
May 13 , 2010 : This weekend , Venus and the crescent Moon are gathering in the western sky for a spectacular conjunction , and they 're not alone .
The International Space Station and , very likely , space shuttle Atlantis will join them for a rare four - way meeting of spaceships and planets over many locations .

The show begins at sunset when Venus and the Moon emerge from the twilight in close proximity to one another .
The Moon will be exquisitely slender , a 5 % crescent on Saturday , May 15th , and a slightly fatter 10 % crescent on Sunday , May 16th .
Between the horns of the crescent , a ghostly image of the full Moon can be seen .
That 's " Earthshine " — the light of our own planet reflected back toward us by the Moon 's dark terrain .
In conjunction with Venus , a crescent Moon with Earthshine is regarded as one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens .
Into this tableau of surpassing beauty comes a spaceship -- and maybe two !
The International Space Station is due to fly over many US towns and cities this weekend .
The ISS appears just after sunset , about the same time as the Venus - Moon encounter , and it glides slowly across the sky shining as brightly as Venus herself .
Check NASA 's SkyWatch web site to see if you are favored with a flyby and to find out exactly when to look .
If the ISS appears over your hometown , Atlantis is likely to be there as well .
The shuttle is scheduled to launch from the Kennedy Space Center on Friday , May 14th , at 2:20 pm EDT ( updates ) .
It would then spend the weekend catching up and docking with the ISS , appearing as a distinct point of light in company with the brighter space station .
People who have seen double flybys of station and shuttle say it is even better than a Venus - Moon conjunction .
Something about two spacecraft gliding silently together among the stars multiplies the beauty and wonder far beyond a factor of two .

This kind of station - shuttle double flyby is rare and soon to be a thing of the past .
With only three flights remaining , the shuttle program is coming to an end .
Indeed , this is the last scheduled flight of Atlantis and the last time it can appear side - by - side with the ISS in the night sky .
Atlantis 's 12 - day mission to the ISS helps lay the groundwork for the post - shuttle era .
The orbiter will deliver thousands of pounds of supplies and spare parts , plus a new Russian research module and a European robotic arm .
Astronauts plan to conduct three spacewalks totaling almost 20 hours to install batteries , an antenna and other hardware around the exterior of the station .
Flying through the sunset in the company of ISS , Venus and the crescent Moon is a nice way for Atlantis to wave goodbye .
Just do n't forget to wave back .

If you do n’t know who Harold Mabern is , it ’s time you did .
The legendary pianist has played with everyone and is on the records of Lee Morgan , Hank Mobley , and Freddie Hubbard , just to name a few .
I had the great honor of studying privately with him for over a year .
Not only is he an incredible musician , but he ’s also one of the warmest , most vibrant , and positive people I ’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing .
Harold possesses great knowledge and he loves to share it .
Sometimes he ’d have a dozen students surrounding him listening intently to his incredible stories and words of wisdom .
Here are three gems of knowledge that he repeated to me over and over during the time I spent with him .
1. ) Your Ear Is Your Fakebook
Harold would constantly point to his ear while energetically expressing , “ This is your fakebook !
This is your fakebook !!! ”
He wanted to emphasize that you have to get tunes operating loud and clearly in your ear and to never be dependent on anything else .
The same goes for everything .
Get rid of your crutches and trust your instincts .
Start to think of your ear as your fakebook and soon it will be .
2. ) Be Greedy For The Music
He frequently said that you have to be greedy for the music like John Coltrane .
Pursue all types of music .
Anything you love , just absorb it .
Figure it out and have fun doing it .
Harold listens to and plays all types of music because he is greedy for the music .
Music or not , you have to be passionate about what you ’re doing and always be striving to soak up more knowledge because you genuinely love it .
Remember to always be greedy for the music .
3. ) I can Inspire You , But You Have to Motivate Yourself
I love this phrase and it is so important .
Harold asked me once to describe the difference between inspiration and motivation .
The point he wanted to convey was that inspiration is an external force acting on you , whereas motivation arises internally .
Think of a time you felt very inspired .
The energy .
The drive .
What happened to that force ?
Did it materialize into something positive in your life , or did it gently fade away ?
Next time you get inspired , know that it ’s up to you to then motivate yourself and turn that energy into action .
Speaking of getting inspired , check out Harold Mabern being featured with the George Coleman Octet !
Harold ’s wisdom continually inspires and encourages me .
He ’s got a lot of knowledge and taking his words to heart will serve you well .

Some Americans are slowly realizing that reformers , whether “ progressives ” or “ liberals , ” are inherently opposed to the majority because of the psychology of reformism .
Pat Buchanan is one of the few Americans who dare write about race .
If you write about race , it ’s assumed you are anti-equality , and the only blasphemy of this time is to be against our egalitarian ideal .
Otherwise , why would you be writing about race , as we crusade onward toward total equality ?
He poses a vital question that extends beyond race , however :
If Kagan is confirmed , the Court will consist of three Jews and six Catholics ( who represent not quite a fourth of the country ) , but not a single Protestant , though Protestants remain half the nation and our founding faith .
If Kagan is confirmed , three of the four justices nominated by Democratic presidents will be from New York City : Kagan from the Upper West Side , Sotomayor from the Bronx , Ruth Bader Ginsburg from Brooklyn .
Breyer is from San Francisco .
What kind of diversity is this â€ ” either in geography or life experience ?
– “ Are Liberals Anti-WASP ? , ” Patrick J. Buchanan , May 14 , 2010
When he asks “ Are Liberals Anti-WASP ? , ” Buchanan breaks through to a bigger underlying question .
Race ( which includes the distinctions between Caucasians , such as WASP — Western European — and Southern , Eastern and Semitic Euripids ) is a subset of social status and rank , which in itself as an issue is a subset of our quest for equality .
But why do we quest for equality ?
It has become our holy grail , even though it was not to our founding fathers — they believed in political equality as a means to an end of avoiding tyranny , but nothing else .
Instead , in the postwar period the West has become obsessed with achieving equality of results where its forefathers were concerned with equality of opportunity .
To understand this paradox , we must look into the mind of a reformer .
Let us for the moment glide over the decision to become a reformer , and the high correlation with anger at one ’s parents ; instead , let us assume that we have decided we are reformers , and pick any stripe you want : progressive , liberal , leftist , Christian , you name it .
Once you have decided to become a reformer , you find yourself needing to make a good case for your position , socially .
You will be explaining to friends , co-workers , neighbors and potential converts the reasons why you are a reformer .
You need a convincing argument that works in multiple scenarios — from academia to man - on - the - street — so you ’re going to use the lowest common denominator , which is an appeal to the fears and hopes of the individual .
For this reason , you ’re going to explain what you ’re doing as moral good .
You are trying to achieve reform ; it is all positive .
By the binary nature of moral good and evil , then , those who oppose you are negative or bad .
Well , who are they ?
If the system is unjust , as you are arguing , that means that those who are thriving in it now must also be unjust or at least unconcerned that it is unjust .
They are selfish .
They are moral bad .
And because reformers start as a minority , these morally bad people are always the majority .
In fact , this is the easiest narrative of reform to suggest : the majority ( we do n’t need to name names , but everyone out there , present company excepted of course ! ) is selfish and does n’t care about the injustice perpetrated .
So what do we propose in response ?
Equality , or the idea that everyone gets the same amount of wealth .
It ’s so simple it ’s catchy like a Taylor Swift tune and hard to get out of your head : the problem is that some are selfish , so spread the money around , and we will have defeated selfishness .
The problem with this approach is that it ’s not scientific ; in fact , it ’s an inversion of the scientific method .
In the laboratory , we study reality and then make conjectures that we test and refine .
In reformist politics , we first look at the theory we want to support , and then invent arguments against it .
If we start out assuming that our society is broken , that leads us to demonize anyone who is not like us a reformer .
It ’s a tautological and cult - like mentality .
If I have learned anything from America , it is that as a whole Americans like justice .
But the idea of justice is split between the reformers and the rest , who because they are not reformers and therefore must like our civilization as it is , get lumped in with “ conservatives . ”
Regular people believe in equality of opportunity and avoiding injustice , or singling someone out for punishment without cause .
In their view , if a meritocracy is in place , then society is working .
They do not expect fairness from life , but they do want a system they can learn and understand how to succeed in , even if there are missteps on the way .
Their idea of tolerance is that they will allow others to live among them , and they will protect the political rights of these others .
Reformers by the nature of needing to reform argue for equality of outcome , because outcome is what we have to measure and it provides a good justification for being a reformer .
They will always point to inequality of outcome as a sure sign of a problem , and will always suggest a universalist response , namely equal division of wealth and power .
In order to achieve reform , they need control , which necessitates an ongoing and permanent split between oppressor and oppressed in which the inequal state of the oppressed becomes a perennial justification for reform and for reformers to gain control .
The result is an impassable chasm : regular people want to continue living in a system that while imperfect joins a long line of imperfect systems , including nature herself if seen through a purely human perspective ( we can be eaten ) .
Reformers need power , and will justify it with the presence of the oppressed , which leads them to construe the majority as the oppressors and thus hate them with the ferocity of a skinhead .
Reformism is an inevitable path toward hating the majority in your country .
Regular people tend to see their way of life as natural , and reform as “ artificial , ” mainly because a conservative approach to life is organic .
We set up a civilization , and see who is able to take care of themselves and take advantage of the opportunity offered .
We try to make sure it ’s roughly meritocratic but do n’t look too closely because we know that everywhere on earth , someone is gaming every system .
Instead , we want to make sure that if someone is dedicated , they can succeed even if at first they meet small injustices .
This view is compatible with both the human spirit and the scientific method .
It allows us to not see the world through a negative light , as reformers must , since the need for reform implies an inherent injustice .
It also allows us to support a kind of natural selection in our own community , where we struggle for success in a flawed but consistent world .
It forces us to understand our world and meet it halfway , in contrast to reforms which try to set up a purely “ human ” order of equality which lets us avoid understanding the world , so long as we understand the social dogma of equality .
Buchanan and others are probably traumatized by the class warfare and its subset , racial antagonism , that comes with a dying
West that has been wracked by reformers for nearly a millennium .
As a result , they are asking whether racial hatred or class hatred is the force dividing us .
In actuality , we are divided by the existence of a self - described minority who have convinced themselves that because they are having trouble , the system is unjust , and therefore needs them to become reformers .
This backward logic creates distrust and hoodwinks many people , since “ the problem is that society is n’t equal , and we need to make it equal ” is both simple and catchy enough to be more tempting than complex treatises on economics and history .
The result has produced a neurotic culture that runs into conflict with others because it does not know itself :
In a sense , the evils of Islam are largely externalized and really amount to blaming the wrong party .
It should be acknowledged that we in the West are often the problem , not the Muslims , due to our failure to value that Christian and Western culture that we have all but discarded .
Poor Muslims seeking work in wealthy Europe have not set out with a plan to overwhelm the West any more than a Mexican picking tomatoes in the Imperial Valley is doing so in hopes of creating Mexifornia .
– “ More on the Clash of Civilizations , ” Philip Giraldi , American Conservative , May 11 , 2010
The title of that article , like the one cited above it , says more than the article contents .
It references historian Samuel Huntington ’s The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order , a book that suggests that instead of being the ultimate evolution of humankind , liberal democracy is an unstable order because it fails to connect citizens to real meaning that is central to their lives .
Equality and freedom after all are facilitative goals , not prescriptive ones , and as a result they do not give their citizens something to shoot for .
“ Do this and you will be rewarded because we all agree it is good ” may be the message of the future , not “ you can do whatever you want and no one will judge you . ”
People want “ organic , ” or “ whole , ” societies of this nature .
They make clear what values are held in common , and these values are not divided by conflict between genders , religion , science , government , social activity and economics — rather , these are all acting in unison with the same set of values expressed in each according to its specific language and needs .
They also make clear that actions toward that value system are valued by every member of society , so that anyone striving toward actions compatible with those values should be rewarded .
Without an organic and unifying whole to a society , we are left with dogma and bureaucracy .
Reformers , by their desire to “ fix ” an organic system and replace it with a fair one , inevitably create powerful governments to enforce equality .
However , those governments are essentially large bureaucracies with no memory and so they are easily gamed .
Here ’s David Brooks on the type of Nietzschean “ last man ” who games the system :
About a decade ago , one began to notice a profusion of Organization Kids at elite college campuses .
These were bright students who had been formed by the meritocratic system placed in front of them .
They had great grades , perfect teacher recommendations , broad extracurricular interests , admirable self - confidence and winning personalities .
If they had any flaw , it was that they often had a professional and strategic attitude toward life .
They were not intellectual risk - takers .
They regarded professors as bosses to be pleased rather than authorities to be challenged .
As one admissions director told me at the time , they were prudential rather than poetic .
If you listen to people talk about Elena Kagan , it is striking how closely their descriptions hew to this personality type .
– “ What It Takes , ” by David Brooks , The New York Times , May 10 , 2010
Reformers are inherently system kids .
They do n’t want to deal with the vagaries of nature or culture ; they want a bureaucracy that they can game .
Since all bureaucracies are gamed by justification , it ’s no surprise that reformers act via justification .
They do not want to deal with ambiguity .
They want to set up a centralized authority and decentralized dogma that will reward them not for results , but for intention .
This way they can please others and get ahead without taking actual risks .
Regular people fear this mentality because they know how easily systems are gamed , producing results “ on paper ” without achieving actual results .
Regular people are beginning to fear that “ reform ” is another type of “ bread and circuses ” approach to government : tell people it ’s not their fault , let them destroy those they ’d like to think oppressed them , redistribute wealth and centralize authority .
The backlash is surprising in its stealth .
While my co-writers have covered the Tea Party and its nuances , it may be a fading phenomenon — more of a flare sent up to rally the troops than the movement of the troops themselves .
What it has done is generate a series of legislative motions to stop the oppressor - oppressed dialogue from being sponsored by the state :
Under the law signed on Tuesday , any school district that offers classes designed primarily for students of particular ethnic groups , advocate ethnic solidarity or promote resentment of a race or a class of people would risk losing 10 percent of its state financing .
â€ œGovernor Brewer signed the bill because she believes , and the legislation states , that public school students should be taught to treat and value each other as individuals and not be taught to resent or hate other races or classes of people , â€  Paul Senseman , a spokesman for the governor , said in a statement on Thursday .
– “ Citing Individualism , Arizona Tries to Rein in Ethnic Studies in School ” , by Tamar Lewin , The New York Times , May 13 , 2010
What they ’re trying to do here is reverse a reversed narrative of justice .
The normal narrative of justice is that we set up a meritocracy , and punish those who do unfair things .
The reversed narrative of justice is that we assume things are unjust , and subsidize those who perceive unfairness might have happened .
When that narrative is re-reversed , we see a new idea being the conduit : our system may not be perfect , but we are against taking from the successful to subsidize people whose claim on injustice remains unproven , especially after 150 years of increasing civil rights legislation .
Look for this issue — long dormant in American society , probably since the founding of the country — to explode in the future .
The next targets will be welfare , and after that , affirmative action and other entitlement programs based on presumed injustice by skin color or religion .
Paradoxically , by going through this process of defining ourselves and getting our narrative of fairness back on track , we will learn more about fairness and thus have more of it in our foreign and domestic policies .

Vettel came second in Monaco behind team - mate Mark Webber
Red Bull 's Sebastian Vettel will race on a different chassis at next week 's Turkish Grand Prix after a defect was found on the one he used in Monaco .
Vettel complained of handling problems during the Monaco race , where he came second , and a post - race inspection revealed an unspecified flaw .
Team boss Christian Horner said the change to a chassis used earlier in the season was a precautionary measure .
" We found the chassis had a minor defect , " said Horner .
" It looks as if it is an issue that deteriorated during the race in Monaco . "
Vettel , 22 , is second in the drivers ' championship behind Australian team - mate Mark Webber , who has won the last two grands prix , in Spain and Monaco , from pole position .
German Vettel is level on 78 points with Webber but the Australian leads by two to one on race wins .
Horner said the problem with the chassis was detected in the post - race inspection back at the factory and tallied with comments Vettel had made about his car 's handling during the previous race .
Webber finished second to world champion Jenson Button in Turkey last year , with Vettel third .
The Red Bull drivers are favourites to win the title this year , with the team already leading the constructors ' championship , 20 points ahead of Ferrari .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that ' secular socialism ' has ' infiltrated ' the nation 's courts , the Congress , academia , the bureaucracy , Hollywood and the news media .
Newt : Left a worse threat than terror
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich on Wednesday said that " secular socialism " has " infiltrated " the nation 's courts , the Congress , academia , the bureaucracy , Hollywood and the news media and is " even more disturbing than the threats from foreign terrorists . "
Gingrich was plugging his new book " To Save America : Stopping Obama 's Secular Socialist Machine " in an article in Human Events .
Advertisement
" In the 20th Century , America fought and defeated Nazism , Fascism , Imperialism and Communism — four existential threats to our survival , ” he writes .
“ In this century , America is facing two different kinds of threats , though no less grave , ” Gingrich continued .
“ This time , the threat does not come from nation - state superpowers , but from non-state networks , each pursuing an agenda based upon radical ideologies . ”
The first threat the Georgia Republican identifies is “ non-state terrorist networks to kill Americans . ”
" But even more disturbing than the threats from foreign terrorists is a second threat that is right here at home , " he writes .
" It is an ideology so fundamentally at odds with historic American values that it threatens to undo the cultural ethics that have made our country great .
I call it ' secular - socialism . '
" The Left has thoroughly infiltrated nearly every cultural commanding height of our civilization , " he says .
" That is , they hold power , influence and control of academia , the elite news media , Hollywood , union leaders , trial lawyers , the courts , the Congress , and the bureaucracy at all levels of government . "
“ Barack Obama is the most radical President in American history , " he goes on .
" His administration combines the radicalism of Saul Alinsky , the corruption of Springfield , and the machine politics of Chicago .
If they succeed in completing their agenda while in power , America will face becoming a European - style , high - tax , big - bureaucracy , low - economic - growth state . ”
Gingrich ’s rhetoric against Democrats — mostly focused on Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan — has become more heated in the last week as he has been promoting his new book .
At the conclusion of his short column , Gingrich states that “ the question before us is simple . ”
“ Will we be able to save America before it is too late ? ” he asks , with a hyperlink to his book ’s page on Amazon.com .
Cannibal trial halted after juror falls ill looking at pictures of girl , 16 , who was ' eaten with potatoes '
Victim : Karina Barduchian
The trial of two Russian men accused of chopping up a 16 - year - old girl and eating her with potatoes has been postponed after a juror fell ill looking at prosecution images .
The case was postponed after the juror had to be excused while examining photographs of student Karina Barduchian after her death .
Maxim Golovatskikh and his friend florist Yury Mozhnov , both 20 , are accused of drowning Karina Barduchian , in a bath , then carving up her body and serving her meat with potatoes to a lodger .
Before the case was halted , the lodger , Ekaterina Zinovyeva , told the court in St Petersburg they had a party with their Goth friends on the night of the murder in January , 2009 .
Karina , who was in love with Golovatskikh , stayed the night , she said .
' Maxim and Karina went to the bathroom together and I went to bed , ' she told the court .
' I was sleepy but heard splashes of water and some noise there but was not worried .
Sometime later I woke up and decided to check what was going on .
' I went to the bathroom but Yury stopped me on the way and told me to go back to bed .
' They had joked earlier that they could kill Karina but , of course , I could n't believe for a second that they were serious . '
Next day when she got home from work , Maxim and Yury offered Ekaterina meat and potatoes .
She allegedly ate it not knowing where it was from .
The men later hid the rest of Karina 's remains in garbage skips , it is alleged .
Accused : Maxim Golovatskikh , left , who Karina was in love with ; and right , his friend Yury Mozhnov
' They cut up the body of the victim into several pieces , eating some of them and throwing the others into the bin , ' said prosecutor Andrei Lavrenko .
' They cooked her meat and served up the meal with potatoes .
' They were interrogated and explained the murder by saying they were desperate to eat . '
The deputy head of St Petersburg criminal investigations Sergei Strelin said : ' They confessed their guilt straight away .
They explained they were hungry and drunk . '
The victim had defied her mother in continuing to see Golovatskikh , who was also the lead singer in a minor pop group in Russia 's second city .
Her mother Nadya , 45 , said : ' Our lives are ruined by Karina 's death and the horrible way she died . '
The two accused are due to give evidence when the case resumes this week .
Pour 1 % de leur prix sur le marché , des objets et outils se fabriquent dans de petits ateliers industriels utilisant allègrement logiciels libres et nouvelles technologies .
Les « fabuleux ateliers » , ou fab - labs , ouvrent une nouvelle voie alliant hautes technologies , auto - production , récupération et recyclage .
La seule condition reste votre participation .
Photo : un fab - lab dans le Bronx , à New York , soutenu par l’association Sustainable South Bronx .
Nul besoin de refreiner vos désirs ou de remettre à demain ce qui vous est nécessaire aujourd ’hui : faites - le vous - même !
De fabuleux laboratoires , les fab - labs ( contraction de « fabrication » et « laboratory » en anglais ) , vous proposent de construire presque tout , de votre machine à laver à votre ordinateur sur mesure en passant par la chaise en bois au design personnalisé .
Le plus souvent avec des matériaux recyclés .
Quand le consommateur devient créateur
Conçus comme des lieux de production , les fab - labs sont parfois comparés à de petites usines clés en main .
A la différence de l’atelier classique , le Fab - Lab se construit en même temps que ce qu’il produit .
Il s’ajuste à un projet , à la conception d’un objet ou d’une astuce technologique .
Le fabuleux laboratoire se pense comme un espace dans lequel viennent se partager des compétences , des nouvelles technologies et l’art de la récup .
On y trouve des outils les plus rudimentaires aux machines plus sophistiqués pilotés par des logiciels : scie , découpeuse , fraiseuse , logiciels libres et petits robots .
L’idée est née dans les années 1990 au sein d’un laboratoire de l’Institut de Technologie du Massachusetts ( MIT ) , puis a lentement mais sûrement cheminé .
Ce concept , assez exotique , a pris de l’ampleur avec la popularisation des nouvelles technologies .
La barrière d’usage des technologies de l’information s’est effondrée et , aujourd ’hui , les Fab - labs éclosent un peu partout sur le globe , de l ’Afrique du Sud à l’Islande , du Costa Rica à l’Afghanistan , jusqu’à Paris [ 1 ] .
Pour son inventeur , Niel Gernshenfeld , professeur au MIT , le consommateur cesse d’être client , il devient créateur .
Dans son livre , FAB , la prochaine révolution sur votre bureau [ 2 ] , il affirme , utopiste , qu’au lieu « de fournir les technologies de l’information aux masses , les Fab - labs leur montrent qu’il est possible de leur donner des outils qui leur permettent de développer et de trouver des solutions technologiques locales à des problèmes locaux . »
Anti-copyright
La véritable origine d’un fab - lab , c’est une communauté de créateurs et d’entrepreneurs .
Parfois spontané , ou dans le sillage des hackers , le fab - lab pousse souvent dans une nébuleuse d’activistes anti-copyrights et d’inventeurs afin de faire fructifier des savoir - faire licites et illicites .
L’objectif : réaliser des prototypes innovants ou simplement utiles .
Ainsi à Vitry , le « Tmp/ lab » s’emploie à essaimer ses recherches et présente en open source l’avancement de ses projets .
A la manière d’une poupée russe , un fab - lab peut en cacher un autre .
Dans une ancienne menuiserie du 10ème arrondissement de Paris , l’agence Nod-A , fondée par Stéphanie Bacquère et Marie - Noéline Viguié , participe à l’élaboration de fab - labs .
Stéphanie Bacquère sort de son tiroir un Lego : «
Pas besoin d’être riche , ni un génie !
Nous travaillons à des logiciels instruisant de petits robots , et ces logiciels pourront être utilisés par des enfants de six ans qui pourront fabriquer eux même leurs jeux de Lego ! »
Pour elle , tout l’intérêt des fab - labs réside dans l’autonomie qu’il procure .
«
Vous pouvez vous débarrassez des grandes marques qui en général tentent de verrouiller leurs trouvailles pour que vous ne puissiez ni les dupliquer ni les réparer ».
Terminés les services après-vente .
Téléchargez une maquette de vélo ou un plan de machine à laver .
Grâce à une imprimante 3D qui fabrique de petits objets et d’autres machines qui découpent et plient , vous n’avez plus qu’à faire l’assemblage .
« Imaginez dans chaque quartier , au coin des rues ou dans une MJC ces ateliers industriels à la portée de tous ...

A quand des fab - labs à proximité de potagers partagés ?
La haute technologie de Bamako aux favelas de São Paulo
Le contenu et la forme des fab - labs varient selon ses usages .
Là où les produits high - techs sont pour la plupart inaccessibles , ils servent de passerelles technologiques au bénéfice de tous .
Une radio numérique peut envoyer des contenus vidéo de formation dans une zone reculée du Mali grâce à des astuces trouvées en fab - lab . «
Un kit de puces électroniques à 20 euros et un simple manuel peuvent suffire à produire des objets de haute technologie !
Vous y ajoutez un peu de recyclage et un zeste de débrouille : votre objet est réalisé .
Dans les bidonvilles de São Paolo ou de Bamako , les fab - labs sont en plein essor parce qu’ils s‘appuient sur le transfert de compétence et l’entraide » , se réjouit Stéphanie Bacquere .
Ils s’insèrent également dans une chaîne de production locale .
Ainsi , en Inde , un fab - lab fabrique des appareils pour mesurer la qualité du lait de petits producteurs .
En Europe , un fab - lab élabore plutôt des prototypes ou du sur-mesure .
Des pépinières de fab - labs peuvent relocaliser et dynamiser la production d’un territoire .
« Le fab - lab a une vocation de prototypage d’objets physiques et " intelligents " .
Il s’adresse aux entrepreneurs , aux designers et aux artistes .
Le plus difficile n’est pas de lancer un fab - lab , mais davantage qu’une communauté d’usagers - concepteurs le pérennise » , explique Daniel Kaplan , de la Fondation Internet nouvelle génération ( Fing ) .
L’idée s’étend comme un rhizome puisque Jean - Paul Huchon , président de la région Île - de - France , prévoit une Cité du numérique à vocation mondiale équipée d’un fab - lab non loin de la Villette .
Daniel Kaplan confirme l’ouverture imminente de fab - labs à Paris .
Fing square , une pépinière d’artistes , de designers , et d’entrepreneurs - devrait développer des fab - labs au déploiement rapide et composés d’une série d’outils cohérents pour le bénéfice du plus grand nombre .
Mao risque de se retourner dans sa tombe .
Une révolution culturelle spontanée se prépare en Europe : intellos , ingénieurs et artistes , tous au travail dans ces fabuleux ateliers !
Mais attention , les créateurs de logiciels libres de droits des fab - labs verraient d’un très mauvais œil ces ateliers laboratoires déposer des brevets .
Sens du partage contre logique marchande ...
Échapperont - ils longtemps à l’implacable domination de la rentabilité financière ?
Le concept de fab - lab ouvre en tout cas de fabuleuses perspectives en matière d’innovation sociale .

The Rule of Three
As Joshua Bloch says in his talk „ API Design and why it matters “ :
Write multiple plug-ins before release !
If you write one , it probably wo n't support another .
If you write two , it will support more with difficulty .
If you write three , it will work fine .
In a recent post of mine on the Clojure group I encountered exactly this rule .
So let 's explore it using the example of clojure .
core / memoize .
Note :
You might also be interested in the follow - up .
`memoize`
There is a function in clojure .
core which is called memoize .
You provide it another function f and memoize will give you a function , which calls f with its arguments and caches the result .
Calling the function again with some previous set of arguments will not call f again , but will return the cached result .
Caching Strategies
However , memoize uses a quite naive strategy to cache values : once a value is in the cache , it will be there forever .
This can lead to some serious memory usage depending the arguments and the return values of f .
One way to remedy this it to provide different strategies as is done eg .
here for a time - to - live strategy or in the thread where I posted my above mentioned message .
However one thing both approaches have in common , is that they have to define their own version of memoize .
So I thought about how memoize could be made more general .
Taking out the Strategy
So first let us make the strategy an option in a backward compatible way .
( defn memoize ( [ f ] ( memoize f ( fn [ c _ ] c ) ) ) ( [ f strategy ] ( let [ cache ( ref {} ) ] ( fn [ & args ] ( if - let [ e ( find @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( dosync ( if - let [ e ( find @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( let [ result ( apply f args ) ] ( alter cache assoc args result ) ( alter cache strategy args ) result ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
This implements the naive strategy .
The strategy is now a separate function which acts on the cache and the function arguments .
In the default cache we simply return the original cache , so we get the naive behaviour of the current memoize as it is in clojure .
core .
Adding our second Strategy : first - in - first - out
Now let 's add the bound FIFO strategy from the above mentioned thread .
( defn fifo - cache [ bound ] ( let [ values ( ref clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY
) ] ( fn [ cache args ] ( alter values conj args ) ( if ( > ( count @ values ) bound ) ( let [ k ( peek @ values ) ] ( alter values pop ) ( dissoc cache k ) ) cache ) ) ) )
We store all encountered argument lists in a queue .
Whenever we hit the given limit we remove items in FIFO order from the cache .
So the cache will never grow beyond the given limit .
To use this strategy we can now simply pass it to the new memoize .
( memoize f ( fifo - cache 5 ) )
But before we are jumping too high in our joy , let 's remember the title of our post : „ The Rule of Three “ .
So let 's add another strategy .
The third Strategy : least - recently - used
Here we keep track of the items , which were requested recently .
If we hit the given limit the longest unused items are removed from the cache .
But wait .
How can we implement this ?
We need to store the time when an item was last requested .
But this is currently not possible .
To implement such a strategy we need another hook which also keeps track of the read accesses to the cache .
So let 's modify our already modified memoize and then implement the new strategy .
( defn memoize ( [ f ] ( memoize f [ find ( fn [ c _ ] c ) ] ) ) ( [ f [ cache - lookup cache - update ] ] ( let [ cache ( ref {} ) ] ( fn [ & args ] ( if - let [ e ( cache - lookup @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( dosync ( if - let [ e ( cache - lookup @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( let [ result ( apply f args ) ] ( alter cache assoc args result ) ( alter cache cache - update args ) result ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn lru-cache [ bound ] ( let [ values ( ref {} ) ] [ ( fn lru - cache - lookup [ cache args ] ( when - let [ e ( find cache args ) ] ( dosync ( alter values assoc args ( System/currentTimeMillis ) ) ) e ) ) ( fn lru -cache - update [ cache args ] ( alter values assoc args ( System/currentTimeMillis ) ) ( if ( > ( count @ values ) bound ) ( let [ k ( apply min-key @ values ( keys @ values ) ) ] ( alter values dissoc k ) ( dissoc cache k ) ) cache ) ) ] ) ) ( memoize f ( lru-cache 5 ) )
Of course the fifo - cache must be altered also to fit the new interface .
In this case we can just use clojure .
core / find as lookup function .
Ok .
Let 's summarise the whole thing and implement some more example strategies :
first - in - first - out
least - recently - used
time - to-live
least - used
So here we go :
( defn memoize " Returns a memoized version of a referentially transparent function .
The memoized version of the function keeps a cache of the mapping from arguments to results and , when calls with the same arguments are repeated often , has higher performance at the expense of higher memory use .
Optionally takes a cache strategy consisting of a lookup function and a cache update function .
The lookup function should return the map entry from the cache or nil of the argument list is not registered in the cache ( cf. clojure.core / find ) . " ( [ f ] ( memoize f [ find ( fn [ c _ ] c ) ] ) ) ( [ f [ cache - lookup cache - update ] ] ( let [ cache ( ref {} ) ] ( fn [ & args ] ( if - let [ e ( cache - lookup @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( dosync ( if - let [ e ( cache - lookup @ cache args ) ] ( val e ) ( let [ result ( apply f args ) ] ( alter cache assoc args result ) ( alter cache cache - update args ) result ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defn fifo - cache - strategy " Implements a first - in - first - out cache strategy .
When the given limit is reached , items from the cache will be dropped in insertion order . " [ limit ] [ find ( let [ values ( ref clojure.lang.PersistentQueue/EMPTY

Upon access to the cache all expired items will be removed .
The time to live is defined by the given expiry time span .

An attempt to kill HB 1284 , the medical marijuana regulatory bill , fell short yesterday -- and that 's fine by Sensible Colorado 's Brian Vicente , a prominent MMJ advocate .
" I think we 're seeing desperation on the side of law enforcement , " he says , " and I also think they can't see the forest for the trees .
They 're so sued to being in the prohibitionist mindset that they can't possibly fathom regulating marijuana . "
According to Vicente , who spent Monday at the Capitol , " you had a coalition of law enforcement bringing a resolution for a referendum that would have explicitly destroyed dispensaries .
It would have said they were illegal under state law and would have heaped all kinds of really onerous requirements on caregivers that are n't currently in the constitution .
" They wanted to put it before the voters in November , which would have been a waste of time , because I think the voters would have soundly rejected it .
But it was a very clear attempt by them to destroy the safe - access model . "
In Vicente 's view , this approach , had it passed , would have been extremely counterproductive .
" They were really arguing against their own interests , " he maintains .
" Instead of having a certain number of MMJ centers in every community that they can oversee and that are regulated , they tried to disperse them into tens of thousands of small neighborhood grows across the state that they could n't regulate .
So there was a piece of logic missing from their argument .
But I think they 're just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks . "
In the meantime , Senator Chris Romer , who 's in favor of regulation , albeit of a sometimes controversial sort , has been causing confusion by proposing loads of new amendments -- including a proposal that 21 - year olds be banned from dispensaries .
Keeping track of these shifts is a fulltime job for Vicente .
Take the suggestion that MMJ regulations be put in place by July 1 rather than July of 2011 , as the bill stated earlier .
" The timeline is a concern mainly because I think it 's geared at shutting down a large number of dispensaries , " Vicente says .
" And that really shuts down patient access and an opportunity to get medicine .
But it 's really been a roller coaster trying to follow where the sponsors are trying to go with this .
I got an e-mail this morning that said now they 're looking at an application deadline of August 1 , and September 1 would be when dispensaries would have to certify that they are in compliance with the 70 - 30 integration model , " which requires dispensaries to grow 70 percent of their own product .
As Vicente sees it , this last alteration " is somewhat more reasonable , but I still think it 's going to make it difficult for businesses to comply .
As [ fellow MMJ advocate ]
Matt Brown has said , that 's like requiring Whole Foods to produce 70 percent of their own vegetables by September 1 .
I think that 's unrealistic and will benefit the big operators , and make things more difficult for the mom-and - pop businesses . "
Right now , it looks as if the bill could reach the senate floor as early as tomorrow , with Vicente hinting that " we may have our bill in its final shape by tomorrow afternoon . "
If things work out that way , there 'll be incredible pressure to make fixes in just a few hours .
What does he think will cause the biggest fights ?
" We 're still pushing to protect some of the constitutional provisions , like allowing caregivers to take care of more than five people if that 's appropriate for their situation , and perhaps addressing the one - year moratorium on new businesses in there .
Our dream is to get growers licensed in some way , but that may be difficult .
And we'd also like to address some of the issues about banning people with prior criminal records from becoming licensees of centers .
I think some of that is just overly punishment - oriented and not focused on what 's best for patients and the industry . "
If something actually passes , Vicente is confident law - enforcement types will despise it .
In his words , " the very thought of that makes them cringe . "
Remember Scribblenauts ?
You should : it was one of the best selling Nintendo DS games last year , selling more than a million .
And success begets sequels : Scribblenauts 2 was revealed earlier this year to be in development at 5th Cell for release later in 2010 .
But there 's been a namechange .
Amazon may have let the cat out of the bag with an early listing late last week , but Warner Bros . has made it official this morning : Scribblenauts 2 will now be known as Super Scribblenauts .
It 's almost like we 're back in 1991 !
Super Scribblenauts builds upon the idea established in the original Scribblenauts : conjure up anything in the game by writing its name .
If you want to solve a puzzle with a refrigerator , a broomstick or a skateboard , well , that 's your choice .
In the sequel , adjectives come into play so you can change the look , size , color and behavior of the object you want to bring to life .
Watch for a release of Super Scribblenauts this fall .
Brendon Rogers , from Manly Vale , Sydney , said four - month - old Kimba , a white , fluffy kitten , must have climbed into the front - loader machine when the door was open and curled up on the dirty clothes - unbeknownst to his father Lyndsay who turned the machine on for a cold wash .
A team of archaeologists have discovered a fortification system at the Minoan town of Gournia , a discovery which rebukes the popular myth that the Minoans were a peaceful society with no need for defensive structures .
The team 's efforts were led by Professor Vance Watrous and Matt Buell of the University at Buffalo .
Located on the north coast , Gournia was in use during the neo-palatial period ( ca. 1700 - 1450 BC ) , when Minoan civilization was at its height .
The town sits atop a low ridge with four promontories on its coastline .
Two of these promontories end in high vertical cliffs that give the town a defensive advantage , and it is here that the fortification system was discovered .
The team were n’t able to excavate the area , and so relied on photography , drawing and surveying to identify the fortifications .
The eastern - most promontory had a heavy wall that was about 27 meters long .
Beside it the team found a semi- circular platform of stone , almost nine meters in diameter , which they believe is the remains of a tower or bastion .
The other fortified promontory had a two meter thick wall , running east - west , “ as if to close off access from the sea , ” said Buell .
The other two promontories slope gently down to the shore , and would have provided easy access to the town .
“ It was on these two promontories ” , said Professor Watrous , “ that the Minoans built structures . ”
The town consists of around 60 tightly - packed houses , a ship shed , and a small palace in the centre , and archaeologists have discovered evidence of wine making , bronze - working and stone - working at the site .
“ Gournia gives you , the visitor , a real feeling of what an Aegean town was actually like .
Walking up the streets , past the houses , you feel like you ’ve been transported into the past , ” said Buell .
In addition to the beach fortifications , it also appears that the Minoans built a second line of defence further inland .
Heading back from the beach , there were two walls , together running about 180 meters east to west .
Backed by a tower , or bastion , the walls would have posed a formidable challenge to any invader trying to march into the town .
Defenders manning this system of fortification would have rained projectiles down on attackers , by using bows and slings .
The walls had stone foundations and were made of mud brick , making them sturdy enough to stand on .
It ’s an open question as to whether the people guarding the fortifications were part of a militia or something more organized .
There was “ definitely a body of men who would have had that duty but we do n’t know exactly what they were like , ” said Professor Watrous .
Tombs uncovered by Hawes and other excavators have shown people buried with swords .
Watrous said that there was one particular tomb that produced an entire collection of daggers , swords and other items .
However , Gournia ’s fortifications did not prevent the town ’s demise .
The town fell around 1450 BC , along with other Minoan settlements .
A new group called the Mycenaean appeared on Crete at this time , taking over the island .
Watrous said that Mycenaeans probably avoided attacking the town by sea .
" Many other settlements were destroyed at the same time .
My guess is that they just came along the land ; they did n’t have to come up from the sea ” .
He cannot say for sure if the town defences were ever actually put to their intended use .
Any evidence of a battle near these fortifications , such as weapons or bodies , would be underground , and excavation would have to be carried out to see if they exist .

EVERY HAND THAT MAKES FREQUENT EXAMINATION IS IN THE CASE OF WOMEN PRAISEWORTHY ,1 BUT IN THE CASE OF MEN IT OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF.2
GEMARA .
Wherein [ in this respect ] 3 do women differ from men ?
4 — Women [ in this matter ] are not sensitive , 5 hence they are praiseworthy , 1 but in the case of men who are highly sensitive [ their hands ] ought to be cut off .
2
But , if so , 2 what was the point in saying ' MAKES FREQUENT ' [ seeing that the same reason2 applies ] also where [ the examinations are ] infrequent ? —
When ' MAKES FREQUENT ' was mentioned it was intended to refer to women only .
6
One taught : This7 applies only to the emission of semen but as regards flux8 a man also is as praiseworthy as the women; 9 and even in regard to the emission of semen , if he desires to make the examination with a splinter or with a potsherd10 he may do so .
May he not , however , do it with a rag , seeing that it was taught : A man may examine himself with a rag or with any other thing he wishes ? —
As Abaye stated elsewhere : ' With a thick rag ' .10 So also here11 it may be explained : With a thick rag.10
And in what connection was Abaye 's statement made ?
In connection with the following :
If a priest , while eating terumah , felt a shiver run through his body 12 he takes hold of his membrum13 and swallows the terumah .
14 ' Takes hold ' !
But has it not been taught : R. Eliezer said , ' Whoever holds his membrum when he makes water is as though he had brought a flood on the world ' ?
15 To this Abaye replied .
' With a thick rag ' .16 Raba replied : It17 may even be said to apply to a soft rag for once the semen has been detached the subsequent touch does no longer matter .
18 And Abaye ?19 —
He made provision against the possibility of an additional discharge .
20 And Raba ? —
He does not consider the possibility of any additional discharges .
But does he not , seeing that it was taught , ' To what may this 21 be compared ?
To the putting of a finger upon the eye where , as long as the finger remains on it , the eye continues to tear ' ?
22 Now Raba ?23 —
It is quite uncommon for one to get heated twice in immediate succession .
24
[ Reverting to ] the main text : ' R. Eliezer said , Whoever holds his membrum when he makes water is as though he had brought a flood on the world ' .
But , they said to R. Eliezer , would not the spray bespatter his feet and he would appear to be maimed in his privy parts so that he25 would be the cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being illegitimate ? —
It is preferable , he answered them , that a man should be the cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being illegitimate than that he should make himself a wicked man , even for a while , before the Omnipresent .
Another [ Baraitha ] taught : R. Eliezer replied to the Sages .
It is possible for a man to stand on a raised spot and to make water or to make water in loose earth and thus to avoid making himself wicked , even for a while , before the Omnipresent .
Which 26 did he27 tell them28 first ?
If it be suggested that it was the first mentioned statement that he gave them first [ is it likely , it may be objected ] , that after he spoke to them of a prohibition 29 he would merely offer a remedy ?
30 — The fact is that it was the last mentioned statement31 that he gave them first , and when they asked him , ' What is he to do when he can find no raised spot or loose earth ' , he answered them , ' It is preferable that a man should be the cause of casting upon his children the reflection of being illegitimate than that he should make himself a wicked man , even for a while , before the Omnipresent ' .
But why all these precautions ?
32 — Because otherwise one might emit semen in vain , and R. Johanan stated : Whosoever emits semen in vain deserves death , for it is said in Scripture .
And the thing33 which he did33 was evil in the sight of the Lord , and He slew him also .34 R. Isaac and R. Ammi said .
He35 is as though he shed blood , for it is said in Scripture .
Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths , under every leafy tree , that slay the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks ; 36 read not ' that slay ' 37 but ' that press out '.38 R. Assi said : He39 is like one who worships idols ; for here36 it is written , ' Under every leafy tree ' and elsewhere40 it is written , upon the high mountains … and under every leafy tree .41
Rab Judah and Samuel once stood upon the roof of the Synagogue of Shaf - weyathib42 in Nehardea .
Said Rab Judah to Samuel ' I must make water ' .
' Shinena ' , 43 the other replied , ' take hold of your membrum 44 and make the water outside [ the roof ] ' .
But how could he45 do so , seeing that it was taught : R. Eliezer said ,
Whoever holds his membrum when he makes water is as though he brought a flood on the world ? —
Abaye replied :
He treated this case as that of a reconnoitering troop , concerning which we learnt , ' If a reconnoitering troop has entered a town in time of peace the open wine jars are forbidden46 and the closed ones are permitted , 47 but in times of war the former as well as the latter are permitted because the troops have no time to offer libations ' .
48
Thus it clearly follows that owing to their being in a state of fear they do not think49 of offering libations , and so also in this case , since he45 was in a state of fear he would not think of lustful matters .
But what fear could there be here ? —
If you wish I might reply :
The fear of the night and of the roof .50 If you prefer I might reply :
The fear of his Master .
51
If you prefer I might say : The fear of the Shechinah .
52
If you prefer I might say :
The fear of the Lord that was53 upon him , 54 for Samuel once remarked of him55 ' This man is no mortal being ' .
55 If you prefer I might say :
He was a married man , and concerning such R. Nahman ruled , ' If a man was married , this is permitted ' .
If you prefer I might say :
It was this that he taught him , vis. , that which R. Abba the son of R. Benjamin b. Hiyya learnt :
But he may support the testicles from below .
And if you prefer I might say :
It was this that he taught them , viz. , that which R. Abbahu stated in the name of R. Johanan :
It has a limit ; from the corona downward [ touch ] is permitted

Since both husband and wife are thereby saved either from doubtful uncleanness or from certain transgression .
Because of masturbation .
FREQUENT EXAMINATION .
Sc. why is the hand of the former PRAISEWORTHY while that of the latter OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF ?
I.e. , the examination does not unduly excite their passions .
Cf. n. 1 . The culpability of men who make such examinations .
I.e. , when a man is suffering from gonorrhoea and is desirous of ascertaining the number of attacks he had ( v. next n. ) .
Since it is necessary to ascertain whether the attack occurred only twice or three times .
In the former case the man is only unclean while in the latter he must also bring a sacrifice .
Avoiding masturbation .

The generation of the flood were guilty of such offences ( cf. R.H. 12a ) .
Now how , in view of R. Eliezer 's statement , could one be allowed to commit an offence even for the sake of terumah ?
Avoiding masturbation .
In the Baraitha just cited .
Lit. , ' since it was uprooted it was uprooted ' , no more semen would be emitted despite the heat engendered .
Why , in view of Raba 's explanation , does he restrict the application to a thick rag only ?
Of semen .
The touching of the membrum after an emission .

Niddah 13 b
Rab stated : ' A man who wilfully causes erection should be placed2 under the ban ' .
But why did he3 not say , ' This is forbidden ' ?
Because the man4 merely incites his evil inclination against himself .
5 R. Ammi , however , stated : He4 is called a renegade , because such is the art of the evil inclination :
To - day it incites man to do one wrong thing , 6 and to - morrow7 it incites him to worship idols and he proceeds to worship them .
There are others who read : R. Ammi8 stated ,
He who excites himself by lustful thoughts will not be allowed to enter the division of the Holy One , blessed be He .
For here it is written , Was evil in the sight of the Lord , 9 and elsewhere it is written , For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness ; evil shall not sojourn with Thee.10
R.11 Eleazar stated :
Who are referred to12 in the Scriptural text , Your hands are full of blood ?
13
Those that commit masturbation with their hands .
It was taught at the school of R. Ishmael , Thou shalt not commit adultery 14 implies ,
Thou shalt not practise masturbation either with hand or with foot .
Our Rabbis taught : ' proselytes and those that play with children delay the advent of the Messiah ' .
The statement about proselytes may be understood on the lines of the view of R. Helbo , for R. Helbo said , ' proselytes are as hard for Israel to endure as a sore ',15 what , however , could be meant by ' those that play with children ' ?
16 If it be suggested :
Those that practise pederasty [ it could well be objected ] :
Are not such people subject to stoning ?
17 If , however , it be suggested :
Those that practise onanism through external contact18 [ it could be objected ] :
Are not such deserving destruction by flood ?
17 — The meaning rather is :
Those that marry minors who are not capable of bearing children , for R. Jose19 stated :
The Son of David20 will not come before all the souls in Guf21 will have been disposed of , since it is said , For the spirit that enwrappeth itself is from Me , and the souls which I have made .
22
BUT IN THE CASE OF MEN IT OUGHT TO BE CUT OFF .
The question was raised :
Have we here 23 learnt a law or merely an execration ?
' Have we here learnt a law ' as in the case where R. Huna cut off one 's hand ; 24 ' or merely an execration ' ? —
Come and hear what was taught : R. Tarfon said , ' If his hand touched the membrum let his hand be cut off upon his belly ' .
' But ' , they said to him , 25 ' would not his belly be split ' ?
' It is preferable ' , he replied , ' that his belly shall be split rather than that he should go down into the pit of destruction ' .
26 Now if you concede that we have here 27 learnt a law28 one can well understand why they said , ' Would not his belly be split ' ; but if you maintain that we have only learnt of an execration , 29 what could be meant by [ the question ]
' His belly be split ' ? —
What then would you suggest , that we have learnt here a law , would it not suffice , [ it may be objected , that the cutting off shall ] not be done on his belly ? —
The fact , however , is that it was this that R. Tarfon meant :
Whosoever puts his hand below his belly that hand shall be cut off .
They said to R. Tarfon , ' If a thorn stuck in his belly , should he not remove it ' ?
' No ' , he replied .
' But [ they said ] would not his belly be split ' ?30 ' It is preferable ' , he replied , ' that his belly shall be split rather than that he should go down to the pit of destruction ' .

MISHNAH .
IN THE CASE OF A DEAF,31 AN IMBECILE , A BLIND OR AN INSANE32 WOMAN , IF OTHER WOMEN OF SOUND SENSES ARE AVAILABLE33 THEY ATTEND TO HER,34 AND SHE MAY THEN EAT TERUMAH .
GEMARA .
Why should not a DEAF woman make her own examination , seeing that it was taught : Rabbi stated , A deaf woman was living in our neighbourhood and not only35 did she examine herself but her friends also on observing a discharge would show it to her ?
36 — There it was a woman who could speak but not hear while here the reference is to one who can neither speak nor hear ; as we have learnt :
The deaf person of whom the Sages spoke is always 37 one who can neither hear nor speak .38
A BLIND .
Why should she not make her own examination and show the testing - rag to her friend ? — R. Jose son of R. Hanina replied : The ' blind ' is no part of the Mishnah.39
OR AN INSANE WOMAN .
Is not this exactly the same as IMBECILE ?
40
This refers to one whose mind was deranged owing to a disease .
Our Rabbis taught : A priest who is an imbecile may be ritually immersed and then fed with terumah41 in the evening .
42
He must also be watched that he does not fall asleep .
43
If he falls asleep he is deemed unclean44 and if he does not fall asleep he remains clean .
R. Eliezer son of R. Zadok ruled :
He should be provided with a leather bag .
45 The Rabbis said to him : ' Would not this cause heat all the more ' ?
' According to your view ' , he replied , ' should an imbecile have no remedy ' ?
' According to our view ' , they retorted , ' only if he falls asleep46 is he deemed unclean but if he does not fall asleep he remains clean , while according to your view there is the possibility that he might discharge a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed and this would be absorbed in the bag ' .47
A Tanna taught :
It was stated in the name of R. Eleazar , The imbecile is to be provided with a metal bag .
Abaye explained :
It must be one of copper , as we have learnt :48 R. Judah ruled , Those buds of hyssop49 are regarded50 as if they had been made of copper .
51
R. Papa remarked : From this 52 it may be inferred that breeches53 are forbidden .
But is it not written in Scripture , And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness ?
54 — That may be explained as it was taught :
To what were the breeches of the priests like ?
They were like the knee breeches of horsemen , reaching upwards to the loins and downwards to the thighs .
They also had laces but had no padding either back or front .55

Cabinet job snub as Cameron passes over Tory eurosceptic for post of Europe Minister
Advertisement
David Cameron risked a confrontation with the Tory Right yesterday by stripping his party ’s eurosceptic wing of the symbolic post of Europe Minister .
Hardliners had expected that Mark Francois , the pugnacious holder of the post in opposition , would be given the job .
But in an attempt to appease pro-Brussels Liberal Democrats , Mr Cameron passed him over in favour of a moderate , David Lidington .
He is best known for having backed John Major during the bitter battles over his signing of the Maastricht Treaty in the early 1990s .
The appointment came as the Government faced its first blow from the European Union after France and Germany refused to delay controversial new plans to regulate hedge funds and private equity firms , which will be voted on in Brussels next week .
Britain had called for the vote to be postponed , arguing that the new government would not have enough time to prepare for the meeting on Tuesday , but Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel are determined to forge ahead .
Elena Salgado , the finance minister of Spain which currently holds the EU presidency , told the Financial Times : ' We have a sufficient qualified majority .
There is a very clear majority of countries that want to approve it . '
A senior German official added : ' We want this put to a vote next week . '
London is the centre of Europe 's private equity activity and the City has 80 per cent of all European hedge funds .
It is against the measures because they claim there are too restrictive .
David Cameron spoke to European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso and EU president Herman Van Rompuy on the phone for the first time today .
Downing Street said he had underlined his personal commitment to a ' practical and engaged relationship ' with Europe and was looking forward to a ' close partnership ' with the two men .
Controversial job : David Lidington has been named Europe Minister instead of Mark Francois , the pugnacious holder of the post in opposition
Many of Mr Cameron ’s other ministerial appointments will disappoint Tory traditionalists .
He more than 30 ministerial posts - six of which went to Liberal Democrats .
There were raised eyebrows over Lib Dem Nick Harvey landing the key post of armed forces minister - meaning he will oversee a war in Afghanistan that many in his party would like to abandon .
With tensions festering , the Prime Minister informed the first coalition government Cabinet for 65 years that he is setting up a special committee to referee disputes between Tory ministers and their Lib Dem colleagues .
It will be co-chaired by himself and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg .
Mr Cameron banned mobile devices from the Cabinet table and told his ministers they should keep their differences private and let the new coalition committee decide on arguments .
Lib Dem Vince Cable , the new Business Secretary , raised a laugh when he told ministers that his Indian relations say : ‘ Arranged marriages often work better than one born out of love . ’
But the appointments immediately created divisions .
Arch - eurosceptic Bill Cash condemned the decision to ditch Mr Francois .
‘ David Lidington is a well - established Europhile , ’ he said .
‘ It means they ’ve overridden Mark Francois , who comes from the euro - realist wing of the party .
It ’s ridiculous . ’
In the hours before the decision was announced , a Right - winger said : ‘ It had better be Francois or there is going to be trouble . ’
Friends of Mr Lidington – who is regarded as a straight bat in Westminster – pointed out that he is a eurosceptic but also a pragmatist .
With Mr Cameron forced to find posts for Lib Dems , he had to call many of his own frontbenchers to tell them they had missed out .
One
Tory frontbencher who lost a ministerial post went so far as to threaten a by - election .
‘ I ’m out of here , ’ he said .
‘ I ’ve got a life and a family and I do n’t need this .
I ’ve been doing this for 15 years and there will be a lot of people like me who might just walk away if there ’s no chance of promotion . ’
There were several notable nods to the right .
John Hayes , a leading light in the socially conservative Cornerstone group , becomes a business minister .
Thatcherite Gerald Howarth will be minister for defence procurement .
Mike Penning , a close ally of Iain Duncan Smith , was made a transport minister .
Right - winger David Jones landed a job at the Welsh Office .
Others to take key jobs included Damian Green , the new immigration minister , schools minister Nick Gibb and prisons minister Nick Herbert .
There was disquiet in Tory ranks yesterday over the appointment of Lib Dem Chris Huhne as energy and climate change secretary .
He will have responsibility for a policy in which nuclear power will get the go ahead - even though he opposes it .
Lib Dem Sarah
Teather becomes an education minister while another female politician , Justine Greening , a Tory , becomes Economic Secretary to the Treasury .
Top table paid back £ 50,000 in expenses
Members of the new Cabinet were made to repay more than £ 50,000 in expenses in the wake of last year ’s scandal .
The new Government yesterday cut ministerial salaries by 5 per cent and froze them for another five years as a mark of penitence for last year ’s scandal .
Most of the MPs responsible for the most notorious expenses claims were either booted out or stood down at the election .
Yet the new coalition Cabinet gave back £ 53,717 of taxpayers ’ money that they should not have claimed - an average of more than £ 2,500 each .
David Cameron repaid £ 965 , including £ 680 for the cost of clearing wisteria from the chimney of his Oxfordshire home – a claim he later said he regretted .
His Deputy Prime Minister , Nick Clegg , paid back £ 989 , including £ 910 for ‘ excessive ’ gardening bills at his constituency home .
Defence Secretary Liam
Fox had to repay one of the largest amounts of any MP - losing an appeal against a demand to hand back £ 22,476 for renovations and furniture at his second home .
Education Secretary Michael
Gove returned £ 7,000 of public money after he claimed large amounts for furniture at his second home and another £ 13,000 in moving costs .
What is Dramatica ?
Dramatica is an entirely new way of looking at story .
Beyond simply a paradigm or sequence of cultural beats , Dramatica theorizes why stories exist and attempts to outline the processes and dramatic touchpoints needed to tell a successful and meaningful story .
Pretty heady stuff , right ?
Really , Dramatica is not all that complicated .
It sees the central character of a story -- the Main Character -- entering with a predetermined way of doing things .
Along the way they develop a relationship with their polar opposite , someone who challenges their way of thinking .
Ultimately , this relationship leads the Main Character towards adopting or rejecting this new way of seeing things .
The result of their decision determines whether they were on the right path or the wrong path .
That 's really it .
Of course then you can get into Overall Story Prerequisites , Relationship Story Catalysts , and Problem - Solving Styles ... but only if you really want to !
When it all comes down to it , Dramatica sees story as an argument .
To provide the very best argument , you have to make sure you cover all your bases and address all the different perspectives .
Dramatica can help with that .

750 Billion Euro Package EU Turns to ' Nuclear Option ' to Halt Euro Speculation
The European Union has put together a massive 750 billion euro package in an attempt to stave off a severe lack of market confidence in the European common currency .
Stock markets in Asia and Europe have reacted positively to the news .
A legal battle is heating up faster than the planet for embattled climatologist Michael Mann .
First word emerged that the inspector general for the National Science Foundation would look into the Penn State panel reviewing the climate scientist , who is currently director of the school 's Earth System Science Center .
Now the attorney general for his old employer the University of Virginia is planning an investigation , too .
According to a report in Charlottesville weekly The Hook , Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has asked the University of Virginia to produce " a sweeping swath of documents relating to Mann ’s receipt of nearly half a million dollars in state grant - funded climate research " conducted while Mann was at UVA between 1999 and 2005 .
Should the AG uncover evidence of impropriety , the school could be commanded to return the funds , and pick up the cost of the AG 's investigation .
The paper , tipped off by anonymous sources , has posted a PDF of Cuccinelli 's formal request , a legal document called a civil investigative demand .
In that letter , he demands production of information and documentary material relating to three papers Mann authored while at UVA , using a total of $ 484,875 of state grant money .
Read the Attorney General 's Letter
Read the Attorney General 's Note to UVA Rector John Wynne
“ Since it ’s public money , there ’s enough controversy to look in to the possible manipulation of data , ” Dr. Charles Battig , president of the nonprofit Piedmont Chapter Virginia Scientists and Engineers for Energy and Environment , told the Hook .
A spokesman for the attorney general told FoxNews that he was unable to comment on the case , explaining that " we can't comment on whether there exists an ongoing investigation or anything like that . "
But the University confirmed that it had received the letter .
According to spokeswoman Carol Wood , " the University has received the CID from the state 's attorney general regarding Michael Mann 's work .
Because of the scope of the request for information it will take some time for us to review it and decide how best to proceed with gathering information . "
Wood confirmed that the school would respond by May 27 , as the AG requested , stating " the University has a legal obligation to answer this request and it is our intention to respond to the extent required by law . "
The geology professor 's 1998 climate study , which showed a sharp increase in the world 's temperatures in the past century , was seen by many as proof that climate change was rapidly occurring and that humans played a significant role in the change .
Despite ongoing criticism , the study formed the backbone of global warming theories -- until leaked e-mails cast fresh doubt on Mann 's methodology and integrity , notably " the trick " he used to make his data so compelling .
It was those e-mails , stolen from British university East Anglia 's climate study group , that sparked Penn State 's probe into Mann 's work .
On Feb. 3 , he was exonerated on three of four charges , and the investigation of the fourth charge will be concluded by June 3 .
And that 's when the NSF 's top investigator could step in .
Meanwhile , controversy has been growing around the validity of the hockey stick graph .
Britain 's top statistician recently blasted Mann for exaggerating the size of global warming .
Professor David Hand , president of the Royal Statistical Society , told the Telegraph that Mann 's research would have shown less dramatic results if more reliable techniques had been used to analyze the data .
" The particular technique they used exaggerated the size of the blade at the end of the hockey stick .
Had they used an appropriate technique the size of the blade of the hockey stick would have been smaller , " he said .
" The change in temperature is not as great over the 20th century compared to the past as suggested by the Mann paper . "
For obvious reasons , there has n’t been a great deal of media coverage about the North Korean national team , making a re-appearance in the World Cup for the first time since their famous adventure in the north of England in 1966 .
Of course , this has only contributed to a sense of anticipation about their side ; there were suggestions that throughout the qualification campaign , North Korea played the most defensive game imaginable – telling their strikers to drop back into defence when out of possession .
That seems doubtful , but regardless , they have new coach anyway
This week , they played their final warm - up friendly against Greece .
The game ended in a 2 - 2 draw , with Korea twice conceding poor goals from set - pieces , and twice hitting back with stunning strikes from Jong Tae - Se – seemingly nicknamed either the “ Rooney of North Korea ” or the “ Rooney of Asia ” , presumably according to how well he ’s playing at the time .
Reports from qualification suggested that they played with a six - man defence , but in truth their formation is fairly close to a 3 - 5 - 2 , albeit in a very defensive manner that could be interpreted as a 3 - 3 - 2 - 2 or even 3 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 , and with some important modifications .
Defending in numbers
The back three act as conventional centre - halves – it was difficult to judge whether a sweeper will be in action , because Greece fielded a central three - man attack that was relatively easy for the Korean three to pick up .
There was no thought from any of the three to bring the ball out of defence , instead calm , short passes were played to the wing - backs .
The wing - backs were fairly far from the rampaging wing - backs we are used to in Europe - typified by the current Lazio side , who rely on theirs for most of their attacking moves .
Instead , they rarely pass the halfway line , looking for passes to one of the front four before taking up their defensive roles again .
The left - wing back , Yun -Nam , seemed slightly more interested in attacking and boasts both good pace and crossing ability .
Between the wing - backs sits Yong Hak - An , who is the midfield destroyer , but also seems to drop into the backline if one of the centre - backs are moved up the pitch when marking an opposition forward .
He plays a fairly static , defensive - minded role – in fact , he is closer to a centre - back than a central midfielder in terms of the role he plays , just 15 yards further up the pitch .
In open play , North Korea defend frantically – multiple players pressure the man in the ball , and with six purely defensive - minded players , they seem reasonably happy for their centre - backs to be drawn up the pitch , knowing there is generally another player covering .
At set - pieces though , they were woeful – defending with a bizarrely high line and twice conceding when Karagounis free - kicks found someone unmarked infront of the goalkeeper at the far post .
They ’re also not the tallest side , so set - pieces might be a real problem for them in South Africa .
Midfield
The main movement comes from the two central midfield players , who are also charged with finding attacking width when in possession .
The onus upon them to take up more advanced positions means that North Korea find it relatively difficult to counter - attack through these players – they are generally met by opposition central midfielders , and then still have a defence to get past .
Their best moves on the counter came from direct balls to the front two from the defence , but when they managed to keep possession and build up play steadily through the wing - backs , North Korea were often very impressive with their movement and interplay around the penalty area .
When the midfielders take up wide positions , they are attacking with four players in not a dissimilar way to how a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 would , although they lack support from the centre of midfield , and need the full - backs to get forward to provide overloads in wide positions .
Quality in attack
If you expected them to be well - organised at the back but lacking technical quality upfront , think again .
Their front two are the two best players in the side – Hong Yong - Jo plays a classic trequartista role , playing between defence and midfield and looking to play through balls for the striker .
And what a striker he is – Jong Tae - Se makes intelligent runs starting from wide positions and has a lethal shot on him .
In this game , his first goal was a tremendous dipping strike from 25 yards , in off the crossbar , and his second was arguably even better – he controlled a long , diagonal ball , took it past the defender and then smashed it into the top of the net .
North Korea may be a defensive side , but they also offer a goal threat .
Conclusion
In all , North Korea look a better side than they have been made out to be , and the defensive nature of their game and constant harrying in numbers will certainly make them difficult to break down .
They are , of course , in the toughest group in the competition – up against Brazil , Portugal and the Ivory Coast – and will be expected to leave without a point .
But with Brazil playing mainly on the counter - attack , and Portugal and Ivory Coast playing systems that rely on pace , North Korea ’s ultra - defensive style could frustrate teams early on in games – you can imagine one of their opponents struggling to break them down early on , and going in 0 - 0 at half - time – whether North Korea will be able to defend resolutely for 90 minutes against a top- quality side is doubtful , however .
The best way to beat North Korea is probably by playing 4 - 3 - 3 with two high wingers , and getting your full - backs well forward – since North Korea do n’t play any wide players ahead of the wing - backs , creating an overload on the flanks should be relatively easy .
In that sense , all three of their opponents are fairly nicely set up to defeat them , but they might find scoring goals more difficult than they expect .
Here are the goals from the Greece game – two superb finishes from Jong Tae - Se preceded by awful defending from two free - kicks .

DETROIT --
The Detroit Red Wings , with their skill , talent and history of success , typically are the team others try to emulate .
But to draw even in the Western Conference quarterfinals , the Red Wings hope to borrow from the Phoenix Coyotes ' blueprint for success .
" They do the little things well .
They get the puck behind you and skate , '' Detroit forward Dan Cleary said .
" They 're not fancy Dans , trying to beat you with their skill level .
It 's more their determination and work ethic .
We need to find a little bit more of that . ''
They need to find it fast , like Tuesday night in Game 4 at Joe Louis Arena , in what Cleary called a must - win game with his club trailing the playoff series 2 - 1 .
After
, the Red Wings realized they need a tactical change to spend less time in their zone , reduce turnovers in the neutral zone and make life more difficult for Phoenix 's defense in the offensive zone .
They suggested the need to play more of a chip - and - chase style .
Beyond strategy , the Red Wings know it mostly boils down to effort .
" They got a lot of character guys in there who are putting it on the line every shift , '' defenseman Niklas Kronwall said of the Coyotes .
" That 's something we 've done in the past , and we have to do it again . ''
Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said he
. Goaltender
from a shaky performance and get more help from his defense .
Detroit 's top six forwards need to generate more scoring chances .
" The biggest issue in my mind for our team is that you 've got to look across at the other guy and say , ' I 'm going to outwork you , ' '' Babcock said .
" It 's not about skill .
You 've got to compete harder than the other guy . ''
The Red Wings want to take a more blue - collar approach in dealing with Phoenix 's trapping system .
Instead of trying to make the extra pass against a wall of players lined up in the neutral zone , the Red Wings said they need to lay the puck in the Phoenix zone more often and win races for it .
" They stay five guys there ( neutral zone ) , waiting for us to turn over pucks , and they make quick ( transition ) , '' Pavel Datsyuk said .
" Maybe we need more chipping and more forechecking and finishing the checks on the defensemen , making them uncomfortable .
And more shots on ( goaltender Ilya ) Bryzgalov and go for the rebounds . ''
Said Cleary : " You got to skate and move the puck and give up possession to get it back . ''
Babcock said there are a lot of ways to get the puck in deep and wear on Phoenix 's defense .
" You can chip it in , you can rim it behind and go get it , '' Babcock said .
" ( Henrik ) Zetterberg 's goal in Game 2 was a prime example of that .
You pass it off the goalie and you bang it in the net .
" If you have no speed through the neutral zone , though , you do n't get in , you do n't grind on them .
You waste your energy in your own zone .
You do n't spend much time in their end and you 're not likely to generate second and third chances . ''
The Coyotes seemed to rally around the absence of Shane Doan , their captain and physical catalyst , after he left Sunday 's game two minutes into the second period with an apparent shoulder injury .
Doan
, and coach Dave Tippett said the forward 's status will be determined after Tuesday 's morning skate .
The Red Wings can't afford to fall behind 3 - 1 in the series , which would force them to win three consecutive games , including two in Phoenix .
" Everyone in this room has been through a lot of different situations , '' Detroit forward Todd Bertuzzi said .
" We 're not little kids anymore .
We 're all guys who 've been around and know the situation and know how important this game is .
I think you 'll see a different team . ''
Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom does n't think his team is shaken in any way .
" I have n't seen any panicking yet , and I do n't think you 'll see it , either , '' Lidstrom said .
" Just have to play with more desperation .
That 's the key word here . ''
The English Defence League is planning a series of demonstrations this summer .
Warning : video contains very strong language guardian.co.uk
MPs expressed concern tonight after it emerged that far - right activists are planning to step up their provocative street campaign by targeting some of the UK's highest - profile Muslim communities , raising fears of widespread unrest this summer .
Undercover footage shot by the Guardian reveals the English Defence League , which has staged a number of violent protests in towns and cities across the country this year , is planning to " hit " Bradford and the London borough of Tower Hamlets as it intensifies its street protests .
Senior figures in the coalition government were briefed on the threat posed by EDL marches this week .
Tomorrow up to 2,000 EDL supporters are expected to descend on Newcastle for its latest protest .
MPs said the group 's decision to target some of the UK's most prominent Muslim communities was a blatant attempt to provoke mayhem and disorder .
" This group has no positive agenda , " said the Bradford South MP , Gerry Sutcliffe .
" It is an agenda of hate that is designed to divide people and communities .
We support legitimate protest but this is not legitimate , it is designed to stir up trouble .
The people of Bradford will want no part of it . "
The English Defence League , which started in Luton last year , has become the most significant far - right street movement in the UK since the National Front in the 1970s .
A Guardian investigation has identified a number of known rightwing extremists who are taking an interest in the movement – from convicted football hooligans to members of violent rightwing splinter groups .
Thousands of people have attended its protests – many of which have descended into violence and racist and Islamophobic chanting .
Supporters are split into " divisions " spread across the UK and as many as 3,000 people are attracted to its protests .
The group also appears to be drawing support from the armed forces .
Its online armed forces division has 842 members and the EDL says many serving soldiers have attended its demonstrations .
A spokeswoman for the EDL , whose husband is a serving soldier , said : " The soldiers are fighting Islamic extremism in Afghanistan and Iraq and the EDL are fighting it here …
Not all the armed forces support the English Defence League but a majority do . "
Following the British National party 's poor showing in this month 's local and national elections anti-racist campaigners say some far - right activists may be turning away from the ballot box and returning to violent street demonstrations for the first time in three decades .
Nick Lowles , from Searchlight , said : " What we are seeing now is the most serious , most dangerous , political phenomenon that we have had in Britain for a number of years .
With EDL protests that are growing week in , week out there is a chance for major disorder and a major political shift to the right in this country . "
In undercover footage shot by Guardian Films , EDL spokesman Guramit Singh says its Bradford demonstration " will be huge " .
He adds : " The problem with Bradford is the security threat , it is a highly populated Muslim area .
They are very militant as well .
Bradford is a place that has got to be hit . "
Singh , who was speaking during an EDL demonstration in Dudley in April , said the organisation would also be targeting Tower Hamlets .
A spokesman for the EDL confirmed it would hold a demonstration in Bradford on 28 August because the city was " on course to be one of the first places to become a no - go area for non-Muslims " .
The EDL has already announced demonstrations in Cardiff and Dudley .
The former Home Office minister Phil Woolas said : " This is a deliberate attempt by the EDL at division and provocation , to try and push young Muslims into the hands of extremists , in order to perpetuate the divide .
It is dangerous . "
The EDL claims it is a peaceful and non-racist organisation only concerned with protesting against " militant Islam " .
However , over the last four months the Guardian has attended its demonstrations and witnessed racism , violence and virulent Islamophobia .
During the election campaign David Cameron described the EDL as " dreadful people " and said the organisation would " always be under review " .
A spokesman for the Home Office said that although the government was committed to restoring the right to " non-violent protest … violence and intimidation are wholly unacceptable and the police have powers to deal with individuals who commit such acts .
The government condemns those who seek to spread hatred . "
He added : " Individual members of EDL – like all members of the public – are of course subject to the law , and all suspected criminal offences will be robustly investigated and dealt with by the police . "

Europium : Savior of the TV Generation
Sir William Crookes , a 19th century British chemist , once wrote that , " rare earth elements perplex us in our researches , baffle us in our speculations and haunt us in our very dreams . "
These were n't easy elements to isolate or to understand , and so there was a very long lag time between the discovery of the rare earths , and the discovery of practical uses for them .
It did n't help that individual rare earth elements do n't occur by their lonesome — they travel in packs .
To get one , you have to mine all of them .
At first , industry did n't even bother to separate out individual rare earths , instead using them in a blended alloy called mischmetal .
This provided the first commercial applications , says Karl Gschneidner , senior metallurgist at the Department of Energy 's Ames Laboratory .
In 1891 , mischmetal became an ingredient in lamp mantles — devices that were hung above open flames , where they burned and produced a bright , white light you could see and work by .
Europium was the first isolated , high purity rare earth element to enter the public marketplace , in 1967 , as a source of the color red in TV sets .
There had been color TV before europium , but the color quality was weak .
The sets relied on phosphors — substances that glow when struck with struck with electrons or other energized particles — to get their red , green and blue colors , and the early red phosphors could n't produce a very bright color .
Europium phosphors made the picture pop .
At the time , rare earth mining was n't even a twinkle in China 's eye .
Up until the 1990s , most rare earth elements came from the United States , especially Mountain Pass , a mine in California near Los Angeles , which supplied most of the late 1960s europium demand .
By 2003 , Mountain Pass had closed and no rare earths were coming out of the United States at all .
The problem , though , is n't supply .
The U.S. still has plenty of rare earth elements left to mine — in Mountain Pass and elsewhere .
Instead , those mines were simply driven out of business , undercut on price by Chinese companies that had lower labor costs , and also benefited from the fact that they were mining rare earth elements as a byproduct of profitable iron mining .
Today , europium is still used as a phosphor , but as cathode ray tube TVs go the way of the dodo , it 's more likely to turn up in white LED - based lights , which could someday be an energy efficient replacement for both incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs .
With this technology , white light is produced by mixing various colored LEDs and europium red happens to be an ingredient in turning out a high - quality , attractive shade of white .
Following a public hearing this morning , Ohio Gov .
Ted Strickland took action to include significant other in the definition of an immediate family member , particularly as it applies to bereavement and family leave for state employees .
This proposed amendment to the Ohio Administrative Code will go to the Joint Committee on Agency Rule Review in June for further action .

Thank the governor by calling ( 614 ) 466-3555 .
A mayor in north Devon is attempting to help rewrite American history by proving that people from his small port town settled in the US 30 years before the Pilgrim Fathers set sail .
Andy Powell hopes to find funds for DNA tests that might help demonstrate Bideford 's " pivotal " role in the history of modern America .
If he can find the proof , the town might find itself at the centre of a tourism boom .
At the centre of the saga is the story of the " lost colony " , a tale better known in the US than in Britain .
In 1587 Sir Walter Raleigh organised a colonial expedition of settlers including a governor , John White .
Powell said it was thought that the fleet set sail from Bideford on 8 May and reached Roanoke Island , just off the coast of what is now North Carolina , in July .
Friendly relations were established with the Croatoan Native Americans , and the fleet sailed back to England .
The following year a new fleet was preparing to return to Roanoke when it was diverted to fight the Spanish armada .
When
White finally returned in 1590 the settlement was deserted , with no sign of a struggle or battle .
Powell said one clue as to what might have happened to the settlers was the word " Croatoan " carved into a post .
He said this suggested the settlers had joined the native Americans .
Over the next few years there were stories of blue - eyed Native Americans , fields organised in the British style and a sighting of white men beating copper with the Indians .
Archaeological digs in the US have sought evidence that people from the lost colony survived .
Powell and Mark Horton , a reader in archaeology at the University of Bristol , have joined digs that have discovered early pottery that appeared to be from north Devon .
Advances in DNA mean that scientists might be able to link people from Bideford ( and elsewhere – Powell is not saying all the settlers were from the town ) to descendants of lost colonists .
The mayor said : " We are working with a group in the USA who have been compiling DNA evidence for some considerable time .
What we now need is to establish if there are any living family descendants of those lost colonists living here in the UK and from them produce a reference library of DNA to match the American results against .
" The significance of this project is simple .
If we are right and there are descendants of those lost colonists alive in America today , then Bideford will become known for having played a pivotal role in the founding of America 33 years before the Mayflower set sail . "

Webbe knew exactly who to blame when her daughter 's criminal boyfriend ploughed his stolen car into a young family 's little Mazda , killing himself and three others .
" I blame the police totally , " she said .
" I want the police to pay for what happened , " she added on A Current Affair , for which she wore a sleeveless shirt to better show her tatt , a symbol of the new barbarianism that is actually behind this tragedy .
Click here to have your say at Andrew 's blog or leave your comment below
Yes , I understand everyone wants to be kind and non-judgmental to Webbe , whose daughter Skye got in that stolen car with Justin Charles Williams and now lies critically ill in hospital .
Oh , hear the poor mother 's sobs on radio or on TV , while interviewers murmur their pitying there - theres - even as she crucifies the cops .
Oh , you poor dear , Mrs Webbe .
So let 's not ask this tattooed lady in her moment of grief why she let her daughter go out with a twice - jailed 23 - year - old father of three who'd been stealing cars since he was eight .
Let 's not ask this poor sniffing mum how she raised a daughter who'd admire a man with 37 convictions - a man Webbe in one interview said she knew had tried to outrun the police just last year , and who nearly killed himself in a crash then , too .
Let 's not ask what values she passes on to her children when even now she claims Williams was " not a bad kid " , " OK " and guilty only of a " petty little crime " after getting " a bit mixed up in the criminal world " .
Oh , I see , Mrs Webbe .
There are no real criminals , right ?
Just the nice people you know who by pure chance mix with some faceless baddies , and can't possibly be blamed when they steal other people 's cars , break into their houses , use false number plates , give two fingers to court orders , drive like death , flee the police and kill two parents and their baby , Brody .
You look at this mayhem and conclude ... what ?
That it could have happened to anyone ?
You see the savage consequences of a savage acting savagely and " totally " blame ... the police ?
But savaging the police for chasing Williams to his death is to blame the one symbol of authority that 's done its job - this time , at least .
Blame people we must , but let 's blame Williams first , along with the exhausted institutions that helped to produce a toxic culture in which such a feral could thrive and run so amok .
Blame this culture that later left its calling card at the crash site - not just flowers , but bottles of Jim Beam .
It 's a sly grief that nudges other ferals even closer to their own moronic deaths .
Taking some of us with them .
This is a tragedy which - like the more dramatic Jaidyn Leskie killing in Moe , or the murder of Anita Cobby , or the rape and execution of the Bega schoolgirls , or the Snowtown killings - seems to lift a rock on a subculture we usually ignore , since it 's so scary to confront .
Here 's some details you should know before you 're tempted to blame the police , too , as the authors of Williams ' death .
Williams was a serial lawbreaker who'd faced court at least once a year since he turned 18 .
Again and again he'd breached good behaviour bonds the courts imposed in the deluded belief that such a man could behave well .
At least twice before his death ride he'd tried to outdrive police in cars he'd stolen , once mounting a bike path and last year crashing so badly he was in a coma for three weeks .
Even as recently as two weeks ago he was still triumphant in his contempt for the laws he'd trashed so often and the authority he'd never recognised .
On the " F - -- the police " Facebook page he wrote underneath a picture of a crashed police car , " HOPE THE LIL DOGS ARE DEAD . "
He had excuses , of course .
To get off his latest charges , he reportedly planned to argue he was unfit to plead because of brain injuries he suffered in last year 's crash .
He also complained he had attention deficit disorder , was illiterate , and had been thrown out of school " too many times to remember " for such things as threatening teachers and students .
AND his background sounds precisely as you 'd expect - another train wreck so typical of these no-responsibility times of breed 'em and leave .
Of broken promises of ' til death us do part .
Of a giddy freedom that leaves the weak falling through an endless vacuum .
He was the fourth of 10 children , his sister Tania - Lee says , and his own father left when he was just four .
He alleged he'd been physically abused by a relative .
But , of course , he 'd since repeated the very pattern of which he claimed he was a victim .
At just 23 , this convicted criminal , who'd never held a job for long , had already fathered three children with a girlfriend he left last year , literally holding the baby .
How mad it is , that the Federal Government pays even criminals , addicts and assorted ferals to reproduce , $ 5000 a baby , rather than pay only to have their offspring at least made fit for society .
What a world we are literally creating .
Two centuries ago in Britain , the rich outbred the poor , and pushed their values down the social scale .
Now the poor - many virtuous , yes , but others lazy , careless or unsocialised - outbreed the rich , and the mob 's values are pushed up .
Am I too pessimistic ?
Too damning and arrogant , even in this week when 2000 fools can block a highway near my home , loot a Bob Jane shop , hoot the police and bash a photographer just because they did n't get to see some dragsters ?
If so , forgive me , because one final detail of Saturday 's smash sealed the grim deal for me .
Guess who Williams killed on Saturday , scything through their car at 200 km / h ?
Friends of his , actually , both with criminal records themselves for offences involving drugs , and with eight children from previous relationships .
Now you have the details , so let 's do that blame thing , but properly this time .
No , I do n't blame police for chasing a lunatic driver in a stolen car .
I blame Justin Charles Williams for being a good - for - nothing .
I blame his parents for not sticking together and raising a boy to be a civilised man .
I BLAME some of his friends and relatives for praising in him what they should have condemned .
After them , I blame the schools and welfare officials for not grabbing Williams when he was young and already dangerous , and trying to make him straight , rather than turn him loose on our streets .
I blame the courts for giving him more chances than he ever planned to take , and leaving him free to steal yet another car for his last deadly drive .
I blame all of us for creating a culture that tells the feckless there 's no dishonour in leaving your children , or in betraying your more solemn duty to your spouse .
I blame all of us for killing shame , and for kicking to pieces the stern guides of tradition and faith that the brainless badly need in their trackless lives .
I blame the " reformers " who stripped our courts and police of their once intimidating authority .
I blame a government that throws money at the shiftless and that finances incivility .
And I blame those who , when a crook crashes and burns , blame first those few who at least tried to hold him to account .

Police blame game is a cop-out
MARCH 19 ---- The last man still imprisoned , as it were , for the murder of Malcolm X was granted parole earlier this month and is scheduled to be freed in late - April , 45 years after the civil rights leader was shot to death at Harlem 's Audubon Ballroom .
Following his 17th appearance before a New York State parole board panel , Thomas Hagan , 69 , was granted his formal release from custody on March 3 .
Hagan , however , has been a part - time prisoner for most of the past 20 years , spending as little as two days a week in custody at an upper Manhattan work release facility , according to state records .
This " five out , two in " program allowed Hagan -- pictured at left in a March 2008 mug shot -- to work and live with his family .
Hagan was one of three men convicted of shooting Malcolm X , who is pictured in this post - mortem New York Police Department evidence photo .
The two other gunmen were previously paroled .
Hagan , who was shot in the thigh while trying to flee , was arrested outside the Audubon carrying a clip from the .45 caliber pistol he used during the attack .
First - person accounts of the shooting were provided to investigators by a variety of witnesses , including a Queens man , William Parker , who was struck with a stray bullet , and Betty Shabazz , Malcolm 's wife , who testified before a Manhattan grand jury .
An NYPD report details the results of an autopsy performed at the Bellevue Morgue : " Cause of death : Multiple shotgun and other caliber bullet wounds of Heart and aorta . " ( 11 pages )
Most employees caught stealing from a company would expect to be fired , forced to return what they took or worse .
But a group of government employees accused of going on a massive shopping spree with taxpayer money have yet to face any disciplinary action .
During an 18 - month period while the Federal Protective Service was moved from the General Services Administration to the Department of Homeland Security , employees spent thousands of government dollars on everything from clothing and flat - screen TVs to gym memberships and tuition payments , according to the General Services Administration inspector general 's office .
But two referrals to federal prosecutors have resulted in no criminal charges in the case , The Washington Times reported Monday .
Investigators said the 21 employees hid more than $ 100,000 worth of " unauthorized " purchases made with government cards in 2003 and 2004 by not logging them into the computer system that processes the agency 's financial transactions .
After the findings of the five - year investigation into the matter were revealed in September , three employees resigned , four retired and five employees faced possible reprimand .
No action was taken against nine others , the Times reported .
The abuse of government charge cards is hardly a new problem .
A March 2008 report issued by Government Accountability Office estimated that “ nearly 41 percent ” of purchase card transactions made from July 1 , 2005 , through June 30 , 2006 failed to meet “ basic internal control standards . ”
One cardholder embezzle more than $ 642,000 over 6 years from the Department of Agriculture ’s Forest Service firefighting fund “ for personal expenditures , such as gambling , car and mortgage payments ” but was n’t caught until a whistleblower turned her in , the GAO report said .
That cardholder was sentenced to 21 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution of more than $ 642,000 .
In addition , the report said agencies were unable to locate 458 of the 1,058 expensed items the GAO had selected for testing , totaling over $ 1.8 million in missing goods like “ computer servers , laptop computers , iPods , and digital cameras . ”
Leslie Paige , a spokeswoman for the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste , says more needs to be done to stop this kind of abuse .
" According to the report the FBS workers have absolutely had no consequences .
And by consequences I mean punitive but also restitution , ” Paige told FoxNews.com .
“ I do n’t know why Congress is not moving to force them to claw the money back .
There should be a claw back measure for sure when people have transgressed in this kind of a way whether it rises to the level of criminal prosecution or not . "
Paige said since the last GAO report on the issue there ’s been an “ explosion ” in the number of government purchase cards , with 300,000 federal employees currently carrying them .
By turning a blind eye when they are abused , she says , the government is inviting more of the behavior .
“ If the worst you get is not even a slap on the wrist , you ’re not made to pay the money back , you do n’t have your name published , you do n’t get drummed out of your job , if there are no consequences for this behavior , you ’re going to see more and more of it , ” Paige said .
The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment over the phone and has not yet responded to emails from FoxNews.com regarding this issue .

Remember the scene in Kubrick 's 2001 where the astronaut walks around inside the circular room , going up and around the walls and " ceiling " ?
That was done , of course , by spinning the set and camera together , not by using an anti-gravity machine .
You could make a similar physics - defying movie with this cylindrical rolling house .
Called " Roll - It " , the round house was made in the University of Karlsruhe and is fashioned from OSB ( Oriented Strand Board , a kind of fancy , high - tech plywood ) .
One clear pathway runs around the internal circumference , allowing the inhabitant to move the house by walking or to get some exercise ( clearly , stepping outside would be too much effort ) .
The central walkway also divides the home into two sections , one for lounging and working , the other for washing and other wet chores .
On the dry side , you can use the space as a bed , easy - chair or a desk and chair depending on orientation .
It 's incredibly neat , if impractical .
On the other side , there is a toilet , a sink , and a cupboard for stashing utensils , along with a water - tank hidden within the wall .
I probably do n't have to explain the potential problems here .
As an experiment , and maybe even as a summer - house for the garden , I love the Roll It .
As a real , practical abode it is clearly nonsensical , though , especially for somebody as lazy and messy as me .
Imagine having to wash the dishes and tidy the whole house before going to bed .
Actually , that 's exactly what the Lady tries to make me do every night .
She 'd love this thing .

Copyright Infringements in the Porn Industry
By Kal Raustiala and Chris Sprigman
The Internet is a copyright - infringement machine .
That truth is nowhere more obvious than on YouTube , the well - known “ user - generated content ” site owned by Google , on which millions of short amateur videos are offered for free viewing , along with many more ripped from commercial – i.e. , copyrighted – songs , motion pictures and television shows .
Big media companies tend to hate YouTube for this reason .
Indeed , back in 2007 , media giant Viacom sued Google and YouTube for copyright infringement .
But are content providers really harmed by short YouTube videos ?
Some people may catch the latest bits from The Daily Show on YouTube rather than watching Viacom ’s Comedy Central .
Yet there are probably just as many whose love for The Daily Show began with YouTube clips .
Viacom benefits from the increased viewership and cultural buzz that the clips create .
Thought of this way , YouTube clips are like ads for Viacom shows - and free ads at that .
Whether harmful or not , YouTube ’s success has unsurprisingly led to imitations .
Among them are the hugely popular “ porn - tube ” websites like youporn.com , xvideos.com and pornhub.com .
These aggregate short clips of both amateur and commercial pornography , posted by the site ’s users .
Like YouTube , a tremendous amount of content is made available for free .
But there are important differences between YouTube and porn-tube , beyond the fact that the people featured on the porn - tube sites are naked .
The effect of these clips on the porn industry is clear - and profound .
The biggest of the sites , Pornhub , is currently the 53rd most heavily trafficked site on the Internet .
By contrast , CNN.com is No. 59 , the website of the New York Times is No. 96 , and vivid.com ( the site of the best - known high - end porn producer in the U.S. ) is No. 19,543 .
( You Tube is no .
3 . ) Sales of porn DVDs are collapsing , and the revenues of subscription - based porn sites are drying up .
Vivid did sue one of the porn - tube sites for copyright infringement , but that suit was dropped in 2008 and the targeted site continues to operate .
There is some talk within the porn industry of a coordinated litigation strategy a la the recording industry ’s campaign against Internet file - sharers .
But there are other insiders who note that copyright suits have done little to stop the implosion of the major record companies , and who despair of any litigation - based solution .
And , unlike the record industry , pornography producers have shown no interest thus far in suing their customers for illegally downloading porn .
The industry has preferred instead to appeal to customers ’ better instincts – in this video , for example , a group of porn stars pleads with customers not to use the porn - tube sites .
The travails of the porn industry give us a chance to think afresh about how creative industries are impacted when technology makes unauthorized copying ever easier and copyright law increasingly irrelevant .
The typical story about intellectual property rights – in this case , copyrights – is that they are necessary to protect investments in the production of creative works .
If others are simply free to copy , then the originators will find it impossible to recover their investments .
If you want creativity , the story goes , you have to stop copying .
As we ’ve shown in our previous posts , however , this is not always true .
Fashion designs get knocked off regularly , and yet the fashion industry continues to produce thousands of designs a month .
Chefs have no protection over their recipes , yet food in America keeps getting better , more varied , and more creative .
Perhaps , as we suggested above , YouTube clips serve as free advertising for regular TV shows .
The point is that copying does not always kill the creative goose .
The interesting question is why it sometimes does and sometimes does n’t .
We do n’t yet have an answer for the porn industry .
But here ’s a prediction : the porn - tube sites are here to stay , and yet many , many people and companies will continue to produce pornography – even in the face of virtually uncontrolled copying .
Like it or not ( and we ’ll leave the morality of this subject to others ) , there is huge demand for porn .
And although we are not economists , we feel safe in saying that where there is demand , there will be supply .
This is especially true now , because the cost of producing porn has fallen so precipitously .
Anyone with a video camera , a bed , and some willing amateurs is now in the business .
If you want to get fancy , you can even edit and add music with software programs like FinalCut .
What ’s true of porn , moreover , is true elsewhere .
Technology has made copying far easier .
But it has also made producing content far easier .
Music used to require elaborate studios and expensive engineers ; now laptops make recording at home a breeze .
In short , the porn - tube sites probably wo n’t kill the porn industry .
But they will change it .
Production is likely to shift even more from “ features ” to short porn - tube - friendly clips .
At the moment , the commercial porn industry , concentrated in L.A. ’s San Fernando Valley , turns out more than 1,000 new feature films every month .
This model probably cannot be sustained in a porn - tube world .
Pornography is , in large part , a utilitarian product , and for most consumers , the purpose for which it is employed is served just as well by a five - minute porn - tube clip .
We can imagine at least two distinctive strategies emerging that will allow porn producers to survive in a market ruled by the porn - tube sites .
The first would be to go upscale — to build a porn- industry brand by associating it with highly - paid stars and high production values .
( CNN recently reported on a $ 4 million 3D porn film about to commence production . )
And then diligently send legal notices and sue to keep your content off the porn - tube sites .
Large , successful producers like Vivid seem already to be following part of this course .
Vivid has two full - time employees sending out hundreds of notices every month demanding that porn - tube sites take down their copyrighted content , and they , along with several other large players , have discussed coordinated copyright lawsuits .
The other strategy is likely to be a much more significant part of the porn industry ’s future .
Many producers will take advantage of falling production and distribution costs to produce a huge amount of pornographic content catering to every imaginable sexual taste .
Revenues may come from banner ads , or from click - throughs to sites offering services , like live chats and video on demand , that cannot easily be copied .
The commercial producers will compete with amateurs , and also with entrepreneurs who use porn clips as advertisements for other , more highly paid services – for example , already many porn actresses use clips to attract clients to their more lucrative work in strip clubs .
In any case , the pornography business is likely to become progressively lower - margin and competitive .
Consumers will pay less , and get more .
Of course , whether any of this is desirable depends on your point of view about the morality of , and possible social harm caused by , pornography .
But that ’s a completely different set of arguments from the one that animates intellectual property law .
The rise of the porn - tube sites may be the end of copyright as a way of structuring the pornography business .
But , for better or worse , it is surely not the end of pornography .

I tweeted earlier that after having slept with her ( Ms. iPad ) , I woke up with morning - after regrets .
She ’s sweet and pretty but shallow and vapid .
Cute line , appropriate for retweets .
But as my hangover settles in , I realize that there ’s something much more basic and profound that worries me about the iPad — and not just the iPad but the architecture upon which it is built .
I see danger in moving from the web to apps .
The iPad is retrograde .
It tries to turn us back into an audience again .
That is why media companies and advertisers are embracing it so fervently , because they think it returns us all to their good old days when we just consumed , we did n’t create , when they controlled our media experience and business models and we came to them .
The most absurd , extreme illustration is Time Magazine ’s app , which is essentially a PDF of the magazine ( with the odd video snippet ) .
It ’s worse than the web : we ca n’t comment ; we ca n’t remix ; we ca n’t click out ; we ca n’t link in , and they think this is worth $ 4.99 a week .
But the pictures are pretty .
That ’s what we keep hearing about the iPad as the justification for all its purposeful limitations : it ’s meant for consumption , we ’re told , not creation .
We also hear , as in David Pogue ’s review , that this is our grandma ’s computer .
That cant is inherently snobbish and insulting .
It assumes grandma has nothing to say .
But after 15 years of the web , we know she does .
I ’ve long said that the remote control , cable box , and VCR gave us control of the consumption of media ; the internet gave us control of its creation .
Pew says that a third of us create web content .
But all of us comment on content , whether through email or across a Denny ’s table .
At one level or another , we all spread , react , remix , or create .
Just not on the iPad .
The iPad ’s architecture supports these limitations in a few ways :
First , in its hardware design , it does not include a camera — the easiest and in some ways most democratic means of creation ( you do n’t have to write well ) — even though its smaller cousin , the iPhone , has one .
Equally important , it does not include a simple ( fucking ) USB port , which means that I can’t bring in and take out content easily .
If I want to edit a document in Apple ’s Pages , I have to go through many hoops of moving and snycing and emailing or using Apple ’s own services .
Cloud ?
I see no cloud , just Apple ’s blue skies .
Why no USB ?
Well , I can only imagine that Apple does n’t want us to think what Walt Mossberg did in his review — the polar opposite of Pogue ’s — that this pad could replace its more expensive laptops .
The iPad is purposely handicapped , but it does n’t need to be .
See the German WePad , which comes with USB port(s ! ) , a camera , multitasking , and the more open Android operating system and marketplace .
Second , the iPad is built on apps .
So are phones , Apple ’s and others ’ .
Apps can be wonderful things because they are built to a purpose .
I ’m not anti-app , let ’s be clear .
But I also want to stop and examine the impact of shifting from a page - and site - based internet to one built on apps .
I ’ve been arguing that we are , indeed , moving past a page - , site - , and search - based web to one also built on streams and flows , to a distributed web where you ca n’t expect people to come to you but you must go to them ; you must get yourself into their streams .
This shift to apps is a move in precisely the opposite direction .
Apps are more closed , contained , controlling .
That , again , is why media companies like them .
But they do n’t interoperate — they do n’t play well — with other apps and with the web itself ; they are hostile to links and search .
What we do in apps is less open to the world .
I just want to consider the consequences .
So I see the iPad as a Bizarro Trojan Horse .
Instead of importing soldiers into the kingdom to break down its walls , in this horse , we , the people , are stuffed inside and wheeled into the old walls ; the gate is shut and we ’re welcomed back into the kingdom of controlling media that we left almost a generation ago .
There are alternatives .
I now see the battle between Apple and Google Android in clearer focus .
At Davos , Eric Schmidt said that phones ( and he saw the iPad as just a big phone … which it is , just without the phone and a few other things ) will be defined by their apps .
The mobile ( that is to say , constantly connected ) war will be won on apps .
Google is competing with openness , Apple with control ; Google will have countless manufacturers and brands spreading its OS , Apple will have media and fanboys ( including me ) do the work for it .
But Google has a long way to go if it hopes to win this war .
I ’m using my Nexus One phone ( which I also had morning - after doubts about ) and generally liking it but I still find it awkward .
Google has lost its way , its devotion to profound simplicity .
Google Wave and Buzz are confusing and generally unusable messes ; Android needed to be thought through more ( I should n’t have to think about what a button does in this use case before using it ) ; Google Docs could be more elegant ; YouTube ’s redesign is halfway to clean .
Still , Google and Apple ’s competition presents us with choices .
I find it interesting that though many commercial brands — from Amazon to Bank of America to Fandango — have written for both Apple and Android , many media brands — most notable The New York Times and my Guardian — have written only for Apple and they now are devoting much resource to recreating apps for the iPad .
The audience on Android is bigger than the audience on iPad but the sexiness and control Apple offers is alluring .
This , I think , is why Salon CEO Richard Gingras calls the iPad a fatal distraction for publishers .
They are deluding themselves into thinking that the future lies in their past .
On This Week in Google last night , I went too far slathering over the iPad and some of its very neat apps ( ABC ’s is great ; I watched the Modern Family about the iPad on the iPad and smugly loved being so meta ) .
I am a toy boy at heart and did n’t stop to cast a critical eye , as TWiG ’s iPadless Gina Trapani did .
This morning on Twitter , I went too far the other way kvetching about the inconveniences of the iPad ’s limitations ( just a fucking USB , please ! ) in compensation .
That ’s the problem with Twitter , at least for my readers : it ’s thinking out loud .
I ’ll sleep with the iPad a few more nights .
I might well rebox and return it ; I do n’t have $ 500 to throw away .
But considering what I do for a living , I perhaps should hold onto it so I can understand its implications .
And that ’s the real point of this post : there are implications .

AFTER five hectic days the general election produced a result last night as the sociopath who has been dicking about with your life for the last 13 years finally got the fucking message .
In a historic announcement Gordon Brown said he was standing down but not before he had discharged his constitutional duty to steal the government for the sack of shit - eating weasel arseholes who have spent most of their shabby careers licking his greasy balls .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said Mr Brown ’s statement ‘ smoothed the way towards a stable government ’ involving an as yet unidentified prime minister , a collection of lying , two - faced whores , some Welsh , Scottish , Irish and possibly Cornish nationalists , a lady from Brighton who drives a car made of yeast , as well as the Roly Polys , the Wurzels and the Average White Band .
Tom Logan , a progressive person from Finsbury Park , said : “ On paper that sounds like it should work perfectly .
“ That said , I would be slightly concerned that the Wurzels will hold the country to ransom every time they want some more cider , while English taxpayers will end up having to subsidise even more of the Average White Band ’s funky baselines . ”
Julian Cook , professor of politics at Reading University , added : “ After five extraordinary days I suspect that Britain is now really starting to regret having Lib Dems .
“ John F Kennedy once remarked that the ‘ hottest places in hell are reserved for those who sat on the fence ’ but of course , I think what he actually meant to say was ‘ Good God , the Lib Dems really are a bunch of fucking cocksuckers , are n’t they ? ’. ”
Meanwhile the prospect of a Labour - led ‘ progressive ’ coalition has been welcomed by thousands of limbless Iraqis , torture victims and people whose DNA is now kept on a database because they signed a petition in the post office about a new bypass .
Abdul Al - Kaleem , a former limb owner from Basra , said : “ I admire the British Labour Party .
They managed to progress my legs off very efficiently , while my Uncle Karim was progressed over a wide area .
“ I remember being handed what was left of his chin and thinking ‘ yes , this is definitely progress ’ . ”
Mohammed Iqbal , from Bradford , said that when he was being tortured by the CIA with the tacit approval of the Labour Party he was comforted by the fact that gay people could now form civil partnerships .
He added : “ As the electricity coursed through my flailing body and the pliers tightened once more around my already swollen testicles , I smiled at the thought of Elton John and David Furnish having a big , fancy party to celebrate their same sex love . ”
And bypass petitioner Martin Bishop , who is now snuggled nicely into the DNA database between a murderer and a paedophile , said he was impressed by the progress the police had made in taking dozens of photographs of his house .
He added : “ It ’s all very impressive .

Why do we have ten fingers ?
In How Many Limbs Should Humans Have ?
I described my Limb Law , an empirical law I discovered which relates how long an animal ’s limbs are to how many limbs it has .
This law is explained by virtue of animals having evolved a limb design that minimizes the amount of needed materials to reach out into the world ( see links to my academic work in the previous piece ) .
To see the Limb Law in action , go to my web site where you can play with an animal ’s limb length and watch how the optimal number of limbs changes .
Roughly speaking , the animal designs you can create in this program are the ones we find on Earth ( … among radially - directed - limbed animals ) .
The Limb Law applies to more than just animal legs .
By “ limbs ” I refer to any appendages that reach out , and so the hypothesis applies to hands as well , but where a hand ’s “ limbs ” are its digits .
The only thing we must keep in mind in order to apply the Limb Law to hands is that hands are not free - range animals , but are , rather , connected to an animal .
Hands have digits pointing away from the arm that connects to the hand , and so have only about half of the digits one would expect if the hand were roaming the world on its own .
In light of this fingers - are - the - hand ’s - limbs observation , in this piece I ’d like to ask …
In addition to being fundamentally interesting , this question also has deep implications for why we use a base - 10 number system ( rather than a base - 2 or base - 8 system , each which would arguably be better ) .
How can the Limb Law tell us how many fingers we should have , given that it only tells us the relationship between limb length and number of limbs ?
Because hands like ours have plausible constraints on how long their fingers should be .
Hands must close , i.e. , their fingers must be able to reach back over the palm and cover it up .
And that simple requirement is enough to enable us to predict roughly how many fingers we should have .
Recall that the Limb Law was that the number of limbs , N≈2π / k , where k was the “ limb ratio , ” k = L / ( L+R ) , where L is limb length and R the radius of the body .
The demand that finger length be approximately the diameter of the palm means that the finger length should be about twice the palm ’s “ radius ” .
So , L≈2R .
It follows that k ≈ L / [ L + ( L/2 ) ] = 2/3 .
And , plugging in k=2/3 into the equation for the number of limbs , N , we have N≈2π / ( 2/3 ) = 3*π ≈ 9.42 .
That is , given that fingers must be roughly as long as the diameter of one ’s palm , then there should be about 9.42 fingers poking out from the circumference of the palm .
But remember that palms are n’t animals living freely on their own , but are attached to arms , and thus we expect palms to have digits on only about one half of their circumference .
So , 9.42 is twice what we should expect for the number of fingers .
Divide 9.42 by 2 and we have 4.78 fingers per hand .
Or , about five .
Could it be that your run -of - the - mill alien would also have ten fingers , and thus get saddled with base - 10 ?

Google Inc. plans to begin selling digital books in late June or July , a company official said Tuesday , throwing the search giant into a battle that already involves Amazon.com Inc. , Apple Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc .
Google has been discussing its vision for distributing books online for several years and for months has been evangelizing about its new service , called Google Editions .
The company is hoping to distinguish Google Editions in the marketplace by allowing users to access books from a broad range of websites using ...
The video sharing site YouTube.com recently started blocking access to countless parodies of the 2004 German movie Downfall , a critically acclaimed film that chronicles Adolf Hitler 's final days in a Berlin bunker .
The parodies take off from a powerful monologue by the great actor Bruno Ganz and the original joke version had Hitler being banned from XBox Live for bad behavior .
Other examples feature Hitler trying to score Miley Cyrus concert tickets , counseling Conan O'Brien after losing a late - night slot to Jay Leno , and much more .
It 's understandable why Downfall 's production company , Constantin Film , might be upset that such a serious movie is being burlesqued , but pushing YouTube to ban the parodies is a terrible idea for at least three reasons :
1 . It 's fair use !
The parodies , which transform a few minutes of a three - hour movie , are clearly legit under existing copyright laws .
Because they clearly transform the original and have no possibility of confusing viewers , the parodies are clearly protected speech .
2 . This is free promotion !
As George Lucas could tell the filmmakers , fan - generated videos help keep the original source material vital and relevant .
Lucas used to try to police all Star Wars knock - offs , until he realized that his audience was promoting his films more effectively than he ever could .
More people have surely seen Downfall due to the popularity of the parodies .
3 . Let 's keep the Internet creative !
The greatest cultural development over the past 20 or so years has been technologies that allow producers and consumers to create and enjoy an ever - increasing array of creative expression in an ever - increasing array of circumstances .
This development is nowhere more powerful than on the Internet , which has unleashed a whole new universe of writing , music , video , and more .
Indeed , YouTube is itself one of the great conduits of cyberspace .
Pulling down the Downfall parodies may be within YouTube 's rights , but it nonetheless strikes a blow to the heart of what is totally awesome about the Internet .
" 3 Reason YouTube Should n't Censor Downfall Parodies " is written and produced by Meredith Bragg and Nick Gillespie , who also hosts .

Michael Clauer is a captain in the Army Reserve who commanded over 100 soldiers in Iraq .
But while he was fighting for his country , a different kind of battle was brewing on the home front .
Last September , Michael returned to Frisco , Texas , to find that his homeowners ’ association had foreclosed on his $ 300,000 house — and sold it for $ 3,500 .
This story illustrates the type of legal quagmire that can get out of hand while soldiers are serving abroad and their families are dealing with the stress of their deployment .
And fixing the mess is n’t easy .
Michael went on active duty in February 2008 and was sent to Iraq .
After he shipped out , his wife May slipped into a deep depression , according to court documents .
“ A lot of people say that the deployment is more stressful on the spouse than the actual person who ’s being deployed , ” Michael , 37 , says in an interview with Mother Jones .
May Clauer had two kids to take care of — a ten - year - old and a one - year - old with a serious seizure - related disorder .
In addition , she was worried sick about her husband .
Michael ’s company was doing convoy security in Iraq — an extremely dangerous job .
“ It was a pretty tough year for the whole company , ” he says .
“ We had IEDs , rocket attacks and mortar attacks , and a few soldiers that were hurt pretty bad and had to be airlifted back to the States . ”
Seeking to avoid hearing about the situation in Iraq , May stopped watching the news .
She rarely answered the door , and Michael says he could n’t tell her when he went “ outside the wire ” — off - base .
May also stopped opening the mail .
“ I guess she was scared that she would hear bad news , ” says Michael .
That was why she missed multiple notices from the Heritage Lakes Homeowners Association informing her that the family owed $ 800 in dues — and then subsequent notices stating that the HOA was preparing to foreclose on the debt and seize the home .
In Texas , homeowners ’ associations can foreclose on homes without a court order , no matter the size of the debt .
In May 2008 , the HOA sold the Clauers ’ home for a pittance — $ 3,500 — although its appraisal value was $ 300,000 , according to court documents .
The buyer then resold the house to a third person .
( Select Management Co. , the company that manages Heritage Lakes , declined to comment for this story . )
It was n’t until June 2009 that May realized what had happened .
Around that time , the new owner started demanding rent from the Clauers .
She told Michael , who was still in Iraq .
“ At first I did n’t believe it , ” he says .
“ I did n’t understand how someone can take your house and not give you anything for it . ”
When Texas Gov. Rick Perry visited Iraq in July , Michael says he told him about the problem .
According to Michael , Perry called May and put lawyers in touch with the Clauers ’ attorney , but could n’t do much to alleviate the situation .
( Perry ’s office did n’t respond to calls seeking comment . )
In August 2009 , the new owner sent the couple an eviction notice , according to court records filed in the case .
In Iraq , “ the stress level was finally starting to come down , ” says Michael , and he was “ starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel . ”
He adds , “ Then all of a sudden I get hit with this , and I ’m trying to get out of there and get home and see what I can do to fight this . ”
At no point did anyone from the HOA — which is , after all , composed of the Clauers ’ neighbors — appear to have tried to visit May Clauer ’s house to talk to her about the problem .
“ The HOA board members … do n’t live very far from me at all , ” Michael Clauer says .
There were “ neighbors owing much more than us [ who ] were notified in person of pending foreclosures , but my wife only received a few letters . ”
David Schechter of the Dallas / Fort Worth television station WFAA , which first reported this story , notes that the “ Clauers ’ HOA says homeowners are free to call them , but they do not call or visit homeowners when there ’s a problem .
They ’re only required to send a certified letter . ”
There are a bevy of laws that are supposed to protect servicemembers from losing their homes or jobs while they ’re on active duty , including the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ) .
The homeowners ’ association ’s lawyer filed an affidavit wrongly claiming that neither of the Clauers was on active duty , says Barbara Hale , the couple ’s lawyer .
Hale is seeking to have the court reverse the foreclosure and declare it “ null and void , ” she says .
In the meantime , the Clauers have obtained an agreement allowing the family to stay in the home , Hale says .
She ’s “ confident that the courts will sort this out and do the right thing , ” but notes that the drawn - out legal process must be stressful for the Clauers .
The one good thing for the Clauers about Michael ’s deployment to Iraq was that it gave them a chance to get their finances in order .
Michael got a bonus and expenses at home were lower .
Now all of that money is gone , says Michael , who is currently working as a production supervisor at a roofing company .
“ It ’s ridiculous how much this is costing us , ” he says .
“ I ’ll be taking out a mortgage on my house that was free and clear just to try to get my house back . ”
Lauren Bean , a spokeswoman for Clauers ’ congressman , GOP Rep .
Michael Burgess , says that Burgess is “ aware of Capt .
Clauer ’s issue , ” but says it is “ office policy to not comment on constituent casework . ”
Even if he ca n’t get his family ’s home back , Michael hopes that the public will pay attention to his story and push for changes to the laws that give Texas HOAs so much power .
“ We do n’t want to see this happen to other people , ” he says .
UPDATE : Several people have emailed asking how they can help .
The Clauers have set up a legal defense fund to help pay for their court battle .

Michael Clauer ’s wife ’s name is May , not Mae , as this story and other news reports originally stated .
Clauer got back from Iraq in September , not October ( his active duty period ended in October . )
This story has been corrected to reflect those changes .
The story has also been edited since it was originally posted .
Critics of a new Arizona law signed by Republican Gov. Jan Brewer last week that aims to ban ethnic studies in the Tucson public school system say the courses and curriculum were originally created to help settle a race discrimination lawsuit in the 1970s .
Officials with the Tucson Unified School District say the ethnic studies courses were part of a measure to reduce racial disparities across the school system and end a court - ordered desegregation decree .
Civil rights activists note the fight to include ethnic studies courses was a battle against racial injustice and inequity in the public school system .
In 1974 , an African American couple with the support of the NAACP sued the Tucson school district , alleging racial bias in the makeup of its schools , staff , student discipline rates , and student services .
Months later , a Latino parent in Tucson , with the support of the Hispanic community also sued the district , making similar charges .
Eventually the cases were merged and four years later a Tucson U.S. District Court judge oversaw a settlement .
The district adopted new hiring practices .
Suspension and expulsion rates among Blacks , Latinos and other minorities to ensure they were not disproportionate to their peers were also tracked .
School boundaries and busing to balance the demographic makeup of classes were also changed .
In the settlement it was agreed that an African American studies program be started .
In 1997 a Mexican American studies program was added .
For three decades the court monitored the district ’s compliance with the settlement and a final plan approved by the judge was approved in December .
It calls for annual reviews of the two programs by the district ’s Department of Student Equity .
The plan said the courses would actually help the district identify other inequities and that the Mexican American studies program should be expanded due to high demand by the students .
Today the Tucson ’s Unified School District is 56 percent Latino , with nearly 31,000 Latino students .
The program offers specialized courses in African American , Mexican American and Native American studies that focus on history , literature and social justice .
The recent move to ban the ethnic studies programs was largely due to the outlandish criticism of Tom Horne , a Republican and current superintendent of the state Board of Education .
The bill was written to target the Chicano , or Mexican American , studies program in the Tucson school system .
Horne argues the classes promote revolutionary ideology such as : “ the overthrow of the U.S. government , promote resentment toward a race or class of people , are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group , ” and “ advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of students as individuals . ”
However officials with the Tucson school district , including Judy Burns , president of the district ’s governing body , say the program benefits students and promotes critical thinking .
The program does n’t promote resentment , and they believe it would comply with the new law , officials add .
Burns said she has no intention of ending the program , which offers classes from elementary school through high school and is open to all students .
Students and educators who defend the programs argue they teach student ’s history from a multicultural perspective , and help them analyze public services to find evidence of discrimination .
Students read about court cases and learn to do research based on data , such as school enrollment , poverty figures and disparities in the education system .
Stereotypes of young people , including stereotypes of students who are gay or lesbian are also examined .
Tucson ’s Mexican American Studies Director Martin Sean
Arce said instructors in the program teach students about the methods of civil rights leaders Gandhi , King and Chavez .
Students say the ethnic studies courses have been unfairly demonized .
Some 200 students walked out of school last week and jammed into the Tucson school district ’s offices to protest the law and Mr. Horne who was expected to have a meeting there .
Officials were forced to cancel the meeting .
At Tucson Unified High School ’s graduation ceremony next week , students will be handed voter - registration forms along with their diplomas .
School officials say if the students want to change what happens in the state of Arizona , they have to vote .

Almost exactly a year ago , Google made one of the most remarkable press releases in the Web 2.0 era .
Of course , by “ press release ” , I actually mean keynote at their own conference , and by “ remarkable ” I mean potentially - transformative and groundbreaking .
I am referring of course to the announcement of Google Wave , a real - time collaboration tool which has been in open beta for the last several months .
For those of you who do n’t know , Google Wave is a collaboration tool based on real - time , simultaneous editing of documents via a mechanism known as “ operational transformation ” .
Entities which appear as messages in the Wave client are actually “ waves ” .
Within each “ wave ” is a set of “ wavelets ” , each of which contains a set of documents .
Individual documents can represent things like messages , conversation structure ( which reply goes where , etc ) , spell check metadata and so on .
Documents are composed of well - formed XML with an implicit root node .
Additionally , they carry special metadata known as “ annotations ” which are ( potentially - overlapping ) key / value ranges which span across specific regions of the document .
In the Wave message schema , annotations are used to represent things like bold / italic / underline / strikethrough formatting , links , caret position , the conversation title and a host of other things .
An example document following the Wave message schema might look something like this :
< body > < line />
Test message < line /> < line />Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet .
</ body >
( assuming the following annotations ) :
style /font- weight -> bold
style /font-style -> italic
link / manual ->
http://www.google.com
You will notice that the annotations for style / font - style and link / manual actually overlap .
This is perfectly acceptable in Wave ’s document schema .
The resulting rendering would be something like this :
Test message Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet .
The point of all this explaining is to give you at least a passing familiarity with the Wave document schema so that I can safely use its terminology in the article to come .
See ,
Wave itself is not nearly so interesting as the idea upon which it is based .
As mentioned , every document in Wave is actually just raw XML with some ancillary annotations .
As far as the Wave server is concerned , you can stuff whatever data you want in there , just so long as it ’s well - formed .
It just so happens that Google chose to implement a communications tool on top of this data backend , but they could have just as easily implemented something more esoteric , like a database or a windowing manager .
The key to Wave is the mechanism by which we interact with these documents : operational transformation .
Wave actually does n’t allow you to get access to a document as raw XML or anything even approaching it .
Instead , it demands that all of your access to the document be performed in terms of operations .
This has two consequences : first , it allows for some really incredible collaborative tools like the Wave client ; second , it makes it really tricky to implement any sort of Wave - compatible service .
Given the fact that I ’ve been working on Novell Pulse ( which is exactly this sort of service ) , and in light of the fact that Google ’s documentation on the subject is sparing at best , I thought I would take some time to clarify this critical piece of the puzzle .
Hopefully , the information I ’m about to present will make it easier for others attempting to interoperate with Wave , Pulse and the ( hopefully ) many OT - based systems yet to come .
Operations
Intuitively enough , the fundamental building block of operational transforms are operations themselves .
An operation is exactly what it sounds like : an action which is to be performed on a document .
This action could be inserting or deleting characters , opening ( and closing ! ) an XML element , fiddling with annotations , etc .
A single operation may actually perform many of these actions .
Thus , an operation is actually made up of a sequence of operation components , each of which performs a particular action with respect to the cursor ( not to be confused with the caret , which is specific to the client editor and not at all interesting at the level of OT ) .
There are a number of possible component types .
For example :
insertCharacters — Inserts the specified string at the current index
deleteCharacters —
Deletes the specified string from the current index
openElement — Creates a new XML open - tag at the current index
deleteOpenElement —
Deletes the specified XML open - tag from the current index
closeElement —
Closes the first currently - open tag at the current index
deleteCloseElement —
Deletes the XML close - tag at the current index
annotationBoundary — Defines the changes to any annotations ( starting or ending ) at the current index
retain —
Advances the index a specified number of items
Wave ’s OT implementation actually has even more component types , but these are the important ones .
You ’ll notice that every component has something to do with the cursor index .
This concept is central to Wave ’s OT implementation .
Operations are effectively a stream of components , each of which defines an action to be performed which effects the content , the cursor or both .
For example , we can encode the example document from earlier as follows :
openElement ( ' body ' ) openElement ( ' line ' ) closeElement ( ) annotationBoundary ( startKeys : [ ' style /font - weight ' ] , startValues : [ ' bold ' ] ) insertCharacters ( ' Test message ' ) annotationBoundary ( endKeys : [ ' style /font- weight ' ] ) openElement ( ' line ' ) closeElement ( ) annotationBoundary ( startKeys : [ ' style /font- style ' ] , startValues : [ ' italic ' ] ) openElement ( ' line ' ) closeElement ( ) insertCharacters ( ' Lorem ' ) annotationBoundary ( startKeys : [ ' link / manual ' ] , startValues : [ ' http://www.google.com'] ) insertCharacters ( ' ipsum ' ) annotationBoundary ( endKeys : [ ' style/font-style ' ] ) insertCharacters ( ' dolor ' ) annotationBoundary ( endKeys : [ ' link / manual ' ] ) insertCharacters ( ' sit amet . ' ) closeElement ( )
Obviously , this is n’t the most streamlined way of referring to a document ’s content for a human , but a stream of discrete components like this is perfect for automated processing .
The real utility of this encoding though does n’t become apparent until we look at operations which only encode a partial document ; effectively performing a particular mutation .
For example , let ’s follow the advice of Strunk and White and capitalize the letter ‘ m ’ in our title of ‘ Test message ’ .
What we want to do ( precisely - speaking ) is delete the ‘ m ’ and insert the string ‘ M ’ at its previous location .
We can do that with the following operation :
retain ( 8 ) deleteCharacters ( 'm ' ) insertCharacters ( ' M ' ) retain ( 38 )
Instead of adding content to the document at ever step , most of this operation actually leaves the underlying document untouched .
In practice , retain ( ) tends to be the most commonly used component by a wide margin .
The trick is that every operation must span the full width of the document .
When evaluating this operation , the cursor will start at index 0 and walk forward through the existing document and the incoming operation one item at a time .
Each XML tag ( open or close ) counts as a single item .
Characters are also single items .
Thus , the entire document contains 47 items .
Our operation above cursors harmlessly over the first eight items ( the < body > tag , the < line / > tag and the string ' Test ' ) .
Once it reaches the ' m ' in ' message ' , we stop the cursor and perform a mutation .
Specifically , we ’re using the deleteCharacters ( ) component to remove the ' m ' .
This component does n’t move the cursor , so we ’re still sitting at index 8 .
We then use the insertCharacters ( ) component to add the character ' M ' at precisely our currently location .
This time , some new characters have been inserted , so the cursor advances to the end of the newly - inserted string ( meaning that we are now at index 9 ) .
This is intuitive because we do n’t want to have to retain ( ) over the text we just inserted .
We do however want to retain ( ) over the remainder of the document , seeing as we do n’t need to do anything else .
The final rendered document looks like the following :
Test Message Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet .
Composition
One of Google ’s contributions to the ( very old ) theory behind operational transformation is the idea of operation composition .
Because
Wave operations are these nice , full - span sequences of discrete components , it ’s fairly easy to take two operations which span the same length and merge them together into a single operation .
The results of this action are really quite intuitive .
For example , if we were to compose our document operation ( the first example above ) with our ' m ' - changing operation ( the second example ) , the resulting operation would be basically the same as the original document operation , except that instead of inserting the text ' Test message ' , we would insert ' Test Message ' .
In composing the two operations together , all of the retains have disappeared and any contradicting components ( e.g. a delete and an insert ) have been directly merged .
Composition is extremely important to Wave ’s OT as we will see once we start looking at client / server asymmetry .
The important thing to notice now is the fact that composed operations must be fundamentally compatible .
Primarily , this means that the two operations must span the same number of indexes .
It also means that we cannot compose an operation which consists of only a text insert with an operation which attempts to delete an XML element .
Obviously , that ’s not going to work .
Wave ’s Composer utility takes care of validating both the left and the right operation to ensure that they are compatible as part of the composition process .
Please also note that composition is not commutative ; ordering is significant .
This is also quite intuitive .
If you type the character a and then type the character b , the result is quite different than if you type the character b and then type the character a .
Transformation
Here ’s where we get to some of the really interesting stuff and the motivation behind all of this convoluted representational baggage .
Operational Transformation , at its core , is an optimistic concurrency control mechanism .
It allows two editors to modify the same section of a document at the same time without conflict .
Or rather , it provides a mechanism for sanely resolving those conflicts so that neither user intervention nor locking become necessary .
This is actually a harder problem than it sounds .
Imagine that we have the following document ( represented as an operation ) :
insertCharacters ( ' go ' )
Now imagine that we have two editors with their cursors positioned at the end of the document .
They simultaneously insert a t and a character ( respectively ) .
Thus , we will have two operations sent to the server .
The first will retain 2 items and insert a t , the second will retain 2 items and insert a .
Naturally , the server needs to enforce atomicity of edits at some point ( to avoid race conditions during I/O ) , so one of these operations will be applied first .
However , as soon as either one of these operations is applied , the retain for the other will become invalid .
Depending on the ordering , the text of the resulting document will either be ' goat ' or ' gota ' .
In and of itself , this is n’t really a problem .
After all , any asynchronous server needs to make decisions about ordering at some point .
However , issues start to crop up as soon as we consider relaying operations from one client to the other .
Client A has already applied its operation , so its document text will be ' got ' .
Meanwhile , client B has already applied its operation , and so its document text is ' goa ' .
Each client needs the operation from the other in order to have any chance of converging to the same document state .
Unfortunately , if we naïvely send A ’s operation to B and B ’s operation to A , the results will not converge :
' got ' + ( retain ( 2 ) ; insertCharacters ( ' a' ) = ' goat '
+ ( retain ( ) ; insertCharacters ( ) = ' goa ' + ( retain ( 2 ) ; insertCharacters ( 't ' ) = ' gota '
Even discounting the fact that we have a document size mismatch ( our operations each span 2 indexes , while their target documents have width 3 ) , this is obviously not the desired behavior .
Even though our server may have a sane concept of consistent ordering , our clients obviously need some extra hand - holding .
Enter OT .
What we have here is a simple one - step diamond problem .
In the theoretical study of OT , we generally visualize this situation using diagrams like the following :
The way you should read diagrams like this is as a graphical representation of operation application on two documents at the same time .
Client operations move the document to the left .
Server operations move the document to the right .
Both client and server operations move the document downward .
Thus , diagrams like these let us visualize the application of operations in a literal “ state space ” .
The dark blue line shows the client ’s path through state space , while the gray line shows the server ’s .
The vertices of these paths ( not explicitly rendered ) are points in state space , representing a particular state of the document .
When both the client and the server line pass through the same point , it means that the content of their respective documents were in sync , at least at that particular point in time .
So , in the diagram above , operation a could be client A’s operation ( retain ( 2 ) ; insertCharacters ( 't ' ) ) and operation b could be client B ’s operation .
This is of course assuming that the server chose B ’s operation as the “ winner ” of the race condition .
As we showed earlier , we cannot simply naïvely apply operation a on the server and b on the client , otherwise we could derive differing document states ( ' goat ' vs ' gota ' ) .
What we need to do is automatically adjust operation a with respect to b and operation b with respect to a .
We can do this using an operational transform .
Google ’s OT is based on the following mathematical identity :
In plain English , this means that the transform function takes two operations , one server and one client , and produces a pair of operations .
These operations can be applied to their counterpart ’s end state to produce exactly the same state when complete .
Graphically , we can represent this by the following :
Thus , on the client - side , we receive operation b from the server , pair it with a to produce ( a’ , b’ ) , and then compose b’ with a to produce our final document state .
We perform an analogous process on the server - side .
The mathematical definition of the transform function guarantees that this process will produce the exact same document state on both server and client .
Coming back to our concrete example , we can finally solve the problem of ' goat ' vs ' gota ' .
We start out with the situation where client A has applied operation a , arriving at a document text of ' got ' .
It now receives operation b from the server , instructing it to retain over 2 items and insert character ' a ' .
However , before it applies this operation ( which would obviously result in the wrong document state ) , it uses operational transformation to derive operation b’ .
Google ’s OT implementation will resolve the conflict between ' t ' and 'a ' in favor of the server .
Thus , b' will consist of the following components :
retain ( 2 ) insertCharacters ( ' a' ) retain ( 1 )
You will notice that we no longer have a document size mismatch , since that last retain ( ) ensures that the cursor reaches the end of our length - 3 document state ( ' got ' ) .
Meanwhile , the server has received our operation a and it performs an analogous series of steps to derive operation a’ .
Once again , Google ’s OT must resolve the conflict between 't ' and 'a ' in the same way as it resolved the conflict for client A .
We ’re trying to apply operation a ( which inserts the 't ' character at position 2 ) to the server document state , which is currently ' goa ' .
When we ’re done , we must have the exact same document content as client A following the application of b’ .
Specifically , the server document state must be ' goat ' .
Thus , the OT process will produce the operation a’ consisting of the following components :
retain ( 3 ) insertCharacters ( 't ' )
Client A applies operation b’ to its document state , the server applies operation a’ to its document state , and they both arrive at a document consisting of the text ' goat ' .
Magic !
It is very important that you really understand this process .
OT is all about the transform function and how it behaves in this exact situation .
As it turns out , this is all that OT does for us in and of itself .
Operational transformation is really just a concurrency primitive .
It does n’t solve every problem with collaborative editing of a shared document ( as we will see in a moment ) , but it does solve this problem very well .
One way to think of this is to keep in mind the “ diamond ” shape shown in the above diagram .
OT solves a very simple problem : given the top two sides of the diamond , it can derive the bottom two sides .
In practice , often times we only want one side of the box ( e.g. client A only needs operation b’ , it does n’t need a’ ) .
However , OT always gives us both pieces of the puzzle .
It “ completes ” the diamond , so to speak .
Compound OT
So far , everything I have presented has come pretty directly from the whitepapers on waveprotocol.org .
However , contrary to popular belief , this is not enough information to actually go out and implement your own collaborative editor or Wave - compatible service .
The problem is that OT does n’t really do all that much in and of itself .
As mentioned above , OT solves for two sides of the diamond in state space .
It only solves for two sides of a simple , one - step diamond like the one shown above .
Let me say it a third time : the case shown above is the only case which OT handles .
As it turns out , there are other cases which arise in a client / server collaborative editor like Google Wave or Novell Pulse .
In fact , most cases in practice are much more complex than the one - step diamond .
For example , consider the situation where the client performs two operations ( say , by typing two characters , one after the other ) while at the same time the server performs one operation ( originating from another client ) .
We can diagram this situation in the following way :
So we have two operations in the client history , a and b , and only one operation in the server history , c . The client is going to send operations a and b to the server , presumably one after the other .
The first operation ( a ) is no problem at all .
Here we have the simple one - step diamond problem from above , and as well know , OT has no trouble at all in resolving this issue .
The server transforms a and c to derive operation a’ , which it applies to its current state .
The resulting situation looks like the following :
Ok , so far so good .
The server has successfully transformed operation a against c and applied the resulting a’ to its local state .
However , the moment we move on to operation b , disaster strikes .
The problem is that the server receives operation b , but it has nothing against which to transform it !
Remember , OT only solves for the bottom two sides of the diamond given the top two sides .
In the case of the first operation ( a ) , the server had both top sides ( a and c ) and thus OT was able to derive the all - important a’ .
However , in this case , we only have one of the sides of the diamond ( b ) ; we do n’t have the server ’s half of the equation because the server never performed such an operation !
In general , the problem we have here is caused by the client and server diverging by more than one step .
Whenever we get into this state , the OT becomes more complicated because we effectively need to transform incoming operations ( e.g. b ) against operations which never happened !
In this case , the phantom operation that we need for the purposes of OT would take us from the tail end of a to the tail end of a ’ .
Think of it like a “ bridge ” between client state space and server state space .
We need this bridge , this second half of the diamond , if we are to apply OT to solve the problem of transforming b into server state space .
Operation Parentage
In order to do this , we need to add some metadata to our operations .
Not only do our operations need to contain their components ( retain , etc ) , they also must maintain some notion of parentage .
We need to be able to determine exactly what state an operation requires for successful application .
We will then use this information to detect the case where an incoming operation is parented on a state which is not in our history ( e.g. b on receipt by the server ) .
For the record , Google Wave uses a monotonically - increasing scalar version number to label document states and thus , operation parents .
Novell Pulse does the exact same thing for compatibility reasons , and I recommend that anyone attempting to build a Wave - compatible service follow the same model .
However , I personally think that compound OT is a lot easier to understand if document states are labeled by a hash of their contents .
This scheme has some very nice advantages .
Given an operation ( and its associated parent hash ) , we can determine instantly whether or not we have the appropriate document state to apply said operation .
Hashes also have the very convenient property of converging exactly when the document states converge .
Thus , in our one - step diamond case from earlier , operations a and b would be parented off of the same hash .
Operation b’ would be parented off of the hash of the document resulting from applying a to the initial document state ( and similarly for a’ ) .
Finally , the point in state space where the client and server converge once again ( after applying their respective operations ) will have a single hash , as the document states will be synchronized .
Thus , any further operations applied on either side will be parented off of a correctly - shared hash .
Just a quick terminology note : when I say “ parent hash ” , I ’m referring to the hash of the document state prior to applying a particular operation .
When I say “ parent operation ” ( which I probably will from time to time ) , I ’m referring to the hash of the document state which results from applying the “ parent operation ” to its parent document state .
Thus , operation b in the diagram above is parented off of operation a which is parented off of the same hash as operation c .
Compound OT
Now that our operations have parent information , our server is capable of detecting that operation b is not parented off of any state in its history .
What we need to do is derive an operation which will take us from the parent of b to some point in server state - space .
Graphically , this operation would look something like the following ( rendered in dark green ) :
Fortunately for us , this operation is fairly easy to derive .
In fact , we already derived and subsequently threw it away !
Remember , OT solves for two sides of the diamond .
Thus , when we transformed a against c , the resulting operation pair consisted of a’ ( which we applied to our local state ) and another operation which we discarded .
That operation is precisely the operation shown in green above .
Thus , all we have to do is re-derive this operation and use it as the second top side of the one - step diamond .
At this point , we have all of the information we need to apply OT and derive b’ , which we can apply to our local state :
At this point , we ’re almost done .
The only problem we have left to resolve is the application of operation c on the client .
Fortunately , this is a fairly easy thing to do ; after all , c is parented off of a state which the client has in its history , so it should be able to directly apply OT .
The one tricky point here is the fact that the client must transform c against not one but two operations ( a and b ) .
Fortunately , this is fairly easy to do .
We could apply OT twice , deriving an intermediary operation in the first step ( which happens to be exactly equivalent to the green intermediary operation we derived on the server ) and then transforming that operation against b.
However , this is fairly inefficient .
OT is fast , but it ’s still O( n log n ) .
The better approach is to first compose a with b and then transform c against the composition of the two operations .
Thanks to Google ’s careful definition of operation composition , this is guaranteed to produce the same operation as we would have received had we applied OT in two separate steps .
The final state diagram looks like the following :
Client / Server Asymmetry
Technically , what we have here is enough to implement a fully - functional client / server collaborative editing system .
In fact , this is very close to what was presented in the 1995 paper on the Jupiter collaboration system .
However , while this approach is quite functional , it is n’t going to work in practice .
The reason for this is in that confusing middle part where the server had to derive an intermediary operation ( the green one ) in order to handle operation b from the client .
In order to do this , the server needed to hold on to operation a in order to use it a second time in deriving the intermediary operation .
Either that , or the server would have needed to speculatively retain the intermediary operation when it was derived for the first time during the transformation of a to a ’ .
Now , this may sound like a trivial point , but consider that the server must maintain this sort of information essentially indefinitely for every client which it handles .
You begin to see how this could become a serious scalability problem !
In order to solve this problem , Wave ( and Pulse ) imposes a very important constraint on the operations incoming to the server : any operation received by the server must be parented on some point in the server ’s history .
Thus , the server would have rejected operation b in our example above since it did not branch from any point in server state space .
The parent of b was a , but the server did n’t have a , it only had a’ ( which is clearly a different point in state space ) .
Of course , simply rejecting any divergence which does n’t fit into the narrow , one - step diamond pattern is a bit harsh .
Remember that practically , almost all situations arising in collaborative editing will be multi-step divergences like our above example .
Thus , if we naïvely rejected anything which did n’t fit into the one - step mold , we would render our collaborative editor all - but useless .
The solution is to move all of the heavy lifting onto the client .
We do n’t want the server to have to track every single client as it moves through state space since there could be thousands ( or even millions ) of clients .
But if you think about it , there ’s really no problem with the client tracking the server as it moves through state space , since there ’s never going to be any more than one ( logical ) server .
Thus , we can offload most of the compound OT work onto the client side .
Before it sends any operations to the server , the client will be responsible for ensuring those operations are parented off of some point in the server ’s history .
Obviously , the server may have applied some operations that the client does n’t know about yet , but that ’s ok .
As long as any operations sent by the client are parented off of some point in the server ’s history , the server will be able to transform that incoming operation against the composition of anything which has happened since that point without tracking any history other than its own .
Thus , the server never does anything more complicated than the simple one - step diamond divergence ( modulo some operation composition ) .
In other words , the server can always directly apply OT to incoming operations , deriving the requisite operation extremely efficiently .
Unfortunately , not all is sunshine and roses .
Under this new regime , the client needs to work twice as hard , translating its operations into server state space and ( correspondingly ) server operations back into its state space .
We have n’t seen an example of this “ reverse ” translation ( server to client ) yet , but we will in a moment .
In order to maintain this guarantee that the client will never send an operation to the server which is not parented on a version in server state space , we need to impose a restriction on the client : we can never send more than one operation at a time to the server .
This means that as soon as the client sends an operation ( e.g. a in the example above ) , it must wait on sending b until the server acknowledges a .
This is necessary because the client needs to somehow translate b into server state space , but it ca n’t just “ undo ” the fact that b is parented on a .
Thus , wherever b eventually ends up in server state space , it has to be a descendant of a’ , which is the server - transformed version of a .
Literally , we do n’t know where to translate b into until we know exactly where a fits in the server ’s history .
To help shed some light into this rather confusing scheme , let ’s look at an example :
In this situation , the client has performed two operations , a and b .
The client immediately sends operation a to the server and buffers operation b for later transmission ( the lighter blue line indicates the buffer boundary ) .
Note that this buffering in no way hinders the application of local operations .
When the user presses a key , we want the editor to reflect that change immediately , regardless of the buffer state .
Meanwhile , the server has applied two other operations , c and d , which presumably come from other clients .
The server still has n’t received our operation a .
Note that we were able to send a immediately because we are preserving every bit of data the server sends us .
We still do n’t know about c and d , but we do know that the last time we heard from the server , it was at the same point in state space as we were ( the parent of a and c ) .
Thus , since a is already parented on a point in server state space , we can just send it off .
Now let ’s fast - forward just a little bit .
The server receives operation a .
It looks into its history and retrieves whatever operations have been applied since the parent of a .
In this case , those operations are c and d .
The server then composes c and d together and transforms a against the result , producing a’ .
After applying a’ , the server broadcasts the operation to all clients , including the one which originated the operation .
This is a very important design feature : whenever the server applies a transformed operation , it sends that operation off to all of its clients without delay .
As long as we can guarantee strong ordering in the communication channels between the client and the server ( and often we can ) , the clients will be able to count on the fact that they will receive operations from the server in exactly the order in which the server applied them .
Thus , they will be able to maintain a locally - inferred copy of the server ’s history .
This also means that our client is going to receive a’ from the server just like any other operation .
In order to avoid treating our own transformed operations as if they were new server operations , we need some way of identifying our own operations and treating them specially .
To do this , we add another bit of metadata to the operation : a locally - synthesized unique ID .
This unique ID will be attached to the operation when we send it to the server and preserved by the server through the application of OT .
Thus , operation a’ will have the same ID as operation a , but a very different ID from operations c and d .
With this extra bit of metadata in place , clients are able to distinguish their own operations from others sent by the server .
Non-self - initiated operations ( like c and d ) must be translated into client state space and applied to the local document .
Self - initiated operations ( like a’ ) are actually server acknowledgements of our currently - pending operation .
Once we receive this acknowledgement , we can flush the client buffer and send the pending operations up to the server .
Moving forward with our example , let ’s say that the client receives operation c from the server .
Since c is already parented on a version in our local history , we can apply simple OT to transform it against the composition of a and b and apply the resulting operation to our local document :
Of course , as we always need to keep in mind , the client is a live editor which presumably has a real person typing madly away , changing the document state .
There ’s nothing to prevent the client from creating another operation , parented off of c’ which pushes it even further out of sync with the server :
This is really getting to be a bit of a mess !
We ’ve only sent one of our operations to the server , we ’re trying to buffer the rest , but the server is trickling in more operations to confuse things and we still have n’t received the acknowledgement for our very first operation !
As it turns out , this is the most complicated case which can ever arise in a Wave - style collaborative editor .
If we can nail this one , we ’re good to go .
The first thing we need to do is figure out what to do with d .
We ’re going to receive that operation before we receive a’ , and so we really need to figure out how to apply it to our local document .
Once again , the problem is that the incoming operation ( d ) is not parented off of any point in our state space , so OT ca n’t help us directly .
Just as with b in our fundamental compound OT example from earlier , we need to infer a “ bridge ” between server state space and client state space .
We can then use this bridge to transform d and slide it all the way down into position at the end of our history .
To do this , we need to identify conceptually what operation (s ) would take us from the parent of d to the the most recent point in our history ( after applying e ) .
Specifically , we need to infer the green dashed line in the diagram below .
Once we have this operation ( whatever it is ) , we can compose it with e and get a single operation against which we can transform d .
The first thing to recognize is that the inferred bridge ( the green dashed line ) is going to be composed exclusively of client operations .
This is logical as we are attempting to translate a server operation , so there ’s no need to transform it against something which the server already has .
The second thing to realize is that this bridge is traversing a line parallel to the composition of a and b , just “ shifted down ” exactly one step .
To be precise , the bridge is what we would get if we composed a and b and then transformed the result against c .
Now , we could try to detect this case specifically and write some code which would fish out a and b , compose them together , transform the result against c , compose the result of that with e and finally transform d against the final product , but as you can imagine , it would be a mess .
More than that , it would be dreadfully inefficient .
No , what we want to do is proactively maintain a bridge which will always take us from the absolute latest point in server state space ( that we know of ) to the absolute latest point in client state space .
Thus , whenever we receive a new operation from the server , we can directly transform it against this bridge without any extra effort .
Building the Bridge
We can maintain this bridge by composing together all operations which have been synthesized locally since the point where we diverged from the server .
Thus , at first , the bridge consists only of a .
Soon afterward , the client applies its next operation , b , which we compose into the bridge .
Of course , we inevitably receive an operation from the server , in this case , c . At this point , we use our bridge to transform c immediately to the correct point in client state space , resulting in c ’.
Remember that OT derives both bottom sides of the diamond .
Thus , we not only receive c’ , but we also receive a new bridge which has been transformed against c .
This new bridge is precisely the green dashed line in our diagram above .
Meanwhile , the client has performed another operation , e . Just as before , we immediately compose this operation onto the bridge .
Thanks to our bit of trickery when transforming c into c’ , we can rest assured that this composition will be successful .
In other words , we know that the result of applying the bridge to the document resulting from c will be precisely the document state before applying e , thus we can cleanly compose e with the bridge .
Finally , we receive d from the server .
Just as with c , we can immediately transform d against the bridge , deriving both d’ ( which we apply to our local document ) as well as the new bridge , which we hold onto for future server translations .
With d’ now in hand , the next operation we will receive from the server will be a’ , the transformed version of our a operation from earlier .
As soon as we receive this operation , we need to compose together any operations which have been held in the buffer and send them off to the server .
However , before we send this buffer , we need to make sure that it is parented off of some point in server state space .
And as you can see by the diagram above , we ’re going to have troubles both in composing b and e ( since e does not descend directly from b ) and in guaranteeing server parentage ( since b is parented off of a point in client state space not shared with the server ) .
To solve this problem , we need to play the same trick with our buffer as we previously played with the translation bridge : any time the client or the server does anything , we adjust the buffer accordingly .
With the bridge , our invariant was that the bridge would always be parented off of a point in server state space and would be the one operation needed to transform incoming server operations .
With the buffer , the invariant must be that the buffer is always parented off of a point in server state space and will be the one operation required to bring the server into perfect sync with the client ( given the operations we have received from the server thus far ) .
The one wrinkle in this plan is the fact that the buffer cannot contain the operation which we have already sent to the server ( in this case , a ) .
Thus , the buffer is n’t really going to be parented off of server state space until we receive a’ , at which point we should have adjusted the buffer so that it is parented precisely on a’ , which we now know to be in server state space .
Building the buffer is a fairly straightforward matter .
Once the client sends a to the server , it goes into a state where any further local operations will be composed into the buffer ( which is initially empty ) .
After a , the next client operation which is performed is b , which becomes the first operation composed into the buffer .
The next operation is c , which comes from the server .
At this point , we must somehow transform the buffer with respect to the incoming server operation .
However , obviously the server operation ( c ) is not parented off of the same point as our buffer ( currently b ) .
Thus , we must first transform c against a to derive an intermediary operation , c ” , which is parented off of the parent of the buffer ( b ) :
Once we have this inferred operation , c ” , we can use it to transform the buffer ( b ) “ down ” one step .
When we derive c ” , we also derive a transformed version of a , which is a ” .
In essence , we are anticipating the operation which the server will derive when it transforms a against its local history .
The idea is that when we finally do receive the real a’ , it should be exactly equivalent to our inferred a ” .
At this point , the client performs another operation , e , which we immediately compose into the buffer ( remember , we also composed it into the bridge , so we ’ve got several things going on here ) .
This composition works because we already transformed the buffer ( b ) against the intervening server operation ( c ) .
So e is parented off of c’ , which is the same state as we get were we to apply a ” and then the buffer to the server state resulting from c .
This should sound familiar .
By a strange coincidence , a ” composed with the buffer is precisely equivalent to the bridge .
In practice , we use this fact to only maintain one set of data , but the process is a little easier to explain when we keep them separate .
Checkpoint time !
The client has performed operation a , which it sent to the server .
It then performed operation b , received operation c and finally performed operation e.
We have an operation , a ” which will be equivalent to a ’ if the server has no other intervening operations .
We also have a buffer which is the composition of a transformed b and e .
This buffer , composed with a ” , serves as a bridge from the very latest point in server state space ( that we know of ) to the very latest point in client state space .
Now is when we receive the next operation from the server , d. Just as when we received c , we start by transforming it against a ” ( our “ in flight ” operation ) .
The resulting transformation of a ” becomes our new in flight operation , while the resulting transformation of d is in turn used to transform our buffer down another step .
At this point , we have a new a ” which is parented off of d and a newly - transformed buffer which is parented off of a ” .
Finally , we receive a’ from the server .
We could do a bit of verification now to ensure that a ” really is equivalent to a’ , but it ’s not necessary .
What we do need to do is take our buffer and send it up to the server .
Remember , the buffer is parented off of a ” , which happens to be equivalent to a ’ .
Thus , when we send the buffer , we know that it is parented off of a point in server state space .
The server will eventually acknowledge the receipt of our buffer operation , and we will ( finally ) converge to a shared document state :
The good news is that , as I mentioned before , this was the most complicated case that a collaborative editor client ever needs to handle .
It should be clear that no matter how many additional server operations we receive , or how many more client operations are performed , we can simply handle them within this general framework of buffering and bridging .
And , as when we sent the a operation , sending the buffer puts the client back into buffer mode with any new client operations being composed into this buffer .
In practice , an actively - editing client will spend most of its time in this state : very much out of sync with the server , but maintaining the inferred operations required to get things back together again .
Conclusion
The OT scheme presented in this article is precisely what we use on Novell Pulse .
And while I ’ve never seen
Wave ’s client code , numerous little hints in the waveprotocol.org whitepapers as well as discussions with the Wave API team cause me to strongly suspect that this is how Google does it as well .
What ’s more , Google Docs recently revamped their word processing application with a new editor based on operational transformation .
While there has n’t been any word from Google on how exactly they handle “ compound OT ” cases within Docs , it looks like they followed the same route as Wave and Pulse ( the tell - tale sign is a perceptible “ chunking ” of incoming remote operations during connection lag ) .
None of the information presented in this article on “ compound OT ” is available within Google ’s documentation on waveprotocol.org ( unfortunately ) .
Anyone attempting to implement a collaborative editor based on Wave ’s OT would have to rediscover all of these steps on their own .
My hope is that this article rectifies that situation .
To the best of my knowledge , the information presented here should be everything you need to build your own client / server collaborative editor based on operational transformation .
So , no more excuses for second - rate collaboration !

In a document affixed with Minnesota ’s official seal and signed by Minnesota ’s Secretary of State , Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty has officially dubbed April “ Abortion Recovery Month . ”
His proclamation hails the “ culture of life and hope ” and praises the state ’s church - based abortion recovery programs as “ offer[ing ] support and recovery services to those who have had abortions or who have been impacted . ”

The proclamation was first reported by The Minnesota Independent .
The statement by the Republican governor , a possible contender for his party ’s presidential nomination in 2012 , reads :
Whereas : Abortion recovery programs help individuals heal by providing counseling , support groups , encouragement ; and Whereas : Abortion Recovery Month encourages and promotes healing opportunities and raises awareness of the aftermath of abortion experienced by individuals and families .
The language of the proclamation may have been amenable to both the pro-choice and pro-life camps , but pro-choice organizations were quick to highlight the political nature of the move .
“ Clearly , this proclamation is truly nothing more than Gov. Pawlenty pandering to the anti-choice organizations in the state , ” NARAL Pro-Choice spokeswoman Linnea House told the Independent .

House added that she “ was hoping the governorÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s proclamation was an April FoolÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Day joke last week , ” alleging that the governor would be focusing on educating the youth about unwanted pregnancies if he were serious about his goals .
Planned Parenthood spokeswoman Kathi Di Nicola called the governor ’s effort “ pure politics . ”
Texas GOP governor Rick Perry issued a similar declaration , the Christian Post reported , using stiffer anti-abortion language than his Minnesota counterpart .

“ An abortion is a tragic ending , not only because of the loss of a life , but also because of the physical and psychological trauma caused by the procedure itself , ” Perry noted in the proclamation .
Whereas : Abortion recovery programs help individuals heal by providing counseling , support groups , encouragement ; and Whereas : Abortion Recovery Month encourages and promotes healing opportunities and raises awareness of the aftermath of abortion experienced by individuals and families .
Derrida and Deleuze on time , the future , and politics
Jack Reynolds
University of Tasmania
1 . In much of their work , Derrida and Deleuze invoke the importance of the futural dimension of time .
Derrida argues that an event can only occur when time is ‘ out of joint ’ ( PF 10 - 24 ) , and he asserts that it is this aspect of the radical singularity of any event that needs to be emphasised as a counterbalance to conceptions of time in which the future is treated as known and demarcated according to the expectations of the present .
2 . In this respect , his work moves closer to the concerns of Deleuze , whose own valorisations of the future often occur , perhaps surprisingly , in association with Nietzsche ’s famous thought of the eternal return of the same .
Deleuze endorses Nietzsche ’s suggestion that the thought of the eternal return can be an aide to a revaluation of values , but he also transforms it and argues that the eternal return ( of difference ) represents the time of the future , rather than history repeating itself .
His arguments for this will be considered in what follows , but for both Derrida and Deleuze there is an ethico - political impetus accorded to this interruption to the temporal order that opens upon the future , and that cannot be treated as simply a future that will one day become present .
3 . Many questions need to be pursued about their conceptions of the future , but this apparent proximity between them is interesting , not least because there has been very little explicit interaction between these two French philosophers over the course of their long careers .
Derrida ’s eulogy for Deleuze is powerful and evocative ( WM ) , and they consistently express respect for one another , but there is no philosophical interaction between them that merits the name .
This seems to attest to some important philosophical differences between them , and in a recent essay Gordon Bearn has suggested that , " the difference between Derrida and Deleuze is simple and deep : it is the difference between No and Yes " ( Bearn , 2000 , 467 ) .
Without wanting to go quite this far , it can also be coherently argued that Derrida rejects empiricism ( cf. WD 126–30 ) , whereas Deleuze endorses a new form of it ( cf. DR , PI ) .
4 . More relevantly for the purposes of this essay , there also seems to be one important asymmetry involved in their respective understandings of the temporal .
Deleuze ’s descriptions of the time of the eternal return appear to challenge Derrida ’s famous early suggestion that there is no concept of time other than the metaphysical one ( MP ) .
For Deleuze , there is something important about the time of the eternal return of difference ( which for him is more than merely an abstract thought experiment ) that might be said to elide the metaphysics of presence , or the tacit insistence upon a temporal ‘ now ’ moment that Derrida , following Heidegger , has associated with much of the Western philosophical tradition ( SP 104 ) .
For Derrida , or at least for the early Derrida , this kind of temporality outside of metaphysics is unattainable , and there hence seems to be an obvious tension between his and Deleuze ’s respective thoughts .
5 . At the same time , Derrida ’s recent work also increasingly emphasises a conception of futural time that cannot be integrated within the horizons of a subject , and he makes these kind of temporal points in relation to the structure that he terms the ‘ messianic ’ , as well as his somewhat synonymous emphasis on that which is ‘ to come ’ in relation to democracy and justice – themes that will soon be examined .
Do Derrida and Deleuze refer to similar things when they talk of the future in this way ?
If so , does this mean that Derrida ’s increasingly prophetic philosophy abandons , or at least challenges , his earlier formulation regarding time necessarily being metaphysical ?
After all , if this radical future is that which breaks open time , then it seems that it cannot be subsumed under metaphysical conceptions of time .
It becomes more like a quasi - transcendental condition for time , and this , according to my understanding , also brings Derrida closer to the work of Deleuze .
Have the respective philosophies of Derrida and Deleuze become closer since Deleuze ’s death , or since Derrida ’s post Gift of Death insistence upon the messianic , the ‘ perhaps ’ , the ‘ to come ’ , the singularity of the event , and the revelation of his " religion without religion " ?
It is to these questions , and their political consequences , that this essay will return .
Derrida on the Time of the Future a ) Friendship 6 .
There are many themes from Derrida ’s recent work that unremittingly emphasise the future .
In Politics of Friendship , he argues that the thought of the perhaps is the only responsible thought of the event , and of the future .
In fact , Derrida declares that the perhaps is the only just category of the future ( PF 29 ) , and this is because it respects the unknown rather than circumscribing it in any particular direction .
7 . To provide this Nietzschean - inspired emphasis upon the perhaps with more context , in Politics of Friendship Derrida is at pains to insist that genuine friendship requires due recognition of the unstable .
Derrida points out that " it takes time to do without time " , which is to suggest that the apparent stability of a long friendship must always have been tested over time ( PF 17 ) .
Any friendship must have experienced this futural recognition that whatever arrangements may now be in place ( eg. meeting for a beer each Friday afternoon , being open and honest with one another , etc. ) , they must have passed through an ordeal of time – and one never completely passes through this ordeal – in which these arrangements were subject to revision and to contestation .
In other words , in order to have a reasonably stable friendship , one must first have had some kind of experience of the future as unlimited and of nothing dictating that the friendship will continue .
8 . Moreover , not only does a stable friendship need to traverse this unstable order of time in which this openness towards the future is experienced unabated – and this is why Derrida describes friendship as involving a " contretemporal habitus " , an untimely habitus ( PF 16 ) – but he also intimates that even after having endured this trial of friendship , we still need to think friendship with an " open heart " , open to the perhaps , and to the chance of an irreducible event .
Contrary to the famous Aristotelean account of friendship , Derrida hence argues that friendship should not be too stable , and should not railroad the future into its habitual expectations , which is to deny not only the difference of the other person , but also the more radical difference that time insinuates into any and every friendship .
This is not only an ethical injunction that Derrida is making .
Rather , it is also a quasi - transcendental argument that in friendship this stable aspect of time is always broken open by this radical future .
9 . In relation to this essay ’s comparison of Derrida and Deleuze , it is important to note that , for Derrida , these dimensions of time are intertwined ( PF 15 , 37 ) , and this kind of radical futurity is hence only experienced as an interruption , or as a discontinuity , within the habitual present .
This raises significant questions about whether Derrida thinks that pure difference itself , or pure futurity , can be experienced , or even ‘ encountered ’ , to invoke the terminology of Deleuze ’s Anti-Oedipus , but we will return to this question below .
b)
Democracy - to - Come
10 .
In a lot of his recent work , and particularly in Politics of Friendship and Spectres of Marx , Derrida has also frequently discussed the idea of a democracy ‘ to come ’ .
Derrida ’s point in this regard is relatively simple .
A genuine democracy is supposed to be about facilitating difference and facilitating the exposure to multiple perspectives and outlooks .
But if democracy is the name for this openness to what is to come , then there is a paradoxical sense in which democracy itself can never actually arrive – democracy is impossible , at least in the peculiar sense that Derrida imbues the notion of impossibility with ( PF 22 ) .
11 .
After all , it seems clear enough that to declare that democracy has finally arrived , once and for all , in a particular contingent historical format such as the Westminster System , is contrary to the spirit of democracy .
Similarly , to suggest that a particular government instantiates democracy , even an altogether admirable kind of government , is contrary to the spirit of democracy ; it is to perpetuate a kind of fascism in that it closes off the future , and involves shutting one ’s eyes to that which might , and will , force us to re-evaluate .
Democracy then , is impossible , because it is about an openness to the future ( difference ) that cannot become present .
12 . But Derrida would also want to claim that the notion of a democracy - to - come cannot simply function as a Kantian regulative ideal either , because we cannot know exactly what kind of difference the future will bring with it .
There is not , Derrida suggests , an ideal form of democracy , comprised of a list of finite characteristics , that we aspire to , and can get closer and closer to .
13 .
Any such regulative ideal treats the future as partially given , in that there is an expectation that our current aspirations will be contiguous with our future aspirations .
Derrida resists this move precisely because that would be to domesticate genuine futurity and genuine otherness .
It would be tantamount to the subjective anticipation of the future that , as we will see , Deleuze argues is involved in both habitual and memorial time .
14 . Finally , Derrida also resists this kind of regulative ideal because of the ethico - political exclusions that it can help to legitimate , ensuring that there is no place at the table for the wholly other , the foreigner , or whatever resists our current ( and hence finite ) understandings of democracy and its subjects .
Although a responsible democracy is never unambiguously assumable , there is a suggestion that a more responsible government would be open to the future in this way , open to the democracy to come .
c) Justice - to - Come 15 .
Similar themes are raised in Derrida ’s many discussions of justice , which he also argues must be constitutively ‘ to come ’ .
In ‘ Force of Law ’ , Derrida emphasises that every deconstruction is undertaken in the name of something that is undeconstructible – eg. justice , openness to difference , the wholly other , the marginalized , the ‘ to come ’ , or the future ( DPJ 25 ) .
These are all roughly synonymous , and Derrida makes clear that without the undeconstructible , deconstruction would be without motivation .
But what motivates deconstruction is neither something specific , nor a vague utopian outline of an ideal world .
On the contrary , it is motivated by something that is ‘ desertified ’ and abstracted of all concrete content : something that is unforeseeable and ‘ to come ’ .
We might say simply that deconstruction is motivated by the future .
16 .
But to return to the issue at hand , justice then is also ‘ to come ’ , deferred , and can never finally arrive , as was the case with democracy , but this does not commit Derrida to an ineffectual pessimism .
Rather , it means that every time the law , or a rule of conduct , folds in upon itself and becomes overly legalistic , such as a government responding in a populist way to their electorate and initiating a " three strikes and you are out " policy ( three breaks of the law and you are incarcerated regardless of circumstance ) , then the law needs deconstruction in order to give justice a chance .
The point is that justice and the law require each other , and further , that the one without the other is useless .
Justice and the law are not supposed to be opposites , but to interweave with one another ; as John Caputo puts it , " laws ought to be just , otherwise they are monsters , justice requires the force of the law , otherwise it is a wimp " ( Caputo , 1997 , 136 ) .
17 .
In order to understand this mutual implication of justice and the law , it is helpful to think about Derrida ’s suggestion that a judge needs to invent the law , for otherwise we could simply get a computer to dispense judicial punishments , paying no attention to the singularity of the participants and the event of transgression .
In an important sense , a judge needs to exceed the letter of the law in order to be just ( DPJ 26 ) , and this is the case even where mercy provisions are themselves enshrined in law , because those particular supplements to the law are also permanently susceptible to revision .
At the same time , it remains the case that a judge cannot completely ignore the law , but must negotiate this tension and must , as Derrida enigmatically suggests , " negotiate the unnegotiable " ( N 11 –40 ) .
18 .
It should be clear from this that to deconstruct does not mean to destroy .
Rather , to deconstruct the law ( and remember that Derrida means the law in its most general sense ) is to open it up to alternative meanings , such that revision is possible , and such that there can be a space for justice .
There is no end to this deconstruction , however , and justice does not arrive .
Justice cannot finally arrive , but is instead the radical future that haunts the time of the present ( SM 125 –72 ) .
The logic of this ‘ hauntology ’ , as Derrida puns in Spectres of Marx , means that justice is impossible in an important sense .
You cannot claim that this or that social organization is just , as justice is not a present thing .
It is an openness towards difference ( the future ) that is always both betrothed to the law , while simultaneously interrupting the calculations of the law , and undermining any attempt to compulsively stick with the law , or to take any social organization as self - legitimated .
Again , the implication is that a judicial or governmental policy , in order to be just ( insofar as this is possible ) needs to keep the future open and permanently revisable .
d) Messianic 19 .
In order to understand what Derrida is getting at with these various invocations of the ‘ to come ’ , it is also worth explicating a term that Derrida has borrowed from Walter Benjamin and the Judaic tradition more generally .
That term is the messianic and it relies upon a distinction with messianisms .
20 .
According to Derrida , the term messianism refers predominantly to the religions of the Messiahs – ie .
the Muslim , Judaic and Christian religions – although he also suggests that there are philosophical messianisms , as we will see .
These religions proffer a Messiah of known characteristics ( as described in the respective religious texts and oral traditions ) , and often one who is expected to arrive at a particular time and place .
The important point is that the coming messiah of the future is known , and his characteristics – maleness is almost inevitably one such characteristic – are foreseen .
In an obvious sense , this futural messiah is hence not acknowledged as wholly other , or beyond human comprehension , but rather is anticipated as conforming to certain spatio- temporal characteristics according to the ( phallocentric ) expectations of the present .
21 . Now , Derrida is not simplistically disparaging religion and the messianisms they propound ( Caputo , Kevin Hart , and others , have illustrated this at length ) , but Derrida ’s desertification of the messianisms puts a decidedly different spin on things .
His call to the wholly other , his invocation for the wholly other ‘ to come ’ , is not a call for a fixed or identifiable other of known characteristics , as is arguably the case in the average religious experience .
On the contrary , his wholly other ( tout autre ) is indeterminable and can never actually arrive .
22 . Derrida more than once recounts a story of Maurice Blanchot ’s where the Messiah was actually at the gates to a city , disguised in rags .
After some time , the Messiah was finally recognised by a beggar , but the beggar could think of nothing more relevant to ask than : " when will you come ? " ( DN 24 ) Derrida intimates that were the messiah actually to turn up , this would be a disaster .
He suggests it would shut down the structure of time and history .
It would close off the future , as well as the hope and faith that this radical temporal difference makes possible .
For Derrida , the messiah must hence be constitutively to come , or if they have already come , they must be to come again , one final time , and there are many religions that do suggest this , Christ and Christianity being the example par excellence .
Even when the Messiah is ‘ there ’ , or has been ‘ present ’ , he or she must still be yet to come , and this temporal necessity reaffirms the force of the distinction between the messianic and the various historical messianisms .
Whereas the historical messianisms domesticate the unknown and the future , the messianic refers to a structure of our existence that involves openness towards a future that can never be circumscribed by the horizons of significance that we inevitably bring to bear upon that possible future .
23 .
In other words , Derrida is not referring to a future that will one day become present ( or a particular conception of the saviour who will arrive ) , but to an openness toward an unknown futurity that cannot be anticipated .
It is time desertified of any concrete content and is hence ‘ formal ’ , and deconstruction is clearly motivated by a desire to open up myriad possibilities for a future that is of a fundamentally different order to the ‘ now ’ .
24 .
But what is wrong with anticipating the future and saying the future will be like this or that ?
While holding that we cannot avoid anticipating the future , Derrida also implies that , to greater and lesser extents , such demarcations of the future lead to the absolutisms of fascism and communism , in which in the name of this or that just future state ( or state of affairs ) , individuals silence or even kill those who do not believe in such a future .
Precisely in order to avoid the problems that such messianisms engender – eg. killing in the name of progress , mutilating on account of knowing the will of God better than others , etc. – Derrida suggests that : " I am careful to say ‘ let it come ’ because if the other is precisely what is not invented , the initiative or deconstructive inventiveness can consist only in opening , in uncloseting , in destabilising foreclusionary structures , so as to allow for the passage toward the other " ( RDR 60 ) .
This means that Derrida cannot and will not name the future .
25 .
For him , there is only a persistent hope for what the future might contain ; and a deconstruction that entertained any type of grand prophetic narrative , like a Marxist story about the movement of history toward a pre-determined future that would , once attained , make notions like history and progress obsolete , would itself have to be susceptible to deconstruction ( SM ) .
For Derrida , any dogmatic Marxism that is not primarily about an immanent critique of capitalism quickly becomes a philosophical messianism , because the future is determined in a particular way .
Derrida wants to emphasise the way in which the future is not , in fact , foreseeable , but is radically other , much as Deleuze ’s Difference and Repetition will also do , albeit in a different idiom that lacks such an obvious political engagement with questions concerning justice and democracy .
Deleuze and Difference and Repetition 26 .
Deleuze ’s most systematic examination of time comes in Difference and Repetition , although Bergsonism and Cinema 2 : The Time Image also accord the temporal sustained attention .
Difference and Repetition emphasises three approaches to time , all of which , Deleuze contends , involve repetition , as well as difference in repetition .
27 .
His three paradigms of the temporal are habitual time , memorial time , and futural time , although these should not be understood in the traditional common - sense way as simply being three different empirical components of time .
Rather , they are three representative ways of looking at time as a totality , and Deleuze suggests that they are hence exemplified in the work of certain philosophers , but rather than being a purely transcendental description , he also argues that these are concrete structures of experience .
Habitual time is the time of the ‘ living - present ’ , in which the chain of present moments is envisaged as constituting time .
Memorial time is the time of the past , as events are placed into time , and a form is imposed upon sensory experience .
Finally , there is the time of the future , which is the eternal return of difference .
28 .
Deleuze argues that all three of these modalities involve a synthesis of time , and the implication of this is that we cannot have an experience without synthesis .
In order to grasp what Deleuze ’s eternal return of difference is referring to , and why it is ultimately prioritised ( both in an ontological and existential sense ) , it is necessary to begin by explicating the two other fundamental modes of time that Deleuze describes in Difference and Repetition .
a ) Habit 29 .
As mentioned , for Deleuze , habit is the time of the living - present .
It is axiomatically clear that habit involves some kind of repetition .
When we behave habitually , we repeat previous modes of conduct , such as trying to park at the university in places where we have previously found a park .
30 .
It is a more difficult problem , however , to establish how habitual behaviour might also involve difference , as Deleuze insists it must – his fundamental contention is that difference and repetition are not simple opposites , but that each is necessarily embedded in the other .
For Deleuze , habit also involves difference primarily because " habit draws something new from repetition – namely difference ( in the first instance understood as generality ) " ( DR 73 ) .
Habit is hence not simply a mechanical repetition .
Rather , it also involves a pre-reflective recognition that the activity that is being engaged in is something that has been done before , and this is the generality of which Deleuze speaks .
31 .
For example , in the famous Humean series AB AB AB AB , it is habit that introduces a difference between one set of the series and the next .
It is habit that creates a difference between the two repetitions , and leads us to expect a B whenever we encounter an A .
As Deleuze suggests , " when A appears , we expect B with a force corresponding to the qualitative impressions of all the contracted ABs .
This is by no means a memory , nor… a matter of reflection " ( DR 70 ) .
His point is that it is not that we reflect upon the past , or even consciously remember the past – in fact , Deleuze argues that repetition induces us to repress any conscious recognition of that repetition ( DR 93 – 110 ) – but that we simply know how to go on in a non-reflective way .
Of course , this partially depends upon past experiences ( and what is often , perhaps problematically , called procedural memory ) , but at least according to Deleuze , there is no memory involved in the living present of habit ( DR 70 ) .
To repeat , he argues that it is not because of memory that the second pair of the group AB AB differs phenomenologically from the first .
32 .
The main premise of a recent film directed by Christopher Nolan , Memento , offers a good example of the manner in which habit might be envisaged as being largely independent of memory .
To briefly summarise the story , the main character , Leonard Shelby , witnesses his wife being raped and perhaps murdered ( this is ambiguous ) , and thereafter suffers a memory loss problem .
Lenny cannot create new memories after the incident .
He still remembers incidents prior to the rape , but after that everything passes and cannot be recalled .
Every minute or two , it is an abyssal difference that returns ; everything is new , repeatedly .
For example , in one scene Lenny has no memorial retention of how he got in the shower , but suddenly just finds himself there .
33 .
For our purposes , the important point is that Lenny does not remember his past at all , and yet he can still develop habitual responses towards his situation that ensure that he can learn and develop increasingly refined ways of adjusting to the world .
How is this possible ?
By simply repeating particular actions , aspects of his behaviour become quasi-instinctual .
He begins to habitually know where to look for things .
Even though he has no recollection of what he did a minute ago , it is nevertheless possible to learn and to adapt to what is ostensibly an absolutely new situation , through the deployment of consistent patterns of behaviour .
This is something that Merleau - Ponty also consistently emphasises in Phenomenology of Perception , where he insists upon the epistemological importance of the way that the body acclimatises to its environment , and thereby makes possible an embodied learning and training ( Merleau - Ponty , 1945 , 152–3 ) . b) Memory 34 .
Now Deleuze is not entirely satisfied with this habitual explanation of time , in which the chain of events , or passing present moments , constitute time .
At least , he is not satisfied with it on its own , and his basic question is something like , ‘ why is it that a habitual present , or temporal ‘ now ’ moment , can pass ’ , or , ‘ why is it that the present is not totally coextensive with time ? ’
35 .
Deleuze suggests that there needs to be a second synthesis of time that causes the present to pass , and this , he argues , is the time of the past , or the time of memory ( DR 79 ) .
The fundamental idea is that we cannot represent a former present ( ie. the past ) without also making the present itself represented in that very representation .
So , if we think about our past , we also in some sense bracket away the present , or cause the present to cease to be .
This means that whenever we remember , there will be two main aspects to this : firstly , the ‘ actual ’ memory of that past ; but also a representation of the present ( or the self ) as itself being engaged in remembering .
Deleuze describes these two aspects as memory and understanding ( DR 80 ) .
36 .
Again , Memento serves as a helpful tool in clarifying how this memorial aspect of our lives might cause the habitual present to pass .
After all , what Lenny cannot experience is memory and this means that Lenny ’s living - present of habit does not pass in the ordinary sense .
Rather , there is only an abrupt break , or gap , in the temporal order , and Lenny suddenly and repeatedly finds himself in new situations .
37 . Deleuze argues that memory involves a more profound synthesis than habit ( DR 79 ) , and he makes a very Derridean point to disrupt any privilege that might be accorded to the living - present of habit .
He argues that " no present would ever pass were it not past ‘ at the same time ’ as it is present ; no past would ever be constituted unless it were first constituted ‘ at the same time ’ as it was present " ( DR 81 ) .
So there is no temporal ‘ now ’ moment , contrary to what Husserl held , and the present must itself always be divided .
The present is always already differentiated from itself , and we have seen the manner in which the repetition of habit does , in fact , instantiate a difference ( it introduces a difference between the first AB and the following AB , by causing us to expect a B whenever we encounter an A ) .
38 . For Deleuze ( as for Derrida in his discussions of the trace ) , any invocations of the past refer to a ‘ pure past ’ that has never yet been present .
As Jon Roffe has put it , memory " synthesises from passing moments a form in - itself of things which never existed before that operation " ( Roffe , 2002 ) .
In other words , unity is imposed upon the past , in that it makes of the past this or that specific meaning .
Difference , or pure difference , is hence denied by this synthesis , but it is also clear that Deleuze does not want to hold that memory is a simple matter of representing the past .
Memory also creates the past , and hence instantiates a lesser form of difference .
According to Deleuze , this second synthesis of time , the past , is also the ground that means that any ‘ present ’ always necessarily passes ( as it is bracketed away in the attempt to remember ) , and it hence allows for the arrival of another ‘ present ’ ( DR 81 –2 ) .
39 .
Deleuze goes on to make the provocative claim that " every reminiscence , whether of a town , or a woman , is erotic " ( DR 85 ) .
Although this is never precisely explicated , his point seems to be that the experience of time in this second sense is ‘ structurally ’ akin to the experience of desire .
In this memorial dimension of time , we violate the purity of an absolute past and fail to understand it in its difference and singularity .
Likewise , desire is an experience in which you never completely get what you want , so to speak , but must always leave intact the mystery or singularity of that which is desired .
40 .
However , Deleuze has another reason why he considers the temporal modes of habit and memory to be insufficient , and this is explained in some detail .
Basically , he argues that these two conceptions of time do not properly institute time in thought .
Although we no doubt can think habitually , and can regurgitate prior ways of thinking about problems ( but remember that for Deleuze , habit must always be flexible and non-mechanistic ) , this is not genuine thought .
Similarly , although there is a type of ‘ understanding ’ involved in memory ( as the present is also bracketed away with the past , and this enables the necessary distance for something tantamount to reflection ) this is also not genuine thought .
Deleuze argues that truly philosophical thought involves a futural form that breaks open time ( DR 88 ) , and interrupts time , even if it always also pertains to time .
It is this aspect of time that we will now turn to , via a discussion of Nietzsche ’s idea of the eternal return of the same .
c) The Future and the Eternal Return 41 .
While Nietzsche regularly affirmed the importance of his conception of the eternal return , arguably the most important recent treatment of the concept can be found in Deleuze ’s work .
Deleuze accords the eternal return sustained attention in several different texts including Difference and Repetition , Nietzsche and Philosophy , Pure Immanence , and his essay " Nomad Thought " .
42 .
However , Deleuze puts a peculiar inflexion on Nietzsche ’s notion of the eternal return of the same , and instead exalts the eternal return of difference , or the eternal recurrence of difference .
He also argues that this is at least partially congruent with Nietzsche ’s own stated position .
43 . While Nietzsche suggests competing interpretations of the eternal return , at least according to the traditional interpretation , the eternal return poses a single but complicated question that can be schematised as follows – what if a malevolent genie informed that you that whatever mode of action you choose now , it will be repeated indefinitely ?
The implication of this is that everything recurs as we have once experienced it , and an infinite number of times .
This view also has potential cosmological implications if we are to concretely attempt to conceive of it , but Nietzsche intends the ‘ return ’ to function more as a test designed to intensify experience , and to ensure that we choose to do something that we are prepared to affirm over and over again .
The presumption seems to be that such an individual , who can affirm their own life on the supposition that their chosen action will recur infinitely , can handle anything .
44 .
This conception of the eternal return seems to represent the world , or at least an individual ’s life , as repeating itself endlessly in identical cycles .
Nietzsche explicitly suggests that a life is envisaged as returning in sequential order , and that there will be " nothing new in it " ( Nietzsche , 2001 , 341 ) .
It would hardly seem to be a good candidate for thematizing the future .
45 .
According to Deleuze , however , to emphasise this one conception of the eternal return in Nietzsche ’s work is to misconstrue the main import of the idea , which he argues is supposed to be about the return of difference .
Now there are undoubtedly some intuitive problems with the notion of difference returning – how can difference return if it does not share something with that which has preceded it ?
Is it even coherent to claim that pure difference can return ?
It is precisely this kind of logic that Deleuze wants to reject in his insistence on understanding pure difference , and he instead argues that the eternal return is designed to affirm only the contingent nature of things , and the manner in which we are confronted with a certain situation and compelled to act .
Like Nietzsche , there is a sense in which Deleuze also wants to affirm the eternal return as a thought that is designed to test us .
However , he argues that any commitment to the eternal return affirms only that initial experience of contingency – the moment of not having any particular mode of action necessitated , or of openness to the future .
Whereas the Kantian categorical imperative prescribes a certain course of action ( at least if one is being rational ) , the Deleuzian / Nietzschean test affirms the way in which the thought of the return does not prescribe anything , and it hence affirms chance , and that things may have been other than they are .
46 .
Elsewhere , Deleuze also goes on to argue that what is affirmed in any genuine thought of the eternal return , is not the whole , as the Ancients may have held , and as some of Nietzsche ’s comments also indicate .
Rather , Deleuze argues that the eternal return is selective ( PI 88 - 9 ; DR 91 - 2 , 298 ) , and that it frees us from conventional morality .
We choose to affirm something in particular ( which rules out , and differs from any number of alternatives ) .
To invoke an example of Deleuze ’s , if one were to choose cowardice or laziness to recur eternally , there is a sense in which this kind of affirmation of these attributes would actually transform them to such an extent that they could not be adequately called cowardice or laziness any longer ( PI 88 ) .
So the eternal return is designed to intensify and affirm our experiences of each moment , and Deleuze argues that it is the affirmation itself that recurs eternally , and not the consequences , or even the agent who does the affirming .
Reaction , negation and sameness do not return , and the consequences of actions do not return .
47 .
But if this is the case , it seems difficult to use the Deleuzian conception of the eternal return as a test to intensify experience .
If the agent does not return , then why worry about what you affirm , or why imbue your decision with any intensity at all ?
In the Nietzschean test , the motivation to do so is provided by the possibility that actual consequences , and an agent who suffers them , will recur indefinitely .
In other words , there is a question here as to how the Deleuzian inversion of Nietzsche ’s position might function as an aide to a revaluation of values .
It rejects traditional normative morality ( much as the return of the same also does ) , but the return of difference , in which agency plays no part , and in which the will also gets left behind , does not seem to motivate or intensify action in quite the same way .
48 . Deleuze and Nietzsche seem to be speaking on different levels .
Even though Deleuze insists on the importance of the existential experience of the eternal return , to a greater extent than Nietzsche he is also naming conditions for the possibility of experience ( hence his more ontological conception of the eternal return ) , as well as conditions for that particular kind of experience that Nietzsche is trying to encourage .
49 .
This brings Deleuze into closer proximity with the work of Derrida .
Rather than juxtaposing the Nietzschean Deleuze in opposition to the more transcendentally concerned Derrida – as Gordon Bearn and many other theorists have done – it seems that the issue is more complicated than that .
50 .
What is required , for the moment , is to connect this discussion of the eternal return of difference with Deleuze ’s descriptions of the final temporal mode – the future .
Deleuze frequently connects these two ideas , but what could such a conjunction mean ?
Clearly it suggests that for him , the eternal return of difference is more than merely a thought experiment , and it is not simply about history repeating itself .
Rather , for him the eternal return functions as a paradigm case of the futural dimension of time that he ultimately wants to privilege .
51 . Among other things , we can take this apparently paradoxical insistence upon the return of difference as a critique of Hegel , in which difference is continually reabsorbed by the synthesising movement of the dialectic .
For Deleuze , the thought of contradiction is not yet the thought of genuine difference ( DR 263 ) , and this means that thinking must not construe difference as derivative – or to be overcome , as he argues is the case with Hegel – but rather as fundamental to the possibility of any relation at all .
52 .
Of course , a complication for Deleuze ’s position is that he argues that this third temporal mode remains a synthesis of time .
The obvious response to this is to ask what exactly is being synthesised in the return of difference ?
If difference can be synthesised , then it would not seem to be an experience of pure difference , precisely because the contradiction , or difference , is overcome in the synthesis .
In other words , how can one synthesise pure difference ?
For Deleuze , such questions are badly posed , as throughout Difference and Repetition he argues that the relation ( the difference ) precedes the actual terms or polarities of the synthesis .
The synthesis that is involved in futural time , and the experience thereof , is hence not recuperative , but instead must be conceived of as disjunctive , in that the only unity of the eternal return is the negative unity that difference does , in fact , return .
He repeats this claim when he suggests that , " it is not the same or the similar that returns , but the eternal return which is the only ‘ same ’ and the only resemblance of that which returns " ( DR 126 ) .
53 .
To put this third temporal modality into more experiential terms , an experience of the future , the time of the eternal return , would hence be oriented towards change .
Of course , that does not tell us much , but Deleuze argues that he cannot tell us much about the eternal return , as pure difference cannot be adequately represented in conceptual thought .
54 .
In order to shed more light upon the way in which this idea might contribute to a revaluation of values , Deleuze talks about the past , or memorial time , as involving a disposition in which the act , or the event ( whether it be imagined or empirical ) , is too big for one , and he suggests that this attitude is exemplified in the cases of Hamlet and Oedipus ( DR 89 ) .
In habitual time , however , Deleuze suggests that there is a becoming equal to the act , and that the self is equal to whatever event may transpire .
Finally , he suggests that in the time of the return of difference , the future , " the event and the act possess a secret coherence which excludes that of the self " ( DR 89 ) .
55 .
But why must a genuine thought , or experience , of the future be subjectless ?
We can see from Deleuze ’s Humean - inspired understanding that the subject is the product both of a habitual synthesis , and also a retrospective imposition in order to give past disparate moments some kind of overall meaning or unity .
These memorial and habitual syntheses set up the basic conditions for subjectivity , but subjectivity is not part of the time of the return , the time of the future ( DR 89 ) .
If the future is to genuinely be the future , then it must not be restricted by this kind of identity .
Rather , the future is pure difference , or pure temporality , without the identity of subjectivity betrothed to it , and the " esoteric truth " of the idea of the eternal return of difference hence concerns the idea that the eternal return affects only the new , the unanticipatable , or the future as such , and not specific agents or conditions which return ( DR 90 ) .
Subjectivity anticipates the future , projects toward the future , and thereby deprives the future of its genuine futurity – it makes of the future a ‘ future - present ’ .
Again , this is not a genuine exposure to difference , but is a ‘ domestication ’ of difference and the future .
56 .
In this third synthesis of time , Deleuze enigmatically suggests that , " the order of time has broken the circle of the same and arranged time in a series only in order to reform a circle of the Other at the end of the series " ( DR 91 ) .
Now it is this circle of the Other that Deleuze describes , as well as this tacit claim that pure difference can be experienced , that Derrida does not so clearly endorse .
For Deleuze , it is only the yet - to - come that returns , and he wants to argue that there is a sense in which one can experience the return of difference ( as well as it being a transcendental condition for this temporal triumverate that cannot itself be thought representationally ) without that difference being subsumed by identity .
This is n’t quite the case with the later work of Derrida , despite it becoming both more Levinasian in its insistence upon the Other and also more Deleuzian in its insistence upon the future .
57 .
But what is the status of Deleuze ’s claim that the eternal return of difference ( the future ) is both the totality of the temporal triumverate and also its end ?
How might this kind of ontological claim aide any revaluation of values ?
How might it allow us to reject ‘ slave morality ’ and avoid ressentiment ?
To indicate briefly how this might be so , it is axiomatic that resentment is an attitude that develops following the conviction that the future is circumscribed ( eg. the master ’s will always be dominant ) and is bound to be contiguous with the past and the present .
Deleuze is pointing toward the way in which this final synthesis of time is about pure difference , whereas the other two aspects of the temporal have a less fundamental conception of difference .
The eternal return affirms the excessive and the unequal , the multiple and the different .
It is about change , or " difference as the origin , which then relates different to different in order to make it return as such " ( DR 125 ) and for him this reversal of the tradition has ethico - political consequences as much as ontological ones .
We need to seek encounters in which the anticipatory ( and potentially judgmental and moralising ) aspects of subjectivity have been stripped away , so as to allow for the new , and for an event , in the fullest possible sense of the term , and what this might consist in is explored in his collaborative works with Guattari .
The Politics of Derrida and Deleuze : A Conclusion , Perhaps 58 .
Although there are important differences between these two theorists , they have a shared emphasis upon the future , and there are clear political motivations behind this ; when the future is thought to be known , this tends to lead to either Fascism or Communism , in which that future state of affairs can justify the violent means needed to get there .
In Deleuze ’s case , this point is accompanied by a more Nietzschean insistence on the potentially pernicious psychological consequences of subjectivity and its inevitable moralisms ( ie. ressentiment ) .
Wary of this kind of thinking , both Derrida and Deleuze valorise the aspect of the future that is contentless and which cannot ever be known .
Both theorists also affirm time as the most radical form of difference , and insist upon the importance of this difference in opposition to the priority that much of the philosophical tradition has accorded to a temporal ‘ now ’ moment .
59 .
Moreover , for Deleuze and Derrida the future is also linked to novelty , to invention , to the emergence of the new , and hence to the singularity of any event worthy of the name – that is , to an event that is not subsumable under considerations of context , historical precedent , structure , etc. 60 .
However , it needs to be noted that this apparent equivalence between these theorists can be complicated through the recognition that in his eulogy for Deleuze , Derrida hints at a fundamental disagreement with the Deleuzian formulation of philosophy as being concerned with creating concepts ( WM , cf. WP 2 ) .
Of course , it is true that Derrida has a more circumspect and qualified attitude to philosophy than Deleuze , considering philosophy to always be partially betrothed to representational thinking ( WM ) .
That said , Derrida ’s discontent with this idea of philosophy as being about concept creation is not purely about what should be called philosophy ( and hence definitional ) .
It is also about the very idea of the creation of the new itself .
61 . For Derrida , the new is highly unlikely , improbable ; invention is qualified by the thought " if there is such a thing … "
( PF 39 ) For Deleuze , however , genuine philosophy creates new concepts , and although this may be relatively rare , in his work there is also a transcendental commitment to the new , to difference , that is not accompanied by the obligatory ‘ perhaps ’ or other forms of scare quotations that Derrida regularly employs .
Of course , phrasing the differences between these two French philosophers in such a way runs the risk of making Deleuze look like a naïve utopian thinker .
This may seem reductive , but from the perspective of Derrida ’s work it is also not altogether false .
For Derrida , pure difference cannot be experienced because the metaphysics of presence , as well as social habituation , etc. , can not be simply avoided .
A time without subjectivity ( eg. différance ) might produce or make ( im ) possible subjectivity ( SP 82 ) , but it is , paradoxically , only experiencable in the context of just such a subject .
Similarly , the radical futurity of the ‘ to come ’ and the messianic is experienced only as a disruption within unity that is necessarily marginal and that is always partly inaccessible .
On the other hand , in the work of Deleuze there is a suggestion that any imperialism of the same , or law of self - presence , is far more unstable and , consequently , that the play of difference , even pure difference , can be experienced in a modality of futural time that dispenses with both identity and subjectivity .
62 . The distinction between messianisms and the messianic can also help to clarify this important difference between Deleuze ’s and Derrida ’s exaltations of the future .
For Deleuze , the syntheses of memorial and habitual time are the basic conditions for subjectivity , but subjectivity is radically absent from the futural experience of time : the time of the eternal return of difference .
Now , while it is clear that Derrida ’s notion of the messianic is not reducible to subjectivity but is other than it , there is also a sense in which the messianic relies upon subjectivity and is inconceivable without it .
This is because the messianic is best construed as the exposure of a subject to this radical difference and , for Derrida , the subject is also one of those many unities that simultaneously resists the experience of the messianic .
63 . Derrida ’s notion of the messianic hence contains a more psychological register , in that he argues that while we persistently hope for the arrival of the wholly other , the prospect also scares us , and we hence harbour a desire for the coming of the Messiah to be indefinitely postponed .
As Derrida has suggested , " we wait for something that we would not like to wait for " ( DN 24 –5 ) and this suggests that even if it were temporally possible for the messiah to turn up , the subject would resist this , and an experience of pure difference ( or pure futurity ) hence seems eminently unlikely .
Perhaps this should not surprise us unduly given Derrida ’s enduring insistence upon the impossibility of simply overcoming metaphysics , but it is an important difference between he and Deleuze , and it ensures that subjectivity is never completely thrown into the volcano ( cf. DR 89 ) , or dispensed with , as is the case for Deleuze .
The experience of pure difference remains tenable for Deleuze ( even if improbable ) , but this is not so clearly the case for Derrida , who seems to hold true to his earlier formulation , at the start of his long academic career , regarding time necessarily being metaphysical .
Derrida accepts and even emphasises that there is an experience of the future , and of the untimely , but these are only possible in the context of a disruption to a metaphysics of presence , and in which a subjectivity produced by such a metaphysics resists these futural experiences .
64 .
The ethico - political significance of this difference is only beginning to be examined in detail ( see Patton and Protevi , 2003 ) , despite it having been apparent for some time .
Indeed , perhaps things have n’t changed dramatically since the student riots in France in May 1968 .
Deleuze embraced these wholeheartedly , but even then Derrida had reservations ( N 147-98 ) , and would not give himself over to the promise of the future as completely as his friend and colleague .
Ad hominem arguments notwithstanding , this ongoing vigilance and caution means that deconstruction will never be quite as politically radical as Deleuze and his followers , but that does not preclude it being effective .
Deconstruction ’s ongoing resistance to teleologies of the future is an important guardrail against absolutisms of any and all sorts , although questions remain to be pursued regarding the kind of political calculations – and politics involves compromise – that might best respect this significant moral insight at work in deconstruction .

A long time ago , I found somewhere on the web this story from Terry Dobson , a master of Aikido and conflict resolution .
I saved the text , but not its address , and I was not able to rediscover it .
Anyway , I think this page gives the clearest possible definition of Aikido , and so I put it on my web .
My apologies if anyone is offended .
THE TRAIN CLANKED and rattled through the suburbs of Tokyo on a drowsy spring afternoon .
Our car was comparatively empty - a few housewives with their kids in tow , some old folks going shopping .
I gazed absently at the drab houses and dusty hedgerows .
At one station the doors opened , and suddenly the afternoon quiet was shattered by a man bellowing violent , incomprehensible curses .
The man staggered into our car .
He wore laborers clothing , and he was big , drunk , and dirty .
Screaming , he swung at a woman holding a baby .
The blow sent her spinning into the laps of an elderly couple .
It was a miracle that the was unharmed .
Terrified , the couple jumped up and scrambled toward the other end of the car .
The laborer aimed a kick at the retreating back of the old woman but missed as she scuttled to safety .
This so enraged the drunk that he grabbed the metal pole in the center of the car and tried to wrench it out of its stanchion .
I could see that on of his hands was cut and bleeding .
The train lurched ahead , the passengers frozen with fear .
I stood up .
I was young then , some 20 years ago , and in pretty good shape .
Id been putting in a solid eight hours of Aikido training nearly every day for the past three years .
I like to throw and grapple .
I thought I was tough .
Trouble was , my martial skill was untested in actual combat .
As students of Aikido , we were not allowed to fight .
" Aikido , " my teacher had said again and again , " is the art of reconciliation .
Whoever has the mind to fight has broken his connection with the universe .
If you try to dominate people , you are already defeated .
We study how to resolve conflict , not how to start it . "
I listened to his words .
I tried hard I even went so far as to cross the street to avoid the chimpira , the pinball punks who lounged around the train stations .
My forbearance exalted me .
I felt both tough and holy .
In my heart , however , I wanted an absolutely legitimate opportunity whereby I might save the innocent by destroying the guilty .
This is it !
I said to myself , getting to my feet .
People are in danger and if I dont do something fast , they will probably get hurt .
Seeing me stand up , the drunk recognized a chance to focus his rage .
" Aha ! "
He roared .
" A foreigner !
You need a lesson in Japanese manners ! "
I held on lightly to the commuter strap overhead and gave him a slow look of disgust and dismissal .
I planned to take this turkey apart , but he had to make the first move .
I wanted him mad , so I pursed my lips and blew him an insolent kiss .
" All right !
He hollered .
" You re gonna get a lesson . "
He gathered himself for a rush at me .
A split second before he could move , someone shouted " Hey ! "
It was earsplitting .
I remember the strangely joyous , lilting quality of it - as though you and a friend had been searching diligently for something , and he suddenly stumbled upon it .
" Hey ! " I wheeled to my left ; the drunk spun to his right .
We both stared down at a little old Japanese .
He must have been well into his seventies , this tiny gentleman , sitting there immaculate in his kimono .
He took no notice of me , but beamed delightedly at the laborer , as though he had a most important , most welcome secret to share .
" Cmere , " the old man said in an easy vernacular , beckoning to the drunk .
" Cmere and talk with me . "
He waved his hand lightly .
The big man followed , as if on a string .
He planted his feet belligerently in front of the old gentleman , and roared above the clacking wheels , " Why the hell should I talk to you ? "
The drunk now had his back to me .
If his elbow moved so much as a millimeter , Id drop him in his socks .
The old man continued to beam at the laborer .
" What cha been drinkin ? " he asked , his eyes sparkling with interest .
" I been drinkin sake , " the laborer bellowed back , " and its none of your business ! "
Flecks of spittle spattered the old man .
" Ok , that s wonderful , " the old man said , " absolutely wonderful !
You see , I love sake too .
Every night , me and my wife ( shes 76 , you know ) , we warm up a little bottle of sake and take it out into the garden , and we sit on an old wooden bench .
We watch the sun go down , and we look to see how our persimmon tree is doing .
My great - grandfather planted that tree , and we worry about whether it will recover from those ice storms we had last winter .
Our tree had done better than I expected , though especially when you consider the poor quality of the soil .
It is gratifying to watch when we take our sake and go out to enjoy the evening - even when it rains ! "
He looked up at the laborer , eyes twinkling .
As he struggled to follow the old mans conversation , the drunks face began to soften .
His fists slowly unclenched .
" Yeah , " he said .
" I love persimmons too " His voice trailed off .
" Yes , " said the old man , smiling , " and I m sure you have a wonderful wife . "
" No , " replied the laborer .
" My wife died . "
Very gently , swaying with the motion of the train , the big man began to sob .
" I dont got no wife , I dont got no home , I dont got no job .
I am so ashamed of myself . "
Tears rolled down his cheeks ; a spasm of despair rippled through his body .
Now it was my turn .
Standing there in well - scrubbed youthful innocence , my make - this - world - safe - for - democracy righteousness , I suddenly felt dirtier than he was .
Then the train arrived at my stop .
As the doors opened , I heard the old man cluck sympathetically .
" My , my , " he said , " that is a difficult predicament , indeed .
Sit down here and tell me about it . "
I turned my head for one last look .
The laborer was sprawled on the seat , his head in the old mans lap .
The old man was softly stroking the filthy , matted hair .
As the train pulled away , I sat down on a bench .
What I had wanted to do with muscle had been accomplished with kind words .
I had just seen Aikido tried in combat , and the essence of it was love .
I would have to practice the art with an entirely different spirit .
It would be a long time before I could speak about the resolution of conflict .
