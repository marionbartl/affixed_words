1 / 4 Back to Gallery
Black may be beautiful , but when it comes to dogs of a darker hue , potential adopters often overlook them -- especially if they 're big .
If you 're like me , you probably chose your dog based on something like the melting feeling you got when he held one ear up and one ear down the first time he looked at you , not the color of his coat .
But when Petfinder.com , an online database of more than 300,000 adoptable pets , declared August 12 national " Adopt - A - Less - Adoptable - Pet Day , " they discovered that finding homes for black dogs , particularly larger ones , was a real problem for their 12,681 member shelters and rescue groups .
" In our July 2009 survey , 54.2 percent of our respondents told us that they had experienced ' big black dog syndrome , ' where pets were harder to place for that very reason , " said Kim Saunders , head of shelter outreach and public relations for Petfinder.com .
The good news is that black dogs have a lot of friends .
Petfinder launched a campaign telling adopters that dark furred pets make it easier to accessorize .
" After all , " said Saunders , " black goes with everything ! "
The Black Pearl Dogs
Web site offers rescue groups a place to list their available black dogs and tries to educate the public about the problem .
And last month , PR and marketing expert Heather Rosenwald launched Start Seeing Black Dogs , which offers free marketing and PR services to help shelters and rescue groups put their available black dogs in the best possible light to potential adopters .
" It 's not that people are rejecting black shelter dogs out of hand , " said Rosenwald , who owns two adopted big black dogs of her own .
" It 's that they just do n't realize the problem exists .
Whenever I do some kind of public education , like appearing on a radio show , and talk about black dogs , there 's an immediate increase in the adoption of those dogs from the local shelters and rescue groups . "
It 's hard to make sense of the difficulty in finding homes for black dogs .
After all , black Labs , along with their yellow siblings , are the most popular dog breed in America .
And not only is the current Presidential pet --
Bo the Portuguese water dog -- a black - furred dog , but in a show of astonishing bi-partisanship , so was former President Bush 's dog Barney , a Scottish Terrier .
This may be a problem not of black dogs in general but of black shelter dogs in particular .
" The fact that black Labs are so popular might be part of the problem , " Rosenwald said .
" There are so many of them that when you get into a shelter setting , they 're kind of a dime a dozen . "
It also could just be a matter of lighting .
" Some shelters are n't very well lit , " she continued , " and that makes black dogs literally harder to see .
We really encourage shelters and rescue groups to show them off in well - lit areas whenever possible . "
Because many people start their search for a new dog on the Web , it 's critical that organizations do a careful job of photographing their darker pets .
" We 've heard from many potential adopters that it's hard to see the faces and get a feeling for the personalities of black dogs in photographs -- we call it ' black blob syndrome . ' "
The fact that black dogs ' facial features , expression and eyes can be very hard to see might give their lighter - colored competition an edge online .
Taking good photos of black pets is easy to learn , however .
" We 've put together great tips for point and click cameras , which most shelters and rescue groups use , " Rosenwald told me .
" Our pointers will help them get great photos of black dogs with a simple camera .
And in photos or in person , shelters really need to bedazzle adopters with something colorful , like a bandana or vest .
Make the dark dogs stand out any way you can . "
Unfortunately , it 's not all just a trick of the light .
" Some people subconsciously see black dogs as menacing , " Rosenwald said .
" Which is unfortunate and also untrue .
Black dogs are just as affectionate and wonderful as dogs of any other color .
There is no correlation between personality and behavior and coat color . "
Anne Hendrickson , who runs a boarding kennel and dog day care center in Minneapolis , saw " big black dog " syndrome in action a few years ago .
" I fostered a litter of homeless puppies for an animal rescue group , " she said .
" The litter had one black puppy and the rest blonds .
Needless to say , the blond puppies were spoken for immediately , but the one black pup was n't adopted . "
Hendrickson , who had adopted two black dogs before learning about " black dog syndrome , " decided to add Cobie to her " black pack . "
" They say in your life you will have one dog who is ' the one , ' " she told me .
" Cobie is my ' one . '
He 's four years old and a certified therapy dog , and we spend our days helping disadvantaged children learn to read at schools , shelters , youth detention centers .
Goes to show what a great dog you can be missing out on by passing up a black dog . "
Some shelters have turned " big black dog syndrome " into a marketing opportunity instead of an obstacle .
" Our animal care workers noticed that we were inundated with wonderful black dogs who were n't finding homes as easily as other dogs , " said Hope Hancock , director of the SPCA of Wake County in North Carolina .
The shelter staff came up with what they called the " Black Dog Blue Light Special " campaign .
" This was a real grassroots campaign , " said Hancock .
" It did n't originate in our marketing department , but from the people who were working hands - on with the adoptable dogs . "
The workers strung blue Christmas lights in the adoption area , made up cards describing the dogs ' personalities and giving them a little pizzazz , and even ran ads that gave " blue light special " a literal spin : they manipulated the photos to turn the black dogs blue .
When some people saw the ads and assumed the dogs had been painted blue , they contacted the shelter with outraged complaints -- giving the SPCA an opportunity to do a little education about " black dog sydndrome . "
And the grassroots campaign was a success .
" The dogs went flying out of here , " Hancock said .
The shelter even won a $ 10,000 award in a marketing competition for promoting adoptions of hard - to - place pets .
I 'm not saying that everyone reading this has to run out and adopt a black dog .
Choosing a dog is a lot like falling in love : a matter of chemistry more than rational choice .
If the dog who captures your heart is red , white , tan , or speckled , there 's nothing wrong with that .
But the next time you 're checking out available dogs on the Web or walking through the kennels in your local shelter , keep your eye out for the love in the eye of a dog of a darker hue .
" That 's all we 're really asking , " said Rosenwald .
" Start seeing black dogs . "
A small pistol belonging to 1930s gangster John Dillinger has been sold at auction to a private collector for $ US95,600 ( $ 116,000 ) - more than double the pre-sale estimate .
Dennis Lowe of Heritage Auction Galleries said the Remington .41 calibre Double Derringer was said to have been found hidden in one of Dillinger 's socks when he was arrested in Tucson , Arizona .
According to affidavits , Tucson 's sheriff at the time gave the pistol to a probation officer , whose family kept it until selling it in 1959 .
The owner , who wished to remain anonymous , sold it because he was in declining health , Lowe said .
It had been expected to fetch up to $ US45,000 at the Dallas auction on Saturday ( local time ) .
A private Los Angeles collector made the winning bid .
Dillinger was one of the most infamous bank robbers in the United States in the early 1930s .
He was shot dead by FBI agents in Chicago in July 1934 , aged 31 .
His exploits have inspired at least five movies or TV films including the most recent release , Public Enemies , in which Dillinger is portrayed by actor Johnny Depp .

Jason Linkins has , though :
I have personally never been to Seattle , Washington , but I am reliably informed that it is a major American city that enjoys many of the technological amenities of modern life , including news organizations with real live reporters and cameras and internet access and even a major newspaper called the Seattle Times .
So , there 's really no reason why the media could n't have reported on the fact that yesterday , 3,000 people attended a rally for health care reform in Westlake Park .
According to one person who was there , though , no one could be bothered :
Development tools that are programmer - friendly but hardware - intensive , notably LISP , have long been a staple of research domains such as artificial intelligence — but have not been thought suitable for mass - market applications due to difficulties in packaging the executable bits and running them on end - user hardware .
Web - facing applications , whose running code resides on servers , shift those trade - offs and invite " research " languages such as LISP to contend for mainstream roles .
Formal studies of programmer productivity and program performance — with multiple programmers doing side - by - side implementations of multiple tasks — suggest that functions can be performed with fewer lines of code , with less variability in development time and with acceptable memory use and execution speed using LISP and LISP - based systems .
Developers handicap themselves if they play by old rules on the Webs quite different field .
That which was
The current generation of application developers has been imprinted with a business model of mass - market software as frozen bits , packaged as executable binary files , delivered on inexpensive media units — floppy disks or CDs — to run on a PC .
This model is merely an artifact , though , of one brief stage in the evolution of technologies and markets .
/ zimages/3/28571.gif
Click here to read about the importance of making source code clear .
The model of " bits in a baggie , " as one might call it in homage to the Apple II era , defined its own criteria for programming languages : ease of compilation , minimum code size for ease of distribution and minimum memory footprint for acceptable performance on low - cost PC configurations .
When product - cycle durations are measured in years — or , at a minimum , in quarters — a cumbersome process of turning source code into saleable bits is tolerable ; when a mass - market application is delivered as function across a network , not as raw bits in a licensees hands , the equilibrium state is far more friendly to developers .
That which is
Imagine the perspective of the proverbial man from Mars , the hypothetical observer with no preconceived ideas about what makes sense .
The man from Mars sees development languages being chosen as if processor cycles are expensive , when a growing fraction of todays computing workload runs on vast farms of cheap boxes whose cost is spread across entire communities of users .
Martian question 1 : Cant you use more processor - intensive methods if they deliver more powerful applications more quickly ?
The man from Mars sees development languages being chosen for their ability to condense ideas into executable bits today — not for ease of incorporating new ideas tomorrow .

2 : If the language youre using requires you to be as clever as you can just to get something working in the first place , how will you ever be clever enough to improve it ?

The Diocese of Kilmore has introudced a number of measures , which will be implemented in all churches , for the duration of the swine flu epidemic .
Bishop Leo O'Reilly speaking in St. Aiden's Church , Butlersbridge , on Sunday morning said : " The move is necessary to avoid people spreading the virus . "
He said those who had flu or flu symptoms were requested not to attend mass or other church ceremonies .
The handshake is to be discontinued as a means of offering the sign of peace .
" People can have a moment of reflection , " he added .
" It is highly recommended that receiving communion on the tongue is replaced by reception on the hand . "
The sharing of one chalice by concelebrating priests and ministers of the eucharist is to be discontinued , with a possible alternative for the host to be dipped into the chalice .
The Bishop added that clergy and lay ministers will be required to wash their hands with an alcohol - based sanitiser before and after distributing communion .
" It is recommended that this is done in view of the people , as a means of reassuarnce . "
Holy water fonts in churches will be empty .
He said parents with children displaying flu - like symptoms , should keep them at home until they have recovered and not sent them to school .
" In most instances those affect should recover within a week and if it is prolonged any further , contact your doctor . "

NAIROBI , Kenya  American commandos killed one of the most wanted Islamic militants in Africa in a daylight raid in southern Somalia on Monday , according to American and Somali officials , an indication of the Obama administration ’s willingness to use combat troops strategically against Al Qaeda ’s growing influence in the region .
Western intelligence agents have described the militant , Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan , as the ringleader of a Qaeda cell in Kenya responsible for the bombing of an Israeli hotel on the Kenyan coast in 2002 .
Mr. Nabhan may have also played a role in the attacks on two American embassies in East Africa in 1998 .
American military forces have been hunting him for years , and on Monday , around 1 p.m. , villagers near the town of Baraawe said four military helicopters suddenly materialized over the horizon and shot at two trucks rumbling through the desert .
The trucks were carrying leaders of the Shabab , an Islamist extremist group fighting to overthrow Somalia ’s weak but internationally recognized government .
The Shabab work hand - in - hand with foreign terrorists , according to Western and Somali agents , and in the past few months , as the battle for control of Somalia has intensified , the group seems to be drawing increasingly close to Al Qaeda .

Claire Logie has a cartoon on her desk which says " stop and think " - a painful reminder of the day when she failed to do exactly that .
She had been meaning to transfer a sum of £ 2,000 into her savings account .
But , after clicking the wrong box , she accidentally sent the cash to someone she had paid years ago , and whose details had been saved on her account .
" As soon as I 'd done it I felt sick and very upset , " she said , but assumed she would eventually get the cash back .
But six months on she is still to receive a refund .
' Easy to do ' I am not a dizzy person .
I am not an idiot .
I made the mistake , and it is very easy to do
Claire Logie Claire is no online novice , and even works for one of the big four high street banks , so is familiar with banking on the internet .
She says : " I am not a dizzy person .
I am not an idiot .
I made the mistake , and it is very easy to do . "
So , why will the bank not return the money ?
The bank concerned , the Alliance and Leicester , says it cannot force the person who received the money to return it .
They tried repeatedly to contact the customer concerned , but " regrettably " that customer has not responded .
A spokesperson told the BBC : " It was n't our mistake , so we are unable to take any further action " .
Furthermore , they would not even tell Claire the name of the customer , because of the Data Protection Act .
That means she is unable to take the case to the small claims court .
The Financial Ombudsman is also unable to help , because her complaint is not against the bank itself .
Grey area
Cases like this are rare , because most people receiving money by mistake pay it back .
But Jemma Smith , of the Payments Council , which oversees the efficiency of bank payments , admits there 's nothing in the banking code about how errors like this can be dealt with .
The only answer seems to be not to make the mistake in the first place .
" Everything your bank will tell you is going to be stressing how important it is that you have the correct account name and sort code , " she says .
Instances like this are not necessarily regarded as theft .
Legally this is a grey area , as proving the recipient of the money had a guilty mind at the time he or she received it could be difficult .
Imagine giving £ 2,000 to someone who looked like your friend on the street , but turned out not to be .
If they ran off with the money , would you have a leg to stand on ?
The police told the BBC it might be possible for them to investigate , but they could not guarantee the Crown Prosecution Service would agree to prosecute .
' Arbitration ' Alison Steed , a former Daily Telegraph journalist who has set up a financial website called MyMoneyDiva.com , believes the problem is much more widespread than has been realised .
She estimates up to 1 % of all bank transfers go astray .
That would mean as much as £ 439 m being paid to the wrong person every year in the UK , although the vast majority of such payments would be corrected .
She also believes the Financial Ombudsman service should set up a department to deal with such mistakes .
" Part of the Ombudsman service could be in a position to look at these cases , and take on some kind of arbitration , " she says .
But she is not optimistic about Claire getting her £ 2,000 back .
" I hope she gets it back .
But I think in reality the chances are pretty slim . "
In the meantime , for anyone doing some online banking , it might be worth remembering to stop and think .
Having that cartoon on your desk , and acting on it , could really save you money .

Mother swan takes babies under her wing for trip across the pond
Advertisement
There comes a time on every family outing when the little ones can go no further and demand to be carried the rest of the way .
Luckily for these six fluffy cygnets , Mummy was happy to oblige .
One by one , under her watchful eye , the brood clambered aboard her back for a ride .
Having checked all were present and correct , the mother swan gently tucked back her wings to stop them falling off before gliding back to her nest .
Hop aboard :
The mother swan checks on the six cygnets tucked beneath her wings
The mute swan and her fluffy cargo were caught on camera by Richard Meston on a visit to Bicton Park Botanical Gardens near
Sidmouth , Devon .
Mr Meston , 32 , said : ‘ The cygnets had been splashing in the water around their mum .
They looked like they
were starting to get tired and one by one started to scramble up on their mum ’s back .
She did n’t mind at all and even gave them a
nudge up .’
The father of three from Bournemouth added : ‘ After they got settled in , she covered them with her wings protectively like a
cushion and went on her way .
Precious cargo :
The tiny birds could be seen peeking from the swan 's feathers at Bicton Park in Devon
‘ She kept looking back to make sure they were still there .
It was almost as if she was giving them a quick telling - off to keep them in line .
I could imagine them like kids in the back of the car saying , “ Are we nearly there yet ? ” and squabbling . ’

Last week Alternet published a controversial essay wherein the narrator attended a party thrown to raise money for a friend 's abortion .
Numerous conservative bloggers wrote obligatory posts .
The piece took heat from the left too .
Tracy Clark - Flory posted a worthwhile example .
" I had n't heard of an abortion party until today .
That 's despite growing up in the liberal sanctuary of the San Francisco Bay Area and attending a passionately feminist women 's college , " she wrote .
" I 've seen women unabashedly announce " I had an abortion " to friends and strangers alike , out loud and on T - shirts and bumper stickers , but an abortion party is an entirely new concept to me . "
In a followup comment , Mary Elizabeth Williams astutely writes that " the story reads like it was calculated to provoke the most apoplectic reactions of the right .
The wimmins are celebrating baby killing , and men are n't welcome ! "
It 's that last bit about men not being welcome that I 'd like to focus on .
The piece 's numerous flaws notwithstanding , it affords an opportunity to discuss an issue that all the critical responses I 've seen have mostly ignored .
Here is the relevant passage :
I saw Maggie ’s boyfriend , sitting near the kitchen , wearing rainbow suspenders and looking uncomfortably alone .
As it turns out , he had been the object of a lot of vitriol from Maggie ’s friends -- women who thought that he should not have had anything to do with the abortion .
Both he and Maggie had been saddened about this reaction because they had made the decision together .
When we talked , his sentences spilled out in quick little jumbles , like scattered puzzle pieces .
His eyes stayed focused on a point behind me .
He looked as if he ’d like to be somewhere else .
Maggie , too , looked less than excited .
A few days beforehand , one of her friends had asked her to have the abortion in Ohio .
When Maggie insisted on bringing her boyfriend along , the friend told her not to bother coming .
Maggie was being shown a great deal of respect , certainly .
But she told me she could n’t help but feel as though her pregnancy had been " hijacked " by women who felt like her inclusion of a man in the decision was weak or wrong .
This was a surprise to me , but I did n’t exactly know how to weigh in .
Abortion is , after all , a very tricky topic -- a minefield of opinions where the slightest misstep can elicit unexpected reactions from friends , family , co-workers and strangers .
Though I would classify myself an ardent pro-choicer , I also recognize that I am a man , and therefore somewhat of a problematic player in the debate .
It ’s never been made clear to me what sort of involvement I ’m entitled to on the issue , and I do n’t feel particularly confident making judgment calls about women -- whatever their political leanings .
Let 's call this the Tupac Shakur approach to the abortion question :
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women , do we hate our women ?
I think it 's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women , be real to our women
And if we do n't we 'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies , that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you 're fed up ladies , but keep your head up
Without taking any position on abortion itself , I want to interrogate the appropriate role of males , and suggest that progressives especially face some thorny questions .
As I understand it , the most common position on the left is that how a woman deals with an unwanted pregnancy is a choice to be made by her alone .
At the same time , the progressives I know subscribe to a partnership ideal in relationships , wherein major life decisions between couples are made via a process of mutually supportive dialogue , stripped of archaic gender norms whenever possible .
It is easy enough to imagine how this plays out in a film that reflects the cultural sensibilities of secular liberals .
The woman gets pregnant : " I 'm late , " she tells her boyfriend .
The man , if he wants to keep the sympathy of the audience , says , " What are we going to do ? "
The " we " signals his mutual responsibility for the circumstance and investment in the process -- and the question mark signifies that he 'll pretty much support whatever she decides .
" Tragedy and Hope " by Dr. Carroll Quigley ISBN 0913022-14-4 , GSG Books and Associates , Box 590 , San Pedro , Ca. 90733 Click to purchase Tragedy and Hope
Dr. Carroll Quigley is best known as Bill Clinton 's professor of history at the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University .
He also taught at Princeton and at Harvard .
His 1300 page book " Tragedy and Hope " is unique among other history books in its exposure of the role of International Banking cabal behind - the - scenes in world affairs .
He does not spend a lot of time explaining what he calls " unorthodox " financial methods as opposed to " orthodox " financial methods which can be be distinguished by the fact that " orthodox " finance has governments allowing banks to create the money and then borrowing that money from them at interest to create massive growth of public debt whereas " unorthodox " finance has government Treasuries create the money and borrowing that money from the Treasury without interest to create a stable debt where all payments go against the principal .
The recurrent theme of these historical texts is the oppression of the poor by the International bankers .
When I speak of Rothschild and Rockefeller ( R&R ) , I am treating them as the epitome of the parasitic usurer families for according to the golden rule , those who have the gold makes the rules and throughout most of recent history , the Rothschild and Rockefeller families have been the most prominent owners of the gold .
Blame for all the genocides and most murders of recent history can be laid at their feet though it is a responsibility shared by their banker cronies the world over .
I know that if Christ came back and had a whip in hand , it 's these moneylenders he 's go after , once again .
Over and over , Quigley details governments acting for the benefits of the owners of money to the detriment of the poor to the point where the poor strike or riot rather than face starvation quietly .
Quigley , on a regular basis , mentions orthodox versus unorthodox financial methods without ever detailing the unorthodox methods responsible for the happiness of the citizens though he goes into great depth about the orthodox financial methods which result in such oppressive misery .
Whereas orthodox financial methods can be best explained as government licensing private banks to create the money and then borrow it from them at interest whereas unorthodox financial methods can be best explained as government Treasury creating the money and paying no interest to middlemen .
Recent use of orthodox financial methods is detailed at : http://www.cyberclass.net/turmel/np2.htm
I will be studying his book in conjunction with the greatest book about monetary systems in antiquity , David Astle 's " Babylonian Woe , " In anticipation of a major improvement on the current unsafe engineering design of money , I will be arguing that the unorthodox financial methods we will be studying are better than the orthodox financial methods that now are enslaving all the planet 's nations to insurmountable debt .

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to issue a report next month suggesting speculators played a significant role in driving wild swings in oil prices -- a reversal of an earlier CFTC position that augurs intensifying scrutiny on investors .
In a contentious report last year , the main U.S. futures - market regulator pinned oil - price swings primarily on supply and demand .

If you need to install MySQL databases on a number of machines with roughly the same configuration then it becomes extremely tedious to run the installer wizard on each machine .
You can download the MySQL server as a msi package which allows you to install with the MSIEXEC DOS command in windows hands free .
To install all the necessary files for MySQL to run you need to type this command at the console :
msiexec /qn /i mysql-essential-5.1.37-win32.msi INSTALLDIR=C:\MySQL
The ‘/ qn ’ switch makes this install quiet .
In this example I chose ‘ C: \MySQL ’ as the install directory .
Feel free to replace that path with whatever you choose .
Just because MySQL is installed and has all the appropriate files registered does n’t mean that it ’s useful .
You will probably want it to run as a service , have it listen on a certain port , and have a root user already set up .
This can be done with the MySQLInstanceConfig .exe program , although the arguments are a little more involved .
C:\MySQL\bin\MySQLInstanceConfig.exe - i -q " - lC:\MySQL\mysql_install_log.txt " " - pC:\MySQL\bin " " - tC:\MySQL\my- template.ini " " - cC:\MySQL\my.ini " -v5.1.37 ServerType=DEVELOPMENT
DatabaseType=MIXED
ConnectionUsage=DSS
Port=3306 ServiceName=MySQL RootPassword=root1234 SkipNetworking=no AddBinToPath=yes
The entire string above must be run as one line .
If you just copy and paste then the console will error out .
Most of the arguments above are straight forward if you ’ve ever configured a MySQL server before but just in case I ’ve detailed the parameters below .
-n product name
- p path of installation ( no \bin )
-v version
Actions :
- i ( install instance )
-r ( remove instance )
-s ( stop instance )
-q ( be quiet )
- lfilename ( write log file )
When launched manually , these can also be submitted
-t
-c
Use the following options to define the parameters for the configuration file generation .
ServiceName=$
AddBinToPath={yes | no}
ServerType={DEVELOPMENT
| SERVER | DEDICATED}
DatabaseType={MIXED
| INNODB | MYISAM}
ConnectionUsage={DSS
| OLTP}
ConnectionCount=#
SkipNetworking={yes | no}
Port= #
StrictMode={yes | no}
Charset=$
RootPassword=$
RootCurrentPassword=$
So if you use the example above you will get a basic mysql installation .
When I used these commands I put them in a batch file followed by this command :
mysql –user=user_name –password=your_password db_name < create_database_and_tables.sql
The ‘ create_database_and_tables.sql ’ obviously has all the sql code to create the MySQL databases and tables that are needed .
The batch file installed , configured , and structured my MySQL databases .
I spent awhile yesterday looking for a post like this so hopefully this saves someone some time .
Los Angeles City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich wants to give police the ability to arrest “ taggers ” simply for hanging out together , without having to catch them in the act -- raising thorny constitutional issues as he lays the groundwork for a campaign to tackle the city ’s vexing graffiti problem .
In an interview , Trutanich said his staff has begun amassing street - level intelligence and reviewing legal strategies that would pave the way for a series of injunctions targeting graffiti and “ tagging ” crews .
The measures would be lawsuits of sorts , brought on behalf of the public , treating much of the graffiti that mars buildings and overpasses as a criminal enterprise and arguing that it has become such a nuisance that it requires an extraordinary police response .
Los Angeles is the national leader in the use of civil injunctions to combat criminal gang behavior -- the model for Trutanich ’s proposal .
The city has 43 injunctions targeting 71 gangs , including one rolled out earlier this year over a 13.7 - square - mile area of South L.A. , the largest in California .
The tagging injunctions would focus on neighborhoods where graffiti is a particularly acute problem , such as the Harbor Gateway area , the San Fernando Valley and , especially , South L.A .
“ I ’m going to put together an end - of - days scenario for these guys , ” Trutanich said .
“ If you want to tag , be prepared to go to jail .
And I do n’t have to catch you tagging .
I can just catch you . . . with your homeboys . ”
It ’s tough talk , but Trutanich has some work ahead of him .
Peter Bibring , staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California , called the proposal “ unquestionably unconstitutional , ” and some law enforcement officials said they were skeptical or ambivalent .
Injunctions prohibit behavior that would otherwise be legal : wearing certain clothes , making certain hand signs , going to certain parks .
Their most potent provisions make it illegal for two alleged gang members to associate in public -- an arrestable offense even if no other crime is being committed .
Critics say injunctions go too far , criminalizing entire communities and pushing kids on the edge into the criminal justice system , not helping them stay out of it .
Injunctions , critics argue , do n’t distinguish between hard - core gangbangers and hangers - on and fail to recognize that in some neighborhoods , an association with a gang is the only way to stay safe .
Blurring the line ?
In South Los Angeles , Police Capt .
Mark Olvera said he feared that injunctions against taggers would be untenable .
He also said it could blur the line that police use when confronting graffiti -- between hardened criminals who use graffiti to mark territory and challenge rivals , and aimless punks who try to enhance their street credibility by scribbling designs on lampposts , vans and buildings .
Olvera is commander of the LAPD ’s Newton station on South Central Avenue , in the heart of a neighborhood where graffiti is ubiquitous .
He said an injunction could be very helpful in policing hard - core gangsters .
But he feared that targeting low - level taggers could undermine the city ’s efforts to combine traditional police suppression tactics with social - service programs that can steer at - risk youths onto a better path .
“ I think the concept could be useful , ” Olvera said .
“ But I ’d have to see where this is going to go .
What are we doing ?
Let ’s say we pick up a kid for this .
Who is going to work with that kid ?
Is there another organization that is going to do counseling or work with him in [ developing ] a new art form ?
Or are we just going to keep arresting them ? ”
Some civil libertarians had hoped that Trutanich , who in May won a rancorous election to succeed Rocky Delgadillo , might curtail the city ’s use of injunctions .
Instead , though Trutanich said he is sensitive to the criticism and is seeking a balance between public safety and civil liberties , he is proposing to adopt the same tactics police use on the city ’s toughest criminals against people who are typically viewed as more of an annoyance .
“ At the end of the day , ” he said , “ they are no less of a gang . ”
To support that contention , he pointed to several incidents in which people have been shot and killed after confronting graffiti vandals in residential areas -- a Valinda man in 2006 , for instance , and a Pico Rivera woman a year later .
Though his proposal is still in its infancy , Trutanich said it would treat many graffiti vandals and taggers as like - minded members of a criminal enterprise and make it a crime for documented taggers to associate in public .
Almost all of them , he argued , work in teams -- with lookouts who can help them access difficult - to - reach areas .
The injunction would enjoin the members of a team from associating with one another in public -- making the association a crime , without any direct evidence of vandalism .
Anyone targeted by the injunction would have been accused of tagging in the past , and Trutanich ’s office stressed that each individual injunction would be tailored to a specific problem in a specific neighborhood .
Each injunction also would require a judge ’s approval .
The city received more than 600,000 reports of graffiti last year -- and many other incidents went unreported .
Trutanich said his proposal would not operate in a vacuum but be one of several new tools the city could use to combat graffiti .
City and county officials recently approved measures allowing authorities to hold taggers and their parents liable for civil damages .
A similar measure was passed this spring by the state Assembly and awaits approval by the Senate .
City officials are also considering further restricting the sale of aerosol spray paint and other materials to people under 21 .
Trutanich has time to drum up support , but so far his proposal has brought harsh criticism from the ACLU .
‘ Nobody likes tagging ’
Bibring , a frequent critic of gang injunctions , said courts have allowed provisions enjoining people from associating only because authorities have successfully argued that gathering in public is a central part of a gang ’s criminal activity -- “ a way to intimidate the neighborhood and advance the criminal activities of the gang . ”
“ That is just not true for taggers , ” he said .
“ So there is no basis to enjoin association .
“ Nobody likes tagging .
Nobody likes vandalism , ” Bibring added .
“ That does n’t mean you can strip away all the protections of the criminal justice system for people suspected of being taggers . ”
Greg Estevane , program director of the School of Justice at Westwood College , was equally skeptical .
On the one hand , he said , city authorities have often conflated -- unfairly -- hard - core gangbangers with small - time taggers .
Perhaps , he said , a proposal like this could help draw a distinction .
But he said it was a stretch to draw any parallel between the aims and goals of gangs with those of tagging crews .
Using the same legal strategies against taggers , he added , “ will turn them into gang members . ”
“ Tagging crews are a hassle .
They are definitely something that costs money , ” Estevane said .
“ But it ’s vandalism .
Vandalism is not the same thing as gang activity -- something that is done to further murder , rape , drug dealing .
It ’s an identity crisis .
They are trying to make it analogous .
It ’s not . . .
It ’s like using a Howitzer to kill a fly . ”
But Ruben Guerra , chairman and chief executive of the Los Angeles - based Latin Business Assn. , said it is time for some unorthodox approaches to a maddening problem .
Guerra owns a design and construction firm ; eight months ago , he founded another company that coats walls and signs with a clear material that can be wiped clean of graffiti .
He said most of the graffiti in places like South L.A. is on the walls of small , locally owned shops and restaurants .
“ Look , these are struggling times for all businesses .
There are businesses that are closing down , letting employees go , ” he said .
“ If you have graffiti on top of that , guess what ?
It just makes it a little bit harder . ”
He applauded Trutanich for trying something new .
“ If you let graffiti go , it takes away the pride of the community , ” he said .
“ There have to be some laws put in place that are really going to scare these guys into stopping graffiti .
And right now there are n’t any . ”

Volgens het nieuwe rapport van de ngo Global Witness kopen Belgische bedrijven zoals Trademet en Traxys hun grondstoffen van Congolese conflictpartijen aan en financieren op deze manier het brutale conflict in de Democratische Republiek .
Daarnaast neemt de ngo de Belgische regering zwaar onder vuur omdat ze weigert concrete stappen te ondernemen tegen de onethische handel van de Belgische bedrijven in kwestie .
Sinds 2001 wijzen internationale organisaties zoals de Verenigde Naties en Global Witness Belgische bedrijven systematisch op het feit dat zij door handel te drijven met de oorlogspartijen het uitermate bloedige conflict in de Democratische Republiek Congo draaiende houden .
In het nieuwe rapport van de ngo Global Witness , “ Faced with a gun , what can you do ? ” , is het weer van dat .
Uit het rapport blijkt dat Belgische bedrijven zoals Trademet , Traxys , SDE , STI en Specialty Metals grondstoffen in de provincie Kivu aankopen via Congolese tussenhandelaars ( ' comptoirs ' ) waarvan ze bijna zeker weten dat die het materiaal van de belangrijkste conflictpartijen verwerven ( het Rwandese FDLR en het Congolese staatsleger FARDC ) .
“ Multitude of Excuses ”
Volgens Global Witness controleren de voornoemde Belgische firma's hun productieketen nauwelijks en zijn de bedrijven ook niet bereid daar iets aan te veranderen in de nabije toekomst .
De ngo stelde bovendien vast dat de bedrijven liever toevlucht nemen tot een “ multitude of excuses ” ( pagina 7 ) om hun indirecte link met de conflictpartijen te rechtvaardigen of te camoufleren .
De bedrijven pleiten zichzelf bijvoorbeeld vrij door te betogen dat ze alleen met ' legale ' Congolese tussenhandelaars zaken doen .
Global Witness maakt echter brandhout van dit argument door erop te wijzen dat de legale tussenhandelaars evengoed met de conflictpartijen samenwerken als hun illegale tegenhangers en dat een grondige controle van de productieketen door de bedrijven dus meer dan ooit noodzakelijk is .
De bedrijven voeren ook economische redenen aan ( tijds - en kostendruk ) om hun falende controlebeleid te rechtvaardigen .
De ngo countert deze rechtvaardiging door erop te wijzen dat de bedrijven door deze houding een conflictsituatie in stand houden waarin zowel het FDLR als ook het FARDC gebruik maken van systematische schendingen van mensenrechten om hun economische en militaire positie in Kivu te handhaven .
Dwangarbeid en massieve verkrachtingen van vrouwen en kinderen zijn in deze context regelmatig aan de orde van de dag .
“ Stay on the margins ”
Naast de voornoemde bedrijven wordt ook de Belgische overheid voor haar lakse houding onder vuur genomen door Global Witness .
Hoewel de ngo de Belgische regering in haar rapport kort looft omwille van haar inspanningen om het probleem van de grondstoffenhandel op de internationale agenda te zetten , is de ngo niet mals voor het gebrek aan engagement op nationaal vlak .
Buiten een gesprek met de firma 's Traxys en Trademet , valt het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken volgens de ngo vooral op door haar onwil om druk te zetten op de ketel van de bedrijven .
Meer nog : tegenover Global Witness verklaarde het ministerie onomwonden “ that the Belgian government ' [ does ] not want to take sides ' , preferring not to be ' directly engaged on this issue ' and ' to stay on the margins ” ( pagina 79 ) .
Gebrekkige verslaggeving
Hoewel “ Faced with a gun , what can you do ? ” expliciet wijst op de “ particular responsibility ” ( pagina 78 ) van de Belgische industrie en de Belgische regering in de financiering van de conflictpartijen in Congo , werd het rapport bijna volledig genegeerd door de Vlaamse kranten .
Alleen De Standaard verwerkte het rapport in een kort artikel : “ België krijgt lof en kritiek voor grondstoffen Congo ” van 22 juli 2009 .
Eigenaardig genoeg doet de krant in het artikel haar best om erop te wijzen dat Belgische firma's ook betrokken zijn in de dubieuze handel met de Congolese bodemrijkdommen , terwijl het rapport van Global Witness er toch duidelijk op wijst dat het vooral de Belgische industrie is die een centrale rol speelt in dit vergrijp omdat ze veruit de belangrijkste importeur van tinerts , coltan en wolfraam is .
De Standaard geeft in het bericht van 22 juli ook evenveel gewicht aan de positieve acties van de Belgische regering als aan de negatieve .
Daarmee druist het verslag van de krant diametraal in tegen de geest van het rapport van Global Witness : het positieve engagement van de Belgische regering op het internationale toneel weegt in het bericht van de ngo op geen enkel moment op tegen de onwil van diezelfde regering haar eigen voorstellen op het thuisfront in de praktijk om te zetten .
Follow - up interviews met de betrokken bedrijven , met de verantwoordelijke ministeries of met de ngo vonden in de dagen na het verschijnen van het kritische rapport in de Vlaamse kranten niet plaats .
Alleen “ Buitenlandse Zaken in Brussel ” mocht in het bericht van 22 juli in De Standaard meedelen dat ze het rapport “ verwelkomt en dat België zijn inspanningen voor de regulering van de mijnbouw in Congo voortzet . ”
Een kritische kanttekening bij deze afsluitende opmerking was niet te vinden .

The zeroeth law of Wikipedia states : “ The problem with Wikipedia is that it only works in practice .
In theory , it can never work . ”
That ’s largely true of the kinds of theory that are most closely related to the hacker - centric early Wikipedia community : analytical philosophy , epistemology , and other offshoots of positive philosophy –the kinds of theory most closely related to the cultures of math and science .
( See my earlier post on “ Wikipedia in theory “ . )
But there ’s another body of theory in which Wikipedia ’s success can make a lot of sense : Marxism and its successors ( “ critical theory ” , or simply “ Theory ” ) .
A fantastic post on Greg Allen ’s Daddy Types blog , “ The Triumph of the Crayolatariat “ , reminded me ( indirectly ) of how powerful Marxist concepts can be for understanding Wikipedia and the free software and free culture movements more broadly .
It ’s a core principle of post - industrial political economy that knowledge is not just a product created by economic and cultural activity , but a key part of the means of production ( i.e. , cultural capital ) .
Software , patentable ideas , and copyrighted content of all sorts are the basis for a wide variety of production .
Software is used to create more software as well as visual art , fiction , music , scientific knowledge , journalism , etc . ( See “ Copyleft vs. Copyright : A Marxist Critique “ , Johan Söderberg , First Monday . )
And all those things are inputs into the production of new cultural products .
The idea of “ remix culture ” that Larry Lessig has been promoting recently emphasizes that in the digital realm , there ’s no clear distinction between cultural products and means of cultural production ; art builds on art .
( Lessig , however , has resisted associations between the Creative Commons cultural agenda and the Marxist tradition , an attitude that has brought attacks from the left , e.g. , the Libre Society . )
Modern intellectual property regimes are designed to turn non-material means of production into things that can be owned .
And the free software and free culture movements are about collective ownership of those means of production .
Also implicit in the free culture movement ’s celebration of participatory culture and user - generated content ( see my post on “ LOLcats as Soulcraft “ ) is the set of arguments advanced by later theorists about the commodification of culture .
A society that consumes the products of a culture industry is very different from one in which produces and consumers of cultural content are the same people–even if the cultural content created was the same ( which of course would not be the case ) .
What can a Marxist viewpoint tell us about where Wikimedia and free culture can or should go from here ?
One possibility is online “ social networking ” .
The Wikimedia community , and until recently even the free software movement , has n’t paid much attention to social networking or offered serious competition to the proprietary sites like Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , etc .
But if current agenda is about providing access to digital cultural capital ( i.e. , knowledge and other intellectual works ) , the next logical step is to provide freer , more egalitarian access to social capital as well .
Facebook , MySpace and other services do this to some extent , but they are structured as vehicles for advertising and the furtherance of consumer culture , and in fact are more focused on commoditizing the social capital users bring into the system than helping users generate new social capital .
( Thus , many people have noted that “ social networking sites ” is a misnomer for most of those services , since they are really about reinforcing existing social networks , not creating new connections . )
The Wikimedia community , in particular , has taken a dim view of anything that smacks of mere social networking ( or worse , MMORPGs ) , as if cultural capital is important but social capital is not .
But from a Marxist perspective , it ’s easier to see how intertwined the two are and how both are necessary to maintain a healthy free culture ecosystem .
Wikimedia and the rest of the free culture community , then , ought to get serious about supporting OpenMicroBlogging ( the identi.ca protocol ) and other existing alternatives to proprietary social networking and culture sites , and even perhaps starting a competitor to MySpace and Facebook .
( See some of the proposals I ’m supporting on Wikimedia Strategic Planning wiki in this vein . )
Leave the church in 3 easy steps
enter your details leave a message of defection enjoy your freedom
In Ireland there was a way to formally record that you were no longer a Catholic and require the church to record that fact .
Over 12,000 people started this " Declaration of Defection " process .
But in April 2011 the Catholic Church changed church law and removed the option to record formal defections .
Cormac Flynn , Paul Dunbar and Grainne O'Sullivan were the pioneers of CountMeOut .ie who took on the church and we salute them .
They closed CountMeOut.ie after church law was changed to frustrate people trying to record their defection .
Read more details here .
NotMe.ie believes that if people tell the church they have defected then it should take a reality check and listen to them and correct their records .
Young infants do not have a choice when they are baptised but adults have the right to set the record straight .
NotMe.ie lets you informally and symbolically leave the Catholic Church .
It has no impact on the Catholic Church 's view of your religious standing but is a way to identify as not Catholic .
This symbolic gesture supports the separation of church and state .
It does not signify or support atheism or humanism as many religious people also support church and state separation .
NotMe.ie is maintained by Atheist Ireland an Irish advocacy group , that does not recognize church law or state submission to church law , promoting atheism and reason over superstition and supernaturalism , and an ethical , secular society where the State does not support or finance or give special treatment or privelege to any religion .
Atheist Ireland is a member of Atheist Alliance International , an umbrella organisation of groups and individuals in the United States and around the world committed to promoting and defending reason and the atheist worldview .

Doctors and nutritionists believe that the average American ’s immune response is only functioning at about 70 % .
That means their immune system is about 70 % effective .
Is that good enough ?
For some , maybe .
But if you ’re getting sick too much , probably not .
Your immune function may be well under that national average .
I was reading in the local newspaper about the recent Swine Flu scare and how the spread is uncertain at this point .
I have two daughters in college and the first week after they went back they were hearing that kids had the flu , some the regular flu and at least two cases of the Swine Flu .
It is very unsettling having children in college when there is a potential outbreak because viruses spread very quickly in dorms .
They live such a ‘ close ’ lifestyle in small rooms and sometimes community bathrooms .
Schools in general can be challenging because kids pass germs very quickly , and repeated sickness can hurt immune function .
Chilly weather is coming soon , and this is the favorite time of year for the flu and many other seasonal health challenges .
There is fear that we are going to be a sick nation .
I prefer to focus on prevention .
I sent my daughters to school loaded with natural supplement that will help build their immune system .
Still it is challenging .
However , many times when your body is more prepared than it might otherwise have been , and even if you get some part of the ‘ bug ’ , it is likely that the symptoms will be less and the recovery time will be quicker .
That is what my goal is for myself and my family , and we have to be pro-active if we want to get good results .
The article in my newspaper stated that the Swine flu is brand new , and nobody really has immunity to it .
I heard it discussed on the national news ( television ) that older adults may have some immunity , though younger people have none .
What we are hoping is that the flu will wait until the vaccine is released , or at least the widespread part of it .
We are just starting to hear about how many doses of the Swine Flu vaccine people will need , on top of the regular flu shot .
Not everyone will get it because there may not be enough .
Whether you do n’t get the flu because of supply and demand , or your own personal choice , and even if you do get the shot , there are preventive measures to take as well .
Everyone talks about washing your hands , but do n’t let that lessen your observance of it .
Wash your hands .
Often .
We know that nutrition can help us be well , and yet we do n’t eat the best diets every day .
And we eat fast foods .
And we eat processed foods .
And we are stressed .
And many of us do n’t exercise enough or sleep well .
These things and more can put us in the less than national average immune system statistics .
And it can make us sick more than we want to be .
I do n’t know about you but I hate to be sick , even with the common cold .
I am faithful to an array of supplements every single day of the year , and it pays off for me .
When I am exposed to something , or maybe feeling tired ( one of the first signs of getting sick ) , I take a special echinacea blend for a week to ten days .
Almost always , I can beat it .
I may get the flu , one of them , this winter .
Of course I hope that I do n’t .
All I know is that I am doing everything I can to prevent it , and that is all I can do .
Besides supplementing with the nutrition that I know I do n’t get enough of in the foods that I eat , I try to sleep enough hours every night ( that can be challenging because I am not always tired and always find something to do .. plus night time is my favorite time to work ! ) , exercise ( taking the time can be tough , but it pays off ) , balance stress , and think positively .
These may sound like things you ’ve heard before , and brushed off , but bottom line is : they work .
Science tells us these things .
They are proven .
They are not even that hard .. it just takes desire .
I answered a question on Linked In yesterday .
Someone was asking why people do n’t succeed at something when they have proven answers or ways to be successful .
My answer is that it is all about desire .
We have to want things for ourselves .
There has to be a ‘ strong why . ’
It is what will drive us each day .
It will keep us going .
It will make sure we do what we need to do .
And it will bring us results .
I started this article writing about the Immune Response , and went a little off - track ( especially if you were looking for an all - technical article ) .
What I wrote about is still associated with our immune response because the immunity results we get can be very closely related to the choices we make .
We have to want wellness for ourselves .
Lily Allen is unhappy about other artists who are supportive of fans who download illegal music files , and has set up a blog to voice the opinions of those in opposition to the practice .
The blog is named It ’s Not Alright and features contributions from James Blunt , Matt Bellamy from Muse and Natasha Khan from Bat for Lashes .
“ I agree that file sharing is a huge and complicated problem for emerging artists , myself included , and for the future of music , ” said Khan .
“ I will be taking the time to research this , but if you do have any meetings where we can all get together and discuss , ( the guy from Muse had some really good points we could take to government ) , then please let me know . ”
It ’s unclear why this issue , which has pervaded throughout most of the 2000s , has suddenly disturbed Allen .
The practice is so widespread at this point that she ’s almost certainly fighting a losing battle .

30 MORE PHOTOS : U2 at Gillette Stadium , September 20 , 2009 .
Credit : Richard McCaffrey .
If you happened to take a cigarette break on the north concourse of Gillette Stadium last night , about a dozen songs into U2's US - tour kickoff , you might 've noticed two young men who were not acting like everyone else .
For one thing , they were facing away from the stage -- a view that afforded them , if anything , a look across Patriot Place , in the direction of the ticketless crowd standing three ardeep in front of the CBS Experience .
For another thing , they were wearing studio - monitor headphones and shit - eating grins .
It seemed an awful expensive way to listen to your iPod .
Then I saw 'em offering a few passers - bye a listen to the headphones , and decided to take a closer look .
" Listen to this , " one of them said , and placed the headphones on my ears .
They were listening to U2 playing behind us , in real time -- and the sound was impeccably crisp , full - bodied , with perfect instrument separation .
Bono 's voice had the kind of standing - next - to - you - in - a - crowded - elevator feeling that no stadium speakers ( and very few live albums ) can reproduce .
The sound through the headphones reminded me of a tape a friend once gave me of the Rolling Stones playing in Australia in 1973 , taped off the soundboard , in which you can hear Mick Jagger 's breath on the mic in between verses .
Commercial recordings clean that sort of thing up , so hearing that faraway voice so close , and unedited , delivers a startling intimacy .
So how'd they do it ?
Part serendipity , part genius : headphones - guy was plugged into a pager - sized Sennheiser wireless receiver -- the type of device that has replaced on - stage monitors for musicians as the way they hear themselves during the concert .
He believes his Sennheiser is identical to the model Bono uses -- something like this one .
And during soundcheck , he 'd simply run through the various channels until he found the one the soundboard was broadcasting on .
Bingo .
There was another big difference between what was on the headphones and what the larger audience heard : the subtle but unmistakable sound of a click track .
You could even hear a soft voice at the beginning of each song counting the band in , " One , two , three , four . "
To longtime U2 fans , it will come as no surprise that the band uses one -- lots of artists do , especially when their live show incorporates triggered samples or effects .
The presence of the click track led headphones - guy to believe he might be listening to the mix being piped to Larry Mullen 's headset , though there was no way to be sure .
Listening to the band the way they hear themselves suggested a plausible explanation for the size of Bono 's ego : maybe he thinks everyone hears him this way .
Replicating this experiment yourself could get expensive : Sennheiser receivers run about $ 800 -- about the price of three decent U2 tickets .
But given the degree of outrage expressed by some upper - deck fans about the quality of audio at last night 's show ( for the record : the sound from my seat , in the lower deck , was very good ) , you could certainly see some cheaper version of this technology -- or perhaps a venue - operated version , perhaps a twist on the way Gillette gets a few bucks for binocular rentals -- becoming an easy upsell .
Tech peoples : someone tell us an easier / cheaper way to patch into a rock band 's monitor signal -- there 's gotta be one , right ?
ace conditions are an inherent part of parallel programming .
A race condition exists any time a program 's behavior may depend on the relative ordering of events on separate threads .
In the vast majority of cases , race conditions are harmless the program works regardless of which thread gets a lock first , or which thread processes a chunk of data .
In some cases , however , race conditions can cause problems .
The main danger with race conditions is that by their very nature they are timing dependent .
This becomes problematic when one thread executes a particular piece of code while another thread is executing a different piece of code .
If the pieces of code in question are very small ( only one or two CPU instructions , for example ) and occur very rarely , then the race condition might not show up very often , and you may miss it entirely during testing .
In fact , the conditions necessary for the problem to occur may not manifest at all during testing .
For example , if your test system has only one CPU , then threads cannot really execute in parallel .
You must interleave them .
This lack of true concurrency means that some potential race condition problems just cannot occur .
The same problem exists to a lesser extent if you test code on a system with a small number of CPUs ( for example , on a dual - core desktop machine ) when the problematic conditions can happen only with a higher level of parallelism ( for example , on a 64 - CPU server machine ) .
This article demonstrates how race conditions in general and C++0 x data races in particular can cause real problems in parallel code and offers some tips for preventing them .
Locks Cannot Prevent Race Conditions
Protecting your data with a mutex lock does not guarantee that your code will be free from problematic race conditions , even if you obsessively ensure that the data is accessed only while the lock is held .
If the lock is at the wrong level of granularity , or the scope of the lock is wrong , then problematic race conditions can still occur .
For example , consider a simple data structure that contains a list of items and a count of the items in the list .
If you protect each part of the data structure with its own mutex , you can still get race conditions even though everything is nominally synchronized .
Because the parts are protected with individual mutexes , you must update them separately .
This means that at certain points you will have updated one and not the other ( for example , you have added a new item to the list but have not yet updated the count ) .
Thus , when another thread accesses the data structure , it will see the two parts of the data structure as out of sync with each other .
The solution in this case is obvious : use a single mutex to protect the entire data structure .
In more complex cases , it can be much harder to identify scenarios where there may be a race condition , and eliminating the race condition may require more extensive changes , such as changes to the interface .
Another year , another iPod nano .
As expected , Apple introduced the next generation of its flash - based music player during the September 2009 iPod event , once again building on its current feature set in an attempt to appeal to more buyers .
The new nano ( fifth generation , for those keeping count ) is very similar to the fourth - generation version .
What differentiates the 5G nano , however , are a few major feature additions plus a handful of refinements intended to keep the nano on everyone 's stocking stuffer list .
Quick look at what 's new
If it were n’t already plainly obvious , the major new feature of the fifth nano is the addition of a video camera .
That alone could have probably justified the new device , but Apple went a few steps further , leveraging existing ( but latent ) capabilities already on the nano to add several other features .
These include a full - featured FM tuner application , a pedometer , a Nike + receiver , VoiceOver support , and a voice notes application .
In addition to these new software features , there is a video camera , a slightly larger screen ( 2.2 inches compared to the previous two model ’s 2 - inch screen ) and an increase in the resolution accordingly ( 240x376 pixels at 204 pixels per inch compared to 240x320 pixels , also at 204 pixels per inch ) .
With the addition of the video camera comes a built - in microphone , which enables audio recording in both the video and voice notes applications .
Finally , a built - in speaker has also been added to enable full , headphone - less playback of recorded videos , voice notes , and even music and videos .
Sadly , though , you cannot play radio through the internal speaker .
The tuner requires the headphones to be inserted as they perform a dual - role as the FM antenna .
Pedometer
The 5G iPod nano comes equipped with a built - in pedometer that , like most pedometers , counts your steps as you take them .
With more people paying attention to their health and with the general popularity of pedometers as a cheap and easy way to track how much you 're walking , the addition of a pedometer in the iPod nano is , at worst , gimmicky , and at best , nice to have .
The pedometer does not require the purchase of a Nike +iPod Sport Kit — all that 's required is that you turn it on via the nano 's menu system and begin walking .
The nano tracks your steps by the bobbing of your body when you walk ( thanks , accelerometer ! ) .
When you turn it on , the pedometer asks you to input your weight ( but not height or any other body specifics ) so that it can give you a ballpark figure on calories burned .
As with most calorie estimates , this is probably not all that accurate .
What 's cool about the pedometer is that you can set it to always be on or just keep it on when you 're running that specific " application . "
If you have it set to always be on , it will show a little shoe at the top to indicate that it 's tracking your steps .
You can also set a daily step goal and see your history on a calendar — we took 1,922 steps on September 11 between the time we left the Apple Store and the time we stumbled home that night .
The pedometer does n't convert your steps into distance because it has no way of determining how long your stride is or how fast you were going at that time — if you want to track those things , you need to use Nike + .
Built - in Nike +
i Pod nano users have always been able to use their devices with the Nike + system , which goes a step beyond the traditional pedometer ( no pun intended ) to actually track your distance and speed while running .
However , users have to connect a dongle to their devices that talks wirelessly to the shoe transmitter .
Though we prefer to run with smaller and lighter music devices ( hello iPod shuffle ) , the nano 's Nike + capabilities continue to make it a popular choice among runners looking for a middle - of - the - road music player that is n't too bulky but can still track their runs .
The Great DCUC Wave 9 Drought
| By
Hi – we unfortunately have received bad news from Mattel on the DC Universe Series 9 assortment .
They have informed us that they grossly under - produced this wave and that only about 25 % of our order will be filled .
Many other stores also apparently have suffered the same huge shortage , and the product is short across the entire market .
We were extremely upset with Mattel for this news and have relayed to them how upset our customers will be as well .
At this point , we unfortunately do not expect any more shipments from Mattel .
For those of you who ordered between February 13th and 14th , it is possible that your orders will fill due to cancellations and non-payment of orders from people who ordered before you ( their cancelled orders will move to the next people in line automatically ) .
If you ordered after these dates , it is very unlikely we will have any inventory , and we suggest that you purchase these figures anywhere else you may be able to find them .
( You can view the date you ordered your product by logging into your BBTS account and viewing your preorders )
We have heard reports they are showing up at mass market stores , and some should also be on ebay .
We absolutely hate not being able to fill your order , but Mattel has really screwed up this wave and there is not anything we can do about it .
We are hoping that some sort of future production run of DCU 09 can be negotiated , but at this point there is nothing worked out .
We will keep your preorders open in our system until we can determine if Mattel will produce more in the future or not .
We will email you with any further news as we hear it from Mattel , hopefully something will be resolved .
The sales manager at Mattel did assure me that DCU waves 11 , 12 , and 13 would not suffer from the same issues , so we do not anticipate any shortages on those waves .
Earlier this week BBTS broke news that they were being shorted by Mattel on their DC Universe Classics Wave 9 figures .
Starting a cavalcade of worries from collectors about being able to purchase this wave .
Rightfully so , since a lot of us are only able to find DCUC via online stores .
However some of those fears seemed to be put to rest when folks were finding DCUC Wave 9 in stores .
Even I stumbled across a Guardian figure ( but only him ) at a Toys R Us a while back .
Now reports are starting to get bare and worries are starting to set in that Mattel may have actually underproduced this wave .
Originally Mattel had stated that Wave 9 was going to be for sale on MattyCollector.com but now that ’s been said not to be happening .
Could Wave 9 become the most sought after series next to the Walmart Wave 5 ?
Did Mattel really make less of this wave ?
Are prices being inflated because of a faux scare ?
I have no idea .
I ’d really like to get Green Arrow and Chemo , but it ’s looking like I might not be able to .
Perhaps I should stay clear of DCUC anyway .
The last time I tried to catch up I ended up inadvertly buying 3 full sets of Wave 6 .
One I ’m keeping , one I plan on selling and one I ’m giving away to you , huzzah !
So have you found DCUC Wave 9 and are you worried ?

How dumb can you get ?
Really , really , REALLY dumb .
Jonathan Parker , a PA resident , decided to rob stands accused of robbing a house outside of Martinsburg in Berkeley County , WV .
But that ’s not the dumb part .
Ready for this ?
He checked his Facebook account on the victim ’s computer and left it logged in !
The Martinsburg Journal ( sort of my home newspaper , unfortunately ) reports .
He apparently stole two diamond rings , in addition to some equipment from the garage .
Because of his awesomeness , the police were able to nab him relatively easily .
He is being held right now in the Eastern Regional Jail in Martinsburg on $ 10,000 bail and could actually get up to 10 years for this .
But that ’s just for the crime ; what can we give him for being the dumbest person on earth ?
I guess this really shows just how important Facebook is in our lives today .
And since comment contests have been popular on WeLoveDC lately … let ’s try one here .
What do you think he set his status to when he logged into Facebook while robbing someones house ?
Add yours in the comments .
Boy With Austim Devastated After City Bans Pet Pig Family says pet pig Loopey has done wonders for capabilities of autistic son .
Sept. 10 , 2009  --
Loopey might be an unorthodox best friend , but she 's a good one .
She was sweet and playful and did n't seem to notice her buddy 's quirks like others did .
Now , more than a year after Loopey -- a black pet pot - bellied pig -- made fast friends with 8 - year - old Anthony Pia , the autistic boy 's parents are battling their city 's ban on hogs .
It 's been three months since Lisa Pia and Bobby Tibbetts , fearing fines from the city , removed Loopey the pig from their Fayetteville , N.C. , home and took him back to the ranch where they got her .
While they plead with city leaders to allow Loopey to come home , Anthony , Tibbetts said , continues to regress into the troubling behaviors the 80 - pound pig helped ameliorate .
Before they brought Loopey home , Anthony had trouble with head and hand shaking , bed - wetting , sleeping and interacting with other people .
His connection to Loopey , Tibbetts said , was immediate .
" He stopped wetting the bed , " he said .
" He came home every day and talked to her because she would n't say anything [ bad . ] "
Devastated by the loss of his friend , Anthony is n't calmed by daily visits to the ranch 35 miles away .
" Right now , he has this mentality that everybody in the world is out to get him , " Tibbetts said , adding that he found the second - grader screaming in his room one night " asking Jesus to take him . "
Fayetteville Councilman Keith Bates , one of Anthony 's supporters , said those in favor of letting the boy keep Loopey never wanted to change the ordinance , but instead give the city manager the opportunity to rule on these situations on a case - by - case basis .
A Council motion to do just that , he said , ended in a 5 - 5 tie vote and was thrown out due to lack of majority .
" This would n't have hurt the city one bit , " Bates told ABCNews.com .
" It 's a shame when we had the opportunity ... to help the child , especially a disabled child and we did n't do this . "
Bates said the other five who voted against the motion " are worried that if we allow one prohibited animal breed into the city limits then anyone can bring one in . "
It was a sentiment echoed by Councilman Robert Massey , who voted against the motion .
" We need to be very careful before we decide we are going to change the ordinance for the whole city of Fayetteville , " he said , as reported by ABC's Fayetteville affiliate , WTVD .
Helping Anthony Find His Comfort Zone
Tibbetts said that his wife suspected her son might be autistic when he was still an infant .
But after the formal diagnosis , the two began researching the growing trend of using animals to help children with autism .
The couple already had a cat which Anthony found boring and a small dog whose movements sometimes scared him .
So they drove him to a ranch to visit a variety of animals and the little boy took an immediate liking to the pigs .
In June of 2008 they brought Loopey home , then just a month and a half old .
She was quickly housetrained and the family was diligent about bathing the pig .
At night she slept either in the living room or in Anthony 's room , Tibbetts said , and the two bonded over a shared dislike of thunderstorms .
They considered Loopey their son's medicine .
" When you find something that helps them you roll with it , " he said of children with autism .
" That 's what we did . "
And Tibbetts said they thought they had done their homework .
In addition to researching how to properly raise a domestic pig , they checked with the city 's animal control officer .
" They said as long as it's not a disturbance , " he said .
" We did n't know anything about an ordinance . "
Tibbetts said it 's not clear how officials found out about Loopey .
He was told that a complaint was filed and while he has his suspicions , he 's not exactly sure who it was .
Acting on the advice of a council member who lived nearby , Tibbets petitioned the city council to amend the ordinance to allow Loopey to remain at home .
" We thought that once they knew why we had her ... we did n't think it would be a big deal , " he said .
But while the council agreed initially to consider the idea , there was not enough support .
Tibbetts said he was told to wait until after the fall elections and hope there would be enough turnover that the new council would think differently .
Tibbetts said he and his wife , a day care administrator , would like to move out of Fayetteville , but have not yet found other housing that is both affordable and can accommodate their four children and , of course , Loopey .
" If I had the money , believe me , we 'd already be out of this town , " he said .
Animals and Their Efffect on Children With Autism
Dr. Lori Warner , director of the HOPE Center for Autism at Beaumont Hospital in Michigan , told ABCNews.com that while there is no scientific evidence that animals provide medical benefit for autistic children , there are enough anecdotal tales , including some from her own patients ' parents , to take the trend seriously .
Losing a close friend -- human or animal -- can be traumatic for any child , but " especially a child who has social difficulties . "
For a child such as Anthony , who Warner has not treated , that loss and the disruption of routine , something else precious to people with autism , could be difficult for him to process .
The animal , she said , can provide companionship for Anthony , but helping him learn how to exist in the real world .
" He could use this relationship with Loopey to reach out to other people , " she said .
For now , Tibbetts , a warehouse manager out on disability , helps Anthony keep his bond going with trips to see Loopey , who he said , is happy to see her boy .
" As soon as she hears her name , she is wagging her tail and grunting , " he said .
And he got a surprise call from a local fair owner who heard about Anthony 's plight and offered the family of six a free night at the fair , an opportunity Tibbetts and Pia used to show Anthony that there are people out there who care about him .
Trans -Atlantic Comparisons ( 2 ) Why Europeans Have It Wrong About Americans
Many Europeans think that the US is full of gun-toting maniacs and illiterate morons .
In part two of his series on trans -Atlantic differences , American historian Peter Baldwin shows why Europeans have this -- and plenty of other facts about America -- plain wrong .
Von Peter Baldwin
Benjamin Netanyahu described the article as outrageous
Israel 's prime minister has urged the Swedish government to condemn a Swedish newspaper article that claimed Israeli troops killed Palestinians for organs .
Benjamin Netanyahu joins broad Israeli criticism of the Aftonbladet paper over the claims troops took organs to sell .
An Israeli official quoted him saying : " Statements in the Swedish press were outrageous .
We are not expecting an apology - we expect condemnation . "
Sweden has refused to condemn the article , citing freedom of expression .
But Mr Netanyahu reportedly compared the claims to medieval " blood libels " , which alleged that Jews used the blood of Christian babies during religious ceremonies .
Israel 's Interior Ministry has said it is freezing new visas to Swedish journalists , although those already in Israel can continue working .
Ikea boycott mooted
Israeli finance minister Yuval Steinitz said if Sweden would not condemn the story , Israel might cancel a visit by the Swedish foreign minister planned for September .
Later , the spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry Yigal Palmor said : " There is no question of cancelling or delaying this visit , but it is clear that this incident will cast a worrying shadow over meetings if it is not resolved . "
An online petition calling for a boycott of Swedish companies , including Ikea , has been signed by hundreds of Israelis , the Haaretz newspaper has reported .
The story - in Sweden 's top - selling daily newspaper - claimed Israeli soldiers kidnapped Palestinian youths and returned their dismembered bodies a few days later .
The tabloid claimed organs were then sold for transplant - with incidents dating back to 1992 .
Sweden 's ambassador to Israel called the article " shocking and appalling " .
But Sweden 's foreign minister Carl Bildt wrote he would not condemn the article because freedom of expression is part of the Swedish constitution .
Mr Bildt added that condemnation of anti-Semitism is " the only issue on which there has ever been complete unity in the Swedish parliament " .
For a few months in college , I took a job doing what was deemed “ guerilla marketing . ”
I ’m not ashamed to admit that I was really just a professional spammer .
It was honestly the best job I ’ve ever had .
Sit at a computer , find message boards , and post about whatever we were marketing that week , and then record my work on a spreadsheet .
Repeat ad nauseum .
I got $ 1.50 per post , and I could do maybe 100 posts a week .
Usually they were for things like a candy bar or a new video game ; I came up with about half a dozen ways to say the same thing over and over .
It was always something like , “ Yo dudez , have you tried the new frosted choco toaster pastries yet ??
They are sooo kickass .
I make them for breakfast or for a tight snack ! ”
It was a lie , of course ; I ’m not sure how toaster pastries can even be kickass ( or tight , for that matter ) , and also I do n’t know how to operate a toaster .
Internet message boards are populated mainly by fourteen year old boys , most of whom have intense anger management issues or possibly guns .
Fourteen year olds today are also apparently notably smarter than I was at that age , because they would sniff me out immediately .
I would check my posts the next day , and the responses would all be of a threatening , if poorly spelled , nature .
I got paid the same whether I started a new thread or whether I just replied to another one , so I encouraged the arguments ; it was easier than finding a brand new message board .
I ’d get something like , “ You fuckin corprate bot , get th fuck out . ”
My response : “ Me ? A robot ?
Whyever would you think such a thing ?
I am just a regular dude like you who is really passionate about Gogurt . ” $ 1.50 is $ 1.50 , after all .
These conversations would go on for as long as I could milk them , and they would usually dissolve into grammatically incorrect threats and garbled strings of profanities .
I ’d defend myself and strike back with my own brand of message board terror , because , well , you should n’t talk shit about someone ’s mother and get away with it , even if you ’re a prepubescent kid hiding behind a computer screen .
I had to record all of those conversations on the spreadsheet , but somehow I do n’t think any of the big companies ever read them .
I feel like Pillsbury might have taken issue with my vow to shiv some preteen ’s grandfather in the face .
Then again , maybe not .
That Doughboy is one crazy motherfucker .
PARIS —
When considering that more than an estimated 5 million Muslims reside in France , the government ’s calculation that 367 women nationwide wear a burqa might seem negligible , but the debate over legislation to outlaw burqas has been anything but .
Following President Nicolas Sarkozy ’s announcement that the burqa was “ not welcome ” in France because it “ imprisons women ” and “ undermines their dignity , ” an everything - but - the - kitchen - sink debate ensued .
Pundits and politicians , theologians and sociologists have added complexity to an already thorny issue .
“ Everything is mixed up ; it should not be taken as something religious , ” said Olivia Cattan , head of the women ’s rights group Paroles de Femmes .
She was among a first wave of experts called before the National Assembly in July to offer her point of view to politicians collecting information that will form the basis for recommendations on the matter expected by the end of the year .
The current debate echoes a similar one that preceded the banning of Muslim headscarves in French schools in 2004 .
Following a year of commissions and studies , the government , relying heavily on its principle of secularism , banned the headscarf in public places , along with other “ conspicuous ” religious symbols including large Catholic crosses or turbans worn by Sikhs .
Cattan said that this time around there seemed to be confusion in the debate .
Would all Islamic forms of women ’s dress be banned ?
Is the legislation aimed at the burqa , once mandatory under the Taliban for all women in Afghanistan , which has a mesh cloth covering the eyes ; the niqab , a veil that covers the face but has a cutout slot for the eyes ; or the hijab , which covers the hair but not the face ?
Other styles include the chador , the long cloak usually worn by women in Iran , and the abaya , a loose robe - like garment worn by Saudi women who might also wear a veil to cover the hair or face .
Cattan condemned what she termed “ spiritual ignorance ” worldwide and the atmosphere that made religion such a difficult topic to broach , especially in France , where “ religion is a dirty word for some . "
" Today , we do n't know one another 's religion , ” she said .
“ Here , we are afraid of everything . ”
Stephane Rolland , an haute couture designer who has created abayas that can cost 20,000 euros and more , said his clients — whether from Turkey , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia or North Africa — have a variety of reasons for their mode of dress .
For some , being covered offered protection from unwanted male attention , for others it was a matter of tradition or of saving their beauty for the eyes of their husbands , a sentiment in which he could find an “ interesting , ” even “ seductive ” element .
But as an artist , it was not for him to judge his clients ’ choices .
“ All cultures interest me , ” he said from his showroom just off the chic Champs Elysees , where he has noticed more and more veiled and covered women over the years .
In the latest uproar , a French convert to Islam who wore a " burquini " to a public pool near Paris was denied entry and has claimed religious discrimination , according to wire service reports .
Pool officials said they banned the fully - covered 35 - year - old woman out of sanitary concerns since swimmers are not allowed to wear baggy clothing in pools .
Excessive garb could obscure skin infections , they said , and pose a health risk to other swimmers .
Fadela Amara , a politician and a former president of the woman ’s rights group Ni Putes Ni Soumises ( which roughly translates as " Neither whores nor submissives " ) told Le Parisien that she was for a total burqa ban , calling the garment a “ coffin that kills fundamental freedoms . ”
Cattan has argued that in order to have a real debate and to determine if a law is in order , a proper count of the number of women affected needs to take place and that her organization would hire a sociologist to come with a more realistic figure .
She was skeptical of the government ’s figure for the number of burqa- wearers in France , which was released suddenly in late July by a service of the Ministry of Interior , which has not disclosed how it arrived at the number .
After its release , Dalil Boubakeur , the rector of Paris ’s main mosque , questioned on French radio why the national debate was necessary given the small number of women concerned .
But even if the ban affects a small number of women , there is no plan for helping them adjust .
Earlier this year Human Rights Watch published a report titled “ Discrimination in the name of Neutrality , ” about the effect of a headscarf ban for classroom teachers and other civil servants in Germany .
It concluded that “ the bans have caused some women to give up their careers or to leave Germany , where they have lived all their lives . ”
Any ban , Cattan said , should take the womens ' rights into consideration and not make matters worse for those who perhaps are already in a delicate position .
Are we just going to “ lock them up and throw away the key , ” she asked ?
Covered in this edition of Crown Gems : Michael Vick , second chances , Sidney Ponson , Ryan Freel , Doug Waechter , Gil Meche , Kyle Farnsworth , Chris Dwyer , Aaron Crow , Ken Williams , Adrian Beltre , and Hamfighters Softball .
Unless you live under a rock or care absolutely nothing about football , you are probably already aware that Michael Vick signed with the Philadelphia Eagles today .
If you are so inclined , click here to read the NFL.com article .
I know this Royals related or baseball related , but I wanted to state my thoughts , not just on Vick but also on the all too often stated belief that everyone deserves a second chance .
I ’ll try to keep this short and sweet since it is late and I ’ve got a long morning ahead of me as I once again attempt to keep up with my 5 and 2 year old boys .
Regardless of the off the field issues , I have always been a fan of Michael Vick on the field .
He was an exciting and unique talent that I have always enjoyed watching , and I sincerely hope he can recapture some of his previous glory .
I am glad he is back in the NFL , I am glad he is getting a second chance , and I think he is going to have a great deal of success with the Eagles .
I was selfishly hoping he would sign with the Vikings or Chiefs , but that just was n’t meant to be .
I really have no problem with how any of the Vick saga has played out .
What I do have a problem with is this notion that everyone deserves a second chance .
Personally I think that is a load of crap .
Do n’t get me wrong here , we all need chances to succeed in life , just as we all need support from others to get ahead , but no one deserves any of it .
Chances are sometimes earned and sometimes they fall in our lap but none of them are deserved .
Simply put , we do n’t have a right to first chances , let alone second chances .
I ’m probably in the minority on this , just as I am in the minority in my belief that you do n’t have to win a championship in a given sport to have a successful season , but now is not the time to go down that road .
Now lets get back to our beloved Kansas City Royals and the recent roster events .
Not surprisingly , RHP - Sidney Ponson cleared waivers and was released yesterday .
Sir Sidney ’s time as a member of the Royals organization is finally at an end .
Thank god !
Another turn of events that was completely devoid of either shock or awe , today the Royals released OF - Ryan Freel .
RHP - Doug Waechter was placed back on the 15 - day DL today with a strained right shoulder .
Since his return to the team this month he managed to pitch just 1.1 innings while giving up 4 hits , 3 runs , and 2 walks .
When it was announced back in December that he had been signed by the Royals , I thought that it was a smart low risk move .
I still stand by that assessment , but it is a shame that he has spent almost 4 months on the DL .
Gil Meche was activated from the DL to take Waechter ’s place on the roster and started tonight ’s game .
Meche got the win , but did n’t exactly impress in his return with a stat line of 5.0 IP , 7 H , 4 ER , 2 BB , 2 SO , and 1 HR allowed .
While on the topic of the DL , RHP - Kyle Farnsworth made an appearance in Triple - A last night and one in Double - A tonight .
He “ hopes ” to be able to return to the ML team in about a week .
His return is eagerly anticipated since he can’t possibly pitch any worse than the collection of the non-Soria bullpen “ talent ” Trey Hillman is able to call on these days .
Jim Callis of Baseball America was reporting today that the Royals signed 4th round pick LHP - Chris Dwyer .
Sam Mellinger , on the other hand , was reporting that the deals are n’t done , but they are getting close .
Rumors are swirling that the Royals offered 1st round pick RHP - Aaron Crow $ 3 million , but he turned them down .
I am 100 % confident that Dayton Moore and co. will get Dwyer and Myers signed on or before Monday ’s deadline but I ’m not sure what to make about Aaron Crow .
I think he should sign , and I think $ 3 million is a fair offer to get the deal done .
I ca n’t believe he wants to waste another year of development just to go back into the 2010 draft .
The Nationals offered him $ 3.5 million last year , and the Royals have reportedly offered him $ 3 million .
To me , that says his market value is pretty much set and that value can only go down as he sits on the sidelines and does n’t pitch in affiliated baseball .
I ’m hoping the Royals give him a hard deadline sometime this month and if chooses not to sign by that point , they should move on .
This team has too many issues to deal with outside of “ negotiating ” with Aaron Crow for the next 10 months .
I still believe he will sign this month , but it would n’t completely surprise me if he is back in the draft next year .
A few other news items to share that are n’t directly related to the Royals :
My man-crush on White Sox GM - Ken Williams got a bit more intense after seeing him on ESPN ’s Pardon the Interruption yesterday .
Oh if only he was OUR GM .
Damn you Chicago !!!
Seattle Mariners 3B - Adrian
Beltre was placed back on the DL with a contusion to his right testicle .
I ca n’t think of a more legitimate reason to go on the DL than anything testicle related .
Actually I can , but seriously …
Click here for the details via MLB.com .
It saddens me to report that the KC Hamfighters co-ed team fell to 1 - 2 on the season after losing 17 - 7 in 6 innings .
Defensive lapses were again the primary cause of our defeat .
Fortunately our opponents on this night understood the concept of co-ed softball and were actually swinging at close pitches instead of trying to draw walks .
Losing by 10 is a lot more fun when people are swinging and hitting the ball .
I ’m exhausted and downright punchy at this point so I better sign off for the night .

It really must take a special level of Teh Stoopids to be Glenn Beck .
You all may remember this video from a couple of weeks ago , back when Beck was just warming up on his favorite subject -- the Threat of Evil Negroes Like Van Jones .
( Presumably , the basis of this threat has something to do with black people being Sons of Ham or something like that . )
Well , Matt Osborne at HuffPo did some digging around to determine the nature of the second group of Scary Negroes featured in Beck 's rant .
And it turns out that they are very , very scary members of a black dance troupe :
Dated October 9th , 2008 , here 's a YouTube description from Christiv3 : A typical step show on college campuses throughout the country .
The young kids from the " Obama Junior Fraternity " are emulating a historically black fraternity that is found on college campuses throughout the nation .
Their teacher was probably a member .
Young men in this fraternity DO go on to become teachers , doctors , lawyers , architects and engineers .
Not a bad way to achieve these goals ..
These kids want to go to college so they can be like the men in this video who are in college and are pursueing their dreams .
Other members of this fraternity include Bill Cosby , Jesse Jackson , Langston Hughes , Count Basie and Michael Jordan .
Cosby , Basie , and Jordan ?
Commies , all of 'em .
The kids in Beck 's video are students at the Urban Community Leadership Academy in Kansas City , Missouri .
How did I learn this ?
Why , from going to the original " Negro army " YouTube video post ...
Yup , that 's purty durn scary there , pilgrim .
And if you really want to make Beck pee his pants , dig up some breakdancing video .
Like millions of Afghans , I have no hope in the results of today 's election .
In a country ruled by warlords , occupation forces , Taliban terrorists , drug money and guns , no one can expect a legitimate or fair vote .
Even international observers have been speaking about widespread fraud and intimidation and , among the people on the street , there is a common refrain : the real winner has already been picked by the White House .
President Hamid Karzai has cemented alliances with brutal warlords and fundamentalists in order to maintain his position .
Although our constitution forbids war criminals from running for office , the incumbent has named two notorious militia commanders as his vice - presidential running mates – Karim Khalili and Mohammad Qasim Fahim , both of whom stand accused of brutalities against our people .
Deals have also been made with countless fundamentalists .
This week saw the return from exile of the dreaded warlord Rashid Dostum .
And the pro-Iranian extremist Mohammad Mohaqiq , who has been accused of war crimes , has been promised five cabinet positions for his party in exchange for supporting Mr Karzai .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Rather than democracy , what we have in Afghanistan are back - room deals among discredited warlords who are sworn enemies of democracy and justice .
The President has also continued to absolutely betray the women of Afghanistan .
Even after massive international outcry – and brave protesters taking to the streets of Kabul – Mr Karzai implemented the infamous rape law , targeting Shia women , to gain support of the fundamentalist elements in the election .
He had initially promised to review the most egregious clauses , but in the end it was passed with few amendments and the barbaric anti-women statements not removed .
As Human Rights
Watch recently stated : " Karzai has made an unthinkable deal to sell Afghan women out in return for the support of fundamentalists . "
And the two main challengers to a continuation of the Karzai rule do not offer any change .
Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah are both former cabinet ministers in this discredited regime and neither has a real , broad footing among the people .
Mr Abdullah , as the main candidate of fundamentalist warlords , has run a wide campaign with money he is receiving from the Iranian regime .
He and some of the Northern Alliance commanders supporting him have threatened unrest if he loses the vote , raising fears of a return to the rampant violence and killing that marked the civil war years of the 1990s .
All of the major candidates ' speeches and policies are very similar .
They make the same sweet - sounding promises , but we are not fooled .
Afghans remember how Mr Karzai abandoned his campaign pledges after winning the 2005 vote .
We Afghans know that this election will change nothing and it is only part of a show of democracy put on by , and for , the West , to legitimise its future puppet in Afghanistan .
It seems we are doomed to see the continuation of this failed , mafia - like , corrupt government for another term .
The people of Afghanistan are fed up with the rampant corruption of Karzai's " narco- state " ( his own brother , Wali Karzai , has been linked to drug trafficking in Kandahar province ) and the escalating war waged by Nato .
In May of this year , US air strikes killed approximately 150 civilians in my native province , Farah .
More than ever , Afghans are faced with powerful internal enemies – fundamentalist warlords and their Taliban brothers - in - creed – and the external enemies occupying the country .
Democracy will never come to Afghanistan through the barrel of a gun , or from the cluster bombs dropped by foreign forces .
The struggle will be long and difficult , but the values of real democracy , human rights and women 's rights will only be won by the Afghan people themselves .
So do not be fooled by this façade of democracy .
The British and other Western governments that claim to be bringing democracy to Afghanistan ignore public opinion in their own countries , where growing numbers are against the war .
In my tours to countries that have troops in Afghanistan , I 've met many bereaved parents who have lost their loved ones in the war in my home .
I am very sorry to see governments putting the lives of their soldiers in danger in Afghanistan in the name of bringing democracy .
In fact the soldiers are serving the strategic and regional interests of the White House and the consequences of their occupation so far have been devastating for my people .
I believe that if the ordinary folk of Afghanistan and the Nato countries were able to vote , and express their wishes , this indefinite military occupation would come to an end and there would be a real chance for peace in Afghanistan .
But today 's election does nothing for that .

Before getting started with Photoshop , we all should have first visited the “ Edit > Preferences ” menu and change the “ Performance ” settings to fit our personal taste and computer specifications , but this is n’t always the case – in many situations designers simply forget these aspects .
If you never changed the default performance settings in your Photoshop or you just want to double check them to improve the Photoshop performance , here are 10 important and useful points that you may want to consider .
Before getting started with Photoshop , we all should have first visited the “ Edit > Preferences ” menu and change the “ Performance ” settings to fit our personal taste and computer specifications , but this is n’t always the case – in many situations designers simply forget these aspects .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
1. Adjust The Number Of History States
Maybe you already went through that bad feeling of clicking “ undo ” dozens of times and realizing that Photoshop would n’t provide you with more previous steps , but this problem can be easily resolved by changing the History States setting in the Edit > Preferences >
Performance menu .
There are more efficient ways of going back and forward in your projects like using the “ Snapshots ” feature , which are essentially comfortable checkpoints of your work that you can go back to .
But if you use Undo a lot , you may want to consider adding more states , e.g. set them to ‘ 30 ’ .
However , be aware that too many states on a single image will usually result in History Palette literally “ eating ” RAM and if you work with less than 8GB of RAM , you probably should n’t using the Undo Feature that often !
Overall , you may add up to 1,000 history state levels in Photoshop .
2. How Many Cache Levels Do You Need ?
The Cache Levels setting can be found inside the Edit > Preferences >
Performance menu , right under the History States .
It controls the histogram and the time it takes an image to reappear on the screen after an action is applied to it .
By default , there are 6 cache levels ; the number of levels can be increased to the maximum of 8 which will – obviously – increase the rendering speed .
It is particular effective when you are working with high - resolution images .
When workin with smaller view - sizes , e.g. viewing an image at 50 % Zoom , the cache levels will determine the number of “ down samplings ” allowing Photoshop to perform operations faster .
Photoshop uses Image Caching and if you have a good amount of RAM , like at least 8GB and work with high - resolution images , you might want to raise the level to 8 as the speed performance will compensate the memory loss , but if you have a low RAM amount and usually work with small images only ( 1 - 4MB ) , you may want to lower the value to 1 or 2 as the RAM will be better allocated – storing the images rather then caching them .
3. Keep An Eye On Your Memory Usage
Photoshop really likes RAM and will use every little bit it can grab , but it also allows you to limit the RAM resources of your computer that Photoshop will use , and it even gives you good suggestions for the appropriate range of RAM values it wants .
This setting , of course , can be found inside the Edit > Preferences >
Performance menu , on the Left Side .
The displayed available RAM is the value left for applications after the Operating System loads into memory .
If you are going to use mostly only Photoshop , or if you have a low amount of memory , you will probably want to give it 75 - 80 % of the available RAM .
But if , on the other hand , you are more of a multi- task kind of person with browser , word processor , mail , Twitter client etc. being always opened , then you might want to limit Photoshop to around 50 % .
Efficient Use of Memory for Photoshop Performance
After setting up your memory values , you can keep an eye on how Photoshop is performing .
At the base of your image window , click to the right of the document size information and you will be able to choose “ Efficiency ” which will show you a percentage value .
If this value is not 100 % , it indicates that if you allocate more RAM to Photoshop , the operations would perform faster .
Closing applications or images that you are not using can also increase the efficiency – not exactly a secret , but worth mentioning nevertheless .
4. Use Proper Scratch Disks
Similar to what happened with RAM , Photoshop also uses a good amount of your hard drive space as the so - called “ scrath disk ” ( Edit > Preferences > Scratch Disks ) which works as the secondary memory resource .
Photoshop assumes that your primary hard drive is its scratch disk , but you can set it up differently with a secondary internal or external hard drive .
If you are going to work with large images , it is recommended that you have a dedicated scratch disk that is different from the one containing the image file .
Using different scratch disks is good , especially to avoid killing your primary boot drive when you have just a few gigabytes left .
5. Turn Font Preview Off
Photoshop users ( and especially designers ) like to have a good selection of fonts always installed and ready to be used ; but when the font preview is active , having too many fonts can slow you down .
Turning the font preview feature off can be a simple and instant step towards improving your Photoshop performance .
To do so , simply go to Type > Font Preview Size > None .
6. Use Thumbnails In Your Palettes
Displaying preview thumbnails in the Layers , Channels , and Paths palettes will cause Photoshop to consume some more of your RAM as it will be constantly updating the thumbnails to reflect the changes you will be doing in your project .
The memory consumption will keep growing with the amount of thumbnails you have opened at the same time as well as their size .
You could use the smaller thumbnail size or no thumbnail at all to increase your Photoshop performance .
To do so , in each palette , select Panel Options from the palette menu as it is shown on the picture above and select the smallest thumbnail size or “ None ” .
7. Learn How To Use Purge
When you are working on your images , Photoshop stores image data for the Undo , Clipboard , and History features .
This data consumes memory , especially if you have been working for a while and have a high number of History States defined ( see Point 1 for more on History States ) .
To eliminate that extra image data consuming your RAM , go to : Edit > Purge > ( option ) .
Keep in mind that clearing History will remove all the history states saved previously and you will not be able to undo your latest actions .
8. Set Maximize PSD And PSB File Compatibility to Always or Ask
Maximize PSD and PSB File Compatibility increases the size of your file by attaching a flattened copy of your image when you save your image .
A small amount of extra data is included in the file when you choose this option that ensures that PSD and PBS files saved in Photoshop will open in previous versions .
Additionally , if you want to use the Edit in Photoshop feature in Photoshop Lightroom , this option needs to be on .
To change the Maximize File Compatibility option choose Photoshop > Preferences > File Handling .
9 . Do n’t clutter your Photoshop
Of course , you can easily find an enormous amount of free stuff to add up to the default Photoshop brushes , fonts , patterns , etc . but that does n’t mean you need to download every freebie that comes in your way .
Keep it simple !
Having too many plugins and other resources installed will greatly decrease Photoshop performance .
Most top designers use a small selection of fonts and brushes that define their style and that can be used in a great amount of ways for literally millions of different results .
10 . Reset Default Settings
If you are using a shared machine for your Photoshop needs there is a little Photoshop start - up trick that may come in handy .
When the application is launching , if you press and hold : Alt + Control +
Shift ( Windows ) or Command + Option +
Shift ( Mac ) , a window will pop up asking you if you want to delete the Photoshop settings file , resetting all of the preferences to their default .

At Condé Nast , it is consultants versus car service .
A three - month McKinsey & Company project advising the publisher how to reduce costs is drawing to a close , and several magazines have been told to cut about 25 percent from their budgets .
The company ’s editors and publishers have already been under pressure to reduce costs this year , as advertising has plunged , and Condé Nast has closed two magazines in 2009 , Domino and Condé Nast Portfolio .
But cost - cutting at Condé Nast is not quite like cost - cutting at other publishers .
For example , on Oct. 13 , the men ’s magazine GQ will host a party in Washington to promote its list of powerful capital players , to appear in its November issue .
The party is upscale : it will be held at the 701 Restaurant , known for its caviar and live piano music .
That is not the only expense involved .
Several editorial employees will travel from New York for the evening .
And they received an e-mail message recently reminding them to limit their expenses for the night  to $ 1,000 a person .
That culture of spending at Condé Nast explains some of the fascination with the place , which incites a mix of envy and scorn among employees at other magazines .
Condé Nast ’s top editors and publishers have drivers on call , staff members can be reimbursed for $ 15 a day for lunches they order in , and even freelance writers stay at hotels like the W when they are on assignment .
' Tamiflu turned my children into hallucinating , sobbing wrecks '
This week , it was with no small measure of satisfaction that I watched Andy Burnham , our implausibly youthful Health Secretary , squirm on the GMTV sofa .
Andrew Castle , it must be said , is no Jeremy Paxman .
So when Mr Burnham agreed to take part in the show to discuss the alleged merits of Tamiflu ( how it sticks in my craw even to write those words ) he was doubtless looking forward to putting across the Government 's point of view in the gentlest of surroundings .
What ensued was an ambush , as the visibly irate presenter revealed that his daughter Georgina had collapsed and nearly died after taking the supposedly harmless drug .
Tamiflu warning : Richard Price , wife Jennie and Jessica and James
Mr Burnham , for his part , burbled some platitudes about Tamiflu being ' our main line of defence ' against swine flu , and how it was a ' different phase of the illness ' when Georgina was prescribed the drug .
Oh really ?
Perhaps Mr Burnham would have liked to come round to my house and explain the merits of Tamiflu to my three - year - old daughter as she sobbed and retched in my arms night after night .
While he was at it , perhaps he could take the time to scrub our sitting room floor , once James , our exhausted 15 - month - old boy , had vomited so many times that his tiny stomach could heave up nothing but bright orange phlegm .
This is to say nothing of the raging fevers , nightmares and hallucinations which plagued both our children until we decided they could take no more .
Squirming breakfast TV : Health Secretary Andy Burnham defended giving swine flu drug Tamiflu to children on GMTV as TV presenter Andrew Castle said his daughter ' almost died ' after taking it
The effects of swine flu ?
Not a bit of it .
My wife and I are utterly convinced that all these symptoms were , quite simply , the vicious side effects of Tamiflu .
Full disclosure : my wife , Jennie , was instrumental in making sure Mr Burnham appeared in public to discuss the issue .
The previous night , she had appeared in the lead item on ITV's News At Ten to exhort all parents that they should think long and hard before giving Tamiflu to their children .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham
Having witnessed the damage wreaked by the drug at close quarters , we would never make the same mistake again .
It is difficult to explain the gutwrenching feeling of seeing your children suffer , when their pain is a result of your decision .
And yet , like any responsible parents , all we wanted was to protect them .
In following the Government 's advice , we thought we were taking the cautious route .
How wrong we were .
Looking back , it started out in innocuous fashion .
When James's and Jessica 's noses started running during a family day out in the Cotswolds late last month , we initially thought nothing of it .
But when both started coughing and developed high temperatures , we rang NHS Direct to seek their advice .
Two hours later , after a flurry of phone calls starting with NHS Direct , both our children had been prescribed Tamiflu .
It was not certain that they had swine flu , but the on - call GP was pretty certain they had and it was better to be safe than sorry .
Under no circumstances were we to take the children to the surgery , so instead we were asked to dispatch a ' flu friend ' to the nearest open pharmacy to collect the drugs .
At that stage - and I remember this vividly , having played it over in my mind dozens of times - both our children were reasonably well .
Jessica , in particular , seemed to regard the pills as sweets and was positively bouncing off the walls with excitement .
Needless suffering or necessary protection ?
Tamiflu is being handed out to thousands of children
Once the first dose had been administered , however , all that quickly changed .
James 's temperature , which up to that point had been kept at normal levels with Calpol , rocketed .
His appetite disappeared and when his raging thirst finally persuaded him to drink some milk , he vomited so spectacularly that we are still struggling to clear up the stains several weeks later .
For the next day he barely moved , except to be sick every time he had so much as a sip of water .
We had never seen him so ill , and because he was unable to keep anything in his stomach , there was no way of controlling his temperature with paracetamol .
His fever was reaching dangerous levels and we were becoming seriously worried about dehydration .
Thankfully - though we did not see it this way at the time - James is nothing if not a character .
He knew what was making him ill - the Tamiflu - and he fought tooth and nail to resist taking the drug .
Producing the packet of pills was the only thing that could rouse him from listless torpor .
In the end , we gave up .
Almost immediately , his symptoms cleared up and he was back to being our happy little boy .
Facemask nation : A girl takes a photograph in Whitehall in London , wearing a medical mask
Jessica , however , has always been of a gentler disposition .
Perhaps it is a simple matter of gender , but she is delightfully eager to please , and even after the pills started to kick in it did not take too much wheedling for her to take them .
Indeed , for a few hours all seemed well .
Until we were woken in the early hours of the morning by the sound of Jessica screaming , between deep , heaving dry retches : ' I do n't like the pills , Daddy !
Please do n't make me have the pills !'
She was hallucinating , sobbing and more upset than I have ever seen her .
Eventually she rocked herself to sleep in my arms , only to wake up an hour later and repeat the process .
In the morning , exhausted , my wife sought advice from our GP .
James had made his own decision , but we were encouraged to carry on with Jessica 's course .
Pills were smothered in chocolate sauce , but she was no longer to be so easily fooled .
In the end , it took the promise of a trip to the toy shop and a river of tears before she , with typical sweetness , obliged and swallowed them .
That night , however , the screams and violent retching returned .
By now she was begging , pleading not to be given any more pills .
We cracked .
Enough was enough .
The Tamiflu went in the dustbin .
So what happened when we defied government advice and eschewed Tamiflu in favour of Calpol and cuddles ?
Within 24hours both of our children were completely recovered , save for those runny noses .
Yet the sobering fact is that today alone , the NHS will hand out Tamiflu to thousands of vulnerable little children who will go through needless suffering as a result of scaremongering about an illness which is no more dangerous than seasonal flu .
Of course , there is always the chance that your child will not suffer side effects , and the drug could reduce the length of the illness by a day - though even the Government now admits Tamiflu does virtually nothing to relieve symptoms .
Take it from us : it really , truly , is not worth it .
Gender , risk , and competition
Alison Booth
Women are underrepresented in high - paying jobs and upper management .
Is that due to gender differences in risk aversion and facing competition ?
This column describes an experiment in which girls were found to be as competitive and risk - taking as boys when surrounded by only girls .
This suggests cultural pressure to act as a girl could explain gender differences that are not innate .
It is well known that women are under - represented in high - paying jobs and top - level management positions .
Recent work in experimental economics , largely examining college - age men and women attending coeducational universities , has examined to what degree this underrepresentation may be due to innate differences between men and women .
Experimental studies have shown that women are less willing than men to take risks or to enter a competitive environment such as a tournament ( see for example Niederle and Vesterlund , 2007 ) .
Gender differences in risk aversion and competition , it is sometimes argued , may help explain some of the observed gender disparities in labour force achievement .
For example , if remuneration in high - paying jobs is tied to bonuses based on a company 's performance and if women are more risk - averse than men , fewer women may choose to take high - paying jobs because of the uncertainty .
Might culture matter ?
Are women naturally more risk - averse or less inclined to enter a competitive situation ?
Or are they trained to be that way ?
Why women and men might have different preferences or risk attitudes has been discussed but not tested by economists .
Broadly speaking , those differences may be due to nurture , nature , or some combination of the two .
For instance , boys are pushed to take risks and act competitively when participating in sports , and girls are often encouraged to remain cautious .
Thus , the choices made by men could be due to the nurturing received from parents or peers .
Similarly , the disinclination of women to take risks or act competitively could be the result of parental or peer pressure not to do so .
An interesting study by Gneezy , Leonard , and List ( 2008 ) explored the role of culture in determining gender differences in competitive behaviour .
They investigated two distinct societies , the Maasai tribe of Tanzania and the Khasi tribe in India .
The former is patriarchal while the latter is matrilineal .
In the patriarchal society , women were found to be less competitive than men , a result consistent with studies using data from Western cultures .
But in the matrilineal society , women were more competitive than men .
Indeed , the Khasi women were found to be as competitive as Maasai men .
The authors interpret this as evidence that culture has an influence .
Environmental factors
What other environments could affect competitive and risk - taking behaviour ?
Educational psychologists argue that the gendered aspect of individuals ' behaviour is brought into play by the gender of others with whom they interact , and that there may be more pressure for girls to maintain their gender identity in schools where boys are present than for boys when girls are present .
In a coeducational environment , girls are more explicitly confronted with adolescent subculture ( such as personal attractiveness to members of the opposite sex ) than they are in a single - sex environment .
This may lead them to conform to society 's expectations of how girls should behave to avoid social rejection .
If competitive behaviour or risk avoidance is viewed as being a part of female gender identity while risk - seeking is a part of male gender identity , then a coeducational school environment might lead girls to make less competitive and risky choices than boys .
Experimental evidence on environmental influences
To investigate the role that nurturing might play in shaping risk and competitive attitudes , we used UK students from years 10 and 11 of state - funded single - sex or coeducational schools as experimental subjects ( Booth and Nolen 2009a , 2009 b ) .
The students had been in that environment since completing primary school , and their average age was just under 15 years .
Our goal was to examine the effect of two potential types of nurturing – educational environment and randomly assigned experimental peer - groups .
The former represents long - run nurturing experiences , while the latter captures short - run environmental effects .
The students were taken by bus from their respective schools to the University of Essex for the experiments .
They came from eight schools in the counties of Essex and Suffolk .
Four of the schools were single - sex .
In Suffolk County , there are no publicly funded single - sex schools .
In Essex County , the old single - sex " grammar " schools remain , owing to a ( convenient for our purposes ) quirk of political history .
On arrival , students from each school were randomly assigned into 65 groups of four .
Groups were of three types – all - girls , all - boys , or mixed .
Mixed groups had at least one student of each gender and the modal group comprised two boys and two girls .
The composition of each group – the appropriate mix of single - sex schools , coeducational schools and gender – was determined beforehand .
Thus only the assignment of the 260 girls and boys from a particular school to a group was random .
The school mix was two coeducational schools from Suffolk ( 103 students ) , two coeducational schools from Essex ( 45 students ) , two all - girl schools from Essex ( 66 students ) , and two all - boy schools from Essex ( 46 students ) .
All students were paid a show - up fee as well as any winnings from the experiments .
A survey was administered immediately after the experiment , to obtain background information to facilitate robustness checks .
Risk
We gave subjects in the controlled experiment an opportunity to choose the risky outcome – a real - stakes gamble with a higher expected monetary value than the alternative outcome with a certain payoff – and in which the sensitivity of observed risk choices to environmental factors could be explored .
The task was carefully constructed so that subjects with a coefficient of relative risk aversion greater than a particular level would choose the real - stakes gamble ; otherwise they would choose the certain amount .
Their choice was either to receive £ 5 with certainty or to flip a coin and get £ 11 if the coin comes up heads or get £ 2 if the coin comes up tails .
We hypothesized that women and men may differ in their propensity to choose a risky outcome for several reasons – innate preferences or because their innate preferences are modified by pressure to conform to gender - stereotypes .
Single - sex environments are likely to modify students ' risk - taking preferences in economically important ways .
Our specific conjectures were that girls from single - sex schools are less risk averse than girls from coed schools , and that girls in same - gender groups are less risk averse than girls in coed groups .
We also conjectured that girls in same - gender environments ( single - sex schooling or same - gender experimental groups ) are no less risk - averse than boys .
We found that girls from single - sex schools were as likely to take a risk by gambling their £ 5 in the hopes of winning £ 11 as boys ( from either coed or single sex schools ) and were more likely to take a risk than coed girls .
Moreover , gender differences in preferences for risk - taking were sensitive to the gender mix of the experimental group , with girls being more likely to choose to take a risk when assigned to an all - girl group .
This suggests that observed gender differences in behaviour under uncertainty found in previous studies might reflect social learning rather than inherent gender traits .
Competitive behaviour
Competitive behaviourwas measured by allowing students to choose between payment via a tournament ( winner - takes - all ) or by piece rate .
Subjects were advised that their payment would depend on which option they chose if this round was randomly selected for payment .
Students ’ tasks involved solving paper mazes , as is common in this literature .
Using the data generated from this experiment , we found that girls from single - sex schools were significantly more likely to choose to enter the tournament than coeducational girls , ceteris paribus .
Being randomly assigned to an all - girls group made the girl more likely to enter the tournament .
We also compared girls ' behaviour with that of boys from single - sex and coeducational schools – girls from single - sex schools behaved more like boys .
These findings were robust to a number of sensitivity checks .
What might explain these findings ?
While our research should not be interpreted as saying that we should all immediately enrol our daughters in single - sex schools , it does provide food for thought .
Educational studies have shown that there may be more pressure for girls to maintain their gender identity in schools where boys are present than for boys when girls are present .
In a coeducational environment , adolescent girls are more explicitly confronted with adolescent subculture ( such as personal attractiveness to members of the opposite sex ) than they are in a single - sex environment .
This may lead them to conform to boys ' expectations of how girls should behave to avoid social rejection .
If risk avoidance is viewed as being a part of female gender identity while risk seeking is a part of male gender identity , then being in a coeducational school environment might lead girls to make safer choices than boys .
What role for policy ?
These results matter , not least because of the underrepresentation of women in high - paying jobs and top management positions .
While gender differences in risk aversion or competition could explain some of the observed disparities in labour force achievement , these gender differences are not necessarily innate , as shown by our experiments and those of Gneezy et al. ( 2008 ) .
Women may be trained to be so by their environment .
Appropriate policy action might be directed not only to removing discrimination on the demand - side but also towards developing female confidence in risk - taking on the supply - side .

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Strong U.S. support for ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya has sharply reduced the chances that the military coup there could reignite ideological tensions in Latin America or encourage similar moves against other leftist governments .
But a failure to match the words with action to help restore the leftist to the presidency could hand a propaganda victory to his fellow socialist leaders in Latin America and damage U.S. efforts to rebuild its leadership in the region .
The apparently weak footing of the Honduras coup in the face of a broad regional consensus against it means it is unlikely to spark similar moves in the historically coup - prone region , analysts said .
“ This coup is a failure ... because the world has changed and it was clear before they did it that they would n’t get support from anyone in the hemisphere , ” said Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research think tank in Washington .
“ I do n’t think it will encourage anyone . ”
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , a foe of U.S. trade and foreign policy in Latin America , has threatened military action in Honduras to restore Zelaya and rallied his leftist bloc since the weekend coup , casting the crisis as an attack on democracy by imperialist forces .
U.S. President Barack Obama joined Latin American leaders on Monday in condemning the coup as illegal , marking a contrast to 2002 when Washington went against the regional consensus by initially welcoming a coup attempt against Chavez himself .
‘ STEALING THE SHOW ’
“ Part of the reason why the U.S. will come out so strongly against it has to do with the intention of preventing Hugo Chavez from stealing the show , ” said Kevin Casas - Zamora of the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington .
He added , “ If Zelaya is put back in power , Chavez wo n’t be able to claim the victory for his Bolivarian revolution , ” a term inspired by 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar that Chavez uses to describe his push to remake Venezuela as a socialist nation .
Chavez , who blamed former U.S. President George W. Bush for the 2002 coup in which he was briefly ousted , said he wants a probe into any role the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency may have played in Zelaya ’s ouster .
The CIA has been involved in toppling past leftist governments in Latin America .
The White House has said there was no U.S. role in Zelaya ’s ouster .
A former soldier who himself once led a failed coup attempt in Venezuela , Chavez knows he has enemies who could be emboldened by a successful overthrow of Zelaya in Honduras .
Chavez has been harsh with new mayors and governors elected last year , stripping them of income and power .
Some in Venezuela fear that by humiliating the opposition in that country , Chavez may be increasing the credibility of radical elements who believe in removing him by force .
Evo Morales , the fellow socialist president of Bolivia , has faced unrest and strong opposition from conservative business groups and politicians in his country , and police recently uncovered what Morales described as an assassination plot against him .
Zelaya was detained and sent into exile in a dispute over his push to allow a Honduran president to stay in power longer than that country ’s constitution allows -- a tactic that other leftist leaders such as Chavez and Morales have also used .
Rather than signaling a warning for leftist Latin American governments about pushing constitutional changes too far , the Honduran coup is an example of the risks of doing so without enough political and military support , analysts said .
The near unanimous diplomatic backing for Zelaya , whose push to change the constitution was seen as undemocratic by critics , could shield other leaders in the region from similar criticism in the future , said Chris Sabatini of the U.S. - based Americas Society - Council of the Americas think tank .
“ The unconstitutional act being punished is the coup d’etat , not the death by a thousand cuts that comes before -- the erosion of democratic institutions , ” Sabatini said .
‘ SUBTLE SIGNALS ’
Weisbrot and other analysts said the coup leaders would be looking for any signs of ambivalence in the U.S. stance that could signal that Washington is willing to allow a political outcome without Zelaya ’s return .
“ This government has probably got a plan to hold out for ( the ) rest of the term , ” Weisbrot said , referring to Honduran interim President Roberto Micheletti ’s intention to retain control through a November 29 presidential election .
“ They are going to be looking for subtle signals from this ( Obama ) administration about what they should do . ”
Obama , saying that Zelaya was the only legitimate Honduran president , said he would work with the Organization of American States and other international institutions to restore Zelaya to power and “ see if we can resolve this in a peaceful way . ”
Both Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have explicitly referred to Zelaya ’s ouster as a “ coup . ”
But Clinton said the administration was not formally designating it as a military coup for now , a step that would force a cut - off of most U.S. aid to Honduras .
A senior U.S. official who spoke on condition he not be named said that by holding off on a legal determination that a coup has taken place , Washington was trying to provide space for a negotiated settlement .
“ Hillary Clinton seems a little less out front than Obama on this ... it will make the U.S. look extremely weak if they cannot march this back , ” said Peter Hakim , president of the Inter - American Dialogue in Washington .
“ The fact is the U.S. says Zelaya is the legitimate president and a lot of us are aware of the kind of influence that the U.S. should be projecting with the people who carried out the coup . ”

BEREA , Ohio --
After a spirited practice , the Cleveland Browns were still in a playful mood so they decided to pull a prank on one of their rookies .
Coye Francies did n't care for the joke .
The first - year cornerback , incensed over being soaked with water by some of his teammates , threw a bucket of ice and at least one errant punch during a skirmish in the Browns ' locker room on Friday .
As the Browns returned from practice , a dripping - wet Francies stormed into the locker room lugging a Gatorade bucket full of ice .
Before he could be stopped , Francies tossed the ice on cornerback Brandon McDonald , hitting him with cubes that covered the floor .
At that point , it was not clear if Francies was playing along and messing with McDonald .
Then , his mood , and the vibe in the room , turned more serious .
Francies flung some more ice in the direction of safety Mike Adams before heading toward safety Abram Elam 's corner cubicle .
With the bucket on the floor , Francies then swung his arms at Elam , who deflected the blows .
Pro Bowl nose tackle Shaun Rogers then stepped in and grabbed Francies by the back of the shirt and escorted him out a side door as other players came to help .
" Calm down , man , " Rogers told Francies as he pushed him outside .
" Welcome to the Browns locker room ! " wide receiver Braylon Edwards hollered .
The incident happened while the locker room was open to reporters .
The Browns ( 0 - 2 ) play at Baltimore on Sunday .

Nick Clegg is ready to ditch key Lib Dem policies in an attempt to be more honest with voters about spending cuts .
The Lib Dem leader warned party members its next manifesto could not be a " shopping list " of unfunded pledges .
He indicated that nothing was sacred - even core policies such as free tuition fees , higher state pensions and personal care for the elderly .
But Lib Dem MP
Evan Harris , a member of the party 's policy committee , said they would not agree to ditch such policies .
' Commitments '
Dr Harris was adamant free tuition fees for undergraduates in particular would be in the next manifesto , as the party had only just agreed the policy and wanted to scrap Labour 's 50 % target for all young people going to university to help pay for it .
He said : " Nick Clegg is right to say that we will be making tough choices about what policy commitments we can afford in our manifesto given that all new spending has to be funded by cuts in other areas .
" But the media are wrong if they think that tuition fee abolition with student debt reduction will not be one of our key proposals to put before the British public . "
What people want is to be treated like grown - ups
Nick Clegg But Mr Clegg has been keen to stress that nothing is off the agenda - and that all he wants at this stage is for the party to agree a mechanism at their autumn conference in Bournemouth for deciding what should be cut .
Challenged on BBC Radio 4's PM programme about whether tuition fees would be one of the policies facing the axe , he said Dr Harris was " running ahead of the debate " .
He said : " What we will be debating in the conference is not a specific list of policies .
It is an approach about how we choose between different policies . "
And he stressed that voters would be told before the next election which policies the party wanted to axe .
But Labour said the " u- turn " on tuition fees left the party 's higher education policy " in a shambles " .
" Students and the general public alike will be fed up with the Lib Dems using fees as a political football , " said higher education minister David Lammy .
Spending principles
Mr Clegg says he wants his party to sign up to the principle that there would not be an overall increase in public spending - and that any new spending pledges would have to be paid for with cuts elsewhere .
Speaking at the launch of new policy document A Fresh Start for Britain , he said : " To my knowledge , we 're the only party saying there are difficult choices .
We 're not going to be able to do everything we aspired to do before .
We have to drop some things . "
The document is short on specifics but it does identify some potential long term savings .
These include downgrading the replacement for Trident , cutting future public sector pensions , scrapping the government 's " arbitrary " target of 50 % of young people going to university , simplifying tax credits and cutting red tape .
It also singles out children and young people as the party 's top priority and reaffirms its commitment to " clean - up " politics and bring in tax cuts for low and middle income workers paid for by green taxes on industry and higher taxes for " the rich " .
Mr Clegg said more details would be revealed as the state of the public finances became clearer .
He said the party had to be " disciplined and honest " about what would be in its general election manifesto .
He said : " What people want is to be treated like grown - ups - I do n't think people want a standard line from politicians that somehow the world has n't changed - it 's changed a lot .
Everyone knows that .
" It seems to me that what we need to say to people is we 're going to have to take difficult decisions .
" We 're not going to pretend we can do everything we did in the era of plenty because it 's just not plausible any more .
" But I think it 's deeply unfair on the next generation to hand on to them the sins ... of this generation . "

In addition to having this “ automatic ” stabilizing effect , the government has stepped in to rescue the financial sector .
You can argue ( and I would ) that the bailouts of financial firms could and should have been handled better , that taxpayers have paid too much and received too little .
Yet it ’s possible to be dissatisfied , even angry , about the way the financial bailouts have worked while acknowledging that without these bailouts things would have been much worse .
The point is that this time , unlike in the 1930s , the government did n’t take a hands - off attitude while much of the banking system collapsed .
And that ’s another reason we ’re not living through Great Depression II .
Last and probably least , but by no means trivial , have been the deliberate efforts of the government to pump up the economy .
From the beginning , I argued that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , a k a the Obama stimulus plan , was too small .
Nonetheless , reasonable estimates suggest that around a million more Americans are working now than would have been employed without that plan  a number that will grow over time  and that the stimulus has played a significant role in pulling the economy out of its free fall .
All in all , then , the government has played a crucial stabilizing role in this economic crisis .
Ronald Reagan was wrong : sometimes the private sector is the problem , and government is the solution .
And are n’t you glad that right now the government is being run by people who do n’t hate government ?
We do n’t know what the economic policies of a McCain - Palin administration would have been .
We do know , however , what Republicans in opposition have been saying  and it boils down to demanding that the government stop standing in the way of a possible depression .
I ’m not just talking about opposition to the stimulus .
Leading Republicans want to do away with automatic stabilizers , too .
Back in March , John Boehner , the House minority leader , declared that since families were suffering , " it ’s time for government to tighten their belts and show the American people that we ‘ get ’ it . "
Fortunately , his advice was ignored .
Il ritrovamento di una delle navi dei veleni torna a lanciare l'allarme radioattivo sulle coste della Calabria .
La vicenda non dovrebbe stupire visto che è stata denunciata a più riprese negli ultimi due decenni .
Nel 1996 , in un’occasione poco riservata come una conferenza stampa , la Legambiente rivelò l’esistenza di una società , la Odm ( Oceanic Disposal Management ) , che si presentava su Internet offrendo i suoi servigi di affondamento su commissione .
Era già in vigore la Convenzione di Londra che vieta espressamente lo scarico in mare di rifiuti radioattivi , ma la Odm , che operava dal 1987 , sosteneva che non si trattava di scarico in mare ma sotto il mare perché la tecnica proposta consisteva nell ’uso di una sorta di siluri d’acciaio di profondità che , grazie al loro peso e alla velocità acquisita durante la discesa , si inabissano all ’interno degli strati argillosi del fondo marino penetrando a una profondità di 40 - 50 metri .
Oltre ai teorici dell ’affondamento “ controllato ” erano poi all ’opera altre organizzazioni , più clandestine , che praticavano l’affondamento selvaggio basato sull ’ inabissamento di vecchie carrette che venivano fatte sparire misteriosamente , spesso senza lanciare il May - Day .
Tutto ciò è stato più volte denunciato dalle associazioni ambientaliste , da pentiti e da inchieste giornalistiche .
Tuttavia nulla - o quasi - è stato fatto a livello governativo .
Il mare e le coste della Calabria sono stati trasformati in un cimitero radioattivo tollerando la crescita di picchi di tumore nelle popolazioni più esposte .
Intanto l’Italia si prepara ad aprire una seconda stagione nucleare che , in comune con la prima , ha la mancata soluzione del problema scorie .

The Charles Darwin biopic Creation contains one of the most robust defences of atheism and agnosticism ever to appear in a mainstream film , says Ariane Sherine
From the Book of Genesis to Haydn 's great oratorio , the concept of " creation " is inextricably linked to the whole " built - world - in - six - days - then -
had - a - nap " shebang .
For this and countless other reasons , John Collee 's resplendent cinematic homage to Charles Darwin will doubtless ruffle the made - in - a - day feathers of evolution deniers around the world – if , as currently seems unlikely , it can find a US distributor .
The film is based on the biography Annie 's Box by conservationist Randal Keynes , one of Darwin 's great - great - grandsons .
It spans the years between 1841 , just after the birth of his beloved daughter Annie , and 1859 – as he submits the only manuscript for On the Origin of Species , worryingly placing the most revolutionary idea in the history of thought on the back of a rickety old cart .
The intervening portrayal , sketched by a brilliant and beardless Paul Bettany , is that of a diffident , tortured and conflicted genius who propagates a scientific revolution despite the grumpiness of his devoutly religious wife Emma ( played by Bettany 's real - life spouse , Jennifer Connelly ) .
Inevitably , Darwin 's story has been narrativised , tightened and passed through a dullness filter to Hollywoodify it ( no reference to his work The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms here ) .
Purists will grumble at the melodramatic sequences between Emma and Charles , laden with poetic licence at its most inventive , while several minor details are historically inaccurate , such as locations ( and the science stuff would n't stymie a nine - year - old ) .
However , even Darwin pedants should see this as a timely , compelling and essential reminder of his brain - boggling contribution to our understanding of the world .
It also contains one of the most robust defences of atheism and agnosticism ever to appear in a mainstream film .
A kind , funny and humble family man , Darwin is as endearing as they come , and yet he refuses to sing or pray in church , walks abruptly out of a service and takes issue with the cruel local vicar .
He can't accept the idea of a God who would knowingly create parasitic , tortuous creatures , or sculpt a system featuring so much natural wastage .
The guileless candour of his winsome and fiercely bright daughter also encourages Darwin to pursue his scientific endeavours .
Evolution and doubt are equated with truth and courage throughout the film , and the adverse consequences of blind faith and superstition are amply demonstrated .
The film is nuanced and intelligent enough , however , not to cast all its religious characters as merely backward .
Emma is a complex yet ultimately sympathetic God- botherer ; in the end , paradoxically , she is redeemed in the eyes of the viewer by a faithless yet utterly faithful gesture .
Conversely , the god - free Thomas Huxley , best known as " Darwin 's bulldog " , cuts a rather bullying and mocking figure .
When he jibes : " You 've killed God , sir " , Darwin 's sense of alarm is both palpable and understandable , given the prevailing Victorian attitudes towards faith .
Creation has a rare emotional pull , and several moments are deeply sobering .
At the end of one of the film 's finest pieces of dialogue , Darwin 's closest friend Joseph Hooker pleads with him , " All of us [ scientists ] are fighting the same battle – you could win it for us . "
And yet , 150 years later , between 40 % and 50 % of Americans still believe in the literal truth of the Biblical account of the universe 's origins , and the largely creationist religious right still has the power to influence US law - making .
The battle may be easier now , but it is far from won .
Let 's hope ( but never pray ) that one stateside distributor sees sense and risks the inevitable opprobrium to screen this film where it is most needed .
It could help Genesis literalists evolve .
Creation , like the 13.7 - billion - year - old universe itself , is truly glorious .

The war on drugs is a failed policy that has injured far more people than it has protected .
Around 14,000 people have died in Mexico 's drug wars since the end of 2006 , more than 1,000 of them in the first three months of this year .
Beyond the overflowing morgues in Mexican border towns , there are uncounted numbers who have been maimed , traumatised or displaced .
From Liverpool to Moscow , Tokyo to Detroit , a punitive regime of prohibition has turned streets into battlefields , while drug use has remained embedded in the way we live .
The anti-drug crusade will go down as among the greatest follies of modern times .
A decade or so ago , it could be argued that the evidence was not yet in on drugs .
No one has ever believed illegal drug use could be eliminated , but there was a defensible view that prohibition could prevent more harm than it caused .
Drug use is not a private act without consequences for others ; even when legal , it incurs medical and other costs to society .
A society that adopted an attitude of laissez - faire towards the drug habits of its citizens could find itself with higher numbers of users .
There could be a risk of social abandonment , with those in poor communities being left to their fates .
These dangers have not disappeared , but the fact is that the costs of drug prohibition now far outweigh any possible benefits the policy may bring .
It is time for a radical shift in policy .
Full - scale legalisation , with the state intervening chiefly to regulate quality and provide education on the risks of drug use and care for those who have problems with the drugs they use , should now shape the agenda of drug law reform .
In rich societies like Britain , the US and continental Europe , the drug war has inflicted multiple harms .
Since the inevitable result is to raise the price of a serious drug habit beyond what many can afford , penalising use drives otherwise law - abiding people into the criminal economy .
As well as criminalising users , prohibition exposes them to major health risks .
Illegal drugs can't easily be tested for quality and toxicity and overdosing are constant risks .
Where the drugs are injected , there is the danger of hepatitis and HIV being transmitted .
Again , criminalising some drugs while allowing a free market in others distracts attention from those that are legal and harmful , such as alcohol .
While it is certainly possible that legalisation could see more people take drugs , a drug user 's life would be much safer and healthier than at present .
There is no room for speculation here , for we know that a great many users lived highly productive lives before drugs were banned .
Until the First World War , when they were introduced under the banner of national security , there were few controls on drugs in the UK or America .
Cocaine , morphine and heroin could be bought at the local chemist .
Many were users , including William Gladstone , who liked to take a drop of laudanum ( an alcoholic tincture of opium ) in his coffee before making speeches .
Some users had problems , but none had to contend with the inflated prices , health risks and threat of jail faced by users today .
Though politicians like to pretend they embody a moral consensus , there is none on the morality of drug use .
Barack Obama has admitted to taking cocaine , while David Cameron refuses to answer the question .
Neither has suffered any significant political fall - out .
Everyone knows drug use was commonplace in the generation from which these politicians come and no one is fussed .
What is more bothersome is that the tacit admission by these leaders that drug use is a normal part of life goes with unwavering support for the failed policy of prohibition .
Producing and distributing illegal drugs is a highly organised business , whose effects are felt throughout society .
The extreme profits that are reaped corrupt institutions and wreck lives .
Dealing drugs can seem a glamorous career to young people in desolate inner cities , even as it socialises them into a gang culture in which violence is normal .
The Hobbesian environment of anarchic street gangs , crooked politicians and put-upon , occasionally corrupt cops portrayed in The Wire may not be immediately recognisable in most European countries .
But it is not all that far away .
It is in the world 's poorer societies that drug prohibition is having its most catastrophic effects .
Mexico is only one of several Latin American countries where the anti-drug crusade has escalated into something like low - intensity warfare , while elsewhere in the world some states have been more or less wholly captured by drug money .
Narco - states are one of the drug war 's worst side - effects , with small countries like Guinea - Bissau in West Africa being hijacked ( as Ed Vulliamy and Grant Ferrett reported in these pages in March of last year ) to serve as distribution points for Latin American cocaine .
Narco - capitalism is one of the less advertised features of globalisation , but it may well emerge strengthened from the recent dislocation in global markets .
Not only in Afghanistan but throughout the world , the extreme profits of the drug trade have a well - documented role in funding terrorist networks and so threaten advanced countries .
No doubt terrorism will remain a threat whatever drug regime is in place , but the collapse in prices that would follow legalisation would make a big dent in the resources it can command .
It is hard to see how the countries where most drug users live can be secure while counter - terrorist operations are mixed up with the ritual combat of the anti-drugs crusade .
What is required is not a libertarian utopia in which the state retreats from any concern about personal conduct , but a coolly utilitarian assessment of the costs and benefits of different methods of intervention .
The scale of the problem suggests that decriminalising personal use is not enough .
The whole chain of production and distribution needs to be brought out of the shadows and regulated .
Different drugs may need different types of regulation and legalisation may work best if it operated somewhat differently in different countries .
At this point , these details are not of overriding importance .
The urgent need is for a shift in thinking .
There are hopeful signs of this happening in some of the emerging countries , such as Argentina , Mexico and Brazil ( whose former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso last week argued forcefully in this newspaper that the war on drugs has failed ) .
There is no reason why these countries , which bear much of the brunt of the drug wars , should wait for an outbreak of reason among politicians in rich countries .
They should abandon prohibition as soon as they can .
It remains the case that without a change of mind in the leaders of rich countries , above all in the United States , the futile global crusade will continue .
The likelihood that the American political classes will call a halt any time soon must be close to zero .
Yet it is pleasant to dream that President Obama , in the midst of all the other dilemmas he is facing , may one day ask himself whether America or the world can any longer afford the absurd war on drugs .

In 1991 I asked Bob Hieb ( Kent ’s Chez Scheme buddy then , and my co-researcher on theoretical stuff ) what the most frequent annoying bug was in the code .
He ranked an accidentally omitted else branch among the top three .
Indeed , he said that because of this , they had agreed to use WHEN and UNLESS exclusively for cases when they needed a one - armed IF and that they considered all one - armed uses as a bug or a legacy issue ( which they corrected as soon as they touched a file ) .
We have chosen to codify their restriction .

THE stories are always similar : a crack addict is running through the streets , semi-naked and delirious , aggressively challenging anyone that gets in his way .
It takes a dozen police officers to subdue and restrain him , at which point he collapses and dies .
Rare as these deaths are , more often than not police brutality is blamed and officers are taken to court , but researchers now think that such events are the result of a rare disorder called “ excited delirium ” .
Anecdotally , physicians use the term to describe a state in which a person becomes agitated …

Is it really possible ?
After all the schlock and pseudo sci-fi hitting theaters this summer ( I ’m looking at you Terminator Salvation ) could Hollywood be gearing up to unleash a cornucopia of sci - fi gems ?
Looks like it .
I will be the first to say : I did n’t see this coming .
It seems that just about everything coming from Hollywood , for better or worse , is a dumbed - down popcorn flick focusing on eye candy and simple stories with little subtext and not much to say .
But the following four flicks , from what we can tell , are the exception to the rule .
True science fiction is about more than showing off cool futuristic gadgets ; it ’s about social commentary , dreaming of what the future could hold , and positing realistic possibilities about where science is headed .
Utopian , dystopian , or somewhere in - between , true good sci - fi makes us look forward at what the future could possibly hold .
And I doubt that will be giant transforming robots .
Without further ado , then , let ’s unveil the line - up .
Four movies that any true sci- fi fan should seek out the second they become available .
1. Moon
This is the only movie on the list that has been released as - of - yet , assuming , that is , that you are lucky enough to live in a city that got the film .
I saw it a few weeks back in an almost - empty arthouse theater , and the movie did n’t disappoint .
It stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell , a government contractor doing a three - year stint on the lunar surface to harvest Helium 3 , a newly discovered energy source that currently powers all of earth .
Sam is only weeks from going home when he starts seeing visions .
When a duplicate Sam shows up , things get hairy .
I wo n’t ruin the twists of the story , but the thing that was most affecting about this film is that the film is n’t about the twists .
It ’s about a man dealing with his own identity and how each discovery affects him in a very personal way .
As a sci - fi yarn , though , the movie excels , positing a future where humankind ’s thirst for energy is , as always , without bounds .
The twist on the HAL - 9000 computer is sure to make any 2001 fan geek out , and the well - designed lunar living quarters are a marvel of science and style .
All of these elements are used for one purpose–to explore a character .
The story is never left behind , and that ’s how it should be .
2. Surrogates
This is the one on the list that I think might bring me the most flack .
And I understand ; a bleach - blonde Bruce Willis is not always the mark of quality .
For me , though , this makes the list in spite of its traditional thriller elements .
Its concept is just too damn interesting to ignore .
In the future , each and every person has a surrogate self–a machine –that experiences the world exactly as we would and sends signals back to us , all cozied up in bed .
The result is that we experience the world without any danger or pain , but it is n’t really us .
The possible thematic questions this brings up are endless .
What does is mean to “ experience ” something ?
Without danger , is there joy ?
Or true feelings of accomplishment ?
The movie will throw in a standard “ what if it ’s not really safe ” plot , but the trailer definitely hints at an exploration of these complicated ideas .
This one is directed by Jonathan Mastow , director of Terminator 3 .
While a lot of people give that movie flack , I really dug it–especially the last fifteen minutes which really pushed the franchise further by going a direction we did n’t expect and truly furthering the technological ideology of the mythos .
With Mostow at the helm , then , there ’s a good chance we ’ll get smart science - fiction that really understands the unintended repercussions of technology gone wrong .
3. District 9
This one seemed to come out of left field .
While everyone was bustling about the new Transformers movie , Neil Blomkamp was quietly chugging away at this politically - charged opus filled with aliens and alien technology .
The idea is simple : a race of aliens with a busted ship settle down in Johannesburg .
While they say their only desire is to return home , they are still looked on with concern , fear , and hatred .
Can we really let them leave , knowing how advanced they are , technologically ?
Knowing that they might be able to wipe us off the face of the earth if they so desired ?
It ’s a complicated issue about xenophobia and racism , but it looks like the movie goes further than that .
Besides all the cerebral stuff , this one is full of action and ‘ splosions , all captured in a docu- drama way that takes the high - tech and paints it in decidedly third - world tones .
The imagery in this trailer is not quite like any sci - fi we ’ve yet seen .
Here ’s praying the movie holds up when it hits on August 14 .

I know …it ’s annoyingly arrogant to put this one on the list before the masses have seen a single frame of footage .
But when it ’s James Cameron , the director of Aliens and Terminator 2 , returning to sci-fi for the first time in decades , I think we just need to give the man the benefit of the doubt .
The movie , with it ’s cutting - edge 3D IMAX technology , promises to take us to an alien world like we ’ve never seen–a world so harsh for humans that they must send out biological “ avatars ” of themselves in order to mingle with a race of aliens that is facing extinction .
Or at least , that ’s what I can gather from the plot synopses we ’ve seen so far .
The movie has been kept so tightly under wraps that anyone who did n’t read the leaked script a few years back has no idea what this one is about .
And yet it ’s the most - anticipated sci- fi film of next year .
I guess only James Cameron can pull that one off .
If the past is any indication , the movie will be intelligent and well thought - out .
It will be an exploration of the future that refuses to get caught up in its own minutiae and instead focuses on telling a compelling action - filled story .
That ’s the hope at least .
It does n’t hit theaters until the end of this year , so we definitely have a chance to change our minds about this one .
If the response from the footage shown at Comic - Con is any indication , though , this could be something special .
That about wraps it up for me .
Here ’s hoping these movies live up to the great sci - fi films we direct in our own heads .
The other thing to note : none of these are remakes or sequels .
Hollywood grasping for originality ?
Talk about science - fiction !

Barroso Wins Second Term A Victory for the EU's Political Chameleon
The European Parliament voted Wednesday to give Jose Manuel Barroso a second five - year term as president of the European Commission .
But Brussels is getting a weak boss .
The unpopular Portuguese politician has become the butt of jokes , with even allies like Angela Merkel poking fun at him .
AUGUST 20 -- An impromptu photo shoot of a scantily clad waitress holding a police assault rifle has led to the firing of one Texas sheriff 's deputy and the disciplining of four other lawmen .
Earlier this month , a group of Midland County Sheriff 's Office deputies were eating at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Round Rock when they asked a waitress to pose with an AR - 15 rifle on the trunk of their police cruiser .
As seen in the photo at left , the 24 - year - old waitress -- who wore a " Bambi " nametag , short shorts , knee socks , and a revealing t- shirt -- was perched on the trunk of a Midland police cruiser .
The automatic weapon , which had been in the trunk of the marked Ford Crown Victoria , was handed to the waitress by Deputy Daniel Subia , who was fired for his role in the August 10 incident .
Subia and his colleagues were in Williamson County for a " Criminal Interdiction " training class , according to a Round Rock Police Department report .
Though the incident was originally investigated as possible misdemeanor disorderly conduct , no charges were bought against any of the Midland officers .
When Round Rock cops questioned their Midland counterparts about the photo session , two Midland deputies claimed that the waitress " asked to have her picture taken with their weapon , but acknowledged they should not have agreed , " according to the police report .
" Bambi , " however , told investigators that " the Midland deputies asked her to go outside to take pictures of her holding the weapon on their marked unit . " ( 6 pages )
Is your social security number on your passport is one question you must have encountered .
So , since you are here , you will surely figure out the answer .
The passport application is a daunting process .
You are required to provide several documents , all in a bid to prove your real identity .
One of the requirements for passport application or renewal is the social security number ( SSN ) .
It would save you time and make the application process a breeze .
Is your social security number ( SSN ) on your passport ?
Well , your social security number might be required for passport application , but you ca n’t find it on your passport .
What you will find there is your passport number .
If your SSN appears on your passport , regard it as an error and rectify it .
So that is it about SSN appearing on a passport .
However , you can read further to get more useful information about this topic .
Why You Require Social Security Number For Passport Application And Renewal
If you are a U.S citizen planning to travel to another country , whether a nearby or far place , you are going to need a passport .
So , before you step foot out of your apartment with your luggage loaded to the brim , make sure you have your passport ready .
However , passports are not that difficult to obtain .
All you need is to provide relevant details , answer a couple of questions , and wait for the approval .
But keep in mind that not having your social security number can cause a slight delay in your passport approval .
The reason you require an SSN for passport application is not far - fetched .
With that number , the Department of States , which issues passports , will be able to ascertain your identity .
Plus , if you have defaulted in child support , they will figure out .
In a nutshell , every citizen looking to interact more with the government needs to have their social security number on hand .
Is there a way to process a passport without SSN ?
Sure !
There ’s a way out .
Not having a passport can only lengthen the process and cause an avoidable delay .
However , you can still apply for a visa without a social security number and get approved .
If you ’re a U.S citizen without an SSN , you will be required to make available a sworn proof that shows that you have never been issued a social security number in the United States of America before .
That way , you can get your passport approved without delay .
Where You Can Find Your Social Security Number For Your Passport Application
I want you to understand something ; your social security number is n’t on your passport .
What you will find there are the passport number and other information about you .
That is it .
So , if you come across your SSN in such a document , make sure it is corrected .
Having a wrong passport number can also create problems for you .
That is simply an error that government agencies in a different country wo n’t tolerate .
So , ensure you have your passport number and not the SSN on your passport .
However , you have several means to access your social security number .
The first place to look for your social security number is your SSN card .
It ’s a small - sized card that carries your name , signature , and security number .
You will be issued this card after your request for SSN is approved and the number issued .
Plus , your SSN is entirely yours for life .
In other words , once the number is assigned to you , no one can claim or use it for any purpose .
You should also have in mind that no two individuals have the same security number .
You and your siblings do n’t share the same security number .
Again , another place to get your security number is bank statements .
Just check carefully , and you ’ll find it there — your tax return , including the W - 2s form and USCIS forms .
But if you do n’t have a security number and want to file a form , just add “ none ” in the space provided .
Then try to get your security number by all means .
You might think there ’s no need to get one since you are already a citizen , but know that you will require it for something important one day .
The Implication Of Using False Social Security Number For Passport Application Or Renewal
Whether you ’re visiting Canada or Mexico , by car or air , you are going to require a passport to make that trip .
If you do n’t have , you can consider applying for one right away .
If you possess every single document required , your application wo n’t take much time .
However , you might find yourself in a desperate situation to get the passport .
In such a case , you may even want to use force details .
But before making such a decision , ask yourself if it ’s worth it using a social security number that was n’t given to you .
So the bottom line is to avoid the temptation to use an SSN that was never issued to you .
Do not even try to place it on your USCIS forms .
Have in mind that doing so can make it challenging to get a passport .
Your passport application will not only be denied ; you may face jail time for that .
Restoring Your Stolen And Lost Social Security Number
You should store your social security number in your head in case the unexpected happens .
You can misplace your social security card at any point in time .
But when you know the digits , you will not be bothered by anything .
Presenting a social security card that bears your name and SSN offers some prestige .
However , all you need is just the number , not the card .
What the State Department processing your passport need is just your SSN .
If you can provide it even without the card , then you are good to go .
But if you ca n’t find your social security card and also do n’t remember your SSN , you can apply for a replacement .
All you need to get this done is to visit the website of the social security administration in the United States of America .
Is there a fee to process a replacement or stolen social security number ?
The answer is no !
The service is entirely free .
Again , most individuals will make use of the same SSN throughout their existence on earth , while some might have to apply for changes in cases of identity theft .
Why The Social Security Number Is Important For Everyone
You might be wondering what a mere nine - digit number can do .
Why will it be of any importance when you have other means of identification ?
If this is what you have in mind , please note that the social security number is essential .
The government of the United States issues it to citizens , including residents who are eligible to have one .
If you need a social security number , all you need to do is start the application process .
Provided you are eligible ; you will receive your social security number in no time .
SSN is highly relevant for citizens and residents who wish to have several interactions with the government .
It is one of the means of identification that will be demanded from you , now and then .
In addition to passport application or renewal , SSN is used by the government to track one ’s lifetime earnings , including the years you may have worked .
Whenever you retire , the government will use the information regarding your contribution to social security for calculation involving your benefit payment .
Other things will require you to present your social security number .
If you do n’t have one , you might be denied access to such services .
Check them out below to make an informed decision .
Federal loan application
If you are thinking of initiating a federal loan application , ensure you have your social security number .
The government would need your SSN to ascertain whether you are eligible for the loan or not .
On your part , ensure you have n’t defaulted in another federal student loan .
Otherwise , your application will be denied .
Tax Return
Your social security number is significant to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) .
The agency would match it with the income you provided when filing the tax return to what your financial institution or employer claims to have paid you .
Driver ’s license application
A non-citizen can apply for a license without an SSN .
But if you are a citizen , you need to provide your social security number while applying for a driver ’s license .
Conclusion
Is your social security number on your passport is a valid question .
However , the answer is no !
You ca n’t find such a piece of valuable information on your passport .
SSN is an identification number that one needs to guide jealously .
Ensure it does n’t get to the wrong person .
Otherwise , you might have serious problems arising from identity theft that will take years to clean up .
So , know when and where your social security number is highly needed .
If there ’s a request for your SSN in a form , find out if you can leave the space blank .
Do not be in haste to provide your social security number .

Is A Degree In Political Science Worth It ?
At some odd point in my relationship , my girlfriend started paying for things in blowjobs .
It started out innocently enough .
She was working on a sitcom spec and needed some sample scripts from a show .
I tracked down a few , and she responded that she owed me two blowjobs .
Never one to turn down a hummer ( well , that 's not true -- I did once tell my Alzheimer 's - suffering grandmother that I was n't interested ) , she quickly offered a certain number of blowjobs for tasks she could n't or would n't do .
Something small like helping her put some boxes on a high shelf might net one Slurpee , while a more time - consuming or arduous task like degreasing our microwave could be worth seven suckdowns .
Just prior to WWII , in Weimar Germany , the deutschmark became so devalued that it cost millions to purchase a loaf of bread .
People wallpapered their houses with the almost - worthless notes .
Similarly , I now have to park a wheelbarrow full of BJ bucks ( $ BJ ) next to our bed to get an actual weiner - hoovering .
In economics , this situation is called hyperinflation .
Under hyperinflation , real money has almost no real value .
The economy becomes completely destabilized .
And because money is backed by Fiat now ( basically the word of the government that it intends to honor the notes and the value they represent ) rather than something tangible like gold , people lose faith in their government .
It happened in Germany , leading to the rise of the Nazis and Adolph Hitler .
I can't be responsible for the resurgence of National Socialism in our apartment ; the Jews here have it tough enough already .
So , my fellow Americans , we need to act now .
I am calling upon my girlfriend for a federal bailout .
We have to save the blowjob bank before it goes under and destroys my faith in our apartment 's solvency .
That is why I am proposing the following bill : all blowjob coupons may be redeemed at a rate of one blowjob per coupon from now until the end of the year .
I realize that that 's a lot of blowjobs and could get tiring .
Nobody wants a sprained tongue or a case of athlete 's jaw .
Which is why my bill contains this provision : blowjob coupons may be consolidated into either a sex note at the rate of $ 5 BJ per fucking ; an anal sex certificate at the rate of ten $ 10 BJ per poopchute - pounding ; or a threesome with the cute friend from her grad program at a rate of twenty $ 20 BJ per menage - a- trois .
I am sure in this way , we will be able to keep our apartment 's economy churning .
It is the lifeblood of our country .
God bless America !
No , I ’m not being over - dramatic .
It is time to buckle the heck up .
The resonant disconnect between reality and the pumping that is going on in the media and among supposed “ experts ” is at an all time historic , never been here before , Economic Mass Psychosis , HIGH .
To Quote John Kenneth Galbraith , Right now the majority believe we are exiting the crisis .
They are just plain old fashioned WRONG – again .
To prove my point , I ’m going to show you the week in charts courtesy of the St. Louis Fed .
This week , however , I ’m issuing a WARNING .
The evidence in these charts points to the beginning of a DEFLATIONARY SPIRAL .
The PPI data comes out next week and will be a key piece of evidence in this regard .
The results of a deflationary spiral will be UGLY if entered .
You will see another round of deleveraging to go with locked credit markets .
Equities will get hammered and the real cleansing of the economy will accelerate .
This process will be PAINFUL but necessary to end the malinvestment .
It will be the phase where more businesses who were hanging on HOPING for recovery will simply run out of cashflow to maintain operations .
The same thing is necessary to cleanse a way over - bloated government and military .
The fallout will affect everyone .
These charts are HISTORIC , they are NOT indicative of a short recession .
As you view these charts , pay attention to the negative trends and look at them from a historic perspective .
Many market callers are looking for immediate inflation due to the money pumping .
I challenge them to point out inflation anywhere in these charts besides the money aggregates , which , by the way , are not growing at the rate they were .
Those who look solely at the money aggregates are not seeing the destruction of credit which is very real and has hobbled the consumer .
Never ending growth was a fantasy and is over for the time being , there is simply too much debt / credit in the system .
The pundits of green shoots will say that the economy is getting better and that the leading indicators are pointing to a dramatic recovery .
THEY ARE WRONG .
They were wrong in 2007 and they are wrong now .
The one and only TRUE LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATOR in a debt riddled society is DEBT to INCOME .
That ratio has not improved , it is worse than ever , especially at the governmental level .
Since I am talking about inflation and deflation , I think it ’s important to reiterate that most people think of inflation as an increase in PRICES and Deflation as a decrease in PRICES .
True inflation or deflation is the increase or decrease in the money AND CREDIT SUPPLY .
Prices follow but do give an indirect indication of money / credit supply over time when looked at in AGGREGATE .
What has fooled so many in the current economy is BAD DATA REPORTING and a SHADOW CREDIT SYSTEM that produced UNREGULATED AND UNTRACKED out - of - control credit ( DEBT ) .
To create more growth , the COMBINED credit and money aggregates , whether they are tracked or not , must increase in total .
That is not happening , and that is why you see negative growth .
FORGET ABOUT GOVERNMENT GROWTH FIGURES , they are so far from reality as to be laughable – they are NOT credible .
The same can be said for inflation statistics , but they are pointing to a trend and they are not positive .
All of the charts below are current and have been updated THIS WEEK or are annotated otherwise .
Let ’s begin with charts of pertinent economic releases and then we will move on and examine the current issue of Monetary Trends ... Consumer Sentiment was released Friday and came in well below estimates at 63.2 .
The chart below is the only one presented that was not updated , but I show where that current level is .
Consumers represent over 70 % of the economy .
As pointed out previously , people are falling off the back of the unemployment rolls and are not being captured in that data .
It ’s hard to be optimistic on the economy when you are unemployed .
It ’s also difficult to pay more and more in terms of price when your income is either gone or under pressure .
Low Consumer Sentiment , high levels of debt , and diminished access to credit all comprise the psychological foundation for price deflation :
And how are PRICES behaving ?
Below is a chart showing BOTH import and export PRICES .
The fed does not produce this particular chart , it comes from Econoday .
This is a HISTORIC collapse of prices , IMPORT PRICES ( watch the scale on the left versus the right ) are DOWN 19.3 % year over year ( yoy ) !
Think about that , it is HISTORIC .
Import prices down nearly 20 % in just one year ?!!
The trend is not turning , it is accelerating downward again .
Export prices are down dramatically too , but pale in comparison .
Next is the current chart of the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) .
It has not been this negative in the past 59 years !
Do you see PRICE inflation there ?
Let ’s see what the PPI says next week .
By the way , why would the CPI number only be down a little more than 2 % when import prices are down 10 times as much and export prices are down 4 times as much ?
Think there ’s a disconnect there ?
There is , and it ’s induced by our own government statistics :
So , those are PRICES .
Why do prices go down ?
Remember supply and demand … not enough demand and way too much supply .
Let ’s take a look at retail sales expressed in yoy percent change …
Here you ’ll see a collapse of historic proportions in demand :
When demand drops domestically , imports drop .
Never before , and likely never again , will you see such a historic plunge of imports .
This is no ordinary recession :
At the beginning of this crisis many “ experts ” said that demand would continue to increase from overseas and that would help offset a slowdown in the U.S. , remember ?
How did that work out ?
“ Deficits do n’t matter , ” remember that one too ?
Well , we were running a trade deficit over $ 60 billion a month .
At the time I warned that it was not sustainable as it could not be financed at that rate forever .
Now the balance of trade is swinging rapidly back , but is still way out of balance .
The rate of change is also historic any way you want to measure it :
Now let ’s turn our attention back inside the U.S. .
Here is a chart of inventories expressed in yoy percent change .
Falling business inventories are actually a good thing as businesses are reacting to falling demand .
Take a look , though , at when this recession actually began versus when inventories began to fall and compare it to the last recession .
Is the contraction over ?
Would you bet on it ?
Now let ’s turn our attention to what remains of the manufacturing sector .
Remember that employment in that sector of our economy is now the same size as it was in 1947 and , quite unfortunately , is a much smaller percentage of the economy ( for a complete update on employment , please see Employment Situation in Chart Form – Damn , I knew I should have moved to New York and found a job on Wall Street ! ) .
Capacity Utilization is at an all time low on the following chart and is still pointing straight down : Non-durable goods manufacturing has plummeted and has not begun to recover significantly : Durable goods manufacturing is down twice as much in percentage terms and likewise is not recovering significantly :
Now look at the effect on the index of manufacturing hours worked :
And just to be clear about it , manufacturing output is down 15 % on a year over year basis , again simply historic :
Okay , so that ’s what ’s happening in the REAL world of sales , export , imports , and manufacturing .
What ’s going on in the supply of money and credit ?
Well , now that we pay banks for “ reserves ” ( and lend real dollars against worthless toxic assets ) , bank “ excess reserves ” ( Nate says no such thing in reality ) are sky high and up nearly 8,000 % on a year over year basis !
The latest report for M2 ( week ending August 3rd ) showed a DECREASE of approximately $ 42 billion .
Still way up yoy , it is no longer accelerating higher :
Same comments for the more broad money aggregate , MZM : Last week we saw that consumer credit is actually negative .
Credit is MUCH LARGER than REAL MONEY .
Yes , those aggregates measure credit that ’s been deposited into financial institutions , but they do not measure credit derivatives that allow the banks to leverage debt to the hilt .
Now let ’s review the latest issue of Monetary Trends , again courtesy of the St. Louis Fed : Note on the chart below that M1 , M2 , and MZM are all higher , but that trend higher has turned recently .
Again , keep in mind that credit growth is negative :
On page 5 we find that the adjusted monetary base has been forced sky high , but the recent trend up has stopped .
You will also then see FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEBT has absolutely skyrocketed , and that currency and time deposits are slowing their rates of growth , and that retail money market shares are negative .
Below are the money aggregates again , this time presented in percent change at an annual rate .
Note that MZM and M2 are NEGATIVE and that M1 is nearly so : Next take a look at page 7 .
Here you will see that everything dealing with credit is in sharp decline .
Look closely at the total borrowings chart expressed in Billions !
It went from over $ 400 billion to just over $ 100 billion , nearly a 75 % plunge .
Commercial Paper – down nearly 25 % !
Consumer credit – negative : Next , please take a hard look at this chart showing actual CPI that I outlined with a vertical red rectangle ( vertical plunge ) and compare that to the EXPECTATIONS of inflation .
You will see that those who have been forecasting inflation are simply WRONG : Next , take a look at the velocity : Finally , take a look at Monetary base VELOCITY GROWTH .
It is down 75 % !
Again , this shows that when the system is saturated with debt , you can pump all the money you want into the system , but it goes nowhere .
Why ?
Because current income cannot service current debt much less more future debt , that ’s why :
That ’s a pretty clear picture to me , one of DEFLATION at work .
It is accelerating , not decelerating .
That is a HUGE divergence from what ’s occurring in the equity markets and from what you hear on television from the supposed experts .
I think we are on the precipice of a self - reinforcing deflationary spiral .
The data is historic .
The disconnect between the data and perception is historic .
The Fed is attempting to do a magic trick by printing their way out of debt – it ’s a trick that has NEVER worked throughout the history of mankind and will not work to create real growth now .
Debt is the ball , keep your eye on it and you ’ll see through the Fed ’s attempted magic trick and slight of hand !

Steve Miller Band – Abracadabra :
by ¡El Gato Negro !
Now that the Baucus caucus has finally loosed its debaucus debacle of a reform bill , it seems the rightmost boundary of the debate ( among those pushing for a health insurance reform bill to pass ) has been set .
I 'm not going to revisit the awfulness of that bill , here .
There are so many other , better , bloggers ( including on this very site ) covering the many , many ways that the Baucus bill 's proposed plans would make the healthcare situation worse .
No , I 'd like to use this space to offer up an idea for a 30 second spot , which I believe could have a firming effect on the Democratic party 's more recalcitrant blue - state senators .
It goes like this :
Fade - in on a scene of a politician 's office , currently empty .
The camera zooms in on the abandoned store - front and the tune " Happy Days Are Here Again " rises in the background .
[- Voice Over : " Hey Democrats , the 2010 elections are coming up . " ]
The scene switches to the receptionists office , also empty .
A phone is heard ringing in the distant background .
The music continues , although we notice that it seems to be slowing , as if the song were playing on an old record player that 's winding down .
[- Voice Over : " We hope that , during the campaign season , you ’ll remember way back in 2009 when you gave away any chance of real healthcare reform to your buddies in the insurance industry , and stuck America with a mandate to buy inadequate health insurance coverage at inflated rates . " ]
The scene shifts again , to a campaign phone bank , the camera pans across the rows of empty chairs and unmanned phones .
Then shifts to another scene of the empty campaign headquarters .
If possible I 'd like to use a photo or film of thousands of campaign flyers and doorhangers , sitting around unused , or even thrown in the trash .
[- Voice Over : " We hope that you remember when you made backroom deals with Blue Cross , Aetna and the drug manufacturers that ensured more Americans would be forced into bankruptcy because of illness , or even die , because some insurance company bureaucrat would rather make his bonus for the year , than pay for their claims . ” ]
Then we move on to election night , the camera pans across a mostly empty banquet hall , and a mostly empty campaign rally .
A politician is speaking , but his voice is almost inaudible in the echoing reverb of the unattended event , and seems very far away .
Nearer by you hear a broom sweeping , and a garbage truck , driving off into the night .
( Fade out )
[- Voice Over : " We hope that you ’ll remember , because we sure will . " ]
( Maybe show a quick poll result here , highlighting the continual favorable results for the public option , or even single payer )
CHYRON : Progressives agree with 72 % of America .
We need a public option .
The last shot is of the original abandoned storefront headquarters that we saw in the opening , the camera zooms out , and perhaps the music resumes its earlier , jaunty rhythym .
[ Voice Over : Just a little reminder from the millions of progressive democrats who worked the phones and knocked on doors and donated their money to help put you in office . " ]
That 's the Ad I 'd like to see on the air before any bill gets near the president 's desk .
I am open to suggestions on how to improve on the script and clarify the message .
I 'm also seeking any good pictures readers may have of mostly empty campaign events and other scenes of abandoned political venues .
I 'm not against accepting funding except that I am uncertain if I can get enough to produce it in time .
Currently I 'm working on a youtube video , a motion - storyboard version of the script you just read .
Suggestions ?
Ideas ?

Update : Now with new improved bleaker visual tone
I do n’t know what has gone wrong in America , but something has .
And it has to do with how people think or more accurately , the lack of thinking .
Maybe it is a mental health issue ; if not already , it could soon become one .
When I was a little kid , the few times I did something overly stupid , my mom would say to me , “ Why do n’t you use your God - given common sense ? ”
That is the question I ask all of our government departments and corporations today .
" The computer is wrong and I ca n’t change that . " - " Sorry sir , but that ’s the rules .
I am following the rules and there 's nothing you or I can do about it . "
We have all heard those phrases before , and now it is almost a daily occurrence .
Today on the radio business news I heard a story that told it all .
A gentleman walked into a bank to have his check cashed .
The teller told him he needed to give his thumbprint before they would cash his check .
That is a normal procedure today .
There was a problem and here is where the epidemic in America showed itself in full force .
This gentleman was a disabled American Veteran and had lost both his arms so he could n’t submit to the bank teller ’s request .
The teller told him that without a thumbprint , they could n’t cash his check ; those were the rules and nothing they or he could do about it .
After a great deal of hassling and stress , the bank finally agreed to cash his check .
No thinking of a solution , no thinking outside the box , no common sense , just following the rules and no thinking .
A 15 - year - old girl goes to school and has a Tylenol with her .
She is detained and the police and her parents are called .
She is investigated and labeled as a possible drug user and on top of that she is suspended .
No thinking and no common sense .
This is the epidemic in America with all its glory : loss of common sense and actual thinking .
Zero tolerance is another phrase that actually means no thinking , no common sense .
In Colorado , a high school student was suspended for bringing a fake rifle to school .
It was left in her car and someone saw it and then all loss of common sense broke out .
At first this could have been a problem , as everyone remembers Columbine .
But it was soon found out she was a member of the Young Marines Organization at Cherokee Trail High School and left it in her car .
She was suspended and it practically took an act of congress to get her back into school .
They not only wanted to suspend her , but expel her as well , in her senior year .
No thinking , no common sense , just follow the rules and be done with it .
One more example of the epidemic in America , a friend of mine was trying to settle an estate and those can be tough enough .
Part of the estate was a manufactured home - a mobile home - and he had to get the title to it .
In many states a mobile home is titled through the department of motor vehicles , not the normal way a house is , even though most mobile homes are actually cemented in the ground and not going anywhere .
In 1994 , congress passed a law called the Driver Protection Act .
This law was enacted because an actress was killed by a stalker in Los Angeles , a good and needed law .
The person trying to get title to his mother ’s mobile home was denied the copy of the title because he did n’t show good enough cause to find out who the new driver of this vehicle ( house ) is .
Try to tell someone afflicted with this loss of common sense that there is no driver of a manufactured mobile home .
Of course , property records are open to the public on the Internet , and anyone can see who owned , who bought and currently owns any property , but the loss of common sense told the clerk to deny the request because of the Driver Protection Act .
The Department of Revenue Motor Vehicle division once again has proven that the loss of common sense is epidemic in America , especially at the government and corporate levels .
Following the rules has become the cop-out of the day , the rationalization for the loss of all common sense .
This used to be called “ passing the buck ” .
President Truman had a sign on his desk that read “ The buck stops here ” .
No more excuses and no more passing the buck .
Today there is no " buck stops here " because there is no " here " .
There is no one to ask or talk to , and the " here " is the rulebook .
And no one knows who wrote the rulebook .
Yes , we are a country of rules and rules should be followed ; but whatever happened to using common sense ?
We are becoming a country of automatons , a person that acts in a monotonous , routine manner , without active intelligence .
The loss of others using their minds is causing the rest of us to lose our minds .
If we are ever to become a great country again , we need to start thinking and using our common sense again .

Venezuela has announced a $ 16bn ( £ 10 bn ) investment deal with China for oil exploration in the Orinoco river .
The move comes shortly after Venezuela signed a similar agreement with Russia , which is estimated to be $ 20 bn ( £ 12bn ) .
President Hugo Chavez said the deals would boost oil production in Venezuela by about 900,000 barrels per day .
Investors in Venezuela 's oil industry have complained for months that a lack of government investment in infrastructure has hurt production .
Multi-polar world
Speaking on state television , Mr Chavez said the deal with China was over three years and that the investment would go towards developing heavy crude oil resources in the Orinoco River belt .
For President Chavez it is part of a wider effort to increase his base of bilateral partners in the oil industry .
The socialist leader often speaks of what he calls a " multi- polar world " in which Latin American countries are less dependent on Washington .
However , US companies and the US government are still the mainstay of the Venezuelan energy industry .
The Venezuelan leader will hope that these multibillion dollar deals , signed with countries which are more friendly to his " 21st Century Socialist Revolution " , will give him further economic independence from Washington .
BOSTON — At the Group of 20 summit in Pittsburgh , President Barack Obama locked arms with the leaders of France and the United Kingdom to warn Iran that it must immediately halt its nuclear program .
Obama accused Iran of building a secret nuclear fuel plant in violation of the U.N. - mandated oversight and said that Tehran had posed a “ direct challenge ” to the international community .
In the city of bridges , Obama essentially threatened Iran that it has just burned one too many with the international community .
But in choosing to do so on the public stage of Pittsburgh ’s G20 summit with all the world ’s media watching and looking for any story more interesting than a long - winded communique on the economy , Obama was essentially doing what he does best .
That is , public diplomacy .
And , as always , his tone is pretty close to perfect .
He sounded firm , convincing and respectfully multilateral , and that tone goes a long way to swooning the world .
It gets people around the globe to believe that the real America is rational and a natural leader in a dangerous world .
This is a decidedly different image from the unilateral and seemingly belligerent America put forward by President George W. Bush .
But former diplomats and Middle East analysts believe Obama will need more than perfect pitch in the public diplomacy of Iran , which interlocks directly with the profound policy challenges on Afghanistan , Iraq and the wider goal of global nuclear non-proliferation .
This is chess on many levels , not pop music .
To succeed in bringing Iran to halt its nuclear program and conform with the U.N. watchdog on nuclear proliferation , he will have to do the much harder diplomatic work of bringing China and Russia fully on board .
That wo n’t be easy as China and Russia do not believe sanctions will work , and as closer neighbors to Iran they have practical economic interests in Iran .
If Obama does not accomplish that real diplomacy , the confrontation of words with Iran will turn into a stand - off .
And , if history is a judge , Iran will ultimately wait that out .
In neighboring Iraq , Saddam Hussein did just that for many years at the turn of this decade .
In the mid- to late - 1990s , Saddam played the cat - and - mouse game with the U.N. inspectors .
And it is sobering to remember that that game along with the events of Sept. 11 served as a triggering mechanism for Bush ’s flawed and ill - fated invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
The U.S. - led offensive toppled Saddam ’s brutal regime and ended all questions — real or fabricated — of weapons of mass destruction there , yes , but it also dragged the U.S. into a conflict where it has paid heavily in “ blood and treasure , ” as they say in the military .
Obama accused Iran of “ breaking the rules that all nations must follow ” and demanded that U.N. inspectors must immediately be permitted to inspect the nuclear facility .
“ It is time for Iran to act immediately to restore confidence of the international community by fulfilling its international obligations , ” Obama said .
Tehran apparently tried to preempt this steely determination on the part of Washington , London and Paris by communicating with the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency that it had a second uranium enrichment plan under construction .
But few were buying it .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Iran was going down a “ dangerous ” path and threatened stepped - up sanctions on Iran if it did not comply .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that Iran ’s violation of the International Atomic Energy Agency ’s regulations should stiffen the resolve of the international community to draw “ a line in the sand ” against Tehran .
But there are many who questions whether even sanctions will work with Iran .
William Luers , a 30 - year career diplomat for the U.S. State Department who served in several postings as ambassador and recently stepped down as president of the United Nations Association , has joined with other top former ambassadors to urge dialogue with Iran .
Luers is the author of a recent memo on Iran for the White House and Thursday night he attended a dinner along with several dozen former diplomats and analysts with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“ He is a dreadful person , but he was unusually agreeable last night , ” said Luers , hastening to add , “ What we know this morning casts new light on his gentility . ”
But even if Ahmadenijad seems to go out of his way to make it difficult for Obama to stick to his previously stated willingness to open dialogue with Iran , Luers and other diplomats believe the Obama administration , in the long run , is wise to go with that initial instinct .
“ No matter what problems we have with an enemy , you have got to talk with them , ” said Luers , who is now a visiting lecturer at Tufts University for the Project on Justice in Times of Transition .
Not so much for altruistic reasons , he says , but because it is the only practical path forward .
The most difficult foreign policy challenges this administration faces are Afghanistan , Iraq and nuclear proliferation .
And all three have one thing in common : Iran .
It neighbors both Iraq and Afghanistan and it clearly needs to come into the fold of the international community on its nuclear program .
“ We think sanctions will not achieve the ends of getting Iran to change its behavior .
And the idea of using military force , the ultimate sanction , is a very dangerous path .
We simply do not have the ability to open a new front in the Middle East . ”
“ To open dialogue with Iran is a big leap for Americans , ” said Luers , and after the events of this morning it ’s understandable if it seems to Americans like a jump off a bridge .
But , he added , Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will need to step up the administration ’s diplomatic game .
They will have to do the long math on engagement with Iran and the hard work of solving an intricate equation in which Iran is a variable for the most serious foreign policy issues the U.S. faces .
Editor 's note :
This column has been updated to reflect the fact that Obama is working toward a wider goal of nuclear non-proliferation .

WITHOUT the right planning , Ballarat 's population growth could outstrip jobs and services in the city .
The Committee for Ballarat issued the warning in a document outlining its vision for the Ballarat West Growth Zone .
The area on the city 's western fringe has been slated as as the hub of residential growth in Ballarat over the next 30 years .
But the committee 's chief executive officer Doug Lloyd said urgent economic development planning of the area is needed to keep pace with the expected stream of new residents in coming decades .
Mr Lloyd said projected population increases for Ballarat may understate the city 's actual growth , due mainly to its proximity to Melbourne .
" There is a risk that our population growth will outstrip the region 's capacity to fund appropriate social development and community services , " Mr Lloyd said .
To meet the needs of an expanding population , strong economic activity in the zone is essential and social and community wellbeing are prime considerations .
" Residential development will encompass sustainable design and living principles , and population growth will be designed to have low or zero impact on the region 's sustainability . "
To achieve the vision , Mr Lloyd said the committee wanted to see development in the area fast - tracked .
That would require the planned Western Link Road and the Ballarat West Employment Zone to be given priority .
"
The road link will create local city transport links and new inter-regional opportunities .
The employment zone will be an early way to create substantial new sustainable employment opportunities , " Mr Lloyd said .
We like to avail ourselves of the Freedom of Information of Act now and again , because sometimes we find FBI memos about how the Green Party is a terrorist organization because we do n't get too many libruls here in Georgia .
Asked by the FBI 's counterterrorism division to assess " future targets of the animal and environmental rights movements and / or those committing crimes on the behalf of the movements in the Georgia area , " some poor local FBI agent complained that he or she would have a little trouble with that one , seeing as how " the animal rights , environmental and anarchy movement activity is relatively low " because " Georgia residents lean toward the views of a conservative nature " and do n't offer a " nurturing environment " for libruls .
The 2005 memo is in a bunch of documents we FOIA'd a while back about Cold Sun , the FBI 's major - case investigation into the Animal Liberation Front and other animal - rights extremist groups .
The agency sent a couple hundred pages , which we 're just starting to go through .
The agent had to write something , so he looked up the Green Party on Wikipedia and identified them as a terrorist group .
Of particular interest to to the agent was a Green Party members ' writings on " marijuana reform , reparations , civil unions , repeal of the Patriot Act , and homosexual issues . "
Keep in mind that this is from a memo that was distributed to the FBI 's Weapons of Mass Destruction and Domestic Terrorism Operations Units ( see the cover sheet below ) , which is evidently who investigates people in Georgia who advocate the repeal of the Patriot Act or talk about homosexuals .
Read the whole memo here .
Few technology and device - making companies probably realize it , but they are in direct competition with Apple ( or soon will be ) .
How did this happen ?
Well , the iPhone1 does a lot of useful things pretty well , well enough that it is replacing several specialized devices that do one or two things really well .
Space in backpacks , pockets , and purses is a finite resource , as is money ( obviously ) .
As a result , many are opting to carry only the iPhone with them when they might have toted several devices around .
Here is a short list of devices with capabilities duplicated to some degree by the iPhone :
Mobile phone -
All the stuff any mobile phone does : phone calls , texting , voicemail .
PDA - The iPhone meets all of the basic PDA needs : address book , calendar , to - dos , notes , and easy data syncing .
i Pod -
The iPhone is a full - featured music - playing device .
And with 32 GB of storage , the 3GS can handle a huge chunk of even the largest music collection .
Point and shoot camera -
While not as full - featured as something like a PowerShot , the camera on the iPhone 3GS has a 3 - megapxiel lens with both auto and manual focus , shoots in low - light , does macro , and can shoot video .
Plus , it ’s easy to instantly publish your photos online using the iPhone ’s networking capabilities and automatically tag your photos with your location .
Personal computer - With the increased speed of the iPhone 3GS , the 3G and wifi networking , a real web browser , and the wide array of available apps at the App Store , many people find themselves leaving the laptops at home and using the iPhone as their main computer when they are out and about .
Nintendo DS or PSP -
There are thousands of games available at the App Store and if the folks in my office and on the NYC subway are any indication , people are using their iPhones as serious on - the - go gaming machines .
GPS - With geolocation by GPS , wifi , or cell tower , the Google Maps app , and the built - in compass , the iPhone is a powerful wayfinding device .
Apps can provide turn by turn directions , current traffic conditions , satellite and photographic street views , transit information , and you can search for addresses and businesses .
Flip video camera -
The iPhone 3GS does n’t shoot in HD ( yet ) , but the video capabilities on the phone are quite good , especially the on - phone editing and easy sharing .
Compass - Serious hikers and campers would n’t want to rely on a battery - powered device as their only compass , but the built - in compass on the iPhone 3GS is perfect for casual wayfinding .
Watch - I use the clock on my iPhone more often than any other function .
By far .
Portable DVD player - Widescreen video looks great on the iPhone , you can d/l videos and TV shows from the iTunes Store , and with apps like Handbrake , it ’s easy to rip DVDs for viewing on the iPhone .
Kindle - Amazon ’s Kindle app for the iPhone is surprisingly usable .
And unlike Amazon ’s hardware , the iPhone can run many ebook readers that handle several different formats .
With all the apps available at the App Store , the list goes on : pedometer , tape recorder , heart monitor , calculator , remote control , USB key , and on and on .
Electronic devices are n’t even the whole story .
I used to carry a folding map of Manhattan ( and the subway ) with me wherever I went but not anymore .
With Safari , Instapaper , and Amazon ’s Kindle app , books and magazines are n’t necessary to provide on - the - go reading material .
Once someone has an iPhone , it is going to be tough to persuade them that they also need to spend money on and carry around a dedicated GPS device , point - and - shoot camera , or tape recorder unless they have an unusual need .
But the real problem for other device manufacturers is that all of these iPhone features — particularly the always - on internet connectivity ; the email , HTTP , and SMS capabilities ; and the GPS / location features — can work in concert with each other to actually make better versions of the devices listed above .
Like a GPS that automatically takes photos of where you are and posts them to a Flickr gallery or a video camera that ’ll email videos to your mom or a portable gaming machine with access to thousands of free games over your mobile ’s phone network .
We tend to forget that the iPhone is still from the future in a way that most of the other devices on the list above are n’t .
It will take time for device makers to make up that difference .
If these manufacturers do n’t know they are in competition with the iPhone , Apple sure does .
At their Rock & Roll event last week , MacWorld quotes Phil Schiller as saying :
i Pod touch is also a great game machine .
No multi - touch interface on other devices , games are expensive , there ’s no app store , and there ’s no iPod built in .
Plus it ’s easier to buy stuff because of the App Store on the device .
Chart of game and entertainment titles available on PSP , Nintendo DS , and iPhone OS .
PSP : 607 . Nintendo DS : 3680 .
i Phone : 21,178 .
The same applies to the iPhone .
At the same event , Steve Jobs commented that with the new iPod nano , you essentially get a $ 149 Flip video camera thrown in for free :
We ’re going to start off with an 8 GB unit , and we ’re going to lower the price from $ 149 to free .
This is the new Apple , is n’t it ?
( laughter )
How are we going to do that .
We ’re going to build a video camera into the new iPod nano .
On the back of each unit is a video camera and a microphone , and there ’s a speaker inside as well .
Built into every iPod nano is now an awesome video camera .
And yet we ’ve still retained its incredibly small size .
In discussing the Kindle with David Pogue , Jobs even knocks the idea of specialized devices :
“ I ’m sure there will always be dedicated devices , and they may have a few advantages in doing just one thing , ” he said .
“ But I think the general - purpose devices will win the day .
Because I think people just probably are n’t willing to pay for a dedicated device . ”
In terms of this competition , the iPhone at this point in its lifetime2 is analogous to the internet in the late 1990s .
The internet was pretty obviously in competition with a few obvious industries at that point — like meatspace book stores — but caught ( and is still catching ) others off guard : cable TV , movie companies , music companies , FedEx / USPS / UPS , movie theaters , desktop software makers , book publishers , magazine publishers , shoe / apparel stores , newspaper publishers , video game console makers , libraries , grocery stores , real estate agents , etc. etc…. basically any organization offering entertainment or information .
The internet is still the ultimate “ there ’s an app for that ” engine ; it duplicated some of the capabilities of and drew attention away from so many products and services that these businesses offered .
Some of these companies are dying — slowly or otherwise — while others were able to adapt and adopt quickly enough to survive and even thrive .
It ’ll be interesting to see which of the iPhone ’s competitors will be able to do the same .

In this essay , I ’m using “ the iPhone ” as a convenient shorthand for “ any of a number of devices and smartphones that offer similar functionality to the iPhone , including but not limited to the Palm Pre , Android phones , Blackberry Storm , and iPod Touch ” .
Similar arguments apply , to varying degrees , to these devices and their manufacturers but are especially relevant to the iPhone and Apple ; hence , the shorthand .
If you do n’t read this footnote , adequately absorb its message , and send me email to the effect of “ the iPhone sux because Apple and AT&T are monopolistic robber barons ” , I reserve the right to punch you in the face while yelling I WASN ’T JUST TALKING ABOUT THE IPHONE YOU JACKASS . ↩

You ’ve got to wonder when Apple is going to change the name of the iPhone .
The phone part of the device increasingly seems like an afterthought , not the main attraction .
The main benefit of the device is that it does everything .
How do you choose a name for the device that has everything ?
Hell if I know .
But as far as the timing goes , I ’d guess that the name change will happen with next year ’s introduction of the new model .
The current progression of names — iPhone , iPhone 3G , iPhone 3GS — has nowhere else to go ( iPhone 3GS Plus is n’t Apple ’s style ) . ↩
Update :
The console makers are worried about mobile phone gaming platforms .

Blackwater 's Unwritten Death Contract Hats off to Mark Mazzetti of the New York Times for reporting that it was after CIA Director Leon Panetta ’s holdover lieutenants finally told him that , under President Bush , they had farmed out assassinations to their Blackwater subsidiary , that he abruptly stopped the project and told Congress .
Email
Printer friendly I use “ they ” advisedly , since the CIA officials who had kept Panetta in the dark continue to function as Panetta ’s top managers at the agency .
Until now , it was not clear what prompted Panetta to set up hurried consultations in late June with the intelligence oversight committees of the House and Senate .
And an odd odor still hangs over the affair .
After being briefed by Panetta , one committee member described him as “ stunned ” that his lingering lieutenants had kept information on the program from him until nearly five months into his tenure .
And yet there is not the faintest hint that anyone on either committee dared to ask why Panetta continues to leave such tainted officials in very senior positions .
Mazzetti quotes officials as admitting that “ the C.I.A. did not have a formal contract with Blackwater ” for a program with “ lethal ” authority .
What Mazzetti does not mention — and what he , like the vast majority of Americans , may not know — is that there is a one - sentence umbrella “ contract ” available for use as authorization for such activities .
It is a legal loophole of sorts , through which Bush and Cheney drove a Mack truck .
Bush administration lawyers were not the first to read considerable leeway into that loophole — one sentence in the language of the National Security Act of 1947 .
The sentence can be ( ab)used as authorization for all manner of crimes — irrespective of existing law or executive order .
A Cheney - esque “ unitary executive ” perspective and a dismissive attitude toward lawmakers reinforced George W. Bush ’s predilection to exploit this ambiguous language , taking it further than it had ever been taken in the past .
The Act ( as slightly amended ) stipulates that the CIA Director shall : “ Perform such functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the President or the National Security Council may from time to time direct . ”
There ’s the “ umbrella contract . ”
While more than one past President ( I served under seven during my tenure at CIA ) has taken advantage of that open language , the Bush administration translated the dodging into a new art form .
This , in turn , was sustained by Frankenstein cottage industries like Blackwater to launch and operate the administration ’s own Gestapo .
I use the word advisedly ; do not blanch before it .
As for outsourcing , the Nazi Gestapo enjoyed umbrella authorization from the Fuhrer ; they and the SS knew what was wanted , and famously “ followed orders . ”
There was absolutely no need to go back to supreme authority for approval to contract out some of their work .
German legislators turned out to be even more intimidated than ours — if you can imagine it .
Charlatans Can Apply …and Stay
As for an American President ’s freedom of action , all a President need do is surround himself with eager co-conspirators like the sycophant former Director of Central Intelligence , George Tenet , ( not to mention his , and Panetta ’s , lingering lieutenants ) who give allegiance to their secret world of unchecked power , rather than to the Constitution of the United States .
True , a Vice President thoroughly versed in using the levers of power can be a valuable asset .
But the sine quo non for successful subversion of our Constitutional process is this : cowardly members of Congress so afraid of being painted pastel on terrorism that they abdicate their oversight responsibility .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney made “ terrorification ” of Congress a high priority , and congressional leaders caved , winking even at torture , kidnapping , warrantless eavesdropping , etc. , etc. , etc . Speaking of contracting , Congress ’ oversight role was , in a very real sense , “ contracted out ” — to eight invertebrate leaders from the House and Senate whose unconscionable , see - no - evil acquiescence was driven solely by their felt need to appear tough on terrorism .
“ After 9/11 everything changed , ” is certainly an overused aphorism .
But it does apply to the spirit and soul of our country , after President Bush was given the pulpit at National Cathedral .
Vengeance is ours , said the President .
And the vast majority of Christian leaders were cowed into razoring out of their Bibles “ Blessed are the Peacemakers . ”
The clergy clapped , and so did the Congress and the Fawning Corporate Media ( FCM ) .
Do n’t you remember ?
The situation bears a striking resemblance to that described by writer Sebastian Haffner in Berlin in 1933 after the Reichstag fire ( Germany ’s 9/11 ) : “ What was missing is what in animals is called ‘ breeding . ’
This is a solid inner kernel that cannot be shaken by external pressures , something noble and steely , a reserve of pride , principle , and dignity to be drawn on in the hour of trial .
It is missing in Germans .
“ As a nation they are without backbone .
That was shown in March 1933 .
At the moment of truth , when other nations rise spontaneously to the occasion , the Germans collectively and limply collapsed , yielded to a nervous breakdown , and became a nightmare to the rest of the world . ”
[ Defying Hitler , p. 135 ] Stormy Applause And our Congress ?
During the President ’s infamous State - of - the - Union address on Jan. 28 , 2003 ( yes , the one with the uranium - from - Africa - to - Iraq and other make - believe ) , Bush got the most unbridled applause when , after bragging about the 3,000 “ suspected terrorists ” whom he said had been arrested , he added : “ And many others have met a different fate .
Let 's put it this way :
They are no longer a problem to the United States and our friends and allies . ”
The lawmakers ’ reaction and the cheering that followed in the FCM reminded me of the short italicized note that Pravda regularly tacked onto the bottom of paragraphs recording the text of similarly fulsome leadership speeches : Burniye aplaudismenti ; vce stoyat ! —
Stormy applause ; all rise !
Even so , Soviet leaders generally avoided ( as not quite presidential ) the seeking of applause for thinly veiled allusions to extrajudicial killing .
It is Congress that is collectively responsible for abdicating its oversight responsibility , while cheering on creeps like Cofer Black , CIA ’s top counter - terrorism official from 1999 to May 2002 and now one of Blackwater ’s senior leaders .
In his prepared testimony to a joint congressional 9/11 inquiry on Sept. 26 , 2002 , the swashbuckling Black said this about “ operational flexibility ” : " All I want to say is that there was ‘ before ’ 9/11 and ‘ after ’ 9/11 .
After 9/11 the gloves came off .
... I know that we are on the right track today and as a result we are safer as a nation .
‘ No Limits ’ aggressive , relentless , worldwide pursuit of any terrorist who threatens us is the only way to go and is the bottom line . ”
What were those “ gloves ” to which you referred , Mr. Black ?
Do you mean that legal restrictions were gone ?
And “ No Limits ? ”
Is it the case that there now are no limitations on your pursuit of terrorists ?
From what do you derive that kind of authorization , Mr. Black ?
These are just sample questions that , apparently , occurred to none of the congressional inquiry members to ask .
And authorization ?
In the Bush / Cheney White House , all it took was a presidential signature , like that appearing in strokes of large felt - tipped pen under the two - page executive memorandum of Feb.
7 , 2002 .
Last December the Senate Armed Forces Committee , without dissent , concluded that this memo , “ opened the door ” to abusive interrogation by exempting al Qaeda and Taliban detainees from Geneva protections .
Alberto Gonzales , in an inadvertent blunder , released that memo five years ago .
Special presidential memos ( often referred to as “ Findings ” ) authorizing covert action like the lethal activities of the CIA and Blackwater have not yet surfaced .
They will , in due course , if the patriotic truth tellers who have now spoken to the Times and the Washington Post about CIA and Blackwater continue to put the Constitution and courage above secrecy oaths .
The Savage Mood CIA operative Gary Schroen told National Public Radio that , just days after 9/11 , Cofer Black sent him to Afghanistan with orders to “ Capture bin Laden , kill him , and bring his head back in a box on dry ice . ”
As for other al Qaeda leaders , Black reportedly said , “ I want their heads up on pikes . ”
Schroen told NPR he had been stunned that , for the first time in 30 years of service , he had received orders to kill targets rather than to capture them .
Contacted by the radio network , Black would not confirm the exact words of the order to Schroen , but did not dispute Schroen ’s account .
This quaint tone reverberated among macho pundits in the FCM .
Washington Post veteran Jim Hoagland , who was extremely well plugged in to the Bush administration , on Oct. 31 , 2001 , wrote an open letter to President Bush .
Apparently no Halloween prank , Hoagland strongly endorsed the wish for “ Osama bin Laden ’s head on a pike , ” a wish he attributed to Bush ’s “ generals and diplomats . ”
The consummate insider , Hoagland then almost gave the real game away , giving Bush a list of priorities :
“ The need to deal with Iraq ’s continuing accumulation of biological and chemical weapons and the technology to build a nuclear bomb can in no way be lessened by the demands of the Afghan campaign .
You must conduct that campaign so that you can pivot quickly from it to end the threat Saddam Hussein ’s regime poses . ”
I have the feeling we are in for many more chapters recording how the savage mood in Washington played out during the last seven years of the Bush / Cheney administration .

By day Luis Zambrano is a construction worker , but by night police say he's a sexual predator stalking intoxicated women in nightclubs .
At the trendy Manhattan club Marquee , Zambrano was caught on surveillance tape accosting a 23 - year - old woman who had passed out on a couch .
Surveillance video shows that she woke up and tried to fight him off .
But he did n't give up .
As he dragged her limp body out of the bar , she fell to the floor , all the time no one coming to her aide .
Then he dragged her down a flight of stairs .
The video shows him lifting her into his arms , and carrying her out of the night club .
Once again , nobody stopped him .
According to police , he took her to his home and raped her .
After my local 6 pm news ended yesterday , I left the TV on and ended up watching a story on Inside Edition about sexual predators at nightclubs .
The IE story sometimes missed the mark but sometimes it was spot on .
If Zambrano 's name sounds familiar it is because I blogged about his crime and his guilty plea only a week ago .
However , the reality of his crime hit home in a different way when I watched the portion of his crime committed inside the nightclub .
What I saw was premeditation , smoothness and coldbloodedness .
After seeing that video I 'd be shocked if this was in actuality his first or even his fifth offense .
He looked like a seasoned predator who had done this many times before .
When the IE story focused on sexual predators and the repeated failure of bystanders , it was powerful .
This included undercover footage which showed how young women leaving the nightclub were treated by men prowling out around the exits .
When two women , Kim and Allison , working undercover for INSIDE EDITION left a nightclub together , they heard the typical come-ons .
But when Kim left a night club alone , something more alarming happens .
She is immediately approached by two men who want to give her cocaine , get her in their car and take her home .
"
You wo n't even try a little bit ? " asks one man .
" We can go back to my apartment . "
Showing this reality is great , but responding to this reality by focusing on the behavior of women who are being targeted is not great .
The troubling behavior came from those men .
From first contact their behavior was coercive and they needed to be challenged for their behavior .
If they are wanting to hook up , why are n't they doing so in a non-predatory way ?
I also wanted IE to do some research to find out if any of those men trying to get a woman to leave with them had previously been accused or convicted of sex crimes .
They would n't be the first convicted sex offender looking for women at that club .
IE had an expert give women patrons drinks which could have been spiked to test those women , but they did not have actors repeating the behavior which resulted in Zambrano 's guilty plea to test nightclub employees or patrons about whether they would intercede .
Telling women not to leave nightclubs alone wo n't fix this underlying danger at the bars and nightclubs where the sexual predators and some sexual predator / murderers are circling like sharks .
Same goes for telling women not to binge drink .
The desire and willingness to perpetrate violence against women which this story focused on is inside the men who are predators before any woman becomes vulnerable .
Their behavior is not about their sexual desire it is about their desire to dominate and / or explicitly hurt women sexually .
Zambrano and the men who became more aggressive toward Kim alone than they were toward her and another woman show that they have great restraint .
The stereotype of men losing their sexual control at the sight of sexy drunk women is contradicted by the evidence .
Right now I would recommend that women boycott nightclubs like the Marquee ( the same club where Laura Garza went on what was likely the last night of her life , until the level of danger is reduced .
The surveillance recordings may help catch criminals after the crime , but until somebody at the nightclub is paying attention to patrons who are unable to defend themselves or to the patrons who display predatory behavior then they are not doing enough to justify women 's basic trust .
If all women who go to nightclubs do so in groups and are all determined to follow all of the safety advice and to leave as a group and if nothing is done to eliminate the circling of predators then those predators will adjust their strategies to create vulnerability .
The undercover work done for TV is a task the police should pick up on .
If predators had to worry about whether the woman passed out inside or outside of a club was really passed out or was an undercover police woman waiting for a predator to strike and had to worry about whether any of his fellow predators was an undercover cop , some of those predators might reconsider committing crimes they likely look at as high return , low risk crimes .
One action which should happen for sex offenders with MOs such as Zambrano displayed is that they should be barred from entering nightclubs and bars , or loitering nearby , while they are on probation .
This type of sex offender also needs to be on a curfew which requires them to be home or at work when women who drink are most vulnerable .
Without this pool of predators who are looking for opportunities to assault women , the women who go to nightclubs could be completely careless about their safety and they would remain absolutely safe from crime .
Being predator - free does n't mean being free of men .
There are many men who will not rape even if they find themselves in situations where they could rape and be confident that they would face no legal consequences for their crime .
What I saw on the undercover video had no relationship to men trying to have honest sexual interactions with women .
When those men highlighted in this IE story cross the line they do so intentionally .
Unfortunately , if it had n't been for the nightclub video Zambrano would have spun a too familiar counter allegation that the alleged victim willingly left that club with him and was not only capable of consenting but actively consent .
Too many people who consider themselves opposed to rapists would accept this counter allegation as easily as the women in that nightclub accepted open drinks which could have been spiked .
Vulnerable women are not the core problem .
The easy - to - find predatory men are the core problem and the strongest messages about needed behavioral changes to be directed at them and those messages need to be repeated at least as often as messages telling women to watch their liquor .
The biggest failure of the piece is that the nightclub owners were n't challenged about how an intoxicated woman could be dragged and carried outside without the man who did that being challenged by a single employee .
This was the same club Laura Garza went to in December before she disappeared so they clearly understand that dangerous people can be patronizing their business .

Biologists have figured out the most efficient way to destroy an ecosystem — and it's based on the Google search algorithm .
Scientists have long known that the extinction of key species in a food web can cause collapse of the entire system , but the vast number of interactions between species makes it difficult to guess which animals and plants are the most important .
Now , computational biologists have adapted the Google search algorithm , called PageRank , to the problem of predicting ecological collapse , and they 've created a startlingly accurate model .
" While several previous studies have looked at the robustness of food webs to a variety of sequences of species loss , none of them have come up with a way to identify the most devastating sequence of extinctions , " said food web biologist Jennifer Dunne of the Santa Fe Institute , who was not involved in the research .
Using a modified version of PageRank , Dunne said , the researchers were able to identify which species extinctions within a food web would lead to biggest chain - reaction of species death .
" If we can find the way of removing species so that the destruction of the ecosystem is the fastest , it means we ’re ranking species by their importance , " said ecologist Stefano Allesina of the University of California , Santa Barbara , who co-authored the paper published Friday in PLoS Computational Biology .
Unlike previous solutions to the coextinction problem , the Google solution takes into account not only the number of connections between species , but also their relative importance .
" In PageRank , you 're an important website if important websites point to you , " Allesina said * .
" * We took that idea and reversed it : Species are important if they support important species . "
In other words , grass is important because it 's eaten by gazelles , and gazelles are important because they 're eaten by lions .
When the researchers tested the Google algorithm against existing models for predicting ecosystem collapse , they found that the new solution outperformed the old ones in each of the 12 food webs they looked at .
" In every case that we tested , the algorithm returned either the best possible solution , out of the billions of possibilities , or very close to it , " Allesina said .
In this case , the " best possible solution " is the one that predicts total ecosystem collapse using the fewest number of species extinctions .
To make the circular PageRank algorithm work for food webs , which are traditionally considered unidirectional , the researchers had to solve the problem of what to do with dead ends :
Not much eats a lion , but that does n't necessarily mean lions are n't critical to the food chain .
The scientists solved this problem by adding what Allesina calls a " root node , " which is based on the idea that all living creatures contribute to the food chain through their excrement and eventual decay .
" What we found is that the importance of a species can be connected to the amount of matter that flows to it , " Allesina said .
" If species eat a lot of things , and a lot of things eat them , they tend to be important . "
Previous solutions to the problem tended to underestimate the importance of species that are lower on the food chain , Allesina said , and he hopes the new solution will encourage conservation biologists to take a broader view of species extinctions .
" What I hope is that people will pick up interest and start thinking about conservation in a more network - based way , " Allesina said .
" Right now , most conservationists are focused on a single species , and they just study that species .
But you really have to take into account that this species is not independent , it ’s really tangled in a network of multi-species interactions . "
For ecosystems on the brink of collapse , such as marine environments taxed by overfishing , Allesina said a network - based approach to conservation could make all the difference .

Off the Beat : Bruce Byfield 's Blog
Bruce Byfield
Quarterly reports are the stuff of business .
In most people 's minds , they are as far from the spirit of free and open source software ( FOSS ) as anyone can imagine .
All the same , as non-profit organizations , many FOSS projects issue them .
And while your first reaction may be to avoid quarterly reports , they can give some insights into projects , especially if you read between the lines .
For instance , if you have been assuming , as I have , that GNOME has more corporate support than KDE , and a larger budget , a look at the latest report for GNOME and KDE may surprise you .
Together , the two reports give an entirely different impression than you might assume .
Neither quarterly report has much in common with the glossy publications offered by multi-national publications .
Both are PDF files with undistinguished layouts and a minimum of graphics .
Even head shots of people mentioned or reporting are absent .
Compared to corporate reports , those of both GNOME and KDE are practical , unadorned publications .
Of the two , GNOME 's ( its first , covering June , July , and August 2009 ) comes closest to the spirit of a corporate report .
It includes not only the obligatory message from GNOME 's executive director , but also reports from the Release , Bugsquad , Marketing , Web , Usability , Accessibility , Documentation , Art and Localizations Teams .
Although some of these reports were outdated by the time the report was released , their overall impression is of a multi-tiered multi-national 's executives reporting in .
In general , the report fits in well with GNOME 's traditional tendency to favor the corporate side and with its recent interest in marketing .
Like most quarterly reports , it is as much a public relations document as an effort to provide concrete information ( although it does both ) .
The one non-corporate note is at the beginning , when executive director Stormy Peters asks readers , " please let us know if you find it useful ! "
In comparison , KDE 's report for March through June 2009 is less than one quarter the size of GNOME's .
Although it includes the usual redundant introduction -- this time by Aaron Seigo -- it contains far fewer individual summaries than GNOME 's report .
These differences may reflect the greater experience that KDE e.V. -- the German non-profit that manages KDE -- has with the whole idea of reports , and has the advantage that it is more likely to be read completely .
At the same time , because it is so short , the KDE report seems less corporate , an impression that is fitting for the project 's more community - based orientation .
Beyond these general impressions , what is most interesting is the financial accounting in the reports .
The two reports are not strictly comparable , given that many FOSS activities occur in the northern hemisphere 's summer rather than spring .
Nor is it always obvious in either report what falls under each line item .
Still , some differences emerge .
For instance , GNOME lists an income of just over $ 102,000 for the quarter covered by its report .
This income includes $ 65,000 from the Desktop Summit , $ 20,000 from " advisory board fees " ( which I interpret mainly as donations from corporate sponsors ) , and $ 12,400 collected by the Friends of GNOME , a promotional and fund - raising project .
Omitting the Desktop Summit as a one - time source of income , these figures mean that GNOME has traditionally relied on corporate supporters .
Corporate supporters continue to provide the bulk of GNOME 's income , but the total from Friends of GNOME suggests that GNOME may be switching to a more community - based source of income .
However , given that GNOME reported an approximate income of $ 54,000 per quarter in 2008 ( http://markmail.org/message/bsk4gush6hoq42ef), GNOME does appear to be suffering from reduced income this year ; if you divide the one - time Desktop Summit income over all quarters , GNOME is apparently operating this year on about $ 47,000 per quarter .
By contrast , KDE 's income for the quarter covered by its report totaled just over $ 111,000 ( if you convert the figures from Euros to approximate American dollars ) .
This is actually an increase from the incomes of $ 93,000 and $ 102,000 in the fourth and second quarter of 2008 .
In other words , despite GNOME 's wooing of corporate support , KDE appears to have roughly twice the budget of GNOME in each quarter .
And , just as importantly , KDE does not seem to have been affected by the recession .
What is not altogether clear is where KDE 's income is coming from .
However , if you assume that the Camp KDE sponsorships and donations indicate corporate donations , then KDE is attracting more support from business than GNOME , Assuming that " supporting members " refers to individuals , KDE is also is collecting more than twice as much from indviduals .
To keep running , GNOME spends $ 34,401 on wages and $ 3300 on employee travel , while sponsoring the costs of developers traveling to the desktop summit with $ 10,300 .
No other travel expenses are listed , so , presumably , GNOME spends a comparable amount for travel each quarter .
In comparison , KDE spends $ 17,000 on wages , plus some $ 2000 for legal expenses and $ 3,000 for board meetings -- presumably because a number of board members travel from North America to attend .
Even so , its administrative costs are less than half GNOME 's , despite its larger income .
Moreover , KDE also provides some $ 27,000 in travel expenses to events ranging from developer meetings , conferences and Camp KDE , a total well over twice that of GNOME , even in a quarter without the Desktop Summit .
From these figures , it appears that KDE places a far greater emphasis on face to face meetings than GNOME currently does .
Considering these figures , you should not be surprised that KDE was reporting a positive balance of over $ 288,000 .
GNOME 's total balance was not reported , but , considering that last year GNOME was expecting a short fall of some $ 40,000 , the chances are that its bank balance is nowhere near KDE's .
These suppositions might change if we knew exactly what each line item involved .
Still , the differences are consistent enough to make clear that KDE is more than holding its own in the corporate world .
What 's more , it appears to run more cheaply than GNOME , and to spend more of its money on its community .
These conclusions are no reflection on GNOME , nor on the current members of the GNOME Foundation .
If nothing else , being centered in North America , GNOME might have been harder hit by the recent recession than KDE , which tends to be centered in Europe .
But these conclusions do show how your impressions can change when you get to the bottom line .
KDE , from what I can see , is not the underdog that many imagine .

The Secret Service detained a man at a Maryland town hall yesterday carrying a sign reading , " ' Death To Obama , Death To Michelle And Her Two Stupid Kids . "
Why do n't Republicans at least say , " Do n't threaten to kill the president " ?
In all likelihood , the unnamed 51 - year - old man carrying that sign was n't an actual direct threat to the president 's life .
Neither was Gary Frago , the Atwater , California , city councilman who forwarded e-mails to his co-workers and friends joking about killing Obama ( a fake letter , for instance , from John McCain to John Hinckley , Jr. , explaining that he 's about to be released and that Obama has been dating Jodi Foster ) .
Neither was William Kostric , the asshole who brought a gun and a sign saying that it 's time to " water the tree of liberty " to Obama 's New Hampshire town hall earlier this week .
None of these men presented an immediate , credible threat Obama .
( Then again , people would probably have written off Hinckley as a harmless nut before he fired his shots . )
Kostric , we learned after seeing him interviewed on Hardball yesterday , was just a provocateur who sought to thumb his nose at authority and get on TV .
But why did he want to get on TV ?
To spread his message and propagate his ideas .
And what are his ideas ?
That it 's time to shed the blood of our leaders .
These death threats are n't threats — they 're challenges .
They 're attempts to inject into the public debate the sense that violence is a legitimate response to political defeat .
As someone in the blogosphere whom we can't presently recall wrote yesterday , the appropriate response to a president who advocates rounding up the elderly and sending them before death panels is — if it seems like he's on the cusp of achieving that goal — to kill or rebel against him .
And each publicized call for Obama 's death adds to the public perception that we 've reached a decision - point about whether it 's time for killing .
Every sign — even if the bearer is merely an angry loon who could never get close to Obama — is an inducement to someone who is willing to try .
It 's a message to fellow travelers , a signal that they are not alone in their rage , a promise of glory to come if they actually manage to get the job done .
As we said before , there are always people who want to kill the president .
The question is how many give it a shot .
And the more of these signs there are in the background of Fox News ' live report from some town hall in Missouri saying that someone should give it a shot , the more people actually will .
And the more people that give it a shot , the more likely someone is to hit the jackpot .
This is not an idle concern : Obama gets 30 death threats every day , according to Ron Kessler , who recently wrote a book about the Secret Service .
That 's a four - fold increase over the number that George W. Bush — the most reviled president in modern history — received .
Secret Service resources are stretched thin , and every threat has to be investigated not matter how harmless .
So what is the GOP 's response so far to these threats ?
" Hey Democrats , They 're Called The American People . "
" No Wonder Democrats Are Smearing Americans – They Read The Headlines . "
" AS CANDIDATE , OBAMA ENCOURAGED ANGER AND AGGRESSION AMONG HIS SUPPORTERS . "
Those are quotes from recent GOP press releases striking back at Democrats for calling a mob a mob .
Where are the Republican politicians denouncing the violent rhetoric ?
Can we at least draw the boundary at threatening to kill his children ?
If GOP politicians were to be outspoken in telling their supporters that strenuous political opposition is OK but that glorifying violence is not — how many signs have you seen reading " Sic Semper Tyrannis " ?— it might go a long way toward tamping down the rage and decreasing the likelihood that someone actually becomes convinced that Sean Hannity will have him on the show as a reward for stopping Obama 's march toward a " culture of death . "
But rage is all they 've got , so rage it is .
Not one GOP politician that we can find has distanced themselves from that rage .
They 've embraced it .
A 21st Century Depression
The inflation / deflation debate is hot …
It crackles and pops like a pine fire .
But it gives off little helpful light .
Abe Lincoln may have read by the light of an open fire .
But when tried it , we singed our eyebrows .
It made us suspicious of Old Abe ; maybe he was n’t quite as truthful as he pretended to be .
Later , we realized he was a mountebank .
But that ’s another story …
Today , we light a candle and try to interpret the shadows on the wall …
Yesterday , the Dow fell 81 points .
Gold dropped $ 5 to $ 1009 .
Will the feds succeed in causing inflation ?
Or will they fail ?
Will the dollar continue to go down ?
Or will it prove to be a safe haven currency in a time of deflationary trouble ?
According to the papers , the feds have already done it .
“ Fed says recovery underway , ” says a headline from yesterday ’s press .
Another headline tells us that the feds are considering how and when to ease themselves out of their interventions .
But what would the economy look like after they stopped meddling ?
Just look at auto sales .
People bought cars when the feds bribed them to do so .
When the bribes stopped , so did car sales .
Now , the clunker program has ended and spiders are busy building their webs in showrooms again .
Sales fell 38 % from August to September …to a 28 - year low .
House sales too have been goosed up by the feds ’ tax credits .
According to an estimate we reported yesterday , 350,000 new house sales since January were assisted by federal intervention – about 80 % of the total .
What will happen when this program ends in November ?
Hey …let ’s guess …uh … housing sales will fall , right ?
And speculators are worried about what will happen when the feds stop their intervention in the financial industry , scheduled for December .
Thanks to taxpayer money , the bankers were spared the consequences of their own stupidity .
Instead , taxpayers will pay for their mistakes .
No one is particularly upset about it .
The taxpayers do n’t know what is going on .
And bankers are happy to continue living in the style to which they have become accustomed .
Reuters reports :
“ You would n’t know it by his pay stubs , but Jiang Jianqing heads the world ’s largest bank .
“ Jiang , chairman of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , made just $ 234,700 in 2008 .
That ’s less than 2 percent of the $ 19.6 million awarded to Jamie Dimon , chief executive of the world ’s fourth - largest bank , JPMorgan Chase & Co .
“ The contrast illustrates the massive differences in pay among the CEOs of the world ’s top banks .
The compensation of the CEOs of the largest US banks towers above what ’s paid to banking chiefs in other parts of the world , according to a Reuters analysis of pay at the 18 biggest banks by market value .
“ The United States is home to four of the nine largest banks in the world – JPMorgan , Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc .
It is also home to four of the six most handsomely rewarded bank CEOs .
“ China , for example , boasts three of the world ’s four biggest banks , yet the leaders of those banks – Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , China Construction Bank Corp and Bank of China – are among the lowest paid of those surveyed by Reuters .
The chairman and the president of each of the banks are paid roughly $ 230,000 per year . ”
If America ’s make - believe capitalists want to pay their CEOs exorbitant wages , that ’s their business .
A pox on all of them .
But in come the feds … and now we ’re all paying the price .
And if the program ends in December , as scheduled , we ’ll get to see how far the economy without taxpayers ’ money in the gas tank .
Let ’s see …it comes to a complete stop ?
But no matter how malign and imbecilic the feds are , the public is rooting for them .
People think Bernanke has avoided a ‘ Second Great Depression , ’ and that the government has rescued the economy .
Now they see nothing but clear highway ahead … perhaps with a little bump from time to time .
What ’s ahead ?
We do n’t know .
Neither does anyone else .
There is no precedent .
Never before has a major central bank reacted so recklessly to a market correction .
Never before has the monetary based exploded so violently .
Never before have so many people with so many bills to pay had to face such a downturn .
But amid all the confusion , uncertainty and noise … your editor is calmly , cheerfully and confidently awaiting a depression .
Yes , dear reader , we do n’t know what markets will do .
We do n’t know how much gold will sell for next year …or what the actual GDP will be .
But when we look at the shadows …we have a strong hunch that we are entering a depression … and that we wo n’t get out of it soon .
That said , we caution readers not to expect soup lines or people selling apples on the street corners .
This is a depression a la 21st century .
A depression with iPhones and Twitter .
This is NOT your grandfather ’s depression .
Keep reading …
It ’s not your grandfather ’s depression , but it has many elements that your grandfather would recognize .
This from David Rosenberg :
“ Frugality theme is secular , not just cyclical . ”
With so much noise … and so many distortions … it ’s hard to tell what is really going on …and impossible to know how the markets will react .
Still , there are some patterns that make sense .
After a long period of credit growth , credit is now shrinking .
At least in the private sector .
And that is not likely to change .
Well , it ’s not likely to change unless the Fed goes nuclear .
If they push the hyperinflation button , the whole picture changes radically and immediately .
But that ’s not likely to happen any time soon … so let ’s ignore it for the present .
What we have before us now is a consumer economy where the consumer is cutting back .
Despite the odd shadow shapes on the wall , that means a slowdown in hiring , business revenues and real prices … and tax revenues .
New York says its budget deficit will grow to $ 3 billion .
And over on the sunny West Coast , California is selling $ 8.8 billion in notes to try to close its deficit .
Apartment rents in New York City are falling .
Credit card defaults hit a new record .
And The Wall Street Journal says that holiday jobs in the retail sector are likely to be scarce .
Not to mention the wave of mortgage loan defaults that is headed our way – and is already in progress .
Another thing you ’d expect is a decline in America ’s relative economic power and political influence .
Richard Duncan , along with your editor , has been following the story .
Bloomberg reports :
“ US budget deficits will continue to pile up in the next decade , eventually reaching an unsustainable level that may result in an economic collapse , according to Richard Duncan , author of The Dollar Crisis .
“ The US has little chance of resolving its deteriorating financial position because the manufacturing industry continues to shrink , leaving the nation with few goods to export , said Duncan , now at Singapore - based Blackhorse Asset Management .
“ In The Dollar Crisis , first published in 2003 , Duncan argued that persistent current account deficits by the US were creating an unsustainable boom in global credit that was destined to break down , resulting in a worldwide recession .
“ ‘ The bad news is at the end of a 10 - year period we ’re still not going to have fixed the problem , ’ Duncan said in an interview in Hong Kong yesterday .
‘ Eventually it will lead to high rates of inflation well down the line and really destabilize things to the point where there may be irreparable damage .
A kind of ‘ Fall of Rome ’ scenario . ’ ”
Fall of Rome ?
Hey , Addison Wiggin and your editor wrote the book on the fall of Rome idea .
Empire of Debt , we called it .
It was such a hit that the publisher asked us for a new edition … which was released this summer .
Richard Duncan , with Bloomberg on lead guitar , was singing our song :
“ The federal budget deficit will total $ 1.6 trillion this year , while combined shortfalls are forecast to total $ 9.05 trillion in the next 10 years , according to projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office .
“ The US has run a current account deficit every year since 1982 except one , with a peak of $ 788 billion in 2006 .
Foreign purchases of US debt has propped up the dollar and allowed a credit - fueled spending boom by the nation ’s consumers , according to Duncan .
“ US workers are now likely to face declining wages and that may create a political backlash against free - trade policies , he said .
The nation ’s jobless rate jumped to a 26 - year high of 9.7 percent in August , while wages logged a 2.6 percent increase from the previous year .
“ As unemployment remains above 10 percent well into the foreseeable future , it wo n’t be long before Americans start voting for protectionism , ” Duncan said .
“ That ’s going to be bad because protectionism will mean world trade will diminish and will overall reduce global prosperity . ”
Once the US debt burden becomes too large and the government can no longer sell debt to the public the Federal Reserve will likely step in and monetize it , resulting in high levels of inflation , he concluded .
Until tomorrow ,

The Daily Reckoning
* Chavez says stations no longer belong to ‘ bourgeoisie ’
* Calls closures part of effort to democratize airwaves
* Critics say the move attacks freedom of speech ( Adds Chavez comment )
CARACAS , Aug 1 ( Reuters ) -
More than a dozen of 34 radio stations ordered shut by the Venezuelan government went off the air on Saturday , part of President Hugo Chavez ’s drive to extend his socialist revolution to the media .
The association of radio broadcasters said 13 stations had stopped transmitting , following an announcement Friday night by government broadcasting watchdog Conatel that 34 radio outlets would be closed because they failed to comply with regulations .
Critics said the crackdown infringed on freedom of speech and that owners were not given the right to a proper defense .
“ They ’re closing the space for dissidents in Venezuela , ” William Echeverria , head of the National Council of Journalists , told RCTV , a private cable TV station , which did not have its broadcasting license renewed in 2007 .
Chavez defended the closures , calling them part of the government ’s effort to democratize the airwaves .
“ We have n’t closed any radio stations , we ’ve applied the law , ” Chavez said on state television .
“ We ’ve recovered a bunch of stations that were outside the law , that now belong to the people and not the bourgeoisie . ”
Chavez supporters say they are waging a “ media war ” against private news companies and have denounced in recent days what they say is a renewed offensive by privately owned domestic and international media to discredit Venezuela .
Diosdado Cabello , the public works minister who also oversees Conatel , said some of the radio stations were shut because they did not have their broadcasting licenses renewed and others transferred them illegally to new owners .
Conatel delivered an order to CNB radio in Caracas before dawn for its five stations to stop transmitting by 8 a.m. , the station said on its website .
At CNB ’s headquarters in downtown Caracas , hundreds of CNB employees and government critics gathered to protest the shutdown .
Some later marched to Conatel .
CNB said it would continue to broadcast on its Internet site , www.cnb.com.ve.
‘ MUTILATOR OF RIGHTS ’
“ This government has turned into a mutilator of rights , ” Juan Carlos Caldera , of the opposition political party Primero Justicia , said on Globovision TV .
Antonio Ledezma , the opposition mayor of Caracas , called on Venezuelans to protest the move in the streets .
One of the stations to cease operations was Radio Bonita 1520 AM in the city of Guatire , 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Caracas .
“ Fifteen years after my father died , they tell me ( broadcasting ) licenses can’t be inherited , we ’re shocked , ” Felix Ali Obelmejia , director of Radio Bonita , told Globovision .
Another 120 radio stations were being investigated for administrative irregularities and the radio frequency of stations being shut down would be transferred to new community broadcasters , Cabello had said .
Venezuela ’s attorney general presented this week draft legislation that would establish prison sentences for anyone who provides false information that harms the interests of the state .
Rights groups harshly criticized the proposal .
As part of his drive to remake Venezuela as a socialist country , Chavez has vastly expanded the number of publicly owned television and radio stations since he took office in 1999 .
Some are directly owned or financed by the government , while others are operated by cooperatives and community groups .
On one level , Inglourious Basterds is a sophisticated and knowing evisceration of fascist cinema — the war ends , essentially , in a conflagration in Shoshanna ’s theater .
And because this is Tarantino , scenes of unmediated gore are interrupted by debates about German movie - making , including a discussion ( whose participants include Winston Churchill ) of whether Joseph Goebbels runs his movie studios in the manner of Louis B. Mayer or David O. Selznick .
But it is the unapologetic depiction of an alternate reality in which Jews torture and murder Nazis that made this film particularly interesting to a veteran REM - state Mengele - killer such as myself .
Early in the film , Aldo the Apache announces the goals of his unit : “ We will be cruel to the Germans , and through our cruelty they will know who we are .
They will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled , dismembered , and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us . ”
Soon enough , the Basterds are committing war crimes , beating prisoners to death and collecting the scalps of dead Germans .
“ Every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps , ” Aldo demands .
The horror - movie director Eli Roth — his film Hostel is the most repulsively violent movie I ’ve ever seen twice — plays a Basterd known as the “ Bear Jew , ” whose specialty is braining Germans with a baseball bat .
Roth told me recently that Inglourious Basterds falls into a subgenre he calls “ kosher porn . ”
“ It ’s almost a deep sexual satisfaction of wanting to beat Nazis to death , an orgasmic feeling , ” Roth said .
“ My character gets to beat Nazis to death .
That ’s something I could watch all day .
My parents are very strong about Holocaust education .
My grandparents got out of Poland and Russia and Austria , but their relatives did not . ”
Tarantino ’s producer , Lawrence Bender , says that after reading the first draft of Inglourious Basterds , he told Tarantino , “ As your producing partner , I thank you , and as a member of the Jewish tribe , I thank you , motherfucker , because this movie is a fucking Jewish wet dream . ”
Harvey and Bob Weinstein , the film ’s executive producers , also reportedly enjoyed the film ’s theme of Jewish revenge .
Tarantino told me he has received only positive reactions from his Jewish friends .
“ The Jewish males that I ’ve known since I ’ve been writing the film and telling them about it , they ’ve just been , ‘ Man , I ca n’t fucking wait for this fucking movie ! ’ ” he told me .
“ And they tell their dads , and they ’re like , ‘ I want to see that movie ! ’ ”
It is not an accident that it took a non-Jewish director to concoct this story of brutal Jewish revenge .
It is difficult to imagine a Jew in Hollywood — each one more self - conscious than the next — portraying Jews as vengeance - seeking knifemen .
Neal Gabler , the author of An Empire of Their Own : How the Jews Invented Hollywood , told me that Jewish revenge fantasies are n’t entirely alien to the movie industry , but they ’ve always been exercises in sublimation , Superman being only the most obvious .
“ Jews have gone from being nonexistent in film to being thoroughly represented , but no Jew would ever make a film like Inglourious Basterds , ” Gabler said .
“ It ’s too brazen . ”
Tarantino in person is both larger and saner than he seems in his films and in his public appearances .
He is a polite and enthusiastic host , and he spent part of a July afternoon with me analyzing German cinema of the 1920s , World War II iconography , and the career of Joseph Goebbels , which seems to fascinate Tarantino endlessly .
( Goebbels provides one of the most amusing moments in Inglourious Basterds , crying when Hitler praises his latest film .
“ If Hitler says that this is the greatest movie you ’ve ever done , I can see Goebbels getting choked up , ” Tarantino said in explaining the scene .
“ When Harvey Weinstein does that , I get a tear in my eye . ” )
Tarantino was less thoughtful on the subject of torturing Nazis , but deliberately so .
Excessive thoughtfulness , he suggested , is the reason his Jewish friends find most Holocaust movies so exasperating .
Yes , up to three million .
That was the conclusion reached in the 2009 annual report on the Spanish property market prepared by Madrid - based real estate analysts R. R. de AcuÃ±a & Asociados .
The report is described by Sunday Times Spanish Property Doctor columnist Mark Stucklin as one of the most influential annual reports on the sector , so the conclusions are hardly to be sneezed at , indeed the assumptions made in the calculations appear on the surface to be entirely plausible .
In fact , having read the summary of the report in this article here , Variant Perception ’s Jonthan Tepper wrote to me to ask whether I thought we were being “ dire enough ” .
Yep .
Sufficient unto the day is the direness thereof .
So where does the 3 million number come from ?
Well , according to the estimates of R. R. de AcuÃ±a & Asociados – as outlined in the Expansion article – there are currently 1.67 millon flats and houses on the market and looking for a buyer in Spain .
Roughly 1.1 million of these are new , while a further 518,000 second hand residential properties are now estimated to be languishing on the market .
To this number we then need to add the 327,350 properties under construction but still unfinished – these will either need to be completed or knocked down , but in either case they represent a problem .
Finally we come to the 1.098 millon housing units for which planning permision has already been granted together with an allocated credit line of 52.947 billion euros courtesy of the Spanish banking sector .
Of course maybe may say , well these properties will never be buit , and this may be true , but deciding whether or not to build them is a much more difficult decision to take than it seems , since any such decision would be equivalent to throwing the towel in on Spain ’s construction industry , and would constitute an implicit recognition that the policy pursued so far by the Zapatero administration of trying to soldier on through to 2011 had been a failure .
Construction activity is still only down some 30 % from peak , and if we think it will need to fall from nearly 12 % of GDP to around 4 % then it still has at least another third ( or fifty percent of current output ) to come down , and this is where all the issues start .
Deciding not to go ahead with these houses would basically mean very little construction activity in Spain during the next couple of years or more .
Evidently this would push up unemployment even further , and here is where the problem comes , since this deterioration in the general economic situation would make it even harder for the property market to recover .
Any kind of bubble like the one we have had requires that everything feeds on itself , the moment this stops happening everything starts to deflate , and this is what is happening now .
Simply not building – which I obviously think is what they have to decide – would mean another vicious twist in the screw , more construction company bankruptcies , and hence more bad loans for the banks .
Faced with this , and crazy as it seems , there is a certain logic in continuing to fund zombie builders to build houses that evidently no one needs , since money is cheap from the ECB , and this way the bad - loan book looks , well if not good , at least not so bad .
And who knows – so the thinking goes – maybe one day we will find a use for all these houses .
And this is where the pre-funding issue comes in , since the builders have had to demonstrate in order to get the permission that they have the financial resources to see the projects through , and the banks accordingly have had to set aside the 50 billion euros or so in anticipation of this , which is why , as Madrid University Professor Daniel Villaba pointed out earlier in the year , keeping funding the zombie builders means effectively starving Spain ’s Pymes ( or small businesses ) of much needed working capital .
But the banks can’t simply tell the builders to go to hell , and not to build , since if they do the builders will declare themselves insolvent , with the evident consequences that that much cultivated non-Performing Loans rate would suddenly shoot up .
So adding everything up , we find that between them Spanish estate agents , banks , savings banks and private investors are now either owning or holding the tab on a grand total of something like 3.1 million properties , all of them looking for , or about to be looking for , that ever so elusive thing in Spain , the potential homebuyer .
Another interesting conclusion is that 75 % of existing builders will simply go out of business in the next five years – since which everway you look at it , building now or building later – Spain ’s construction sector is hopelessly overpopulated .
Fortunately Mark Stucklin has – on his Spanish property buff blog – given us what he calls a a “ bulleted summary ” of the main points in the report , and these I reproduce below .
To his summary I would only add two further points of my own .
Firstly the estimate of 25 % unemployment by the end of next year contained in the report may well be on the low side , especially if the Spanish government is running out of funding for the stimulus programmes .
Spanish INEM employment department officials have already leaked estimates that if the Plan E type projects are not renewed , then we could see something like 700,000 additional unemployed in October and November of this year alone .
If these warnings turn out to be realistic then my feeling is that we will hit 25 % unemployment around Easter , and then start heading up towards 30 % .
We should break through the 30 % level around the turn of 2010 / 11 or by the spring of 2011 , depending on a lot of factors which are still hard to see at this point .
And where will we stop ?
No idea at all , since this simply depends on when the Spanish citizenry decide they have had enough and a package of emergency measures are put in place .
It is hard , given the way the eurosystem works , to see how a “ short sharp shock ” may be administered , but something of the kind will be needed , or the patient will simply arrive moribund on the operating table .
My second observation is merely anecdotal , but the AcuÃ±a & Asociados report places a lot of emphasis on the coastal situation , which has , to some extent , already been “ factored in ” by most participants , however quite by chance I have talked with a number of people in recent days who have stressed with me just how serious the situation is in the satellite towns around Madrid , built as they have been for Ecuadorians who never arrived , or Romanians who have already left .
I think this element is yet awaiting a proper accounting , and the cost is unlikely to be small .
Summary by Mark Stucklin of R. R. de AcuÃ±a & Asociados 2009 Annual Report On The Spanish Property Market
– â€œThere are no green shoots around here , â€ said Fernando RodrÃ­guez y RodrÃ­guez de AcuÃ±a , president of the company , describing the state of the Spanish property market during a press conference introducing the report .
– At end of 2008 the supply of property for sale or under construction was 1,623,042 , of which roughly 580,000 were resales , 500,000 newly built but unsold , and 470,000 under construction and nearing completion .
– Annual demand estimated as follows : 233,000 in 2008 , and 218,000 in 2009 .
– That means there are some 1,6 million homes on the market , whilst demand in the next few years is expected to run at around 220,000 homes .
At current levels of demand it will take 6 to 7 years for the real estate sector to recover .
So it could take until 2016 for the market to digest the current property glut .
– Looking at the market for holiday homes on the coast , local demand was estimated at 42,000 in 2008 , expected to fall to 40,000 in 2009 , whilst foreign demand for holiday homes on the coast was 21,000 in 2008 , falling to 20,000 in 2009 .
– The report singles out the coast as one of the areas with the biggest glut of property , and therefore the biggest problem that will take the longest to resolve .
– Higher priced market segments are also a problem ; more expensive market segments are expected to take more than 6 years to clear , compared to 3 years or less at the cheaper end .
– The only way developers and banks will get rid of the glut of property in the medium term is selling at a loss .
– After falling 1.83 % in 2008 , overall prices will fall 9.55 % in 2009 , 9.32 % in 2010 , and 4.81 % in 2011 , a cumulative fall of just under 25.5 % in nominal terms .
– After falling 3.32 % in 2008 , coastal prices will fall 11.28 % in 2009 , 7.98 % in 2010 , and 4.31 % in 2011 , a cumulative fall of 27 % in nominal terms .
– Housing starts will fall to between 50,000 and 75,000 a year in the next few years , down from more than 700,000 in 2005 .
â€ œThe market situation doesnâ€™t justify more building , and anyway the banks wonâ€™t lend money to build something that wonâ€™t sell , â€ said Fernando RodrÃ­guez y RodrÃ­guez de AcuÃ±a .
– Thanks to long lead times in the construction business , the full economic impact of the collapse in residential construction is yet to be felt .
The darkest hour for the Spanish economy will come in the second half of 2010 , when unemployment could reach 25 % .
– Developers will go out of business in greatest numbers during 2010 and 2011 .
â€œIt gets increasingly harder for developers to refinance with assets they either canâ€™t sell or which are already mortgaged , and are increasingly devalued , â€ said Fernando RodrÃ­guez y RodrÃ­guez de AcuÃ±a , who predicts that 75 % of developers will be wiped out in the next 5 years by a combination of too much debt , the market slump , and â€œbad managementâ€ .
– Recovery wonâ€™t come until 2013 , by which time the sector will be just half the size it used to be , if that .

A car accident lawyer at our firm can help you pursue damages such as medical expenses , the costs of future treatment , pain and suffering , lost enjoyment of life , lost income and earning capacity , damage to your vehicle , and loss of consortium .
To get this compensation , you probably will need to prove the elements of a negligence claim .
Negligence is a theory of law that holds people accountable for failing to act safely under the circumstances and causing preventable harm to others .
It may apply whenever a driver acts carelessly between the wheel , resulting in a crash .
For example , a driver may run a stop sign or a red light , fail to check a blind spot , or look down at their phone for a text while hurtling down the freeway .
The accident must have been a foreseeable result of the driver ’s unsafe behavior .
Victims of car accidents may suffer injuries that persist for many years or for the rest of their lives , such as paralysis , brain trauma , PTSD , or serious burns .
The most devastating collisions result in an unnecessary loss of life .
Motorcycle riders , bicyclists , or pedestrians are particularly susceptible to being involved in a fatal accident , since they are exposed to the full force of a vehicle , whereas people inside cars and trucks have structural protections to blunt the impact .
Family members who are grieving for the loss of a loved one may be able to bring a wrongful death claim to pursue damages .
If the victim provided substantial financial and emotional support to their family , such as to their spouse or child , these damages may be compensated .
Costs related to medical treatment and funeral expenses also may be recovered .
The situation may be somewhat more complicated when the at - fault driver is not insured or does not have adequate insurance to cover the victim ’s injuries .
This is why it is critical to secure uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage from your insurer .
If you do , you can bring a claim against the insurer for compensation .
Despite your status as a policyholder , you should be aware that the insurance company is likely to contest your claim if at all possible .
You still need a car accident lawyer in this situation to make sure that the appropriate evidence is gathered to protect your rights .

Here 's how we make money
Ready to jump into homeownership ?
Is owning a home a financial milestone that you have been dreaming about your entire life ?
Many people dream of becoming homeowners .
They dream their entire lives of getting the keys to their first home .
But it can be overwhelming trying to figure out how to handle all the costs of purchasing a home .
Things like ,
saving up the down payment ,
handling closing costs , and
dealing with the necessary incidental costs of new homeownership that can quickly add up .
Luckily for anyone looking to take the plunge into buying a home , Uncle Sam has several tax breaks in place to help homeownership a reality for first - time homebuyers .
These tax breaks may be the motivation you need to achieve your dream of purchasing your first home .
Mortgage Interest Deduction
This can be one of the biggest tax breaks of home ownership .
It covers interest on loans up to $ 1 million or $ 500,000 for married couples filing separately .
This deduction can be even more beneficial for new borrowers because the interest on their mortgage is a lot higher in the earlier years of the loan .
When filing your taxes , your interest amount will be itemized on a Schedule A form .
All of your other deductions will be added on this form .
This will save you tax dollars if your itemized deductions are higher than your standard deductions .
Each year you will receive a 1098 form your loan provider .
Be on the lookout for this form so you can claim your interest .
Property Tax Deduction
Another deduction you can put on your Schedule A form is your property tax amount .
You can only deduct taxes on your primary residence .
Mortgage Interest Credit
The federal government ’s mortgage interest credit is another great way to save money on your tax bill .
The mortgage interest deduction lowers your taxable income , while the mortgage interest credit counts directly against your tax bill .
In order to see if you qualify for this credit , you will need to fill out the IRS Form 8396 .
Let ’s say that you owe $ 500 to the government in taxes and you are approved for a $ 500 mortgage tax credit .
This means your credit would cover your tax bill , and you can do a jig on Tax Day while everyone else is paying their taxes .
In order to qualify , you would receive a Mortgage Credit Certificate at the time of purchase .
This certificate will tell you how much interest you can claim for a credit .
Unfortunately , you cannot claim the mortgage interest deduction and mortgage interest credit at the same time .
Consider working with a CPA to evaluate which would be the best option and save you the most money .
Home Enhancement Breaks
Does your home need a little work ?
This may have some tax benefits if you use a home equity loan from a company like Figure or another loan secured by your mortgage from a company like Unison .
Your home improvement amount will qualify as a mortgage interest deduction .
Your home improvements could also have a big benefit when selling your home .
If your house sells for more than you bought it for , the additional amount you receive can incur a capital gains tax .
But your improvements can lower your taxes and tax basis , saving you money .
Energy Tax Credit
Being environmentally conscious is the way of the future , it seems .
The government will even reward you for being saving energy through the energy tax credit .
This energy tax credit covers 30 % of the cost ( with no upper limit ) of an energy - efficient appliance or product for your home .
This credit is only available for purchases made in 2017 .
ENERGY STAR is the recommended company to use .
They have over 70 categories of products to choose from .
Not only will energy efficiency save you money on your tax bill but it will help with your energy bill over time .
The Bottom Line
There are many tax benefits to homeownership .
Purchasing a home is a big decision and you need to understand everything that comes along with owning a home , good and bad .
Be sure not to let the tax “ tail wag the dog ” though : these tax breaks are here if and when you need them .
Do n’t allow them to push you into a decision you would n’t make otherwise .
Are you a first - time home buyer ?
Which of these tax breaks will you be taking advantage of ?
Tens of thousands of protesters swarmed the streets of Tehran and at least two other Iranian cities Friday , audaciously turning an annual rally in support of the Palestinian cause into the first major demonstration against the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in six weeks .
“ Not Gaza , not Lebanon , I ’ll sacrifice my life for Iran , ” chanted the protesters as they stretched out along the capital ’s wide boulevards .
Witnesses in Tehran reported that by late morning the demonstrators had taken full control of the expansive Seventh of Tir Square .
Amateur video also showed thousands holding up green ribbons and shawls in peaceful rallies in Shiraz and Esfahan .
Ahmadinejad , whose disputed reelection three months ago has triggered Iran ’s worst political crisis in decades , ignored the protesters , who confronted him with chants of “ Liar ! Liar ! ” minutes before he delivered a blistering condemnation of Israel at Tehran University in the capital ’s downtown .

Ahmadinejad repeated well - known controversial statements , questioning the Holocaust , saying Israel was founded on “ lies ” and blaming “ Zionists ” for various wars .
“ If the Holocaust you claim is correct , why do you reject any research about it ? ” he said in his remarks before Friday prayers .
“ The Zionists are behind the ongoing wars in Afghanistan , Iraq and Sudan . ”
Ahmadinejad ’s stepped - up anti-Israel rhetoric comes as he heads to the United Nations next week to address world leaders and as Iran ’s nuclear program is under intense scrutiny .
During an interview Thursday with NBC TV News , Ahmadinejad declined to categorically say that Iran would never pursue a nuclear weapons program , saying only , “ We do not see any need for such weapons . ”
The president ’s repeated anti-Israel statements and questioning of the Holocaust have triggered a fierce backlash overseas that has helped him rally domestic support .
But with anger still seething over the controversial election , it is not clear that Iranians will come together behind him .

State - controlled Iranian television showed thousands of Quds Day attendees wearing traditional Arab scarves and holding posters of Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , leader of Lebanon ’s Hezbollah organization .
The crowds chanted “ Death to Israel , ” a traditional rallying cry on this holiday , which has been held on the last Friday of the Islamic month of Ramadan since the first years after Iran ’s 1979 revolution .
But the opposition stole the day .
The huge crowds illustrated the anti-government movement ’s continued vitality despite a violent three - month crackdown that has included beatings , imprisonments , detainee abuse allegations and awkward televised confessions of dissident activists held for months in solitary confinement without access to lawyers .
The protesters ’ daring stunned some observers .
At one point Friday , a tall woman holding a green balloon flashed the opposition ’s signature “ V ” sign with her fingers as she walked nonchalantly past a sidewalk packed with pro-government rally attendees .
Opposition leader and presidential candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi , along with reformist leader Mehdi Karroubi and former President Mohammad Khatami , joined in the demonstration amid reports that their arrests were imminent .
A young government supporter allegedly tried to attack Khatami with a knife but was thwarted by his guards .

A spokesman for Karroubi said he did not think the authorities would dare to provoke the opposition in the coming days after witnessing the movement ’s strength Friday .
“ Based on what I have heard about the extent of the marches . . . it was much more than I expected and predicted , ” said Esmail Gerami - Moqaddam , a spokesman for Karroubi ’s political party .
“ I do not think they will dare to arrest Karroubi now .
I think all the pressures and arrests have proved to be counterproductive . ”
Calls to join in and undermine the government rally had been distributed by an informal network of organizers via the Internet and leaflets pasted on city walls , bus stations and telephone booths .
The government ’s Revolutionary Guard had ominously warned a day earlier that anyone wearing the green associated with Mousavi or chanting anything other than slogans against Israel would be attacked harshly .

Some opposition protesters came by subway , nervously moving out into the streets and hiding green ribbons in their pockets as they walked past phalanxes of helmeted riot police and hard - line pro-government Basiji militiamen .
They chanted quietly at first , nervous among the many government supporters headed toward Friday prayers , where the sermon was delivered by an acolyte of Ahmadinejad after the relatively moderate Ayatollah Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was barred from speaking .
Eventually , their murmurs gave way to boisterous choruses , as they realized that they were among thousands of protesters .
Soon they were shouting down government supporters , drowning out the loudspeakers broadcasting calls for the death of Israel and America .
The protesters responded with , “ Death to Russia , ” a strategic ally of the government .

“ I did not expect such a huge number of young people , ” said 27 - year - old graduate student Reza , who declined to give his last name .
“ We asserted ourselves and changed the agenda of the day . ”
Some protesters threw rocks and bottles at security forces and Basiji militiamen who were firing tear gas .
Some arrests were reported .
Charred motorcycles lay on a street , possibly burned in clashes between demonstrators and militiamen .
Protesters told The Times that the crowd rivaled the numbers that flooded Tehran ’s streets in the week after Iran ’s June 12 election , a claim backed by video showing huge crowds flooding major downtown thoroughfares .
“ We want to have freedom of expression , ” said Hoda , a university student wearing a traditional all - covering black chador .
“ We want to have a country that every Iranian will be proud of their country and we fight for that until the end . ”
Advertisement
There were reports of some violent confrontations between security forces and protesters .
But uniformed police mostly stood on the sidelines .
“ Come on , do n’t be afraid , ” one police officer told an opposition demonstrator , in apparent support .
“ Be brave .
We die once , and this is worth it . ”
Another nearby police officer chimed in , “ Today there will be no beating up going on , ” he said .
With both sides taking to the streets , boisterous political debates erupted , similar to those before the elections .
Advertisement
On the west side of Enghelab Square , hundreds of government supporters chanted , “ The blood in our veins is a gift to our leader , ” as they marched toward Azadi Square to force the opposition to leave .
The opposition protesters countered : “ The blood in our veins is a gift to our nation . ”
“ Listen , today is the day of unity , ” one elderly man said .
Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “ said we should shout against Israel , why do you talk about Mousavi ? ”
Another elderly man responded , “ We are unable to make ends meet as the prices go up and up .
Who cares about Israel ?
‘ Down with Israel ’ does not make jobs for our youths or grow our money . ”

A week or two away from the land of surveillance and you realise what a very strange place Britain has become .
On my return from holiday I understood one frightening truth , which is that surveillance systems and databases have become as much a part of the country 's infrastructure as the road or rail networks .
No government , however liberal or determined , has the power to dismantle the apparatus that Labour has put in place .
On the thread of my most recent post , divesandlazarus asked , " I wonder if in 2010 Cameron will be able to ' press default ' and return the criminal justice system legislation to what it was in 1997 . "
The answer of course is that he wo n't be able to , even if he wanted to , and the same issue applies to the databases that form Labour 's dreadful legacy .
There is no return from this point .
All we can hope to do is find politicians at the next election who have a real understanding of the pace of technology and its implications for privacy , and they begin to find means of controlling data gathering and surveillance .
This requires effort in the political classes as well as among voters .
I see no evidence of that .
During the last dozen years we have constantly been assured that govnernment databases are there to help us and that they will be tightly controlled to guarantee individual liberty .
A key part of this promise is the guarantee that systems will not link up to share information .
That is baloney .
The whole point of the project to create a super structure that will know everything about us and will make each one of us dependent on the database .
Already the Home Office is devising ways of making use of the ID card integral to gaining employment , an extremely sinister development .
Last week ,
The Register published an important story , through a freedom of information request , they discovered that the Criminal Records Bureau is considering requiring ID card and fingerprint data in an attempt to improve the accuracy of CRB checks .
This would force people to get ID cards in order to get a job .
As Phil Both of No2ID says , " This is entirely consistent with the various forms of coercion strategy they 've been working on to create artificial ' volunteers ' for ID cards . "
You have to acknowledge the cunning of the Home Office and CRB .
As the Register reports the CRB is palpably dysfunctional .
" In the 12 months to the end of March 2009 , identity errors at the CRB more than doubled compared to the previous year .
More than half of the 1,570 mistakes were made in just one month . "
The government 's solution to this disaster , which by the way has not received nearly enough publicity , is to marry the CRB with the ID card , which the Home Office desperately wants to make compulsory .
From this autumn , about 11.3 m people will be required to get enhanced background checks and join a register if they are to continue working with children .
The CRB , which is at the centre of the checking procedure , is obviously going to come under a great deal of pressure so the government 's answer is to add another layer of compulsion and expense .
Clearly the ID card holds very little appeal to the general public .
In Manchester , the designated test bed for the government 's megalomaniac plans , just 8,000 people have inquired about applying for a card .
Even Lord Brett , the minister in charge of the introduction of the ID card scheme , admitted this was a very small percentage of the population .
The Manchester Evening News reported that a website poll indicated that 81 % of adults would not be taking part .
Not much of a result for the £ 140 m spent by the Home Office on consultants last year , a 44 % rise on the previous year , much of which is due to the ID card .
The point in this case study is that once a database is established for a discrete purpose , the authorities always find a means of extending its application .
It is a fundamental law of databases that they spread outwards to connect and share information .
What the Home Office and CRB want is to make people 's livelihoods dependent on these system , even though they fraught with obvious problems of security and accuracy .
Phil Booth said " If the CRB gets its way , then for millions of people their ID card would be directly linked to a detailed police record and a scoring system designed to evaluate their suitability for various jobs . "
That is truly appalling prospect .

This is inspired by an article by chromatic from ages back , about your programming force multipliers .
I think improving your learning is a major “ force multiplier ” , so this is about how to do that .
Observation 1 : Most programmers are on a life - long learning mission .
Actually , all programmers are .
Programming is about solving problems .
You must pick up something from that .
Observation 2 : Learning happens at different speeds , both between individuals and within the same individual .
One day you get the point of mod_perl and burst forward , after making CGI - scripts in the same way for three years .
At the same time your colleague kept discovering new cool skills every week .
Accordingly , most programmers should be concerned not about their learning , but also their learning velocity .
Your skill level is not only based on what you know , but how long it took you to learn it and how much more you can manage to squeeze in during your programmer life - span !
If you ’re ambitious , but your learning curve is slow or stuck , someone will put you on the sidelines .
If your goal is to really understand something , you will be able to reach a deeper understanding if you can fit more learning into a short timespan .
So , this is n’t about using mind - maps , role - plays or fancy games at a training course .
Rather , this is about tactics and strategies for life - long learning , or the kind of ten - year long learning it takes to create world - class expertise .
I want to share something about what Psychology knows about making us learn more , faster , better and deeper – as well as some personal experiences – and hopefully get some feedback about people ’s own experiences about increasing their learning rate .
So here are some points :
Avoid Arrested Development
You start a new job .
You have an amazing learning curve while you pick up knowledge and skills from your new colleagues .
Six months in you ’ve found the comfort level at which you can do your job well .
Six years later you are still at that level .
Meet Arrested Development .
This is why some people are Formula 1 drivers , while most people drive their car good enough to get them to work and the beach .
Getting out of arrested development might not be easy .
One key is to avoid automatic behaviours .
In coding , this is to be aware of your habits and trying to break them up .
Starting every day with opening a secure shell to the server and starting vim ?
How about learning to use Padre instead ?
Always firing up CGI :: Application for every new web application ?
Learn Catalyst , HTML :: Mason , even Ruby on Rails .
Or push your limits .
Try taking on larger responsibilities .
Take on a project that is larger , more complex or more difficult than anything you ’ve built before .
The problem with getting out of arrested development is that it might take unlearning of the comfort level , and actually decrease your productivity and even understanding temporarily .
It ’s actually quite easy to explain in a programming setting :
If you ’re moving on from CGI : : Application to Catalyst , your first web application is going to take longer than normal to develop .
But your next one might be a big step forward for both you and human - kind .
( Although probably mostly for you )
Take Risks
It is found , again and again , that taking risk is a driving force in learning .
In experiments in controlled learning environments , it is regularly found that being willing to try out more , click more buttons and do individual try - and - see experimenting is clearly correlated with higher outcomes in learning .
And it ’s just because the risk - takers will get more learning opportunities , they will simply see more of how things work .
So make sure you have a safe testing environment , a box for experiments and wild ideas .
Try to break things that work , find edge cases or do things in a new way .
Have a machine you can re-install without losing your precious collection of photos .
Write some crazy ideas on your blog .
Try and see what happens .
But most important : Create a technical environment that is conductive to risk - taking , just as much as a social environment .
If your development server is a sacred cow or people are dependent upon it , set up a crash - test server .
I think a reason Test Driven Development is working is also because it forces you to think about and try out your software .
Writing tests is also a great way to get to know new packages or software suites , you can take risks you would never imagine doing while developing code .
This method takes two scalars ?
I wonder what happens if I give it a 10.000 element list of japanese characters !
And let me repeat this :
Take on a project that is larger , more complex or more difficult than anything you ’ve built before .
Learn the right things
Some knowledge needs pre-requisite knowledge .
It ’s just a fact of life .
If you try to learn how to make 3d graphics , it will take you a lot longer if you do n’t know vector mathematics .
( And you might want to look at something other than Perl for implementation .. )
It ’s pretty obvious stuff .
What is less obvious is what the optimal learning direction in computer programming actually is .
In Perl , is there a learning run that is better than others ?
A sequence of reading perldocs that is more effective than another ?
I can certainly imagine some bad and good places to start , but everyone can do that .
What is more unclear is what happens after that start .
When you ’re half - good and can do what you want , but want to expand , what is the most optimal directions to follow ?
I actually do n’t have a good answer to that yet .
My only advice would be that if the terminology is getting too tricky , it is time to go back a step .
And not only to ..
Learn the terminology
When you meet a new term , do n’t fill in it ’s meaning from the context .
One of my own most immediate improvements in learning came from always immediately looking up words I do n’t understand .
I believe there usually is a reason I do n’t know the word , and often I ’ve had some surprises where my “ context fill - in ” actually was way off .
Also , as suggested above , it you ’re missing too much terminology , it might be a hint you are in over your head and need to gain the pre-requisite knowledge .
Learn something new outside Perl
Everyone will tell you this .
Stuck on Perl ?
Get some new vibes from Ruby .
Your C - coding is getting you down , try Scala ( should get you back to C soon enough ) .
And you can go further .
Adam Kennedy says he gets inspiration from places like TED conferences , New Scientist or Economist .
Some people will suggest just learning anything can get you out of a rut .
However , there is a condition .
If it is going to help your programming , it must involve some sort of domain - transferable skills .
Not everything new you learn will necessarily do that .
I ’ve been doing digital photography for nearly ten years and have gotten to a decent level .
It has absolutely not improved my programming in any way .
It is far too domain - specific .
Getting a degree in psychology , however , has plunged me forward on a lot of levels , from new learning skills to seeing new ways of solving problems and learning about how the brain does biological information processing .
Studying Zen sometimes provides me with a focus that is very conductive to understanding difficult subjects .
The same with learning mathematics , particularly discrete mathematics .
So consider well what you learn .
Pick the right thing , and you might gain a unique perspective on programming or just sharpen your thinking .
Pick the wrong thing and you are wasting good learning time on taking vacation shots .
Of course , you might want a whole and fulfilling life filled with culture and art too , but that ’s not what this text is about .
Accessing other peoples experience
Talk with people , and talk with them , not to them .
Unless you are Ada Lovelace or Charles Babbage and invented this stuff , learning programming involves transferring knowledge from another human ’s brain into your brain ( I know some of you will lament this fact ) .
One of the most effective ways of doing this , and the one way we are the most biologically disposed to , is talking combined with listening .
Reading is a hard - learnt skill that is piggy - backed on top of the visual system the last some - thousand years .
Conversation , on the other hand , has a significant part of your head dedicated to it .
Use that !
Study the code of excellent programmers and learn from it .
Avoid the code of bad programmers , and if you have to look at it , do n’t learn from it .
Perl is fantastic for this .
As well as being a great code repository , CPAN is also a fabulous learning resource .
In addition , the core modules are often very good and thorough code that has been optimized and looked after a lot .
If you bring your laptop on the train and lose the connection to the net , study a core module .
The problem of tacit knowledge .
A problem of accelerating training towards an expert level is that the real expert knowledge is not the same as the knowledge written down in documentation and books .
Rather , what actually sets a novice or an expert apart is unknown , or at least not explicitly known , to either .
If you just squeeze 10 years worth of reading into someone in five years , they might just still be at the 5 year level in real skill , but with a lot of knowledge they do n’t really know how to apply .
This is related to the concept of declarative or procedural memory , or that what you read and what you do is remembered in completely different ways and places in your brain .
That , for example , is what things like the “ variable roles ” mentioned in a previous post try to encode .
They find how experts understand and use variables , and try to teach that to beginners instead of giving them the basic intro and letting them get the experience the hard way .
How do this apply in a life - long learning perspective ?
Study the how and what people do , not only what they say ( or write ) .
Also : Study design patterns .
Do n’t necessarily base your own software designs on them , but know them , as they encode expert experience that previously was tacit .
Increase your physical learnability
Up until recently , we thought you grew new neurons ( brain cells ) up to certain age , then it stops and from then on it went down hill .
It is not the case .
At least in the hippocampus , which is the center of forming new memories , neurogenesis is found to take place all through life .
But there is a condition …
It takes physical exercise , namely aerobic training – that means running , biking , rowing or anything that makes you pant and sweat for an extended period of time .
I ’m sorry … but it will increase your learnability …
Furthermore , your brain needs the right chemicals to actually form new neurons .
One major compound that ca n’t be synthesized by your body from normal foodstuffs is omega - 3 fatty acids .
Omega - 3 is found repeatedly to increase general cognitive ability ( meaning higher processing power in your head ) under many conditions .
And you know you want more processing power as well as increased memory .
Omega - 3 fatty acids can usually be bought as pure capsules , or they can be found in salmon and walnuts if you want to eat that every day .
But be careful with the portioning .
Too high Omega - 3 dosages can lead to thinning of the blood , and while you might want to accelerate your Perl learning until your gum bleeds , you did n’t read that here .
And the last , but not least , point , is to be well rested .
The code - all - night pattern might work when you are teenager or young adult and physically do n’t need as much sleep .
After that , it will effectively decrease your hard - won cognitive abilities .
And more ?
Believe it or not , but I would actually like to expand on most of the points above and provide some more evidence and put some numbers to the claims above .
But I have to post my Perl Ironman 10 - day post and that effectively limits the time .
So , please share how you learn , or your advice to increase your learning rate .
I know some rather able Perl - programmers drop by here occasionally .
If you managed to become a guru , please share what you have done different .
Is it just a lot of years of experience ?
Or do you have a unique approach ?

$ 1.2 trillion could be saved by energy efficiency , according to a study released Wednesday by the consulting firm McKinsey , quoted by the International Herald Tribune .
According to the document the biggest opportunity to improve the energy situation of the US is through a major investment program to make homes and businesses more efficient .
An investment of $ 520 billion in improvements like sealing ducts and replacing inefficient appliances could produce $ 1.2 trillion in savings on energy bills , the study found , and all this by 2020 .
If carried out over the next decade , could cut the country ’s projected energy use in 2020 by about 23 percent , a savings that would be “ greater than the total of energy consumption of Canada , ” Ken Ostrowski , a senior partner in McKinsey ’s Atlanta office , said at a forum in Washington on Wednesday .
The study also says that homes account for about 35 percent of the potential efficiency gains .
The interesting thing is that the share of the industrial sector is just a little bigger than the domestic - 40 % and the commercial sector - 25 % .
But the document did not consider the potential environmental benefits of cutting energy use .
After the good news the authors of the study admit that one of the biggest barriers to achieving the savings is the initial costs , because the $ 52 billion annual investment envisioned by McKinsey is four or five times more than the nation currently spends on energy efficiency .
In the meantime , the IHT quotes another report released on Tuesday by the National Research Council , according to which potential energy savings of 15 percent by 2020 and 30 percent by 2030 if more efficient technologies were adopted .
Unlike McKinsey , the research council included transportation , acknowledging that it would be a difficult sector to transform quickly .

McLaren says it is yet to decide the identity of Lewis Hamilton 's 2010 team - mate .
Today 's confirmation that Fernando Alonso would make his long - anticipated move to Ferrari in 2010 has led to suggestions that McLaren will soon announce that Kimi Raikkonen will be returning to the Woking squad after a three - year absence to partner Hamilton next season .
But McLaren insisted that its second seat remained open at present .
" As is already in the public domain , Lewis Hamilton is contracted until the end of the 2012 season , " said a McLaren spokesman .
" As regards the identity of our other driver for 2010 and beyond , we have not yet made a decision . "
Hamilton 's current team - mate Heikki Kovalainen has had a disappointing 2009 season , struggling to match the world champion for race pace in particular .
Sources have suggested to AUTOSPORT that Raikkonen is close to deal to take Kovalainen 's place .
Raikkonen previously drove for McLaren from 2002 to 2006 - winning nine races and coming close to two world championships during this period - before leaving for Ferrari .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) —
The number of first - time claims for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly for the second straight week , a sign that jobs remain scarce even as other data show the U.S. economy is stabilizing .
Many economists expect the economy to grow at a modest pace in the second half of this year , bringing an end to the longest recession since World War II .
But jobs are likely to remain scarce and many analysts worry that persistently high unemployment could cause consumers to hold back on spending , threatening a recovery .
The Labor Department said Thursday the number of new jobless claims rose to a seasonally adjusted 576,000 last week , from a revised figure of 561,000 .
Wall Street economists expected a drop to 550,000 , according to a survey by Thomson Reuters .
Economists closely watch initial claims , which are considered a gauge of layoffs and an indication of companies ’ willingness to hire new workers .
“ Consumer spending is going to have a very difficult time recovering with the labor market as weak as it is , ” said Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc .
The Conference Board ’s index of leading economic indicators rose for a fourth straight month in July , gaining 0.6 percent .
That was slightly less than economists expected and a slower rate than in the prior three months .
Still , the Conference Board said its index , which is meant to project economic activity in the next three to six months , suggests the recession has bottomed out and growth in economic activity will begin soon .
Six of the 10 indicators that comprise the index increased in July , including employment data and stock prices .
Consumer expectations were the biggest negative factor .
Meanwhile , the Mortgage Bankers Association said more than 13 percent of American homeowners with a mortgage are either behind on their payments or in foreclosure , a record tally as the recession leaves more people unemployed .
About a third of new foreclosures between April and June were prime , fixed - rate loans , up from one in five a year earlier .
The jobless claims figures are volatile , and had been trending down , after remaining above 600,000 for most of this year .
The new report indicates that the labor market is still weak .
In a healthy economy , initial claims are usually around 325,000 or below .
The four - week average of initial claims , which smooths out fluctuations , rose for the second straight week to 570,000 .
The number of people remaining on the benefit rolls dropped by 2,000 to 6.24 million .
Analysts had expected a slight decline .
The continuing claims figures lag initial claims by a week .
The stock market rose slightly in morning trading .
The Dow Jones industrial average added about 35 points , while broader indices also edged up .
When federal emergency programs are included , the total number of jobless benefit recipients was 9.18 million in the week that ended Aug. 1 , the most recent data available .
That was down from 9.25 million in the previous week .
Congress has added up to 53 extra weeks of benefits on top of the 26 typically provided by the states .
The large number of people remaining on the rolls is an indication that unemployed workers are having a hard time finding new jobs .
Still , layoffs have slowed recently .
The department said earlier this month that companies cut 247,000 jobs in July , a large amount but still the smallest number in almost a year .
The unemployment rate dipped to 9.4 percent in July from 9.5 percent , its first drop in 15 months .
But many private economists and the Federal Reserve think the rates could top 10 percent by next year .
The recession , which began in December 2007 and is the longest since World War II , has eliminated a net total of 6.7 million jobs .
More job cuts were announced this week .
Bethesda , Md. - based defense contractor Lockheed Martin Corp. said it will eliminate about 800 jobs in its space systems division , and San Francisco - based video and audio conferencing company Polycom Inc. said it will cut 3 percent of its 2,600 person work force .
Among the states , Tennessee had the largest increase in claims with 2,525 for the week ended Aug. 8 , which it attributed to more layoffs in the transportation equipment , industrial machinery , and rubber and plastics industries .
The next largest increases were in North Carolina , Wisconsin , Georgia and Washington .
California reported the largest drop in claims of 5,635 , which it attributed to fewer layoffs in the construction , trade and service industries .
Michigan , Ohio , Kentucky and Delaware had the next largest decreases .

President Obama ’s risky perseverance on health care is running over another of his pet government expansions — the cap - and - trade bill sent by the House on June 26 for Senate consideration .
Recall that cap - and - trade is complex legislation with a very simple premise : make energy so expensive to consume that Americans use less of it , and “ greenhouse gas ” emissions are thereby curtailed .
But even though it ’s now clear the bill is not getting out of Congress , look for the Obama Administration to saddle our economy with this huge new energy tax through other means .
First , a brief flashback :
The blowback against Obamunism began over global warming , not health care .
By a squeaky 219 - 212 vote , the House rushed the 1,300 - page cap - and - trade opus out the door so the members could get back to the hustings for the Fourth of July .
When many freshman Democrats got home , those who voted for it experienced the first angry town halls of their careers .
In our minds , it is easy to remember that the rancorous public meetings that continued in the August recess were always about health care , but they were n’t .
So , given that health care is now effectively bottled up in both chambers of Congress , why is n’t Obama pushing cap - and - trade in the Senate ?
Simple : the votes are n’t there for it .
Blanche Lincoln , the new head of the Agriculture Committee , calls cap - and - trade a “ complete non starter ” and said that it is not her “ preference to move on cap and trade this year . ”
Majority Leader Harry Reid recently signaled his agreement by stating that cap - and - trade " may " not be considered until next year .
For cap - and - trade , “ next year ” translates as “ never . ”
Senators know what touched off the town halls , and they know what fate awaits many of their Democratic colleagues come November 2010 .
Passing an unpopular health care “ public option ” along with cap - and - trade will easily realign the Senate into its old filibustering self .
That kills cap - and - trade in the next Congress .
But do not despair , fans of economy - killing regulation .
Thanks to the Supreme Court ’s landmark decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency ( 2007 ) , the EPA has authority to issue its own regulations on carbon dioxide .
So while asking legislators to swallow hard on the bitter gristle of cap - and - trade , the president has really had the power to enact its core components on his own all along .
Small wonder lawmakers of his own party are more than willing to toss the issue back onto his plate .
Now that cap - and - trade has so spectacularly failed in the legislature , it is a sure bet that Obama will direct ( or has directed ) EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to issue her own cap - and - trade protocols .
Look for something concrete out of EPA before the U.N. ’s climate change confab in Copenhagen in early December .
( That “ something ” may even include a new fuel economy standard of 35.5 miles - per - gallon — though it would be lower , of course , for the inefficient cars produced by government - owned General Motors . )
The timing of the Copenhagen conference is really what has been driving Obama ’s support for cap - and - trade all along .
It would be an embarrassment for a left - hewing “ green ” president to show up empty - handed at such an event — and it will greatly diminish Obama ’s ability to wag his finger at other industrialized countries .
For sure , the world ’s largest emitter of CO2 — China — is n’t going to agree to any mandatory emissions reductions unless the U.S. has something very serious in hand .
And if China does nothing , there ’s simply not going to be a major slowdown in the growth of atmospheric greenhouse gases .
Not that it really matters .
The rather large elephants crowding cap - and - trade out of the Senate are the earth ’s reluctance to warm in the last decade along with new projections saying that we could go another ten years without much warming .
The current hiatus in warming portends a reduction in potential heating for the entire century .
Most computer models produce significant warming as a result of an increase in atmospheric water vapor ( a “ greenhouse ” gas ) , which comes from an ocean initially warmed by carbon dioxide .
When the ocean does n’t warm much , this “ feedback ” effect is delayed .
Or so goes the myth .
The lack of warming is an embarrassment to any elected official who has been hiding behind “ the science is settled ” fig leaf in order to promote cap - and - trade .
While every scientist will tell you that indeed the surface temperature of the planet is warmer than it was a century ago ( that ’s the “ settled ” part of global warming science ) , very few scientists anticipated as long a period without warming as we are in .
In other words , the real science of future warming is completely unsettled .
The bottom line is that Senate Democrats are perfectly happy to kick cap - and - trade under the bus .
They ’re going to have a hard enough time recovering from the upcoming health care wreck .
But the economy , meanwhile , will have an equally hard time recovering from what President Obama is going to do instead .
Glenn Beck was mad .
He ’s the right - wing talk radio host who has a television program on the Fox News Channel .
Advertisers were fleeing his Fox program en masse after the civil rights group Color of Change mounted a campaign urging advertisers to boycott Beck , who labeled President Barack Obama a “ racist . ”
As the campaign progressed , Beck began his attacks against Van Jones .
Jones was appointed by Obama in March to be special adviser for green jobs .
He co-founded Color of Change four years ago .
After weeks of attacks from Beck , Jones resigned his position at the White House last Sunday .
Beck said on “ Fox & Friends , ” the network ’s morning show , July 28 : “ This president I think has exposed himself as a guy over and over and over again who has a deep - seated hatred for white people . …
This guy is , I believe , a racist . ”
This inspired colorofchange.org to launch its campaign urging advertisers to drop their sponsorship of Beck ’s Fox program .
The campaign had a powerful impact , with companies like Progressive Insurance , Geico and Procter & Gamble immediately pulling their advertising .
Since then , more than 50 companies have joined , including Best Buy , Capital One , CVS , Discover , GMAC Financial Services , HSBC , Mercedes - Benz , Travelocity and Wal - Mart .
Van Jones was named one of Time magazine ’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2009 .
His book , “ The Green Collar Economy , ” was a national best - seller .
A Yale Law School graduate , Jones did n’t go after the lucrative jobs that were available to him , but moved to San Francisco , where he founded Bay Area PoliceWatch , a hot line for victims of alleged police brutality .
He then founded the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , based in Oakland , Calif. , “ a strategy and action center working for justice , opportunity and peace in urban America . ”
The center thrived , growing to a staff of more than 20 and building a solid record of fighting police violence and youth incarceration , along with spearheading green - job initiatives .
The fusion of racial justice and economic and environmental sustainability is at the core of Jones ’ work .
Jones told me last October : “ The clean energy revolution … would put literally millions of people to work , putting up solar panels all across the United States , weatherizing buildings so they do n’t leak so much energy … you could put Detroit back to work not making SUVs to destroy the world , but making wind turbines .
We think that you can fight pollution and poverty at the same time . ”
Beck alleged Jones was a former black nationalist and communist , that he signed a petition calling for a congressional investigation into the events of 9/11 , and that Jones referred to Republicans as “ assholes ” in a February 2009 talk .
( Beck failed to note that Jones referred to himself in the talk with the same term . )
Jones apologized for the remark , which is more than George W. Bush did when recorded referring to New York Times reporter Adam Clymer with the same term in 2000 .
Jones said Beck ’s attacks were a “ vicious smear campaign … using lies and distortions to distract and divide . ”
Ben Jealous , president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said , “ The only thing more outrageous than Mr. Beck ’s attack on Van Jones is the fact that there are sponsors that continue to pay him to provide this type of offensive commentary . ”
He recalled Beck ’s 2006 radio attack on a 7 - year - old African - American girl , when Beck , responding to her poem about her heritage , said : “ You want to go to Africa ?
I will personally purchase your airfare .
I ’ll do it .
It ’s one - way . ”
Glenn Beck may claim a notch in his belt , but he ’s also helped push Van Jones back into an arena where he can be much more effective , as a grass - roots organizer working for progressive change from outside the administration .
And with groups like the NAACP paying more attention to Beck , the advertiser boycott of his show is unlikely to just go away .

" You would n't even need to wash the beer off , it 's a fabric that dries immediately , " he told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
The shorts look remarkably like the real thing , with elaborately embroidered deer heads , a front bib and traditional side stitching .
They retail at € 79 , a fraction of the cost of the leather alternative .
Alpine traditionalists who last year complained about the growing trend towards cheap lederhosen imported from Asia may cry heresy at the sight of Kolb 's lederhosen .
After all , they 're manufactured in China and do n't contain a scrap of leather .
But Kolb insists he is helping to introduce Alpine traditions to younger generations , and is even exporting the region 's folk culture to a global audience .
Traditional lederhosen can cost up to €700 a pair , and one good beer spill can ruin them .
So what are you going to wear to Oktoberfest ?
Austrian restaurant owner Peter Kolb has an alternative : swim trunks he designed that look like lederhosen will be on sale during Oktoberfest in Munich .

The Democratic Republic of Congo is a tragedy .
It 's also a vast , organized scam .
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived there today .
If she does n't address the scam , the suffering will not end .
Congo is a tragedy for reasons that many know well , including the 5 million who have died from conflict since 1998 , the thousands gang - raped by soldiers and rebels , and nearly 2 million who 've been displaced from their homes .
Add to that a population of more than 60 million citizens suffering from the state 's chronic inability to provide safety , dignity , and anything close to development .
Progress has been painfully slow .
A so - called democratic transition , six years of postconflict intervention , billions in foreign aid , and some 20,000 UN soldiers have done little to end the violence .
A major reason for this tragedy is that Congo 's governance resembles a racket .
Its politicians and administrators are mostly corrupt , getting rich from keeping their state dysfunctional , and promoting local violence to serve their interests .
Throughout the country , people in positions of state authority systematically dominate and extract resources from those below them , all under the guise of sovereign power .
Congo presents Mrs. Clinton with the most daunting challenges and greatest opportunities of her seven - country trip to Africa .
Yet outsiders have too often made things worse by cajoling and rewarding rapacious politicians and soldiers , reinforcing rather than abating the authority of a criminal state .
Recent UN - supported operations against Rwandan Hutu rebels , for example , have encouraged the deployment of unpaid and poorly trained soldiers who loot , rape , and terrorize more than they protect .
Although Clinton will speak against " gender - based violence , " and Congress has approved a $ 15 million project for a " professional rapid reaction force " of Congolese trained in " the fundamental principles of respect for human rights , " this is unlikely to achieve much .
Soldiers terrorize because they , like other state officials , benefit from near total impunity ; they steal because their officers and politicians hijack their pay ; and they rape because it is an easy way to control and dominate civilians .
It is only by exposing and stopping the scam that Congo 's tragedy will end .
The more we contribute to rebuilding the state , however , the more we inadvertently restore authoritarianism , domination , and predation , features that have characterized Congo since its creation by Leopold II of Belgium in 1885 .
However failed a state Congo might be , Clinton must avert uncritically embracing its rebirth .
What can she do ?
First , she must exert vigorous pressure on Congo and Rwanda to neutralize once and for all the remaining 5,000 or so Hutu rebels and their genocidal leaders , who have wreaked havoc in the Kivu provinces since being chased out of Rwanda in 1994 .
In addition to their own atrocious exactions on local populations , these rebels have provided the trigger for larger conflicts in the area , and the motivation for the formation of many xenophobic Congolese militias .
The Rwandan Army is best suited to do this , and it should do so under the authority of the UN .
Belgium or France , which have significant historical responsibility in this conflict , should also participate .
United States Africa Command can play a logistical role and redeem itself from its association with botched operations against the Lord 's Resistance Army in northern Congo in 2008 .
Second , the current policy of integrating defecting rebels into an ever - growing and ever - more - dangerous military must be abandoned .
Eventually , the Kivu provinces must be demilitarized .
Yet no lasting peace will come until the power of the state to dominate and predate is curbed .
The US must more forcefully support Congolese human rights groups in pushing back the overwhelming culture of impunity .
Local self - help initiatives , which have sustained people during years of state truancy , must be encouraged as they provide the foundations of accountable state reconstruction .
Simultaneously , the legal authority of local state agents must be curtailed .
A land reform would deprive chiefs of the opportunity to give land to their ethnic kin , which feeds inter-communal grievances .
Finally , rather than sinking more aid in the quagmire of Congolese corruption , the US should help create a manufacturing sector that would deflate the importance of land and public office , and offer youth an alternative to warfare .
Congolese labor is cheap .
Rwanda , whose leadership has visions of becoming an African Singapore , could help create a free - trade zone with eastern Congo .
Congo would then become eligible for the many benefits of the US African Growth Opportunity Act , which Clinton has promoted throughout her trip .
Together , these efforts may finally give the country a fighting chance to escape misery .
Pierre Englebert , a professor of African politics at Pomona College , is the author of " Africa : Unity , Sovereignty , and Sorrow " as well as three other books on African politics .
He 's visited Congo four times , most recently in 2005 .
Women 's weight is more affected by their emotions study says Children with self - esteem problems are more likely to be obese as adults , a research team has found .
A study of 6,500 participants in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study found that 10 - year - olds with lower self esteem tended to be fatter as adults .
The effect was particularly true for girls , researchers from King 's College London reported .
One obesity expert said the results highlighted that early intervention was key to tackling obesity .
This is not about people with deep psychological problems , all the anxiety and low self - esteem were within the normal range
Professor David Collier , King 's College London
The children had their weight and height measured by a nurse at the age of 10 and they self - reported when they were 30 .
Their emotional states were also noted , the researchers reported in the journal BMC Medicine .
Children with a lower self - esteem , those who felt less in control of their lives , and those who worried often were more likely to gain weight over the next 20 years , the results showed .
Professor David Collier , who led the research , said : " What 's novel about this study is that obesity has been regarded as a medical metabolic disorder - what we 've found is that emotional problems are a risk factor for obesity .
" This is not about people with deep psychological problems , all the anxiety and low self - esteem were within the normal range . "
Strategies Another researcher , Andrew Ternouth , said : " While we cannot say that childhood emotional problems cause obesity in later life , we can certainly say they play a role , along with factors such as parental weight , diet and exercise .
" Strategies to promote the social and emotional aspects of learning , including the promotion of self - esteem , are central to a number of recent policy initiatives .
" Our findings suggest that approaches of this kind may carry positive benefits for physical health as well as for other aspects of children 's development . "
Dr Ian Campbell , of the charity , Weight Concern , said : " This study presents some disturbing evidence that , as we suspected , childhood psychological issues have an influence on future weight gain and health .
" Many of the adults we work with have identifiable underlying emotional and self esteem issues and are often resistant to treatment .
" The message here is that early intervention , in childhood , can be the key to combating adult obesity .
" That requires much more than health practitioners can deliver alone and needs greater alertness from parents , teachers , and anyone involved in the welfare of children . "

What 's It ?
Pyntch ( pron. " pinch " , originally means PYthoN Type CHecker ) is a static code analyzer for Python programming language .
It detects possible runtime errors before actually running a code .
If you have been constantly bothered by a TypeError or AttributeError caused by giving a wrong type of objects , Pyntch is a tool for you .
Pyntch examines a source code and infers all possible types of variables , attributes , function arguments , and return values of each function or method ( take a look at a sample output below ) .
Then it detects possible exceptions caused by type mismatch , attribute not found , or other types of exceptions raised from each function .
Unlike other Python code checkers ( such as Pychecker or Pyflakes ) , Pyntch does not address style issues .
Pyntch normally runs pretty fast .
It can perform checking for tens of thousands of lines of code within a minute .
Note : Pyntch currently supports Python 2.x only .
The following information can be gathered by static checking :
Possible types of objects that each variable , function argument or class attribte might potentially have .
Functions or instance methods that can be actually called at each function call ( considering polymorphism ) .
Calling locations for each function or method .
Uncaught exceptions such as : Type mismatch ( e.g. adding an integer and a string ) .
Access to undefined attributes ( e.g. obj.attr where obj does not have attribute attr ) .
Subscript access to unsubscriptable objects ( e.g. a [ 1 ] where a is not a sequence ) .
Calling something uncallable ( e.g. func ( 1 ) where func is not either function , method , or class ) .
Iteration over non-iterable objects ( e.g. sorted ( x ) where x is not an iterable object ) .
Sample Output :
( Original code )
import sys , os #
Count the total number of characters for each file in directory .
def countchars ( directory ) : n = 0 for name in os.listdir( directory ) : fp = open ( name ) for line in fp : n += line fp.fclose ( ) return n countchars ( sys.argv [ 1 ] )
( Annotated by Pyntch )
import sys , os #
Count the total number of characters for each file in directory .
def countchars ( directory ) : n = 0 for name in os.listdir( directory ) : fp = open ( name ) for line in fp : n += line fp.fclose ( ) return n countchars ( sys.argv [ 1 ] )
Background
Have you had a TypeError caused by giving a wrong type of arguments , say , a string object to numeric functions ?
Or trying to access a nonexistent method of a wrongly passed class that would otherwise have such a method ?
One of the great advantages of scripting languages such as Python is its dynamicity .
You can define any functions , variables and data structures whenever you want without elaborating the detailed type definitions .
However , this feature comes with some cost : sometimes it is difficult to find potential errors that are caused by type mismatch before actually running the program .
In a language like Python , there is always a risk of uncaught runtime exceptions that a programmer could not foresee when s/he was writing the code , which causes sudden death of the program .
This kind of behavior is particulary unfavorable for mission critical applications , so we want to catch these errors in advance .
Unfortunately , as the program gets larger , it 's getting hard to track these kinds of errors , and it 's even harder to prevent them by infering which types / values can be passed or returned by each function .
Pyntch aims to help reducing these burdens by infering what kind of types can be assigned to variables / members / function arguments and what kind of types can be returned from a function at any time of execution , and what kind of exceptions might be raised .
This is done by examining the code without executing it .
The goal of Pyntch is to try to analyze every possible execution path and all possible combinations of data .
Sounds impossible ?
Well , I can show you at least this is partially possible , by using a technique called " typeflow analysis . "
For the details , see How it works ?
section .
However , there 's also a couple of drawbacks .
Because the purpose of Pyntch is to catch as many obscure errors as possible before the code is acutally used in a production , it focuses on the coverage of the analysis at the expense of its accuracy .
Sometimes Pyntch brings a lot of false positives in its result , which need to be further examined by human programmers .
Install
Install Python 2.4 or newer .
Download the Pyntch source .
Extract it .
Run setup.py to install :
# python setup.py install Done !
How to Use
The main checking program is tchecker .py .
It comes in two different running modes : summary mode and annotation mode .
In summary mode , Pyntch only shows the types of each variable and exceptions in a succinct text format .
In annotation mode , there 're two stages .
First , the analyzer program produces an XML file that contains all information about a source code .
Then another program uses that information to annotate the source texts .
Summary Mode
The basic use of summary mode is pretty simple and straightforward .
Take this sample code :
$ cat -n sample .
py 1 import sys , os 2 3 # Count the total number of characters for each file in directory .
4 def countchars ( directory ) : 5 n = 0 6 for name in os.listdir( directory ) : 7 fp = open ( name ) 8 for line in fp : 9 n += line 10 fp.fclose ( ) 11 return n 12 13 countchars ( sys.argv [ 1 ] )
To check this code , simply run the tchecker .py against the source file :
$ tchecker .py sample .py loading : ' sample.py ' as ' sample ' ... total files=9 , lines =1435 in 0.38sec .........................................[ A ] [ sample ( sample.py ) ] os = < Module os ( /home/euske/work/ pyntch/ pyntch/stub/os.pyi ) > sys = < Module sys ( /home/euske/work/ pyntch/pyntch/stub/sys.pyi ) > # ## sample ( 4 ) ..............................................................[ B] # called at sample ( 13 ) .....................................................[ C ] def countchars ( directory = < str > ) : ...........................................[ D ] fp = < file > .............................................................. [ D] line = < str > .............................................................[ D] n = < int > ................................................................ [ D ] name = < str > .............................................................[ D ] return = < int > ...........................................................[ E ] raises TypeError : not supported operand Add( int , str ) at sample : 9 ........[ F ] raises AttributeError : attribute not found : @fp.fclose at sample :10 ...... [ G ] raises AttributeError : attribute not found : < file >. fclose at sample :10 ... [ H ]
The output shows several things :
[ A ] : The analyzer read 9 Python modules ( 1 target + 8 imported ) that have 1,435 lines in total .
The analysis took 0.38 seconds .
: The analyzer read 9 Python modules ( 1 target + 8 imported ) that have 1,435 lines in total .
The analysis took 0.38 seconds . [ B ] : Function countchars starts from line 4 in sample1.py .
: Function starts from line 4 in . [ C ] :
The function is called from line 13 .
: The function is called from line 13 . [ D ] :
This shows the possible type of each variable .
: This shows the possible type of each variable . [ E ] :
The function returns an integer .
: The function returns an integer . [ F ] :
The function might raise a TypeError exception at line 10 by attempting to add an integer and string .
: The function might raise a exception at line 10 by attempting to add an integer and string .
[ G ] : Attribute reference fp.fclose fails for any type of objects that fp could have contained .
: Attribute reference fails for any type of objects that could have contained . [ H ] :
A file object does not have fclose attribute .
( It should have been close instead . )
Annotation Mode
In annotation mode , first you need to run the analyzer program to produce the result in an XML format .
Then give the XML file to another program called annot.py .
This program inserts the analysis results into appropriate places in the source code , producing an annotated source text .
Step 1 :
$ tchecker -o output.xml sample .py loading : ' sample.py ' as ' sample ' ... total files=9 , lines =1435 in 0.40sec
output.xml
< output > < module src=" sample.py " name = " sample " > < var name = " os " >< compound id = " 0 " >< module name= " os " /></compound></var> < var name= " sys " >< compound id = " 0 " >< module name= " sys " /></ compound></var> < function loc= " sample : 4:5 " name= " countchars " > < caller loc= " sample :13 " /> < arg name = " directory " >< compound id = " 0 " >< str /></compound></arg> < var name = " fp " >< compound id = " 0 " >< file /></ compound></var> < var name = " line " >< compound id = " 0 " >< str /></ compound></var> < var name= " n " >< compound id = " 0 " >< int /></ compound></var> < var name = " name " >< compound id = " 0 " >< str /></compound></var> < return >< compound id = " 0 " >< int /></compound></return>
< raise msg=" TypeError : not supported operand Add( int , str ) " loc= " sample : 9 " type = " TypeError " /> < raise msg=" AttributeError : attribute not found : @ fp.fclose " loc= " sample :10 " type = " AttributeError " /> < raise msg=" AttributeError : attribute not found : < file>.fclose " loc= " sample :10 " type = " AttributeError " /> </ function > </ module > </output >
Step 2 :
$ annot .py output.xml sample .py # os = < module os > # sys = < module sys > import sys , os # Count the total number of characters for each file in directory .
def countchars ( directory ) : # directory = < str > # fp = < file > # line = < str > # n = < int > # name = < str > # return < int > n = 0 for name in os.listdir( directory ) : fp = open ( name ) for line in fp : # raise TypeError : not supported operand Add( int , str ) n += line # raise AttributeError : attribute not found : @fp.fclose # raise AttributeError : attribute not found : < file>.fclose fp.fclose ( ) return n countchars ( sys.argv [ 1 ] )
tchecker.py
tchecker .py is the main checking tool .
It scans Python source codes and shows the result of analysis .
The output can be later used for annotation purposes .
Syntax :
tchecker .py [ options ] file .py ...
Options :
-a Shows the result of all modules that are imported , instead of the ones specified in the command line arguments .
-c config_file Specifies a configuration file .
A configuration file is a Python script that defines parameters for ErrorConfig settings .
-C key=value Specifies a configuration parameter ( described below ) .
-d Increases the debug level .
- D
Ignore all the default Python module paths .
-f type Specifies the output format .
Currently txt ( summary mode ) or xml ( annotation mode ) is supported .
-o filename Specifies an output file name .
When it ends with " .xml " it automatically assumes the output format is XML .
-p > python_path
Adds a search path for Python modules .
Multiple -p options are allowed .
- P stub_path Adds a stub path for Python modules .
Stub files in these directories are always used instead of a real Python module .
Multiple - P options are allowed .
-q Quiet mode .
Suppresses to show the progress .
annot.py
annot .py is an annotation tool .
It takes an XML output of tchecker .py and combines it with the source codes to produce annotated output .
A source file can be specified either by an actual pathname or by a Python module name ( as used with a " import " statement ) .
When a pathname is used , the pathname string must be exactly the one contained in the " src " attribute in an XML output .
Syntax :
annot.py [ options ] output_xml file .py ...
annot.py [ options ] output_xml module_name ...
Options :
- p basepath Specifies the base pathname of source files which is to be prepended to relative pathnames contained in the output_xml file .
-d Increases the debug level .
Adding a Module Path
Pyntch can take module names instead of actual file names as input .
Pyntch searches the Python search path that is specified by PYTHONPATH environment variable , as well as stub path ( explained below ) .
If you want to instruct Pyntch to look at different locations , use -p option to alter the module search path :
$ tchecker .
py -p / path/to/your/modules mypackage.mymodule
Creating a Stub Module
Due to the nature of source level analysis , Pyntch cannot analyze a program that uses external modules , in which the behavior of the code is specified only in opaque binaries .
In that case , a user can instruct Pyntch to use an alternative " stub " module which is written in Python and defines only the return type of each function .
Python stub modules are similar to C headers , but a Python stub is a real Python code that basically does nothing than returning a particular type of objects that the " real " function would return .
For example , if a Python function returns an integer and a string ( depending on its input ) , its stub function looks like this :
def f( x ) : return 0 return ''
Python stub files end with " .pyi " in their file names .
They are usually placed in the default Python search path .
When a Python stub and its real Python module both exist , the stub module is checked .
Stub modules for several built - in modules such as sys or os . path are included in the current Pyntch distribution .
They are normally placed in the Pyntch package directory ( e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages ) and used by default instead of built - in Python modules .
Pyntch cannot correctly analyze a built - in function that returns different types of values depending on its parameters ( notably struct.unpack ) .
Putting Extra Constraints
It is possible to inform Pyntch that a certain variable can only have a specific type .
These constraints can be embedded in a source code using Python 's assert statement , as in :
$ cat -n assert1.py 1 def f( x ) : 2 assert isinstance (x , ( float , int ) ) 3 return x *2 4 5 f( 1 ) 6 f( 2.3 ) 7 f ( ' foo ' ) $ tchecker .py assert1.py [ assert1 ( assert1. py ) ] ### assert1( 1 ) # called at assert1 ( 5 ) # called at assert1 ( 7 ) # called at assert1 ( 6 ) def f( x= < float > | < int > ) : return = < float > | < int > raises TypeError : @x ( < str > ) must be int|float at assert1:2
Controlling warnings
Since Pyntch can produce a lot of information about a code , a user might be overwhelmed by the amount or complexity of its result .
Pyntch offers a couple of ways for controlling the outputs in order to provide the desired information .
Configuration parameters :
These are defined in ErrorConfig class ( config.py ) .
raise_uncertain ( boolean )
Include exceptions that might occur at runtime ( such as IndexError or IOError ) .
ignore_none ( boolean )
Supress warnings for operations against a None object .
show_all_exceptions ( boolean )
Displays all the possible uncatched exceptions for each function , including exceptions that occur indirectly inside the internal function calls .
Limitations
One of the major drawbacks of typeflow analysis is its inability to take account of execution order ( which is also true for dataflow analysis ) .
The sequence of statements is simply ignored and all the possible order is considered .
This is like considering every permutation of statements in a program and combining them into one .
This sometimes brings inaccuracy to its result in exchange for a comprehensiveness of the checking .
For example , consider the following two consecutive statements :
x = 1 x = 'a '
After executing these two statements , it is clear that variable x has always a string object , not an integer object .
However , due to the lack of awareness of execution order , Pyntch reports this variable might have two possible types : an integer and string .
Although we expect this kind of errors does not affect much to the overall usefulness of the report , we provide a way to supress this type of output .
Also , Pyntch cannot detect UnboundLocalError .
Another limitation is that Pyntch assumes the scope of each namespace is statically defined , i.e. all the names ( variables , functions , classes and attributes ) are written down in the source code .
Therefore a program that define or alter the namespace dynamically during execution cannot be correctly analyzed .
Basically , a code has to meet the following conditions :
not using globals ( ) or locals ( ) function , nor refering to or altering __dict__ member .
or function , nor refering to or altering member .
not using getattr or setattr .
or .
not using eval , compile or exec functions .
, or functions .
no metaclass programming .
How It Works
( This section is still way under construction . )
The basic mechanism of Pyntch is based on the idea of " typeflow analysis . "
This is similar to dataflow analysis , which gives the maximal set of possible data that are stored at each location ( either variable or continuation ) in a program .
First , it constructs a big connected graph that represents the entire Python program .
Every expression or statement is converted to a " node " , which is an abstraact place where certain type(s ) of data is stored or passed .
Then it tries to figure out what type of data goes from one node to another .
Let us consider a trivial example :
A = ' xyz ' B = 2 C = a*b
Given the above statements , Pyntch constructs a graph shown in Fig.
1 . A square shaped node is a " leaf " node , which represents a single type of Python object .
A round shaped node is a " compound " node , which is a place that one or more types of objects can be potentially stored .
Now , the data stored at the top two leaf nodes , which are a string and an integer object respectively , flow down to the lower nodes and each node passes the data according to the arrow .
Both objects are " mixed " at the plus sign node , which produces a string object ( because in Python multiplying a string and an integer gives a repreated string ) .
Eventually , the object goes into variable c , which is the node at the bottom .
This way , you can infer the possible type of each variable .

Handling Dynamicity
Now take an example that involves a function :
def foo(x ) : return x+1 def bar(y ) : return y* 2 f = foo z = f( 1 ) f = bar z = f ( 2 )

A word about moonlight
Most important : a dark sky
Know your dates and times
Where to go to watch a meteor shower
What to bring with you
Are the predictions reliable ?
Remember …
January 4 , 2020 , before dawn , the Quadrantids
The Quadrantids can produce over 100 meteors per hour , but the narrow peak of this shower lasts only a few hours and does n’t always come at an opportune time .
The radiant point is in the part of the sky that used to be considered the constellation Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant .
You ’ll find this radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism ( chart here ) , in the north - northeastern sky after midnight and highest up before dawn .
Because the radiant is fairly far to the north on the sky ’s dome , meteor numbers tend to be greater at northerly latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere .
In 2020 , watch in the wee hours – after midnight and before dawn – on January 4 .
The moon is somewhat past first quarter phase , providing moon - free viewing in the predawn hours for 2020 ’s Quadrantid meteor shower .
Everything you need to know : Quadrantid meteor shower
April 22 , 2020 , before dawn , the Lyrids
The Lyrid meteor shower – April ’s shooting stars – lasts from about April 16 to 25 .
About 10 to 15 meteors per hour can be expected around the shower ’s peak , in a dark sky .
The Lyrids are known for uncommon surges that can sometimes bring the rate up to 100 per hour .
Those rare outbursts are not easy to predict , but they ’re one of the reasons the tantalizing Lyrids are worth checking out .
The radiant for this shower is near the bright star Vega in the constellation Lyra ( chart here ) , which rises in the northeast at about 10 p.m. on April evenings .
In 2020 , we expect the peak viewing hours to take place in the dark hours before dawn April 22 , with no moon to ruin the show .
Everything you need to know : Lyrid meteor shower
May 5 , 2020 , before dawn , the Eta Aquariids
This meteor shower has a relatively broad maximum ; you can watch it the day before and after the predicted peak morning of May 5 .
Yet the nearly - full waxing gibbous moon is sure to dampen this year ’s production .
The shower favors the Southern Hemisphere and is often that hemisphere ’s best meteor shower of the year .
The radiant is near the star Eta in the constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer ( click here for chart ) .
The radiant comes over the eastern horizon at about 4 a.m. local time ; that is the time at all locations across the globe .
For that reason , you ’ll want to watch this shower in the hour or two before dawn , no matter where you are on Earth .
In the southern half of the U.S. , 10 to 20 meteors per hour might be visible in a dark sky .
Farther south – at latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere – you might see two to three times that number on a dark , moonless night .
Meanwhile , at northerly latitudes – like those in the northern U.S. and Canada , or northern Europe – meteor numbers are lower for this shower .
In 2020 , the almost - full moon will be out nearly all night long , providing almost no dark sky for meteor watching .
The most meteors will probably rain down in the predawn sky on May 5 – though in a moonlit sky !
The broad peak to this shower means that some meteors may fly for a few days before and after the predicted optimal date .
Everything you need to know : Eta Aquariid meteor shower
Late July 2020 , before dawn , the Delta Aquariids
Like the Eta Aquariids in May , the Delta Aquariid meteor shower in July favors the Southern Hemisphere and tropical latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere .
But these meteors can be seen from around the world .
These faint meteors appear to radiate from near the star Skat or Delta in the constellation Aquarius the Water Bearer .
The maximum hourly rate can reach 15 to 20 meteors in a dark sky .
The nominal peak is around July 27 - 30 , but , unlike many meteor showers , the Delta Aquariids lack a very definite peak .
Instead , these medium - speed meteors ramble along fairly steadily throughout late July and early August .
An hour or two before dawn usually presents the most favorable view of the Delta Aquariids .
At the shower ’s peak on or near July 28 , 2020 , the rather faint Delta Aquariid meteors will be best seen in the predawn hours , after the moon has set .
You ’ll still be seeing Eta Aquariids when the Perseids peak in August .
Everything you need to know : Delta Aquariid shower
Late evening to dawn on August 11 , 12 and 13 , 2020 , the Perseids
The Perseid meteor shower is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere .
It ’s a rich meteor shower , and it ’s steady .
These swift and bright meteors radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus the Hero .
As with all meteor shower radiant points , you do n’t need to know Perseus to watch the shower ; instead , the meteors appear in all parts of the sky .
These meteors frequently leave persistent trains .
Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into midnight , and typically produce the most meteors in the wee hours before dawn .
In 2020 , the peak night of this shower will be somewhat marred by the last quarter moon , although the brighter Perseids will likely overcome the moonlit glare .
Predicted peak in 2020 : the night of August 11 - 12 , but try the nights before and after , too , from late night until dawn .
All you need to Know : Perseid meteor shower
October 7 , 2020 , nightfall and evening , the Draconids
The radiant point for the Draconid meteor shower almost coincides with the head of the constellation Draco the Dragon in the northern sky .
That ’s why the Draconids are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere .
The Draconid shower is a real oddity , in that the radiant point stands highest in the sky as darkness falls .
That means that , unlike many meteor showers , more Draconids are likely to fly in the evening hours than in the morning hours after midnight .
This shower is usually a sleeper , producing only a handful of languid meteors per hour in most years .
But watch out if the Dragon awakes !
In rare instances , fiery Draco has been known to spew forth many hundreds of meteors in a single hour .
In 2020 , watch the Draconid meteors at nightfall and early evening on October 7 .
Try the nights of October 6 and 8 , too .
Fortunately , the waning gibbous moon wo n’t rise till late evening , providing moon - free viewing for several hours after nightfall .
All you need to know : Draconids in 2020
October 21 , 2020 , before dawn , the Orionids
On a dark , moonless night , the Orionids exhibit a maximum of about 10 to 20 meteors per hour .
More meteors tend to fly after midnight , and the Orionids are typically at their best in the wee hours before dawn .
These fast - moving meteors occasionally leave persistent trains .
The Orionids sometimes produce bright fireballs , which can overcome some moonlight in years when the moon intrudes .
If you trace these meteors backward , they seem to come from the Club of the famous constellation Orion the Hunter .
In 2020 , the waxing crescent moon sets in the evening , providing moon - free viewing for rest of the night .
With no moon to ruin the show , try watching the Orionids in the wee hours before dawn on October 21 and 22 .
Everything you need to know : Orionid meteor shower
Late night November 4 until dawn November 5 , 2020 , the South Taurids
The meteoroid streams that feed the South ( and North ) Taurids are very spread out and diffuse .
Thus the Taurids are extremely long - lasting ( September 25 to November 25 ) but usually do n’t offer more than about five meteors per hour .
That is true even on their peak nights .
The Taurids are , however , well known for having a high percentage of fireballs , or exceptionally bright meteors .
Plus , the two Taurid showers – South and North – augment each other .
In 2020 , the expected peak night of the South Taurid shower happens when a waning gibbous moon lights up the sky almost all night long .
Peak viewing is just after midnight , though under the glaring light of a bright waning gibbous moon .
The South and North Taurid meteors continue to rain down throughout the following week , but with more interference from the waxing gibbous moon !
Late night November 11 until dawn November 12 , 2020 , the North Taurids
Like the South Taurids , the North Taurids meteor shower is long - lasting ( October 12 – December 2 ) but modest , and the peak number is forecast at about five meteors per hour .
The North and South Taurids combine to provide a nice sprinkling of meteors throughout October and November .
Typically , you see the maximum numbers at around midnight , when Taurus the Bull is highest in the sky .
Taurid meteors tend to be slow - moving , but sometimes very bright .
In 2020 , the slender waning crescent moon – rising in the wee hours before dawn – wo n’t seriously intrude on the peak night of November 11 ( morning of November 12 ) .
November 17 , 2020 , before dawn , the Leonids
Radiating from the constellation Leo the Lion , the famous Leonid meteor shower has produced some of the greatest meteor storms in history – at least one in living memory , 1966 – with rates as high as thousands of meteors per minute during a span of 15 minutes on the morning of November 17 , 1966 .
Indeed , on that beautiful night in 1966 , the meteors did , briefly , fall like rain .
Some who witnessed the 1966 Leonid meteor storm said they felt as if they needed to grip the ground , so strong was the impression of Earth plowing along through space , fording the meteoroid stream .
The meteors , after all , were all streaming from a single point in the sky – the radiant point – in this case in the constellation Leo the Lion .
Leonid meteor storms sometimes recur in cycles of 33 to 34 years , but the Leonids around the turn of the century – while wonderful for many observers – did not match the shower of 1966 .
And , in most years , the Lion whimpers rather than roars , producing a maximum of perhaps 10 - 15 meteors per hour on a dark night .
Like many meteor showers , the Leonids ordinarily pick up steam after midnight and display the greatest meteor numbers just before dawn , for all points on the globe .
In 2020 , the moon will display a waxing crescent phase , and set at early evening , to provide moon - free skies nearly all night long .
The expected peak night is from late night November 16 till dawn November 17 .
The Leonids tend to produce the most meteors in the predawn hours , at which time the moon will be long gone .

December 13 - 14 , 2020 , mid-evening until dawn , Geminids
Radiating from near the bright stars Castor and Pollux in the constellation Gemini the Twins , the Geminid meteor shower is one of the finest meteors showers in the Northern Hemisphere ( though still visible , at lower rates , in the Southern Hemisphere ) .
The meteors are plentiful , rivaling the August Perseids .
They are often bold , white and bright .
On a dark night , you can often catch 50 or more meteors per hour .
The greatest number of meteors fall in the wee hours after midnight , centered around 2 a.m. local time ( the time on your clock no matter where you are on Earth ) , when the radiant point is highest in the sky .
In 2020 , the peak of the shower almost coincides with new moon , providing dark skies all night long .
Watch the usually reliable and prolific Geminid meteor shower from mid-evening December 13 until dawn December 14 , with absolutely no moonlight to ruin the show .

December 22 , 2020 , before dawn , the Ursids
Die -hard meteor watchers in the Northern Hemisphere watch for Ursid meteors about a week after the Geminids .
This low - key meteor shower is active each year from about December 17 to 26 .
The Ursids usually peak around the December solstice , perhaps offering 5 to 10 meteors per hour during the predawn hours in a dark sky .
This year , in 2020 , the first quarter moon will set in the evening , providing dark skies at late night and the morning hours .
Ursid meteors peak around December solstice
A word about moonlight .
In 2020 , moonlight poses no problem for the April Lyrids , November Leonids and December Geminids .
The moon wo n’t seriously interfere with the October Draconids , October Orionids or November North Taurids .
Some moon - free viewing time accompanies the January Quadrantids and July Delta Aquariids in the predawn sky , and the August Perseids in the evening sky .
On the other hand , a nearly full moon obstructs the May Eta Aquariids , while a bright waning gibbous moon obstructs the November South Taurids .

Most important : a dark sky .
Here ’s the first thing – the main thing – you need to know to become as proficient as the experts at watching meteors .
That is , to watch meteors , you need a dark sky .
It ’s possible to catch a meteor or two or even more from the suburbs .
But , to experience a true meteor shower – where you might see several meteors each minute – avoid city lights .
EarthSky ’s Stargazing page shows dark locations worldwide .
Know your dates and times .
You also need to be looking on the right date , at the right time of night .
Meteor showers occur over a range of dates , because they stem from Earth ’s own movement through space .
As we orbit the sun , we cross “ meteor streams . ”
These streams of icy particles in space come from comets moving in orbit around the sun .
Comets are fragile , icy bodies that litter their orbits with debris .
When this cometary debris enters our atmosphere , it vaporizes due to friction with the air .
If moonlight or city lights do n’t obscure the view , we on Earth see the falling , vaporizing particles as meteors .
Where to go to watch a meteor shower .
You can comfortably watch meteors from many places , assuming you have a dark sky : a rural back yard or deck , the hood of your car , the side of a road .
State parks and national parks are good bets , but be sure they have a wide open viewing area , like a field ; you do n’t want to be stuck in the midst of a forest on meteor night .
An EarthSky friend , veteran meteor - watcher and astrophotographer Sergio Garcia Rill , also offers this specific advice :
… you might want to give it a try but do n’t know where to go .
Well , in planning my night photoshoots I use a variety of apps and web pages to know how dark the sky is in a certain location , the weather forecast , and how the night sky will look .

What to bring with you .
You do n’t need special equipment to watch a meteor shower .
If you want to bring along equipment to make yourself more comfortable , consider a blanket or reclining lawn chair , a thermos with a hot drink , binoculars for gazing at the stars .
Be sure to dress warmly enough , even in spring or summer , especially in the hours before dawn .
Binoculars are fun to have .
You wo n’t need them for watching the meteor shower , but , especially if you have a dark sky , you might not be able to resist pointing them at the starry sky .
Are the predictions reliable ?
Although astronomers have tried to publish exact predictions in recent years , meteor showers remain notoriously unpredictable .
Your best bet is to go outside at the times we suggest , and plan to spend at least an hour , if not a whole night , reclining comfortably while looking up at the sky .
Also remember that meteor showers typically do n’t just happen on one night .
They span a range of dates .
So the morning before or after a shower ’s peak might be good , too .
Remember … meteor showers are like fishing .
You go , you enjoy nature … and sometimes you catch something .
Peak dates are derived from data published in the Observer ’s Handbook by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and Guy Ottewell ’s Astronomical Calendar .
Bottom line :
Look here for information about all the major meteor showers between now and the year ’s end .
There are some good ones !

Almost everyone believes in an accused person ’s right to a trial by jury — it ’s in the Constitution , after all — but almost everyone also dreads receiving a jury summons in the mail .
It ’s conscription , but into the justice system instead of the military , and it could mean anything from one wasted day to a lengthy sequestration .
The prospective juror is helpless before the long arm of the law .
This past Tuesday I had my first experience with jury duty in nearly 20 years of eligibility , almost 15 of them spent in the same county .
Had I any doubts about the viability or necessity of private courts before this week , that experience has surely banished them forever .
In fact , the entire day I kept saying to myself , " No private court would ever operate like this .
It would go bankrupt in no time flat . "
I even managed to convince a fellow prospective juror over lunch that private courts would be superior to government courts ; our shared experience , however , did most of the convincing .
I was summoned to serve as a juror for Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , which includes the city of Pittsburgh , where the courthouse is located .
I received the summons several weeks prior to my mandated appearance .
The summons , though , did not specify that I would definitely have to appear on September 8 , only that I must appear if so ordered .
I had to wait until after 4:00 PM on the business day prior to my scheduled appearance to find out if I actually had to show up .
Unfortunately , I did .
On the morning of September 8 I had to leave my productive employment behind and make my way to a parking garage in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour , then walk from there to the courthouse .
Upon arrival at 8:30 I had to turn in my summons and listen to the woman in charge drone through a long list of instructions and explanations .
Among the explanations was the fact that when we arrived she had no idea how many cases requiring a jury would come up that day , or even if any would .
Furthermore , some cases on the day ’s docket that at first had requested a jury might turn out not to need one after all .
In other words , we could potentially have been sitting there all day for absolutely nothing .
We were then given a " diversity " survey to complete so that the court could make sure they did n’t get too many white males — er , so that they could ensure a fair distribution of various ethnicities among the jury pool .
We were also given another questionnaire to complete and retain until such time as we were selected for a jury .
It contained questions about whether we had been convicted of crimes or victimized by crime ( the state ’s daily crimes against us not included , of course ) , whether we knew any victims of crime , etc .
Two of my answers were most likely guaranteed to get me thrown off any jury : ( 1 ) that I would not be more likely to accept a police officer ’s word because of his or her job , and ( 2 ) that I would be less likely to accept a police officer ’s word because of his or her job ( reading Will Grigg ’s columns will do that to a person ) .
The defense attorney would probably have loved those answers , but no district attorney worth his salt would let a state - hater such as I on a jury .
A judge entered the room and read through another list of instructions .
Bully Boy : The Truth A... Jim Powell Best Price : $ 3.12 Buy New $ 17.99 ( as of 11:10 EST - Details )
For the rest of the morning we just sat there in a hot room .
Some people read ; some chatted with their neighbors ; other stared at the walls until they fell asleep .
I read Jim Powell ’s excellent book Bully Boy : The Truth About Theodore Roosevelt ’s Legacy .
Around 11:50 , the woman returned and told us there was a case coming up at 1:30 , so we should leave for lunch and return by then .
When we returned from lunch , having already wasted five hours of the day , we resumed our morning activities .
Finally , around 2:30 , they began selection of the first jury .
Thirty - five people were randomly selected and moved to chairs in the front of the room .
The case was reviewed , and the 35 selected jurors were asked a series of questions to determine if they would bring any biases to the case .
Then each juror was questioned individually by the prosecutor and the defense attorney .
Ultimately 14 people — 12 regular jurors plus 2 alternates — would be selected from the 35 .
While the attorneys were interviewing the prospective jurors , another group of those who had n’t been selected for the first jury were called to another room .
I could n’t determine whether they were being sent home for the day or called for another jury , but the number seemed about right for another jury .
The rest of us , a dozen or so , were sent down to the county treasurer ’s office to pick up our pay — nine dollars plus mileage — and dismissed shortly after 3:00 .
Even the casual observer can spot all the waste and inefficiency in such a process .
Begin with the monetary cost .
First there ’s the cost of administration , always high when run by the government .
The visible costs , however , include the cost of mailing every summons , the pay for each juror , and the cost of mailing thank - you letters from the judge ( yes , I got one a couple days later ) to everyone who shows up .
( Those who do n’t show up get a much less friendly notice . )
There were about 80 to 85 prospective jurors on September 8 ; let ’s use 85 as our average daily attendance .
Let ’s assume that on an average day two juries are selected , each consisting of 14 people .
That leaves 57 people who are not needed .
Those 57 still get paid , however ; it probably averages to $ 10 per person , and quite possibly higher .
That means on an average day the county is paying out $ 570 for exactly nothing .
Multiply that by 5 days a week and 52 weeks in a year ( we ’ll ignore all the government ’s holidays ) , and that means the county is disbursing a whopping $ 148,200 a year for people to sit around all day .
Now imagine how long a private court would last if it poured money down the drain like that !
Its owners , after all , would not have the luxury of simply extorting more money from people in the surrounding area to cover those costs .
In fact , in a system of private courts , there would likely be a variety of approaches taken to settling disputes .
Some courts might have each case heard by a single judge ; others might have a small panel ; still others might opt for a full jury .
Those that opted for jury trials would then have more than one way of selecting jurors .
Some might rely on volunteers , while others might have paid , professional jurors on staff or call upon a pool of jurors acting as independent contractors .
Not one , I think it safe to say , would herd 100 or so people into a room every day without first knowing whether those people would be needed .
Would a private court force prospective jurors to wait until the day before their scheduled appearance to find out if they were actually needed ?
Some might , but prospective jurors would know that and agree to that condition in advance ; such on - call jurors might well command a higher wage than those on a regular schedule .
Would a private court be so completely in the dark about how many juries it would need to select on a given day at the beginning of that very day ?
One suspects not .
More likely the court would have settled on the need for a jury ahead of time and would have scheduled the necessary jurors for the date when they would be needed .
It certainly could n’t afford to pay so many people to twiddle their thumbs all day , especially at market rates , with the strong potential of their not being needed at all .
Trials might even be scheduled around when jurors were available , rather than the reverse , as is the case with government courts .
Furthermore , would a private court really want rank amateurs , who do n’t understand the intricacies of law and court precedents , to act as jurors ?
The current system tends to select the most uninformed individuals , those who have no knowledge of what ’s going on in the world and have no opinions on anything of significance .
Professional jurors would have to be knowledgeable and , probably , opinionated .
This does not mean that they would let their biases influence their judgment — on the contrary , a biased juror would soon find himself out of work — but that they would have definite opinions about justice and apply those opinions to the cases they decide .
We would not find many professional jurors who use their positions to " send a message " to people they dislike , as jurors did in the Martha Stewart case , for example .
They would be hired and retained on the basis of their evenhandedness .
Neither can one imagine a private court hiring security guards who treat visitors as unkindly as the cops at government courts .
I had to pass through a metal detector to enter the courthouse , of course .
In the morning the cop did n’t really say anything ; she just waited for me to empty my pockets and put my belongings on the conveyor belt .
When I returned from lunch and entered through a different door , the cop at that door asked , " Are you wearing a belt ? "
I very politely replied , " Yes , but I went through this morning with it on . "
I should say I tried to reply that way , for the state ’s minion cut me off in midsentence and barked , " I said , u2018 Are you wearing a belt ?!’ "
The implication was clear : submit or be cited for " disorderly conduct " or , worse , be electrocuted by a " non-lethal " weapon .
No private court would treat its customers as bugs to be squashed .
Finally , there ’s the perennial issue of the seen versus the unseen .
The average American , having read this , might say , " At least the current system does provide us with jurors to conduct trials , even if it does waste a lot of time and money doing so .
What ’s the big deal of having to take a day off work for such an important duty ? "
This ignores the fact that every day all across the country thousands of people are forced to spend all day more or less locked in a room on the off chance that they might be selected for a jury , and of those thousands probably two thirds or more will have spent the entire day in that room in vain .
While we can see the people who were selected for juries , we cannot see all the productivity lost to the private sector because so many people were compelled to waste a whole day in a courthouse ; and those who are selected will lose even more productive time .
Few object to the idea of trial by jury , and no one , to my knowledge , objects to having some system for arbitrating disputes .
The question is , should this function be handled by the government , which will invariably perform it in the most costly , wasteful , inefficient manner and almost certainly fail to accomplish the objective of administering true justice ; or should it be handled by private courts , which will perform it much more cheaply and efficiently and must administer true justice or go out of business ?
After one day of jury duty , my verdict is clear : get the government out of the justice business .

It is easiest to make new friends when you consistently see the same people day after day .
Think back over the times in your life when you had friends -- most likely you were spending lots of time with the same people .
It also helps if these individuals share your values , beliefs and interests .
Use this information to nurture new friendships , by signing up for a course or class that interests you and that will have you meeting with the same people regularly over an extended period of time , recommends psychologist Daniel J. Tomasulo , in the Psych Central article " Friendless and Alone . "
For example , you might join a book club , take an acting class or participate in a co-ed volleyball league .
Activities that are fun or that require you to get to know each other will make it easiest to make new friends .
The captain of the anti-whaling ship , the Steve Irwin , has been arrested in Portugal on an outstanding 30 - year - old arrest warrant .
Paul Watson was arrested at Madiera airport as he arrived for this week 's meeting of the International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) in Portugal .
The Australian director of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society , Jeff Hansen , says Mr Watson was released after four hours of questioning .
" This warrant was actually issued back in 1980 , which was in response to Sea Shepherd ramming and later scuttling the pirate whaler the Sierra , " he said .
" Then Paul had lengthy discussions with the police in northern Portugal and they determined that the warrant had actually expired in 2008 so there was no valid reason for them to hold him . "
Mr Watson says he was released after authorities discovered the warrant for his arrest had expired .
" A little surprised because I 've come and gone in Portugal many times and so suddenly why this happened I do n't know , " he said .
" But it was like last year in Chile , I was hassled a bit ...
Chileans told me it was because Japan had put in a complaint and they wanted to question me about what I was doing at the International Whaling Commission meeting .
" So I 'm not really quite sure if Japan was behind this . "

AN autistic Swindon boy has become an internet hit thanks to his series of online games .
Jack Booth , 11 , of Beech Avenue , Pinehurst , has created scores of games to challenge players around the world – including City Of The Dead , which no player has managed to complete in over 2,000 attempts .
Now Jack hopes his achievements will help to challenge perceptions of autism .
“ I would like to show people they should n’t be scared to be friends with me , ” said Jack .
The Swindon Academy pupil was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) three years ago .
He has always struggled to make friends , according to his mum Tracey .
“ The other children think he ’s weird because all he wants to do is learn , ” she said .
“ He has told me that some of the children thought they could catch ASD from him .
“ There is definitely not enough understanding about autism – from children and adults .
“ I used to apologise for the way he was but now I do n’t – why should I ?
“ He ’s a joy to have as a son and I ’m very proud of him . ”
Jack has been advanced from a very early age and Tracey has always been keen to support his twin passions of technology and cars .
The Ferrari - obsessed youngster has already passed his driving theory test – at the age of nine – and has become an online sensation with his games .
He said : “ I can create them in about half an hour .
For some people it can take them days .
People from all over the world have played them .
“ I think the fact that I am very organised and I can focus very clearly on things is one of the reasons that I ’m good at making the games . ”
Jack ’s latest game has already outfoxed seasoned gamers across cyberspace and he is keen to accept challenges from Adver readers .
“ It ’s designed so there ’s so much going on that it ’s a real challenge – even for people who are really good at these games , ” he said .
“ I ’d like to see if anyone can ever complete it . ”
Anyone who would like take on the role of Steven Laver and tackle the treacherous City Of The Dead can go to www.sploder.com/ games/members/ferrarif50 man .
Jack ’s other games include Defeat the Swine Flu and Death Mountain .
He is now hoping to enlarge his online empire by setting up his own website featuring games , blogs and videos .

Scary music plays a key role in ramping up the fear factor in movies .
The soundtrack has such an effect that I put my hands over my ears during the most frightening moments .
Now researchers at Tel Aviv University report that scary music is even scarier if you shut your eyes .
In research published in the Public Library of Science ONE , they say this effect may lead to new ways to treat neurological diseases .
Volunteers listened to Hitchcock - style music twice : once eyes open and once eyes shut .
With eyes closed , their amygdalas lit up .
That ’s the region of our brains that processes emotions .
Volunteers said they also felt the emotional effects of the music much more in the dark .
Scientists say shutting our eyes might synch up different brain activities , allowing our brains to “ better integrate the highs and lows of the emotional experience . ”
The researchers hope that these findings could lead to music - based therapies for conditions like depression and schizophrenia .
As for me , during some of those scary movie scenes , music does sneak through my hands into my ears — good thing I leave my eyes open .

Writing Urdu ( major language of Pakistan / India ) on PC requires good amount of effort if you are new to it .
The keyboards are mainly designed for English and Urdu is handled as a secondary script .
That ’s the reason why we do n’t see much content on Urdu over internet , despite of many different tools and huge development in Arabic script fonts .
Google recently came in to business and launched “ Transliteration ” services .
Transliteration means changing of script from one system to the other , followed by rules specific to the script .
Treat this tool just as you chat in your own language but use English letters .
For example instead of writing “ My name is Hamza ” we write “ Mera naam hamza hai “ .
So with this tool whenever you writer mera naam hamza hai it will convert it into Urdu .
Currently the tool is available for 10 other languages .
Now many chat problems will be solved when people use their own language to communicate but uses English letters .
This tool will be beneficial for them as well as for Urdu writers .
Right now , Google Transliteration is in experimental stages and will get better by the user feedback .

The race to control Opel is between two firms
The board of US carmaker General Motors has postponed making a decision on who should buy its Opel division , which includes Vauxhall in the UK .
The Detroit - based firm said directors had met on Friday to discuss the options but " no decision was taken " .
An assessment on whether to start exclusive talks to buy German - based Opel had been expected at the weekend .
The race to control Opel is between the Canadian component manufacturer Magna and Belgian financial group RHJ .
The BBC understands that a number of stumbling blocks have emerged to delay the final decision .
The German government - which has openly preferred the bid from Magna and has offered it bridging finance of 4.5 bn euros ( $ 6.4bn , £ 3.9 bn ) - is thought to have added further conditions to that support .
Magna has publicly promised to cut fewer jobs in Germany , where 25,000 people are currently employed in the division .
Buy - back option Germany 's economy minister said he regretted the failure to make a decision .
Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg was also quoted as telling the online edition of the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper that " there is still room for an agreement " .
UK Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has been critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel for politicising the bidding contest ahead of federal elections in the country , at the end of September .
Earlier this week Lord Mandelson said GM needed to look for an " industrial outcome based on the long term viability " of Opel .
Lord Mandelson has also said he would stand by the UK carmaking industry - in particular Vauxhall , which employs more than 5,000 people directly in its plants in Ellesmere Port , Cheshire , and Luton , Bedfordshire .
He did not specify what level of financial support , if any , would be provided and he has also warned there would be some job losses irrespective of who gains control of Vauxhall .
There is also speculation that GM , which only recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy with a host of new US government - appointed board members , may prefer to exercise a buy - back option in the future .
That could see it re-acquiring Opel and Vauxhall within a few years at an advantageous price - an option which may be unpalatable to any potential buyers .
German media has also reported that GM may be also toying with the idea of placing Opel into insolvency , though that was played down on Saturday by a spokesman for the US company .

French growers say cheaper imports are threatening their survival France says its fruit and vegetable growers will have to start paying back hundreds of millions of euros in subsidies deemed illegal by the EU .
But French Agriculture Minister Bruno Le Maire said the repayments would be discussed on a case - by - case basis .
In January the European Commission said France would have to recover more than 330 m euros ( £ 280 m ) in state aid which was " incompatible with the market " .
The French growers say they are in a crisis and will not repay the funds .
When interest charges are added to what the Commission calls the " market distorting " French subsidies the total comes to about 500 m euros .
France , the biggest beneficiary from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy , was criticised by the Commission for state aid granted in 1992 - 2002 to deal with crises in the fruit and vegetable sector .
The French " contingency plans " for farmers were " a kind of ' national ' common market organisation ( CMO ) superimposed on the Community CMO and seriously affecting its operation , " the Commission said .
The subsidies were paid out to cover sales prices , storage , destruction of part of the crop and to provide financial incentives for processing fresh fruit and vegetables , the Commission concluded .
' Blazing summer ' Speaking on Monday , Mr Le Maire said he had begun discussions with the growers after a 29 July deadline for action , set by the Commission , had elapsed .
He told French radio that some of the 500 m included " aid that I do n't regard as illegal " .
In April his predecessor Michel Barnier appealed to the European Court of Justice against the Commission 's demand .
Mr Le Maire said he would pursue that appeal .
The minister also promised that the goverment would " respond to the unprecedented difficulties faced by fruit and vegetable growers " .
The president of the growers ' union Fedecom , Francois Lafitte , said " fruit and vegetable growers wo n't pay " and he threatened a " blazing summer " of protests if the government pressed its demands .
According to Mr Le Maire , pickers get 11 to 13 euros an hour for their labour in France , whereas in Germany it is six euros an hour and in Spain seven .

Sept. 23 , 2009 -- Former child - star Mackenzie Phillips , whose life has been marred by drug abuse and arrests , confessed today that she engaged in a 10 - year consensual sexual relationship with her father , rock star John Phillips .
Phillips , 49 , the former star of ' 70s - '80s sitcom " One Day at a Time , " told Oprah Winfrey that she was first raped by her father in a hotel room when she was 18 while passed out after a drug binge but continued to use drugs and have consensual sex with him for years .
The relationship continued long after she married Jeff Sessler when she was 19 , and ended only when she became pregnant and feared her father was the baby 's father , Phillips said .
John Phillips , she said , paid for an abortion .
Reading an excerpt from her new book , " High on Arrival , " on Winfrey 's show today , Phillips said of her first sexual experience with her father : " I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my father .
I do n't know how it started . "
She was raped by her father , lead singer of the Mamas and the Papas , in the hotel room in the late 1970s , Phillips said .
" For a moment , I was in my body for a horrible truth , " she said of waking up and realizing she had had sex with her father .
" I boxed it away .
I started very early on in my life compartmentalizing .
...
This was the mother of all difficult experiences .
... I [ have spent ] the last 30 years trying not to look at it , " she said .
Michelle Phillips , Mackenzie Phillips ' stepmother and a member of the '60s group the Mamas and the Papas , told the Hollywood Reporter she believed the allegations were false .
Phillips said Mackenzie had " a lot of mental illness " and that " she 's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years . "
" Mackenzie is jealous of her siblings , who have accomplished a lot and did not become drug addicts , " Michelle said .
Mackenzie Phillips told Winfrey she confronted her father about the rape , but he characterized their relationship as romantic , Mackenzie said .
" After the first experience , I went to my father and said we need to talk about how you raped me .
My dad said : ' Raped you ?
Do n't you mean made love ? '
In that moment , I thought I 'm really on my own here . "
In 1980 , soon after she 'd been fired from " One Day at a Time " because of her out - of - control drug use , Phillips began to travel with her father 's new band , the New Mamas and the Papas .
It was during that time , she said , that she began regularly doing drugs and having sex with her father .
" It did n't happen every day , it did n't happen every week , but it certainly happened and happened many times , " she said .
Mackenzie Phillips Forgave Her Father
" It became a consensual relationship over time .
I can't believe I 'm the only one this happened to , " she said .
" No matter what kind of incest , it is an abuse of power ... a betrayal of trust . "
She forgave her father on his deathbed , but his death , in 2001 , relaunched her abuse of drugs , Phillips said .
In excerpts from " High on Arrival " printed in People magazine , Phillips writes : " On the eve of my wedding , my father showed up , determined to stop it .
I had tons of pills and dad had tons of everything too .
Eventually I passed out on Dad 's bed .
" I was a fragment of a person , and my secret isolated me , " she writes , according to People .
" One night Dad said , ' We could just run away to a country where no one would look down on us .
There are countries where this is an accepted practice .
Maybe Fiji . ' "
Phillips was supposed to be reunited last year with her former television co-stars on the " Rachael Ray Show " but was arrested at Los Angeles International airport for possessing cocaine .
Former co-star Valerie Bertinelli learned of Phillip 's incestuous relationship while backstage during the taping of the Winfrey show .
" You 're only as sick as your secrets , " Bertinelli told her old friend and said she regretted not being there to help Phillips earlier .
Phillips hails from a famous Hollywood family .
Her sisters are singer - actress Bijou Phillips and Chynna Phillips .
She has been married three times and has one son , born in 1997 .
On Steam , you can purchase a $ 20 collection of Jedi Knight titles , including Star Wars Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy , Star Wars Jedi Knight II : Jedi Outcast , Star Wars Jedi Knight : Dark Forces II , Star Wars Jedi Knight : Mysteries of the Sith , and Star Wars : Dark Forces .
That 's a pretty awesome deal , right ?
It would be , if all the games worked on modern systems .
From the slickdeals forum , here is what you can expect from the games :
1. Dark Forces -
Runs fine on most systems since it 's using DosBox .
Some users reporting framerate problems due to frame limiter .
Most are running fine .
2. Dark Forces II : Jedi Knight - Range of problems from artifacting , to black screen with just a HUD , to being completely unplayable .
Even if you can get it working , there will be no music since the original game had CD music and LucasArts has n't changed anything to allow it to find the music anywhere but from the original game CD in your disc drive .
3. Jedi Knight : Mysteries of the Sith - Same engine as above , same problems
4. Jedi Knight II : Jedi Outcast - Fairly recent game , will run well on most systems
5. Jedi Academy - Same as Jedi Outcast
The Steampowered forum is likewise filled with complaints and angry consumers .
Before you buy , make sure you understand exactly what you 're getting , and make sure that the game will work with your computer .
That being said , Jedi Outcast has a great system for lightsaber dueling in mulitplayer ; if you pick that one up by itself it 's worth an afternoon or two .
That game got me through many evenings in college when I should have been studying .
Why I Enjoy Being Poor
If you had asked me a year ago if I would like being poor , I would have called you crazy .
Both my husband and I had just lost our jobs and we were just coming to the realization that we were no longer going to be able to live the life of luxury that we had been living up until that point .
In one fell swoop , we had gone from being able to afford basically anything we wanted to being poor .
I must admit that the first 6 months were n’t pretty .
There was a lot of resentment and complaining deep inside that came out much too often .
It was n’t fair that I could n’t have everything that I wanted or that I had to make sacrifices that I never had to make before .
It was a rough period and there was a lot of shouting , accusing and bad attitude as we were adjusting to our new financial circumstances .
But a funny thing happened after that .
Once we began to adjust to not having the money we used to have , being poor was n’t nearly as terrible as I had imagined .
In fact , there were times that I downright enjoyed it .
I get to spend more time with my family :
Since we no longer have the money to pay for entertainment that used to occupy our time , we now entertain ourselves .
That entertainment has come by spending more time together .
: Since we no longer have the money to pay for entertainment that used to occupy our time , we now entertain ourselves .
That entertainment has come by spending more time together .
Life has slowed down :
When we had a lot of money , there always seemed to be a rush about everything .
We needed to go there , we could n’tmiss that .
The lack of money has made me ( and my entire family ) a lot more relaxed and easy going .

We have a lot more family projects :
When we had money , we were more of a group of individuals that a family unit .
We each did what we wanted and often ignored the other members of the family .
Now that we are all required to stay home a lot more often than in the past , we have come together and do family projects .
We recently repainted my daughter ’s room together .
In the past , we would have hired out this work to others .

We play a lot more games :
We do play more games as a family like scrabble and cards , but we also turn a lot of the ways we save money into games .
For example , we now have a contest where we see if we can cut the amount we pay on our utility bills each month .
If we succeed , 50 % of the savings we manage to save is used to go out for a meal , ice - cream or some other treat .

I now know our needs :
I thought I knew our needs when we had money , but I had been greatly mistaken .
Technology and habit blinded me from reality .
The fact is that there is very little that we actually need : shelter , clothing , healthy food and water , a safe neighborhood .
A lot of the gadgets and toys that I once thought I would die without turned out to not be necessary at all .

We eat better and together :
Meals used to be on the run , usually prepackaged and often eaten outside the house .
When we could no longer afford to do this , it was surprising how much better we began to eat .
I cook a lot more from scratch and we have a lot more meals as a family unit than we used to .

We waste less :
When I look back to when we had money , I am shocked at the amount that we used to waste .
I did n’t think I was wasteful then , but now that we must use as much as we can , I realise that we were incredibly wasteful .
: When I look back to when we had money , I am shocked at the amount that we used to waste .

Life is more fun : I can honestly say that life is a lot more fun that it was when we had more money .
There is a lot less stress now that we have learned to live with the amount that we make and knowing that even if we do n’t have a lot of money , we can still get by .
This is not to say that I hope to always live this way .
it can be tough being poor and having to make decisions about how to spend a limited amount of money that I would rather not .
However , I do hope that when we are making more money and can afford a lot more than we can today that I can remember the new found attitude that I have and the joys that I may have never found had I never been poor .

The tragic midair crash over the Hudson River that killed nine people last Saturday was caught on a chilling home video .
The video , shot by a tourist aboard a boat on the Hudson and obtained exclusively by NBC News , captures the moments before and the stunning impact when small plane collided with a sightseeing helicopter shortly after noon that fateful day .
Meanwhile , the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to impose tighter visual flight regulations in the Hudson River corridor .
Ray LaHood , secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation , said today that an FAA working group will deliver recommendations within two weeks based on past suggestions from the National Transportation Safety Board .
" We 're gonna speak loudly .
We know there are some things we can do immediately , " LaHood said .
" But I ca n't prejudge ( the working group ) .
We 're gonna get it right . "
The video , which is sure to provide clues to the NTSB , came to light as it was revealed that the air traffic controller handling the small plane was chatting with his girlfriend on the phone at the time of the incident .
What 's worse , according to the FAA , is the controller 's supervisor was not present in the Teterboro Airport tower at the time of the accident either .
Yet , both trangressions are not believed to have played a role in the collision , according to officials .
" While we have no reason to believe at this time that these actions contributed to the accident , this kind of conduct is unacceptable and we have placed the employees on administrative leave and have begun disciplinary proceedings , " the FAA said in a statement .
The NTSB , however , objects to the FAA 's statement that the controllers ' actions did n't contribute to the crash .
" The role that air traffic control might have played in this accident will be determined to the NTSB , " the agency said in a statement .
The disturbing video appears to show the plane making a desperate , last second attempt to turn to the right to avoid hitting the climbing chopper .
The plane then appears to rear end the helicopter .
The video shows the plane 's left wing striking the chopper 's main rotor blades .
The left wing then breaks away as the plane flips over and over .
The chopper , with its main passenger compartment appearing intact , then plunges into the water like a rock .
Nine people died in the crash ; six aboard the chopper and three who were on the plane .
After the impact , gasps , shrieks and cries of " mamma mia " can be heard aboard the tour boat before the shooter puts the camera down .
The controller had cleared the small plane , a single - engine Piper , for takeoff and then made a personal call to a woman , said sources familiar with the investigation , who asked not to be named because they were n't authorized to speak publicly .
While still on the phone , the controller handed off the Piper to the control tower at Newark Liberty International Airport , which monitors low - flying air traffic over the Hudson but does n't actively try to keep aircraft separated , they said .
When the plane departed Teterboro , there were several other aircraft in its vicinity , NBC News has learned .
But the Teterboro controller had already switched the plane to Newark frequency .
By the time Newark controllers contacted the Teterboro controller to tell him to warn the pilot about traffic in the area , it was too late .
The Teterboro controller tried to radio the pilot but got no response .
Remember , he 'd already told the pilot to switch frequencies to Newark control .
The controller was still on the phone when the accident occurred .
Both towers got an automated warning of impending collision at 11:52:54 a.m.
Neither of the controllers remember seeing the alert .
The crash occured 20 seconds later .
The entire sequence of events lasted only a few minutes .
National Transportation Safety Board and FAA investigators learned of the telephone conversation earlier this week while examining recordings of telephone calls on a landline phone in the tower that controllers use to communicate with other parts of the Teterboro Airport .
The controller and supervisor were removed from duty immediately .
Air traffic controllers are expected to be alert at all times while on duty and typically are given about a 15 - minute break roughly every two hours for that reason .
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association released a statement saying , " We support that any such allegation is fully investigated before there is a rush to judgment about the behavior of controller . "
Mobile phones act as remote control for streetlights in scheme by German village to cut energy bills and emissions
It can be a music player , a camera , a navigator and now , in the spirit of saving the planet , the mobile phone has been turned into a remote control for street lights in a village in central Germany .
In an effort to cut energy bills , residents in Dörentrup , 60 miles from Hanover , have been given the ability to turn the village lamps on as and when they need them , just by making a call .
The village has trialled the so - called Dial4 Light scheme on several of its streets for a year and because of its success now plans to roll it out to the entire settlement , as well as further afield .
All 9,000 residents of Dörentrup can register their details for the free system .
They can then make a phone call , entering the code number displayed on a lamp post , which triggers the lights to go on within seconds .
They stay on for up to 15 minutes before automatically switching off .
Dörentrup 's mayor said the scheme aimed first and foremost to save money but was also a useful way of raising the community 's awareness of how they used energy .
" We 're doing this for the sake of saving costs , " mayor Friedrich Ehlert told the Süddeutsche Zeitung .
" But we also want to do our bit to protect the environment and take care of the climate .
In this , the community should be held accountable just like every private individual . "
The project came into being after the village council made the unpopular decision several years ago to turn out the lights at night because it could no longer afford the electricity bill .
A frustrated local resident came up with the idea to allow the lights to be available on demand .
" We took his idea very seriously , " said Bernd Klemme from the county council in Lemgo , which developed the system with the help of experts and secured a patent for it .
" We developed a special modem and a software allowing every registered user the ability to control the lights , " he said .
Data collected by the council shows that the Dial4 Light will lead to an annual reduction in the community 's carbon dioxide emissions of almost 20 tonnes – the equivalent of the emissions of 11 four - person households .
Publicity generated during the pilot stage of the project prompted inquiries to the Lemgo authorities from numerous European countries as well as Saudi Arabia , Japan , India and the US .
Later this month Lemgo will launch the Dial4 Light system internationally .
Is This What Recovery Looks Like ?
The demise of the credit card crisis has been greatly exaggerated … here ’s one for those recovery cheerleaders :
Bank of America and Citigroup — which comprise 35 % of the entire credit card industry — announced this week that customers are defaulting on their credit cards at the highest rates since the recession began .
Bank of America ’s charge - off rate registered a whopping 14.5 % in August .
In other words , for every $ 7 in credit card debt on BoA ’s books , they expect to lose $ 1 .
Other mega - banks and creditors like JP Morgan , Discover , Amex and Capital One revealed similar August numbers .
It ’s an extra - harsh dose of reality for the Street , which enjoyed improving credit default rates this summer , especially in July .
We ’re a bit less surprised … nearly every measure of loan losses at U.S. banks are still soaring into record territory :
This is a component of our thesis at Agora Financial — that while the credit fallout has been cruel , it has yet to equal the size and scope of the credit bubble that preceded it .
We still have quite a mess ahead of us .
The process can be applied to beer , milk and other beverages A material that could lead to beer with significantly longer shelf life has been designed by researchers .
The approach works by removing riboflavin , or vitamin B2 , which causes changes to beer 's flavour when exposed to light passing through the bottle .
Scientists at the Technical University of Dortmund designed a polymer " trap " with tiny crevices that capture the riboflavin molecules .
The technique could be applied to other beverages such as milk , they said .
Because such riboflavin - containing beverages tend to be stored in translucent containers , they are more prone to the effects of light on their long - term storage .
In a process called photo - oxidation , ultraviolet light can strip off charged atoms that can go on to degrade other chemicals or proteins in the drink , ultimately affecting its flavour and shortening its shelf life .
Lock and key Borje Sellergren of the Technical University of Dortmund made use of a technique called molecular imprinting to design a solution to the riboflavin problem .
The process involves chemically designing a riboflavin - shaped cavity into a polymer by moulding it around riboflavin molecules and then removing them .
These polymer cavities are then made in high quantities , selectively trapping riboflavin when dunked into a vat of beer or milk .
The idea mimics biological systems such as antibodies which are targeted in a similar " lock - and - key " way for mopping up bacteria or viruses .
The work was commissioned by Dutch brewery Heineken , but the concept is not just limited to those drinks , Dr Sellergren told BBC News .
" The technology itself is more generic than we 've shown here , " he said .
" There are a number of examples where this kind of absorbance can be used for the removal of specific unwanted compounds in food - flavours , impurities , pesticides , and spoilage agents as we 've shown here . "
" The next step is to demonstrate for the brewery industry and food industry that we have this capability now . "

ATHLETICS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS
Venue : Olympic Stadium , Berlin Date : 15 - 23 August
Coverage : Watch the action live and highlights on BBC Two , BBC HD , Red Button , Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport website ( video for UK users only )
Full BBC coverage details Jamaican sprint superstar Usain Bolt claimed yet another world record as he recorded a stunning victory in the 200m final at the World Championships .
Bolt set a time of 19.19 seconds to demolish the previous record of 19.30 he set in winning Olympic gold last summer in Beijing .
The 22 - year - old finished well clear of the field , with silver medallist Alonso Edward finishing in 19.81 .
Wallace Spearmon of the United States took bronze .
Bolt , who also smashed the 100 m record in Berlin on Sunday , is now the first man to hold the 100 and 200 m World and Olympic titles at the same time .
After a nervy opening which saw Frenchman David Alerte false start , Bolt streaked off the blocks and took the lead within 20 m .
TOM FORDYCE BLOG
Bolt has redefined the boundaries of what was believed to be humanly possible
He put on the afterburners around the bend to leave the chasing pack trailing in his wake and after storming over the line , Bolt glanced down to the electronic display and pointed at his historic time .
Earlier in the week Bolt had said he did not think a 200 m record was on after missing a month of training earlier this year following a car crash in Jamaica .
And after the 200 m Bolt told BBC Sport : " I can definitely say I did n't expect that because I was a little bit tired .
" I said let 's try because people are really looking out for this , I said it wo n't hurt to try .
So I tried really hard and now I 'm really tired .
" Maybe next time I should just run the 200 m or the 100 m alone .
My form was going backwards .
I was n't running upright .
It was n't a good race but it was a fast one . "
Bolt , who completed his 200 m win a day before his 23rd birthday , set three world records when winning his Olympic golds in Beijing last summer and his breathtaking performances in Berlin have enhanced his reputation as the best sprinter of all time .
" I definitely showed people that my world records in Beijing were not a joke , " he said .
And Bolt said he is closing in on his aim of becoming a sprinter the world will never forget .
" I keep telling you guys my aim is to become a legend , " he added .
" I do n't think about records .
I do n't put myself under pressure .
I know what to do and I go and execute .
" I did well for myself and I am on my way to becoming a legend so I am just happy . "
America 's Shawn Crawford , who finished fourth , admitted he was left in awe by Bolt 's display .
" Just coming out there , I 'm just waiting for the lights to flash ' game over , ' because I felt like I was in a video game , " said Crawford .
" That guy was moving - fast . "

I installed the early version of Snow Leopard Apple gave out to developers attending their WWDC event last week ( build 10A380 ) on my 2007 MacBook Pro ( the 15 - inch 2.16 GHz model with 3GB of RAM ) .
This version is not the final release that will hit shelves this September , but it 's got some ( not all ) of the enhancements Apple showed off at the WWDC .
If you 're thinking about hitting the torrent and trying out Snow Leopard for yourself to see what it 's all about , let me save you the trouble .
Startup and Shutdown Speeds
First , Apple promises that Snow Leopard will wake from sleep , join Wi -Fi networks , and shutdown faster than plain old Leopard .
While it 's difficult to accurately test wakeups and network connections , I timed startup and shutdown on my MacBook Pro in both Leopard and Snow Leopard .
Turns out Snow Leopard is indeed faster even on my old hardware .
While shutdown sped up by almost 66 % , cold boots only sped up by 13 % .
Here are the numbers .
Operating System Average Time to Boot Up Average Time to Shutdown Leopard 10.5.7 52 seconds 29 seconds Snow Leopard
( Developer Preview , Build 10A380 , WWDC edition ) 45 seconds 10 seconds
These numbers are an average of about half a dozen restarts I timed using very unscientific means : a kitchen timer .
Since my MBP has several programs planted in startup and I just wanted to test Snow Leopard , these times measure from the time the machine is off to the login screen only .
System Footprint
Apple also claims that Snow Leopard 's footprint is so much smaller than Leopard 's that you 'll save 6GB of disk space .
Granted , I upgraded Snow Leopard over my existing Leopard setup ( instead of a clean installation ) , but I did not save that much disk space .
Running Leopard , my Mac's / System / directory weighed in at 4.4GB , the / Library / directory was 6.99GB , and the / Applications / directory was 6.99 GB .
After the Snow Leopard upgrade , / System / shrunk just a bit to 4.3GB , / Library / shed the most bulk and slimmed down to 4.73GB , and interestingly , the / Applications / contracted to 6.75GB .
While Apple promised 6GB of recovered disk space after upgrading to Snow Leopard , in total I only gained 2.6GB .
Finder Tweaks
Apple 's boasts that Finder was " totally rewritten " in Snow Leopard — which is great for developers who want to take advantage of the new code base , but meaningless to the end user who sees the same old Finder .
The lack of Finder revamp is what disappointed me the most about Snow Leopard ; but hopefully now that it's " totally rewritten " the stage is set for a better file browser .
( Finder tabs , please ? )
That said , there are a few little new things you can do in Finder : notably , get huge file icons , play video , and page through PDF 's without opening a new app .
Hit the play button on this short screencast to see that in action .
UPDATE : Unfortunately Apple requested that YouTube remove our Snow Leopard videos , so if you missed the videos , our apologies .
Stacks Scrolling and Browsing
Fans of Leopard 's Stacks feature will like the enhanced Stacks in Snow Leopard .
You can now scroll through Stacks that contain lots of items , and browse to subfolders within Stacks .
Not sure if you could do this before in Leopard , but you can also hop to items in Stacks by typing the first letter of the name .
( For example , when I 've got the Applications Stack extended , tapping the U key selects the Utilities folder . )
Hit play on the screencast here to see this in action .
New Menu Bar Niceties Render Third - Party Software and Hacks Unnecessary
Snow Leopard does n't have many huge !
exciting !
features , but a few checkboxes and controls around the menu bar and in System Preferences will make the power Mac customizer happy .
Roaming Mac users will love the new addition to the Airport drop - down menu : signal strength indicators for every network around you .
This way you can choose to connect to the network with the strongest signal .
Have n't confirmed this yet , but from my tests it looks like Snow Leopard 's Airport menu even shows Wi -Fi networks that are not broadcasting their SSID .
Used to be you'd have to muck around with international date formats just to get today 's date on the menu bar .
That 's no longer the case in Snow Leopard .
While it 's not on by default , in System Preferences , Date & Time , Clock , you can check off " Show date " to see the date on your menu bar .
My MacBook 's battery has been having problems , and I know that because it cuts out before I get the low battery warning .
Leopard never alerted me about it , but Snow Leopard is smart — it displays a " Check Battery " indicator in the menu bar .
If you click it , it pops a Help item basically telling me to have the machine checked out , because I might need a new battery ( which I probably do ) .
Points to Snow Leopard for being communicative about this .
QuickTime 10 Video Recording and Editing
QuickTime 10 is venturing into iMovie 's territory with built - in video editing and even recording .
While the version of QuickTime in the Snow Leopard preview does n't appear to be the final version — it 's not sporting that swanky new icon , anyway — recording , editing , and publishing video to YouTube is working ( mostly ) .
Hit the play button to see how QuickTime 10 can record from your iSight or from the screen itself .
( Screencasters , rejoice ! )
Note that while the " Share on YouTube " button is there , when I tried it out it hung on a " Processing video " pop-up endlessly .
I wound up shooting these ' casts using Jing instead .
You can also cut down a video to its best parts using QuickTime 's new trimming feature .
Hit the play button here to see an adorable puppy get a good edit in QuickTime 10 .
Exposé on the Dock
After risking the stability of my Mac in the name of previewing Snow Leopard , the biggest disappointment was that the new Exposé Dock integration is not yet enabled ( on this build , anyway ) .
Exposé on the Dock is Cupertino 's response to Windows 7's new Aero Peek features , so I was anxious to screencast it .
Alas .
To see it in action , check out the demonstration from the WWDC keynote .
( And do n't do what I did and install the version of Snow Leopard from WWDC just to see this ; you 'll be disappointed . )
Phew !
We did n't even get to Microsoft Exchange support and Safari 4 , but as you can see Snow Leopard does pack several nice - to - haves that will make your time and $ 30 well worth it .
( Thanks to the author of this article for helping me out with my Snow Leopard install from a FireWire drive . )

According to this Census Bureau report " Income , Poverty , and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States : 2008 " ( released today ) , there were 46.34 million uninsured Americans in 2008 , up from 45.6 million in 2007 .
The chart above shows the household income levels of those 46.34 million uninsured Americans .
There are 9.725 million uninsured Americans living in households making $ 75,000 per year or more , and this represents more than 1 out every 5 uninsured ( 21 % of the total ) .
There are about 8 million Americans without health insurance in households making between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 , representing 17.3 % of the uninsured .
With those two groups combined , 38.3 % of Americans without health insurance ( 17.75 million people ) lived in households with $ 50,000 or more of household income in 2008 ( see Table 7 for these data ) .
Update : According to
The Kaiser Family Foundation
employer - sponsored health insurance were $ 4,704 for single coverage ( $ 392 per month ) and $ 12,680 for family coverage in 2008 ( $ 1,056 per month ) .
And various individual Blue Cross Blue Shield plans are available in Michigan ( other states may vary ) starting at Individual Care Blue Plus plan , , the average annual premiums forwere $ 4,704 for single coverage ( $ 392 per month ) and $ 12,680 for family coverage in 2008 ( $ 1,056 per month ) .
And various individual Blue Cross Blue Shield plans are available in Michigan ( other states may vary ) starting at $ 173.18 per month for the Care Blue Plus plan , $ 52.82 per month for the Flexible Blue II plan , and $ 49.30 per month for the Young Adult Blue plan .
Q : With $ 50,000 or more in household income , would n't many or most of those 17.75 million uninsured households be without insurance voluntarily ?
That is , could n't most of those households afford health insurance ?
Alternatively , with those income levels ( especially the 9.725 million with household income above $ 75,000 ) , could n't many of those households choose to forego health insurance in favor of being " self - insured , " at least for routine health procedures ?
Given the widespread availability of more than a thousand convenient and affordable retail health clinics around the country at Wal - Marts , Meijers , CVSs and Walgreens , these households could easily be on the " pay - as - you - go " model of self - insurance for health care , at least for routine medical services .
As Thomas Sowell wrote :
A man who drugged and sodomised a 13 - year old girl would not usually receive the uncritical support of the political and literary establishments .
On the other hand , Roman Polanski is not your common - or - garden paedophile : he is possibly the world 's most admired film director .
It was on his arrival in Zurich to pick up yet another lifetime achievement award that Polanski was arrested , at the request of the US Justice Department , which has sought him ever since 1978 when he fled rather then face prison for a crime to which he had pleaded guilty .
To say that the Swiss Justice Ministry 's swoop on the 76 - year - old French citizen has aroused outrage in high places would be an understatement .
France 's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner denounced the arrest as " sinister " .
Polanski's would - be hosts , the Swiss Association of Directors , are angrier still , calling it " a grotesque judicial farce and a monstrous cultural scandal " .
In the UK , the novelist Robert Harris – who is working with Polanski on a film of one of his books – said that he was " shocked and stunned ... it strikes me as disgusting treatment . "
The United Nations has stepped in : the Bulgarian Director - Designate of Unesco , Irina Bokova , declaring that " Polanski is a world renowned intellectual ... even though I am not aware of any details , this is shocking . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Bokova should acquaint herself with the details of the original case .
She might even find them quite shocking , too .
In 2003 the Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Wesley unsealed the grand jury testimony of Samantha Galley taken 26 years earlier .
In it , the 13 - year old , who aspired to become a model , described how Polanski offered to take photos of her for French Vogue ... in the house of the film star Jack Nicholson .
There , the 44 - year - old Polanski plied her with the drug Quaalude mixed in glasses of champagne .
Then , after insisting that she join him in the Jacuzzi , Polanski said : " Let 's go in the other room " .
From this point on , the testimony is harrowing , so skip the next few paragraphs if you are of a squeamish disposition .
" Q. What did you do when he said , ' Let 's go into the other room ' ?
A. I was going ' No , I think I better go home ' , because I was afraid .
So I just went and I sat down on the couch .
Q. What were you afraid of ?
A. Him ....
He sat down beside me and asked if I was OK .
I said ' No ' .
Q. What did he say ?
A . He goes ' Well , you 'll be better ' .
And I go , ' No I wo n't .
I have to go home .
He said ' I 'll take you home soon ' .
Q. Then what happened ?
A . Then he went down and he started performing cuddliness ...
I was kind of dizzy , you know , like things were kind of blurry sometimes .
I was having trouble with my coordination ...
I was n't fighting really because I , you know , there was no one else there and I had no place to go . "
Q. Did he ask you about being on the pill ?
A . He asked , he goes , ' Are you on the pill ? ' and I went , ' No ' and he goes ' When did you have your period ? ' and I said , ' I do n't know .
A week or two .
I 'm not sure '...
He goes , ' Come on .
You have to remember ' .
And I told him I did n't .... and right after I said I was not on the pill ... and he goes ... and then he put me – wait .
Then he lifted my legs up farther and he went in through my anus .
Q. Did you resist at that time ?
A. A little bit , but not really , because ...
Q. Because what ?
A. Because I was afraid of him . "
This testimony took place barely two weeks after the incident – Samantha Galley did not obey Polanski's demand that she not tell her mother about " our little secret . "
We can predict the sort of defence that Polanski's present - day supporters will make in the coming days .
They will not be so crass as to suggest , as the new head of Unesco did , that because he is a " world - renowned intellectual " , he should be judged differently from lesser beings – although I 'm sure that some of them believe it .
They will suggest that the 13 - year - old girl was mature for her age and complicit .
Samantha Geimer ( as she now is ) has already said to those who want her somehow to take the blame , " You were n't there .
You do n't know . "
And what if she had been partially complicit ?
Is it less heinous because the renowned film director used his fame and the promise of his support to seduce a 13 - year - old ?
His supporters will also point out that Ms Geimer herself has previously urged that the proceedings be dropped , because they are embarrassing her family .
She certainly deserves even more sympathy on that score ; it is one of the perennial problems with rape cases that the victim will very often prefer her assailant to remain unprosecuted , rather than face the ordeal of cross-examination at the hands of his lawyers .
Polanski himself has never , so far as I know , expressed any contrition for what he did .
At the time of Bill Clinton 's impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky affair , the director observed that , " There 's a different justice for people who are public figures than for those who are not " , with the implication that somehow he too had been a victim of unfair double standards over matters of sexual behaviour .
The truth is that Polanski has been treated with extraordinary indulgence because of his fame .
When in 2003 Polanski was nominated as best director for The Pianist , but did n't attend the Oscar ceremony because of his outstanding arrest warrant , the event 's host , Steve Martin , joked to the Hollywood audience " Roman Polanski is here ... GET HIM ! " Polanski won that evening , and received a standing ovation in absentia .
I do not deny his genius , nor his contribution to cinematic art ; but I also share the view expressed by the historian Lord Acton that " if we may debase the currency [ of the moral code ] for the sake of genius , or success , or rank , or reputation ... then it serves where it ought to reign " .
If that means nothing to Polanski 's defenders among the literati , let them think of this : if it were their 13 - year - old daughter who had been drugged and sodomised , would they still feel that the perpetrator was in fact the victim ?

( CNN ) --
Two employees at the Baltimore , Maryland , branch of the liberal community organizing group ACORN were caught on tape allegedly offering advice to a pair posing as a pimp and prostitute on setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS .
The footage , which appears to have been edited in places , was recorded and posted online Thursday .
The video footage -- which has been edited and goes to black in some areas -- was recorded and posted online Thursday by James O'Keefe , a conservative activist .
He was joined on the video by another conservative , Hannah Giles , who posed as the prostitute in the filmmakers ' undercover sting .
The video shows the pair approaching two women working at the ACORN Baltimore office and asking them for advice on how to set up a prostitution ring involving more than a dozen underage girls from El Salvador .
One of the ACORN workers suggests that Giles refer to herself as a " performing artist " on tax forms and declare some of the girls as dependents to receive child tax credits .
" Stop saying prostitution , " the woman , identified by the filmmaker as an ACORN tax expert , tells Giles .
The other woman tells them , " You want to keep them clean ... make sure they go to school . "
Watch tape of alleged advice on prostitution »
Both women appear enthusiastic to help .
Calls to ACORN 's Baltimore offices were not immediately returned Thursday .
Stuart Katzenberg , lead organizer for ACORN 's Maryland chapter , told the Baltimore Sun that both ACORN employees were fired because they " did not meet ACORN 's standards of professionalism . "
Sonja Merchant - Jones , chair of Baltimore City ACORN , told CNN affiliate WMAR - TV that the fired workers were seasonal , part - time employees and that no senior ACORN staff members were in the building at the time the film was made .
Scott Levenson , a spokesman at ACORN 's national offices said , " The portrayal is false and defamatory and an attempt at ' gotcha journalism . '
" This film crew tried to pull this sham at other offices and failed .
ACORN wants to see the full video before commenting further , " Levenson said .
The conservative filmmakers unsuccessfully attempted similar ruses at the group 's offices in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Los Angeles , California , and New York , Levenson said .
Law enforcement officials in the Baltimore area would n't confirm whether they are investigating the alleged incident at the local ACORN office .
However , authorities said that under Maryland law , such undercover video may not be admissible in court as evidence .
CNN attempted to reach O'Keefe and Giles ; O'Keefe was not available for comment and Giles canceled an interview scheduled for Thursday .
ACORN -- an acronym for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- made headlines last year when Republican groups seized on allegations of voter registration fraud by the group in Florida and several other states , claiming its workers were trying to push the election in Barack Obama 's favor .
On Wednesday , arrest warrants were issued for 11 Florida voter registration workers suspected of submitting false information on hundreds of voter registration cards , according to court documents .
The Florida investigation was triggered by ACORN officials who noticed irregularities in forms they were receiving .
Founded in 1970 , ACORN calls itself " the nation 's largest grassroots community organization of low - and moderate - income people . "
The group says it has more than 400,000 member families organized into more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in 110 cities .
Besides voter registration , the group focuses on issues such as predatory lending , the minimum wage and funding for public schools , according to its Web site .
It also provides free tax - return preparation for low - income people and screening for state and federal benefit programs .
CNN 's Bill Tucker , Chris Murphey and Steve Turnham contributed to this report .

The one body area a woman is most worried about is her hips , thighs and butt .
Right ?
So why would a designer ever make a dress that specifically brings more attention , weight , and bulk to that area ?
This is a perfect example of the disconnect between fashion and real people .
I mean , if you only have 30 - something looks in a show to tell your story for that season why waste any of them on designs that would never sell ( especially in this economy ) or even push the " art " of fashion in a reasonable direction .
That ruffle detailing is great ( and , to be fair , Preen did offer other options with that detail ) , but there must be other ways to use it so that it does n't strongly detract from a woman 's body .

HANOVER , NH - Despite their popularity in the science fiction genre , there is much to be learned about black holes , the mysterious regions in space once thought to be absent of light .
In a paper published in the August 20 issue of Physical Review Letters , the flagship journal of the American Physical Society , Dartmouth researchers propose a new way of creating a reproduction black hole in the laboratory on a much - tinier scale than their celestial counterparts .
The new method to create a tiny quantum sized black hole would allow researchers to better understand what physicist Stephen Hawking proposed more than 35 years ago : black holes are not totally void of activity ; they emit photons , which is now known as Hawking radiation .
" Hawking famously showed that black holes radiate energy according to a thermal spectrum , " said Paul Nation , an author on the paper and a graduate student at Dartmouth .
" His calculations relied on assumptions about the physics of ultra-high energies and quantum gravity .
Because we can't yet take measurements from real black holes , we need a way to recreate this phenomenon in the lab in order to study it , to validate it . "
In this paper , the researchers show that a magnetic field - pulsed microwave transmission line containing an array of superconducting quantum interference devices , or SQUIDs , not only reproduces physics analogous to that of a radiating black hole , but does so in a system where the high energy and quantum mechanical properties are well understood and can be directly controlled in the laboratory .
The paper states , " Thus , in principle , this setup enables the exploration of analogue quantum gravitational effects . "
" We can also manipulate the strength of the applied magnetic field so that the SQUID array can be used to probe black hole radiation beyond what was considered by Hawking , " said Miles Blencowe , another author on the paper and a professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth .
This is not the first proposed imitation black hole , says Nation .
Other proposed analogue schemes have considered using supersonic fluid flows , ultracold bose - einstein condensates and nonlinear fiber optic cables .
However , the predicted Hawking radiation in these schemes is incredibly weak or otherwise masked by commonplace radiation due to unavoidable heating of the device , making the Hawking radiation very difficult to detect .
" In addition to being able to study analogue quantum gravity effects , the new , SQUID - based proposal may be a more straightforward method to detect the Hawking radiation , " says Blencowe .

In addition to Nation and Blencowe , other authors on the paper include Alexander Rimberg at Dartmouth and Eyal Buks at Technion in Haifa , Israel .
When US students return to their classrooms this fall , few of them will be lugging along new Apple notebooks .
That 's the conclusion reached by a small survey conducted recently by consumer - electronics ecommerce website Retrevo .
Of the 300 - plus students surved by Retrevo , 34 percent of laptop buyers will purchase netbooks , and 49 per cent will buy full - sized Windows - based machines .
" The majority of student laptop shoppers will not consider buying a Mac , " says Renevo 's press release .
The reason for the defection from Apple is a simple one , Retrevo 's chief executive Vipin Jain said : " Fifty - eight per cent of [ students ] plan on spending less than $ 750.00 .
Only 18 per cent have a budget over $ 1,000.00 .
Netbooks are affordable - some costing only $ 170.00 .
In contrast , Apple laptops start at $ 949.00 .
At a time when many people are experiencing economic hardship , having a new Apple laptop is n’t a necessity . "
The tiny size of the survey and that fact that Retrevo links to far more netbook - selling sites than it does Apple resellers colors the legitimacy of its figures , but the move to low - price netbooks is inarguable .
In May this year , IDC reported that worldwide netbook sales would top 22 million in 2009 .
In July it upped that estimate to 26 million .
DisplaySearch in July was even more bullish for the netbook market , putting the number of 2009 sales at a cool 33 million , with US year - on - year growth of 137 per cent .
The low - price , good - enough laptop boat has sailed , and Apple 's not on it .
Apple spokesfolks have repeatedly dissed the netbook market .
In October last year , Steve Jobs said : " There are some customers which we chose not to serve .
We do n't know how to make a $ 500 computer that 's not a piece of junk , and our DNA will not let us ship that . "
Job 's did , however , leave the netbook door open a crack by adding : " It ’s a nascent category and we ’ll watch while it evolves , and we ’ve got some pretty good ideas if it does evolve . "
In April , Jobsian stand - in Tim Cook toed the company line .
" When I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today , I see cramped keyboards , terrible software , junky hardware , very small screens ... not something that we would put the Mac brand on , quite frankly .
It 's not a space as it exists today that we 're interested in . "
But Cook also hinted that Apple might someday play in the netbook space by adding : " If we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution , then we 'll do that .
We have some interesting ideas in the [ netbook ] space . "
This July , however , Cook reiterated his distate for netbooks .
" I think some of netbooks that are being delivered , or many of those , are very slow , they have software technology that is old , they do n't have a robust computing experience , they lack horsepower , they have small displays and cramped keyboards , " he said .
" And so that kind of thing I think many people will not be happy with .
We 're only going to play in things where we can deliver something that is very innovative and that we 're very proud of . "
All well and good , but it appears that Apple has little regard for the old adage that " The customer is always right . "
And these days , customers - especially the proverbial starving students - are seeking low - cost computing devices that will allow them to take notes in class , check their email , write papers , and surf the web , all without straining their backpack bedecked backs as they tote them around campus .
Namely , netbooks .
It was just over a year ago when Apple edged out Dell as the laptop - of - choice among college students .
The rise of the netbook may have made that victory a short - lived one .
And although rumors abound about Apple 's impending netbook - substitute , the tablet / netbook / media - pad / ebook / whatever , said rumors describe a device designed more for content consumption than for writing a term paper on corporate hubris . ®

A group of teens hanging out by a lake in Panama saw the elusive Gollum climbing out of his cave and did what any respectable youths would do : beat it to death with sticks .
According to reports in Panama , the teenagers spotted the creature crawling out of a cave while playing in the town of Cerro Azul north of Panama City .
Fearing for the safety as it moved towards them , the youths claim they attacked the beast with sticks before throwing its lifeless body into a pool of water .
A hooked claw visible in one of the photos has been cited as evidence for the popular theory that the creature was a sloth that somehow lost its hair .
Wow you little assholes , you beat a hairless sloth to death .
That 's low .
I mean , are n't sloths slower than turtles ?
You could have gotten high , had a four course picnic and taken a nap afterward and the thing would have still been like a foot from where it was before you packed the bong .

Deadly second wave of swine flu ' on its way ' , scientists warn
A second wave of swine flu could be on its way , scientists warned last night after the number of new cases rose for the first time since July .
The jump , from an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 , comes a fortnight after children - key spreaders of the disease - returned to school .
There have been outbreaks at six schools in England , but health chiefs repeated that there are no plans to close schools as it would do little to contain the disease .
In another development , two sufferers are believed to have developed resistance to Tamiflu , the anti-viral drug which is the only line of defence to the disease before a vaccine is ready .
Disruption : A woman walks through London with a surgical mask in an attempt to protect her from swine flu ( file picture ) .
Scientists fear the deadly second wave of swine flu is on its way
Chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson however said the two cases were not of significance as there was no evidence these resistant viruses had been transmitted from person to person .
Experts have been predicting a second wave of swine flu will hit in the winter months following a lull over the summer break , when children were not mixing as freely .
Sir Liam said the figures ' begin to suggest swine flu is coming back ' .
And he admitted : ' We would naturally have hoped for a bit more breathing space before it started again . '
There are 143 people in hospital in England , of whom 23 are in intensive care .
The total of deaths linked to the virus stands at 67 in England and 79 across the UK .
Sir Liam has revised NHS forecasts , saying that between 3,000 and 19,000 will die from the virus - down from the 65,000 worst case scenario outlined in July .
The number of new cases have been falling since the peak of 110,000 a week reported in late July .
Experts believe a second wave of the disease will be more deadly as it will coincide with winter , when flu is more virulent .
Sir Liam said more than 1.3 million people had been assessed via the National Pandemic Flu Service for England , with 522,890 collections of anti-viral drugs .

As we pass the one year anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers , journalists , politicians and market analysts have seized on the occasion to offer seemingly sober assessments of what went wrong and what went right in the lead up and aftermath of the biggest financial event since Black Tuesday .
The most popular storyline offered by these Monday morning quarterbacks is that the mistaken decision to allow Lehman to fail resulted from the Bush Administration ’s misplaced faith in the free markets .
In this telling , the real crises began in the days following the Lehman bankruptcy , which unleashed a financial panic that would have caused complete economic collapse — if not for the subsequent federal intervention .
In reality , Lehman ’s demise was simply the result of an unfolding crisis that began years before .
Popular belief aside , allowing the institution to succumb to the overwhelming debts on its balance sheet was perhaps the only correct decision made by government since this crisis began .
The propagandists ’ complete reversal of cause and effect now threatens to spur the government to compound prior mistakes and bring on the next phase of the financial crisis .
Unfortunately , this chapter will likely be much more dangerous than what we saw last fall .

In March of 2008 , in the aftermath of the Bear Sterns " bailout " ( which itself was a major mistake ) , equity shareholders walked away with a generous ten dollars per share , all creditors were made whole , and most employees got jobs and bonuses from JP Morgan .
As a result of this largess , the Fed created a very serious problem for itself .
After Bear , the perception took hold that investment banks were too " interconnected " to fail .
The resulting moral hazard decreased the financial stability of the banking system and exposed taxpayers to open - ended risks .
The Bush administration rightly determined that a message needed to be sent that Bear was an isolated case , and that capitalism still held sway on Wall Street .
The fall of Lehman , which was helped along by the unrealistic recalcitrance of its chairman Richard Fuld , would be that clear signal .
However , politics quickly trumped economics , and the Lehman trial balloon soon turned into the Hindenburg .
Washington had no stomach for the ensuing financial carnage , and when other institutions began to topple , Bush , Paulson and Bernanke abandoned their prior convictions and threw all they had into the ensuing bailout bonanza .
As a result , the moral hazard that they had sought to avoid now exists on a scale unprecedented in our history .
Capitalism has been extinguished on Wall Street , and our financial institutions now exist as public utilities .
The presidents of our biggest banks are now the highest paid civil servants in the world !

Since market forces are no longer allowed to allocate capital and control risk , these decisions are now made by government regulators and are then passed through to their subordinates on Wall Street .
This perverse organizational structure constitutes a new form of American fascism .
The pain of allowing Lehman to fail will be dwarfed by the agony of bailing out the rest of Wall Street , which is now a foregone conclusion .
Just because the Lehman bankruptcy created unpleasant consequences does not mean it was a mistake .
On the contrary , sometimes doing the right thing hurts — especially if it is done to avoid even greater pain down the road .
It just seems that our representatives are incapable of asking for short - term sacrifice .
There is no price they are not willing to force the rest of us to pay to assure their own reelection .
In reward for its gross culpability in creating the financial crisis , the Federal Reserve has been given extensive new powers .
Given the damage it was able to inflict in the past , I can only imagine the havoc that will be wrought by the new " Super Fed . "
If the current policies continue , the America we know — for which our forebears risked so much — will cease to exist .
The constitution originally established by our Founding Fathers has been under attack almost since inception .
Up until now , the greatest damage occurred during Roosevelt ’s New Deal .
However , the current assault on our birthright could be a knockout blow .
The last vestige of republican government now hangs in the balance .

Charity book sale not for the faint of heart
Personal smackdowns , a threat to call the police and 500 to 600 buyers storming the front door .
What is this , the release of a new iPhone ?
Nope .
It is the annual five - day Friends of the Library Big Book Sale at Fort Mason .
This year 's event will begin Sept. 23 with the Member Preview Sale .
Doors open at 4 p.m .
" I get there at 7 a.m. and there are people already in line , " said Byron Spooner , director of book operations .
" We 've actually timed it and all 500 to 600 people go through the door in five minutes . "
The sale is huge , more than 300,000 books in 50 categories .
Last year , the Friends raised $ 265,000 , even though no book sells for more than $ 5 .
Spooner says he 's broken up tugs - of - war between buyers and posted rules state they " have the right to expel anyone . "
That may be easier said than done .
Spooner says a couple of years ago a fire started and the Friends had to evacuate the building - or try to .
" I had to threaten to call the police to get them to leave their baskets of books , " Spooner said .
Members of the Westwood Park Association , homeowners in a bungalow community near City College , made local history last week when they became the first group to invoke the city 's blighted properties law for a residential property .
The law , passed last October , calls for fines of up to $ 1,000 or repairs by the city which would bill the owner .
Anita Theoharis , a former Planning Commission president , said the law was reluctantly invoked .
The residence is unpainted and has a plywood door and a front yard littered with construction materials , and some 60 neighbors signed a petition requesting action .
" We do n't like neighbors running around like Nazis complaining that you did n't mow your lawn , " she said .
" But this is a very serious situation . "

… Just kick it till it breaks ’ – Angry Brigade , communiqué no.8
The last film showing at the upcoming Bristol Bookfair , at 5 pm , is ‘ The Angry Brigade : The Spectacular Rise and Fall of Britain ’s First Urban Guerilla Group ’ .
The version we are showing is a recently released version by PM Press of the original 1973 documentary , and includes an intro by Stuart Christie , one of the original defendants .
Below we reproduce a forthright piece by Jean Weir that places the A / Brigade firmly in an historical context of struggle .
This documentary , produced by Gordon Carr for the BBC ( and first shown in January 1973 , shortly after the trial ) , covers the roots of the Angry Brigade in the revolutionary ferment of the 1960s , and follows their campaign and the police investigation to its culmination in the “ Stoke Newington 8 ” conspiracy trial at the Old Bailey - the longest criminal trial in British legal history .
Produced after extensive research - among both the libertarian opposition and the police - it remains the essential study of Britain ’s first urban guerilla group .
For the full description of the film go here .
The Angry Brigade have stirred up discussion and usually condemnation whenever they are mentioned .
Dismissed by many as little more than middle class situationists and stupid adventurists , they have also attracted many serious admirers .
Below we publish a long intro to the Angry Brigade , by Jean Weir , one of the UK ’s most colourful anarchists , which actually covers far more than just the Angry Brigade !.
We would also recommend you read John Barker ’s review of the Tom Vague book ‘ Anarchy in the UK – The Angry Brigade ‘ .
Barker of course was one of the defendants found guilty at the Angry Brigade trial .
An introduction to the Angry Brigade – by Jean Weir
The eight libertarian militants on trial in the Old Bailey in 1972 who were chosen by the British State to be the `conspirators ’ of the Angry Brigade , found themselves facing not only the class enemy with all its instruments of repression , but also the obtusity and incomprehension — when not condemnation — of the organised left .
Described as `mad ’ , `terrorists ’ , `adventurists ’ , or at best authors of `gestures of a worrying desperation ’ , the Angry Brigade were condemned without any attempt to analyse their actions or to understand what they signified in the general context of the class struggle in course .
The means used to justify this were simple : by defining the actions of the Angry Brigade as `terrorist ’ , and equating this with `individualist ’ , the movement organisations — whose tendency is to see the relationship between individual and mass as something in contrast — neatly excluded them from their concerns .
Strangely enough this attitude was not limited to the broad left but was also prevalent within the anarchist movement , where still today there is a tendency to ignore the role of the individual within the mass , and the role of the specific group within the mass movement .
When the question is raised , it is usually in the form of an absolute condemnation .
For example , in an article entitled ` Terrorism ’ ( sic ) we read : “ If a few people take it upon themselves to engage in ‘ Armed Struggle ’ , this spells out for us , besides the usual public hostility , police harassment , arrests and defence campaigns , the loss of all our political lessons , gains and strengths . ” ( Class War )
The problems encountered by the comrades of the Angry Brigade were similar to those of other groups active at the time who had refused the limits of struggle delineated by the State — the so - called limits of legality , beyond which the repressive mechanism is is unleashed — and taken as their points of reference the level of mass struggle .
This decision was in defiance of the State ’s definition of the struggle ’s confines .
It also defied the limits imposed by the official workers ’ movement and the extraparliamentary organisations , including the anarchist movement .
The Symbionese Liberation Army in the US , the RAF in Germany , the first of the Red Brigades in Italy , were all isolated by the `revolutionary ’ organisations , condemned as agitators , provocateurs , individualist terrorists threatening the growth of the mass movement .
On the attitude to the SLA , Martin Sostre was to write in America : “ The denunciation of the SLA by the movement press is indistinguishable from that of the ruling class .
Each left organisation seems to be competing with the others for their legitimacy by denouncing the SLA … Conspicuously absent from the denunciations is any discussion of the role of armed struggle .
Revolutionary violence is seen as something repulsive that should be shunned .
The left movement press would have one believe that to overthrow the criminal ruling class we have merely to organise mass movements , demonstrations of protest and repeat revolutionary slogans . ”
One such paper in this country — the Trotskyist Red Mole — distinguished itself by calling for solidarity with the comrades accused in the Angry Brigade trial .
With the following reservation —
“ It is no use the organised left criticising the politics of the Angry Brigade , unless we also recognise why a lot of potentially very good comrades reject the various Leninist organisations , and indeed resort to bomb - throwing — until you are caught — by itself an easy option that does not deal with the problem of helping to change the political understanding of millions of people . ”
Understandable enough in view of the Leninist programme .
But from the anarchist perspective ?
We read on the front page of a fairly recent issue of Freedom , “ Even the bombing campaign carried out by the Angry Brigade which was technically brilliant … achieved absolutely nothing because , in direct contradiction with their spoken ideals , they were trying to act as an elite vanguard leaving ordinary people as passive spectators of their actions .
Far from this resulting in an ‘ awakening ’ of ‘ the masses ’ it resulted in a fear of anarchism and anarchist ideas which has significantly contributed to our current impotence . ”
As we can see , the old preoccupation persists : that of protecting the movement ( especially the anarchist one ) from the ‘ adventurists ’ .
In fact the movement of the exploited is not and never has been one monolithic mass , all acting together with the same level of awareness .
The struggle against capital has from the beginning been characterised by a dichotomy between the official workers ’ movement on the one hand , with its various organisations — parties , unions , etc , channelling dissent into a manageable form of quantitive mediation with the bosses .
And on the other hand , the often less visible movement of `uncontrollables ’ who emerge from time to time in explicit organisational forms , but who often remain anonymous , responding at individual level by sabotage , expropriation , attacks on property , etc , in the irrecuperable logic of insurrection .
There is no distinct or fixed dividing line between the two movements .
They often affect each other , the surge from the base obliging the big official organisations to take a certain direction , or the inverse , where the latter put a brake on autonomous struggles .
Many of those who make up the mass of union membership , are also extremely active in extra-union ( and by definition extra- legal ) forms of struggle .
Each side , however , has its own heritage : on the one a heritage of deals and sell - outs , the great victories that are real defeats on the workers ’ backs ; on the other , a heritage of direct action , riots , organised insurrections or individual actions which all together form part of the future society we all desire , and without which it would be nothing but a utopian dream .
A brief look at the development of the struggle in this country shows this duality quite clearly .
The organised anti-capitalist movement as we know it today began to take shape at the beginning of the nineteenth century .
Unlike the other European capitalist countries developing at the same time , there was only a minor communist influence both at organisational and ideological level .
Traditional British anti-intellectualism and `common sense ’ were perhaps fundamental to a more pragmatic form of organisation which took the form of trades unions .
These unions were from the start reformist , although at times , through pressure from the base , some knew insurrectional moments .
The changes the unions proposed were however usually intended to come about using non-violent methods within the constitutional limits .
The most numerically significant of the early workers ’ movements was the Chartist one , which began around 1838 .
Recognised as the first modern mass movement , the first Chartist petition had one and a quarter million signatures .
This is clearly not a qualitative assessment of active adherents .
Even this movement was marked by two opposing currents : on the one hand those preaching non-violence and the constitutional road to universal suffrage as a solution ; on the other , those who spoke of ( and carried out ) rebellion and armed direct action .
These were the so- called `moral force ’ and the `physical force ’ .
They were linked to the division between the tradesmen and unskilled workers and were never never reconciled , possibly accounting for the short duration of the movement .
During and immediately preceding this period there also existed forms of autonomous revolt , such as that of the many artisans in the textile industry who , under threat of losing their jobs or of being reduced to non-specialised labourers , organised in armed groups .
The most significant of these insurrectional movements was that known as Luddism , which took place between 1810 - 1820 .
During this period an immense amount of property was destroyed , including vast numbers of textile frames redesigned to produce inferior , shoddy goods .
The Luddites , taking the name of Ned Ludd who had taken a sledge hammer to the frames at hand , organised themselves locally and even federally with great coordination , and in spite of vast deployments of soldiers especially in West Riding and Yorkshire where the movement was strongest , generalised insurrection was approached on more than one occasion .
As John Zerzan points out , this was not the despairing outburst of workers having no other outlet , as a long tradition of unionism was in existence among textile workers and others prior to and during the Luddite uprisings .
In the early 1830 ’s it was the turn of agricultural workers become casual labourers to organise in the `army ’ of Captain Swing , a mythical figure adopted as a symbol of the farmworkers who burned ricks and barns , threatening their oppressors — farmers , vicars , justices of the peace alike — with the same fate .
Where the Luddites were extremely organised , the Swing men lacked secrecy .
Nineteen of them were hanged ( sixteen for arson ) , 644 jailed , and 481 deported to Australia .
Along with the inevitable development in the forces of repression in the form of police and army , we see the development of the unions as an attempt to instill order from within the work situation itself .
By their division by trades , and by specialised and non-specialised workers , they had the effect not only of controlling but also of fragmenting the struggle and diffusing it along these artificial divisions .
By 1910 there were over 50 unions in the engineering industry alone .
The revolutionary movement that subsequently developed began partly as a destruction of the old forms of organisation .
Three important movements developed .
The evolutionary syndicalist movement under the French influence ; the industrial syndicalists ( IWW ) from America , and the shop stewards movement , which was particularly active in the Clydeside in Scotland .
They struggled for the control of industry by the workers and against the failure of the orthodox trade unions and left parliamentarianism to get any improvement in working conditions .
But these movements , although strong at local level , and capable of organising important strikes and revolts , never went beyond the limits of the engineering and transport industries and the mines .
The war years saw a pact between trade unions and the government .
Both combined to forcibly instill a sense of patriotism in the workers to prepare them for the great massacre that was to come .
Strikes became illegal as a result of this deal , showing clearly how the borderline between legality and illegality is a malleable instrument in the hands of power .
Not all went willingly to the slaughter , and the many desertions and mutinies which were savagely put down are still part of the proletariat ’s unwritten history .
The Communist Party , formed in 1920 during the post war depression , was authoritarian and centralised .
Although the party never gained the support that its continental counterparts did , it nevertheless carried out its role of policing the struggles in course .
For example it entered the struggles of the unemployed who were organised in local groups expropriating food , squatting , etc , and channelled them into reformist demands on the State and large demonstrations such as the Jarrow hunger marches .
The General Strike was emblematic of the contrast between the mass of workers and the unions and parties who claimed to represent them .
However , with the recovery and development of heavy industry , the main energies of the exploited were concentrated at the workplace , the only place they now found themselves together .
The shop stewards ’ movement was revived in the fifties and sixties in the so - called boom years .
But , although nearer to the base of the workers , it broke up the area of struggle even further than the already single trades orientated unions .
The growing division of labour caused increasing divisions in struggle , with the result that solidarity between the various sectors was limited , even between workers in the same factory .
While the unions were working to develop industry along with the bosses , the base were developing different , uncontrollable forms of struggle such as go - slows , wildcat strikes , sit-ins , etc .
For example , of the 421 strikes in the docks at the beginning of the sixties , 410 were unofficial .
These same workers had already experienced troops being moved into the docks by a Labour
government , and TGWU officials giving evidence against their own members ten years before .
Acceleration in automation , work pace , and alienation , especially in the fast developing car industry , created struggles which went against the union / management work ethic .
Against bargaining and negotiation , car workers and dockers in particular were carrying out sabotage on the assembly lines , wildcat strikes and occupations .
At times they succeeded in pushing their `defence ’ organisations into situations of attack and across the frontiers of sectionalism and trades differences into which they had been conscripted .
But the economism of the unions was one of capital ’s strongest arms .
At a time when industrial riots and even insurrections were spreading all over Europe , each starting from a minority with its own objectives and spreading to other categories of workers in the same industry , then beyond , using pickets , workers ’ committees , assemblies , etc , the unions were the only organs capable of negotiating with the management and getting workers to return to work under great slogans of unity .
This dualism in the workers ’ movement between elements of the base struggling directly and spontaneously within a precise economic situation , and the representatives of the national politics of the official workers ’ movement always ready to put a brake on and formalise struggles ( e.g. boycotts , strikes and even ‘ working to rule ’ ) , turning them into instruments of negotiation with the industries , has always existed .
But not all the actions of the base can be instrumentalised , and the thrust towards illegality can never be fully stifled .
At times it might seem so .
But even during the relative ‘ lulls ’ , there exists a perpetual movement of absenteeists , expropriators , and saboteurs .
This movement from below , which emerged in force at the end of the sixties , dispelled the myth of the passive , stable English working class , just as the image of the traditional worker changed with the increase in the number of women and immigrant workers in productive work and the rapidly expanding service industries .
At the same time a new movement was growing in the schools and colleges .
One of the main points of reference for this movement was the Vietnam war .
In every college and university various groups were struggling for political space .
For a period there was an attempt to form a unified students movement , the Revolutionary Students Federation .
The most significant groups were of a Trotskyist tendency , Maoism having little influence in this country .
But the sterile politics of the straight left ( Trotskyists and other Leninists ) could not contain the new anti-authoritarian movement that was beginning to develop .
The politics of everyday life — organising around one ’s own oppression , trying to overcome the division between workers and students , between men and women , forming groups around precise problems as opposed to under political banners — was in full development .
A vast movement of claimants , squatters , feminists , etc , emerged expressing not the Right to Work but the Refusal of Work , not employing the waiting tactics of unionist education but taking , Here and Now , what was being refused , and refusing what was being offered .
A critique of the nuclear family as a firm bastion of capitalist power led to many experiences of communal living .
This movement in all its complexity , not so much a students movement , but a widespread one comprising of young workers , students and unemployed , could be called the libertarian movement of the time .
This movement was comprised of autonomous groups acting outside the stagnant atmosphere of the traditional anarchist movement with its own microscopic power centres which , as Bakunin so astutely pointed out , are just as nefarious as any other power structure .
A parallel can therefore be drawn between the dichotomy within the workers movement , and that which exists within the anarchist movement .
On the one hand there are the comrades who hold positions of power , not carrying out any precise activity to contribute to the revolutionary consciousness of the mass , but who spend their time presiding over meetings and conferences aimed at influencing younger comrades through the incantation of abstract principles .
These principles are upheld as the only true tenets of anarchism , and are adhered to by those who , either by laziness or weakness , accept them acritically .
The manifestations of these islands of power usually take the form of publications that are long standing and repetitive .
They have the external semblance of an `open forum ’ for the use of the movement as a whole , but the basic ideology — that of conservation and stasis — is filtered through from behind the flurry of `helpers ’ carrying out the task of `filling ’ and physically producing the publication .
These publications are the first to condemn autonomous actions that take their points of reference from the illegal movement of the exploited .
They are the first to denounce them , accusing them of bringing police repression down on the anarchist movement .
In their reveries they have forgotten that repression always exists , and that only in its most sophisticated form creates the peaceful graveyard of acquiescence , where only ghosts are allowed to tread .
Many of the most forceful of recent social rebellions have been fired and spread by the popular response to police repression .
The traditional anarchist movement finds itself threatened therefore by the other movement of anarchists , the autonomous groups and individuals who base their actions on a critical appraisal of past methods and up to date theory and analysis .
They too use the traditional instruments of leaflets , newspapers and other publications , but use them as tools of revolutionary critique and information , trying always to go towards the mass struggle and contribute to it personally and methodologically .
It is quite coherent — and necessary if they are to be active participants in the struggle — that they also apply the instruments of direct action and armed struggle .
These groups refuse the logic of the power centre and ‘ voluntary helpers ’ .
Each individual is responsible for his or her action which is based on decisions reached through the endless task of acquiring information and understanding .
Some of this can also be gained from the older or more experienced comrades in the group , but never as something to be revered and passed down acritically .
Just as there are no immovable boundaries between the two workers ’ movements , nor are there within the two anarchist movements .
Nor is there a fixed boundary between the latter anarchist movement and the insurrectionalist workers ’ movement .
When the struggle heightens these movements come close together and intermingle , the anarchists however always with the aim of pushing the struggle to a revolutionary conclusion and offering libertarian methods to prevent its being taken over by authoritarian structures .
The other , traditional , anarchist movement has shown all too often in the past its willingness to form alliances with structures of the official workers ’ movement .
Given the situation at the end of the sixties and beginning of the seventies , with its wave of industrial unrest at the level of the base , the students ’ struggles in the universities , the struggles of the unemployed , women and so on , the Angry Brigade emerge both as a product of this reality , and as revolutionary subjects acting within it .
To reject them as some form of social deviance is to close one ’s eyes to the reality of the struggle at that time .
The fact that their actions deliberately took place in the field of illegality , soliciting others to do the same , does not in any way disqualify them from what was in its very essence an illegal movement .
It is possible to see this even in the context of the bombings alone that took place in these years ( although by doing so we do not intend to reduce the vast and varied instruments of illegality to that of the bomb ) : Major Yallop , head of the Laboratories at Woolwich Arsenal , main witness for the prosecution in the trial of the supposed Angry Brigade , was forced to admit that in addition to the 25 bombings between 1968 and mid 1971 attributed to them , another 1,075 had come through his laboratory .
Looking at the bombings claimed by the Angry Brigade , we see that they focus on two areas of struggle that were highly sensitive at the time .
The first was the struggle in industry : the bombing of the Dept. of Employment and Productivity on the day of a large demonstration against the Industrial Relations Bill ; the bombing of Carr ’s house on the day of an even larger demonstration ; the bombing of William Batty ’s home during a Ford strike at Dagenham ; the bombing of John Davies ’ , Minister of Trade and Industry , during the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders crisis ; the bombing of Bryant ’s home during a strike at one of his building works .
To complement these attacks , there were the bombs aimed directly at the repressive apparatus of the State at a time when repression was increasing heavily in response to the upsurge in all areas of struggle .
The bombing of the home of Commissioner Waldron , head of Scotland Yard .
The bombing of the police computer at Tintagel House ; the home of Attorney General Peter Rawlinson , and , finally , that of a Territorial Army Recruitment Centre just after internment was introduced in Northern Ireland fall into this category .
The bombing of the high street boutique , Biba ’s and that of the BBC van the night before the Miss World contest was an attempt to push further in the direction of destroying the stereotyping and alienation of the spectacle of consumerism and role playing .
“ Sit in the drugstore , look distant , empty , bored , drinking some tasteless coffee ?
or perhaps BLOW IT UP OR BURN IT DOWN . ” ( Communique no .8 )
By their actions the Angry Brigade also became a part of that spectacle , but a part that took form in order to contribute to its destruction .
Their actions as presented here find a place therefore not as some old commodity to be taken out and dusted , then put back on the shelf like a relic that belongs to the past .
The work they carried out — and which five libertarians paid for in heavy prison sentences — is a contribution to the ongoing struggle which is changing form as the strategies of capital change in order for it to restructure and preserve itself .
A critical evaluation of the Angry Brigade must therefore take place elsewhere than on the sterile pages of this pamphlet .
It must take place in the active considerations of a movement that has a task to fulfil , and that does not take heed of the condemnation and defamation by those whose ultimate aim is to protect themselves .
Many problems are raised by a rereading of the actions and experiences of the Angry Brigade — clandestinity or not , symbolic action or direct attack , anonymous actions or the use of communiques to be transmitted by the media — to name but a few .
The solution will only be found in the concrete field of the struggle .

Advertisement Space tourist and circus entrepreneur Guy Laliberte has begun his journey as the " first clown to go into orbit " .
The Canadian billionaire was aboard the Soyuz craft which blasted off to the International Space Station ( ISS ) .
Mr Laliberte , who founded the Cirque du Soleil theatre company in the 1980s , reportedly paid $ 35 m for his ticket .
He says he will make the ISS astronauts laugh during his 10 - day stay , and produce a web event that highlights the issue of clean water for all .
He was accompanied in the Soyuz TM - 16 spacecraft by Russian cosmonaut Maksim Surayev and US astronaut Jeffrey Williams .
I 'm an artistic person and a creator .

The vessel lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 0714 GMT .
The three - man crew is expected to arrive at the ISS on Friday .
The Canadian is the seventh private individual to make the trip .
While previous tourists have emphasised science as a motivator , Mr Laliberte says his inspiration lies elsewhere .
" I 'm an artistic person and a creator .
I 'm not a scientific .
I 'm not an engineer , " he told the BBC this month .
" Life has given me some qualities , some assets and I have built up a team of very creative people around the world .
" With those people I think we 'll present something that is originally creative and hopefully will have the result of sensitising people toward the situation of water in the world . "

On 9 October he intends to lead a " poetical social " performance from orbit .
The two - hour show will link up with contributions from 14 cities worldwide .
The whole endeavour will be streamed on the web .
" I start with the simple idea of reading a poem , which will involve characters like the Sun , the Moon and a drop of water , " he explained to the Associated Press this week .
" Those characters will then engage in a discussion , which will take the form of a little poetic story that we will read to the population of Earth . "
Celebrities , including former US Vice President Al Gore and Irish rock band U2 , are set to make appearances .
The purpose of the poem , written by Yann Martel , author of the Man-Booker prize - winning novel Life of Pi , is intended to emphasise the need for all the world 's population to have access to clean water .
Opportunities for tourists to visit the ISS are likely to become extremely limited in future .
The expected retirement of the US space shuttles in 2010 / 11 will mean all Soyuz seats are needed to maintain the resident station crews , which now number six individuals .
All the tourists have bought their tickets from the Russian Federal Space Agency through the marketing company Space Adventures .

A stripped down version of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle that could be ready as soon as 2013 to start carrying passengers to and from low Earth orbit , according to its maker , Bigelow Aerospace .
A strippeddown version of NASA 's future spaceship designed by a Nevada - based company couldbe ready as soon as 2013 , according to the Bigelow Aerospace , the private companyproposing to build it .
A Bigelowofficial flew to Denver in July to privately brief a White House - charted panelon the suggested design based on the planned Orion CrewExploration Vehicle , which will carry passengers to and from low Earthorbit .
Such asystem is crucial to Bigelow ?s plans for deploying Sundancer , an inflatable spacestation module the North Las Vegas , Nev. - based firm is building based onNASA ?s Transhab design .
In search of the means to transport paying passengersto Sundancer , Bigelow has spent the past two years working with Denver - basedUnited Launch Alliance to study a human - rated version of the Atlas5 rocket .
" OrionLite "
But it wasnot until last month that Bigelow quietly unveiled the ?
Orion Lite ? concept in a private briefing to former Lockheed Martin Chief Executive NormAugustine and his White House - charted committee tasked in May with developing arange of options for an affordable and sustainable U.S. human spaceflightprogram .
Bigelow ? screw capsule design is modeled on the Orion vehicle that Lockheed Martin ?
oneof United Launch Alliance ?s corporate parents ? is developing for NASA .
In a July30 interview with Space News , Mike Gold , director of Bigelow ?
sWashington office , said he believes a low Earth - orbit optimized version of Orion could be ready to launch atop a human - ratedversion of the Atlas 5 within three or four years ?
much sooner than NASA ? sdiscredited March 2015 target for the first crewed launch of Orion and its AresI rocket .
Gold saidthe Bigelow capsule would have the same outer mold line as NASA ?s 16 - foot ( 5 - meter ) wide Orion and possibly the same internal pressure vessel , but little else incommon .
LighterCapsule
Forstarters , NASA expects the lunar - capable Orion crew capsule andpropellant - laden service module to weigh well in excess of about 40,000 pounds ( 20,000kg ) .
Gold would not provide weight or cost estimates for Bigelow ? s
Orion Liteconcept , but said the envisioned vehicle would be light enough to launch atop anAtlas 5 with a twin - engine Centaur upper stage but no strap - on solid - rocketboosters .
This configuration , known as the 402 , is capable of lofting 27,557 pounds ( 12,500 kg ) into low Earth orbit .
Gold saidthe Bigelow capsule would also be capable of launching atop the Falcon 9 rocketHawthorne , Calif . - based Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) hopes to debutthis year .
? I don ? tthink there ?s any question that a commercial capsule can be constructed , testedand launched years before the existing Orion plan will come together , if itever does , ?
Gold said .
?
We ?re moving beyond Orion - Ares at this point .?
A start - upventure founded in the late 1990s by real estate mogul Robert Bigelow , thecompany currently has two subscale expandablespace modules in orbit .
The privately financed Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 modules were launched in 2006 and 2007 , respectively , from Russia aboard Dneprrockets .
Acombination of rising Russian launch prices and the success of Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 compelled the company to skip the launch of additional subscaledemonstrators and accelerate development of Sundancer , a six - person space stationthat could grow to accommodate 15 .
? We have ahistory of leveraging existing technology as demonstrated by the Dneprmissions , and utilizing a commercial capsule simply follows in the pragmaticpath we have begun upon , ?
Gold said .
?
We will soon be moving forward withsolicitations focused on the airframe and getting quotes from varioussubcontractors .?
Gold wouldnot say whether Orion prime contractor Lockheed Martin has or will have anyinvolvement in Orion Lite .
Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Joan Underwood did notreturn multiple phone calls seeking comment by press time .
But industry andgovernment sources familiar with the effort , said Lockheed has helped Bigelowwith the concept .
LowEarth orbit only
From theoutside , the full - size mockup built for Bigelow appears to be a clone of NASA ?
sOrion capsule adorned with the Bigelow logo .
But while NASA ?s Orion is intended to carry up to six people to the International Space Stationand four to the Moon , Gold said Bigelow ? s commercial variant will accommodate aminimum of seven passengers because it is intended for low Earth - orbit missionsonly .
That eliminates the need for bulky propellant tanks , extremely robustheat shields and other lunar - driven requirements that add mass to NASA ?s Oriondesign .
? This willbe meant for relatively short trips to and back , so there ?s a difference inhang - time , ? he said .
?
It ?s not intended to operate independently for extendedperiods , which Orion is .?
One of thebiggest deviations from NASA ?s Orion design involves the vehicle ?s landingsystem .
Whereas NASA plans call for Orion to make an Apollo - style splashdown inthe ocean , Bigelow is considering midair retrieval as a safer and moreeconomical means to land the spacecraft following atmospheric re-entry .
? Air - captureis a strategy that has been implemented many times in the past , but never doneat weights as high as a capsule , ?
Gold said .
Midaircapture was used by the military during World War II to recover gliders andduring the 1960s to catch film canisters dropped from Corona spy satellitesorbiting overhead .
Morerecently , NASA attempted a midair capture of a Genesis solar - sample returncapsule in 2004 , but a parachute failure prevented the awaiting helicopter frommaking the catch .
In 2007 , Houston - based Spacehab , now Astrotech , dropped amockup of a space station cargo module from a helicopter and subsequentlyrecaptured it .
Privatespace endeavors
While the Bigelow capsule is in the pre-system design review stage , industry sourcesfamiliar with the effort say much of the work Lockheed Martin has done on Orioncan be readily applied to Orion Lite .
Inaddition , sources said , Lockheed Martin has a number of preflight Orioncapsules planned for testing purposes that could be turned into flight vehiclesfor Bigelow .
Bigelow is not the only private space company venturing into the realm of mannedspaceflight : SpaceX plans to fit at least seven crewmembers aboard its Dragoncargo and crew capsule designed for trips to and from the space station .
Gold saidBigelow wants to see SpaceX succeed with Falcon 9 and Dragon .
? However , we would be foolish to depend completely on one capsule provider or any singlelaunch system , ?
Gold said .
?
Therefore , it ?s vital from both a practical andbusiness perspective to ensure that SpaceX and Dragon aren ?t the only optionsavailable to us , hence the need for another capsule .?
Brant said Thomas has told various media outlets that he was fired for referring a salon patron looking for waxing hair removal elsewhere , because the Chop Shop on South Street did not offer that service - a common practice at the salon , he said .
He said that another employee told him when his hours were cut that Thomas wanted to " phase him out . "
WINNIPEG–People who hold racist views , associate with neo -Nazis and teach their children white pride can still be good parents , a lawyer told a Manitoba Court of Queen 's Bench judge yesterday .
" You can fundamentally be a racist ... but the point is , people 's beliefs are legal in Canada , " Catherine Dunn said on behalf of a man fighting to regain custody of his two children .
" He has a right to care for his children . "
The court battle centres on two children who were seized last year from their home after one showed up at her elementary school with racist slogans and symbols drawn on her skin in permanent marker .
Manitoba Child and Family Services is seeking permanent guardianship of the children , but the father is fighting the move , saying the seizure violates his freedom of expression under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The agency says the markings were just the tip of the iceberg in what it alleges was a dysfunctional home .
One social worker said the girl calmly described how black people could be killed with a ball and chain .
The department accuses the father and his now - estranged wife of neglecting their children , frequently failing to bring the daughter to school as well as abusing drugs and alcohol .
It also says they raised the children in a filthy home filled with neo -Nazi items .
The government argues the Charter of Rights does not allow parents to mark their children with controversial slogans .
" An attempt to convey meaning by using another person 's body without his or her consent falls outside of the scope of expression that is protected ( under the charter ) , " government lawyer Deborah Carlson said .
But Dunn pointed out the mother admitted earlier in the trial to drawing the markings on her daughter .
She said the father never let his beliefs expose the children to potential harm .

Welcome to Coqoban !
This is a Coq implementation of Sokoban , the Japanese warehouse - keeper game .
The keeper must push the boxes to specified destination places .
He can only push one box at a time , no more , and he can't pull .
How to put the boxes in place ?
I would have liked to put a cedille underneath the " C " , but I was n't sure how to do that , or whether Coq could handle it .
Let 's talk about installing the game .
Only two .v-files , so that should n't be too hard eh ?
Coqoban_engine .v contains the actual sokoban implementing script / program / data .
It has a fair amount of remarks explaining what 's going on , for those interested to know more about this implementation .
Otherwise just compile it : coqc Coqoban_engine.v
The file Coqoban_levels .v contains 355 levels to be played with Coqoban_engine .
Proof General users may just load this file into ( x ) emacs and play .
Still it can be useful to compile the levels : coqc - I . Coqoban_levels .v
Now you can play easily without needing Proof General too , e.g. : ------- bash -2.05 b $ coqtop - I . Welcome to Coq 8.0 ( Apr 2004 ) Coq < Require Import Coqoban_levels .

Responses to “ CSS Specificity - Cheat Sheet ”
One of most common difficulties with CSS is determining what CSS rule will be applied on the page .
That was my nightmare when I started with CSS .
But actually is not so hard to understand how these rules are applied and the order of CSS Specificity .
I created CSS Cheat Sheet that I hope it can help you understand CSS Specificity better .
There are many articles talking about this issue , here are some : Cheers !
The man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing published documents on the internet today and claimed they would prove his innocence .
Hundreds of pages relating to an appeal against the conviction of Abdelbaset al - Megrahi were put into the public domain on the Megrahimystory .
net website .
Megrahi , who has terminal prostate cancer , was last month freed early by the Scottish justice secretary , Kenny MacAskill , on compassionate grounds from the life sentence he was serving at Greenock prison , in Scotland , for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in 1988 .
Before his release – which prompted fury from many of the relatives of the US victims of the bombing , in which 270 people died – Megrahi dropped his second appeal against the conviction .
His Scottish lawyers , Taylor & Kelly , said today the documents published on the website related to that appeal .
A spokesman for the firm said Megrahi hoped to continue to publish details of his appeal challenge in the forthcoming weeks .
" I have returned to Tripoli with my unjust conviction still in place , " Megrahi said in a statement .
" As a result of the abandonment of my appeal , I have been deprived of the opportunity to clear my name through the formal appeal process .
" I have vowed to continue my attempts to clear my name .
I will do everything in my power to persuade the public , and in particular the Scottish public , of my innocence .
" Through my website , I have published the material which featured in the first full hearing of my appeal . "
The material includes documents on the grounds of his appeal and the " legal sufficiency and reasonableness " of court findings .
" I hope that this can assist in the understanding of my case , especially for those who have been most profoundly affected by it , " Megrahi said .
" As can be seen from the documents released today , some of the challenges mounted before the court are supported by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission . "
Argument had been heard on the challenges but the appeal court had not been able to give its opinion by the time he dropped his appeal , he said .
The Libyan had been told he would serve a minimum of 27 years after being convicted in 2001 .
There has been a long - running campaign , supported by the relatives of some British victims , to have his conviction overturned amid fears there are serious doubts about it .
Megrahi was convicted by a three - judge Scottish court convened in the Netherlands .
He appealed unsuccessfully in 2002 .
In 2007 , the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission , which investigates possible miscarriages of justice , sent his case for a second appeal .
That process got under way earlier this year , but has been left in legal limbo by his decision to drop the appeal .
The documents published today relate to the grounds of appeal which were argued at the appeal court in Edinburgh between 28 April and 19 May .

The Wide Field Camera 3 ( WFC3 ) , a new camera aboard NASA ’s Hubble Space Telescope , snapped this image of the planetary nebula , catalogued as NGC 6302 , but more popularly called the Bug Nebula or the Butterfly Nebula .
WFC3 was installed by NASA astronauts in May 2009 , during the servicing mission to upgrade and repair the 19 - year - old Hubble telescope .
NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope is back in action after its most recent upgrade , with a spectacular array of new images showing off the telescope 's new capabilities .
Among the first images — a closely guarded secret until today — is one of galaxy NGC 6217 .
The picture was taken with NASA 's newly refurbished Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) .
This is " the day many of us have all been waiting for to celebrate Hubble 's new beginning , " said Ed Weiler , associate administrator for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C .
Hubble also snapped pictures of a group of five galaxies , a densely packed star cluster , an eerie " pillar of creation , " and a " butterfly " nebula .
Scientists also released spectroscopic observations that slice across billions of light - years to probe the cosmic - web structure of the universe and map the distribution of elements that are fundamental to life as we know it .
Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski , D - Md. , who has provided key support for Hubble and NASA in Congress , unveiled the images at NASA Headquarters .
She was given the honorary title " Godmother of Hubble . "
Mikulski's district includes the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , where Hubble images are processed .
" I fought for the Hubble repair mission because Hubble is the people 's telescope , " said Mikulski , chairwoman of the Commerce , Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NASA .
Hubble 's new instruments , including the Wide Field Camera 3 , a new super - sensitive spectrograph , were installed on the 19 - year - old telescope by shuttle astronauts during a 13 - day service mission in May .
The mission , which was initially cancelled in 2004 due to safety concerns after the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster , also revived two instruments —
Hubble 's main ACS and a versatile imaging spectrograph — that were never designed to be fixed in space .
The new instruments are more sensitive to light and , therefore , will improve Hubble 's observing efficiency significantly .
It is able to complete observations in a fraction of the time that was needed with prior generations of Hubble instruments .
The WFC3 was actually used to take a picture of Jupiter 's new black spot — thought to have been caused by a comet collision — back in July , but the camera was n't yet fully calibrated then .
WFC3 also took new images of the Omega Centauri star cluster in our galaxy , in which the contrast between hot and cool stars can vividly be seen , and the Butterfly Nebula , for which astronomers used the new filters on the camera to see the envelope of gas expanding away from this planetary nebula .
" We could n't be happier about the way things have gone , " Bob O'Connell , chair of the science oversight committee for the Wide Field Camera 3 at the University of Virginia .
" We 're fully confident the camera is working as it was intended to work . "
Images taken with the new Cosmic Origins Spectrograph were taken in one - tenth of the time of Hubble 's older spectrograph , which will allow scientists to view 10 times as many targets or look at targets one - tenth as bright , said James Green , the COS principal investigator at the University of Colorado .
Scientists hope to build a catalogue of hundreds or thousands of targets and map the distribution of matter throughout the universe .
Hubble will also be able to continue observations of Eta Carinae , one of the most massive stars in the galaxy ( and actually a pair of stars ) , that were suspended by instrument failure in 2004 , said David Leckrone , senior project scientist for Hubble at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. Eta Carinae has erupted before and is expected to do so again .
Despite a few bumps in the three - month checkout , Hubble 's systems and instruments are all up and running now .
NASA 's new administrator Charlie Bolden was also on hand to congratulate the scientists and astronauts on Hubble 's new lease on life .
Bolden was one of the astronauts on the shuttle mission that deployed Hubble in 1990 .
" Hubble has a special place in my heart , " Bolden said .
Through Hubble 's past and future observations , " our view of the universe and our place within it will never be the same , " he added .

Eight years after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , the Pew Global Attitudes Project finds that support for Osama bin Laden has declined considerably among Muslim publics in recent years .
Moreover , majorities or pluralities among eight of the nine Muslim publics surveyed this year say that suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilians can never be justified to defend Islam ; only in the Palestinian territories does a majority endorse such attacks .
The drop in support for bin Ladenhas been most dramatic in Indonesia , Pakistan and Jordan .
Currently , about one - quarter of Muslims in Jordan ( 28 % ) and Indonesia ( 25 % ) express confidence in the al Qaeda leader to do the right thing regarding world affairs ; in 2003 , majorities in each country agreed ( 56 % and 59 % , respectively ) .
In Pakistan , where bin Laden is believed to be hiding , 18 % of Muslims now say they have confidence in him .
Just last year , 34 % of Pakistani Muslims expressed support for bin Laden and , in 2003 , nearly half ( 46 % ) agreed .
Pakistani Muslims ’ views of al Qaeda have also grown less favorable over the past year ; 9 % have a favorable view of the group , compared with 25 % in 2008 .
( Publics in the other nations surveyed were not asked about their opinion of al Qaeda in the current poll ; for a more detailed analysis of Pakistani views about extremism see “ Pakistani Public Opinion : Growing Concerns About Extremism , Continuing Discontent with U.S. , ” released Aug. 13 , 2009 )
Only in Nigeria is Osama bin Laden more popular among Muslims than he was earlier in the decade .
More than half of Nigerian Muslims ( 54 % ) have confidence in bin Laden when it comes to world affairs ; 44 % said that was the case in 2003 .
Bin Laden also has the support of most Muslims in the Palestinian territories ( 52 % ) , but a much more solid majority of Palestinian Muslims had confidence in him in 2003 ( 72 % ) .
Young Palestinians are far more likely to express positive views of the al Qaeda leader .
Six - in - ten Palestinian Muslims under 30 say they have confidence in bin Laden ; 46 % of those age 30 and older share that view .
The age gap was much narrower in 2003 — 76 % of those under 30 and 69 % in the older age group had confidence in bin Laden then .
Support for suicide bombing and other forms or violence that target civilians has also declined in recent years .
Among the Muslim publics surveyed , Pakistanis now express the strongest rejection to this kind of violence — 87 % say such acts are never justified .
In 2002 , just months after the September 11 attacks , one - third in Pakistan said suicide bombing was often or sometimes justified in order to defend Islam , while 43 % said it was rarely or never justified .
In Lebanon , the percentage of Muslims that say suicide bombing is often or sometimes justified has plummeted to 38 % from 74 % in 2002 .
Still , support for this kind of violence against civilians among Muslims in Lebanon is one of the highest among the publics surveyed .
Lebanese Shias are about twice as likely as Sunnis to endorse suicide bombing ( 51 % vs. 25 % ) .
The pace of U.S. job losses continued to slow in September as the private sector shed fewer jobs than in the previous month , according to a report offering a preview of government data due Friday .
Meanwhile , gross domestic product decreased at a 0.7 % annual rate in the second quarter , better than the 1 % decline previously estimated , the Commerce Department said Wednesday .
It was a big improvement over GDP 's 6.4 % decline in the first quarter .

Deborah Arnott is a professional anti-smoker .
She makes her living from it .
She thinks she can " save lives " .
Since we all get a lifetime and she is not offering immortality , what she means is you might have a longer life .
Given the choice of 50 years as a free person or 70 years as a slave , she would choose slavery .
I would n't , and I suspect there are many like me , as most people seem to go for quality of life not quantity .
Time , the great mystery , is elastic .
Watch the kettle boil and it takes " a long time " .
Ten hours in a police cell might seem like 10 months .
There are many jokes playing with this idea or observation .
This quantitative view of life seems dominant today among the medical profession and politicians – as though they can and should make these kind of choices for us .
It seems a recent phenomenon , and not really very wise .
On big issues it might be good , but on small ones it 's tyrannical .
There are a lot of people who do n't like smoke or smoking but there are a lot of people who do .
Tobacco is a great calmer , it relieves stress , it can put you in a contemplative mood .
Bertrand Russell , Albert Einstein , Clement Attlee and Stanley Baldwin , with their pipes , do n't look too stressed .
I used to hitchhike in my youth with a pipe , counting on a pipe smoker picking up a fellow contemplator .
It worked many times .
If tobacco is taken away , something else moves in to replace it .
We can now see in the US what this is .
Television there is saturated with drug advertising painkillers and antidepressants and all sorts of other things , all on prescription .
Just tell your doctor you need whatever the product is and you 'll be fine .
It 's hardly an improvement .
I am hyperactive , I seem to have more energy now than I did 10 years ago , I am producing more work with a clearer head .
I am aware not everybody is like this , certainly on the surface we are all different .
I cannot drink alcohol – I am prone to pancreatitis , it knocks me out quickly and I 'm in bed for three or four days .
I gave it up 15 years ago .
I have never had pancreatitis since .
Others have a constitution like a horse and can consume large quantities of alcohol .
It must be the same with smoking .
The madness of anti-smokers is not seeing this .
Deborah Arnott , with her cold abstractions of statistics , says " half of all smokers will die from their addiction " , but as we know the other half will die of something else ( she 's not offering immortality ) , most people laugh or shrug their shoulders .
She seems obsessed with death and " saving lives " .
I do n't suppose she 's much fun or has much humour .
She must think the late Keith Floyd was terrible , and I 'm sure he would n't have thought much about her view of life .
Just another boring busybody telling people how to live .
We do n't have a very representative parliament .
They seem to discuss trivia and nothing else .
Because of technology we are probably moving into a period of chaos .
Power is shifting , and I 'm aware this has a great deal to do with images and their distribution .
The political class is confused .
There seems to me to be a growing madness , smoking is down , obesity is up ; is there any relationship here ?
Politics seems so dishonest .
It is said smokers " cost " the NHS money .
How , one wonders .
They pay a lot of tax .
If they die younger , as it says on the packet , one can only conclude that the government can't rip them off any more – a high cost , really ?
I have thought for a long time that a political and media elite imposes things on us that people did not request .
They must have a low opinion of most people who simply can't be trusted to keep things in order .
The tax on cigarettes is raised at practically every budget .
It is an iron law that as the tax rises , so does smuggling .
It is now enormous .
Putting cigarettes " under the counter " is now quite funny .
That 's where a lot of people buy them already , so this is just going to get bigger .
It will mean non-smokers will pay more tax , as revenue still has come to the government .
From where ?
This is never debated , because the press has the same agenda as the government .
We 'd all be healthier without tobacco .
I , for one , just do n't believe it .
Like alcohol , it wo n't go away .
People will make their own and to stop that will need a bigger tyranny than we have now .
Deborah Arnott wo n't mind so long as it's " smoke free " .
A far more lawless society will emerge , and the statistics might please her .
Others will know they are not true .
Susan Davis reports on the latest WSJ / NBC News poll .
There ’s more bad news for Republicans : about three times as many Americans disapprove of how they are handling the heath care debate than approve , according to the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll .
A clear majority , 65 % , said they disapprove of how congressional Republicans are handling the issue of health care overhaul , while just 21 % said they approve .
Those numbers are little changed from last month — their approval rating stayed the same , but the disapproval was slightly lower at 62 % .
Meanwhile , President Barack Obama ’s handling of the health care debate has divided Americans almost evenly : 45 % approve of the president ’s actions while 46 % disapprove .
Since August , Obama has tightened that gap slightly , as 47 % disapproved then and 41 % approved .
The full poll will be released on www.wsj.com at 6:30 p.m. EDT .

No question , Joe Wilson was a royal schmuck for screaming " you lie " at President Obama during his speech yesterday .
But Wilson 's worse sin was that he lied , and too many people ( many of them in the media ) are forgetting that .
As a refresher , President Obama said :
There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants .
This , too , is false – the reforms I ’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally .
Congressman Wilson , take note : President Obama was correct .
You were wrong , as the actual legislative language of HR 3200 makes clear .
Page 143 for those keeping score at home , Lines 3 to 7 : SEC .
246 . NO FEDERAL PAYMENT FOR UNDOCUMENTED ALIENS .
Nothing in this subtitle shall allow Federal payments for affordability credits on behalf of individuals who are not lawfully present in the United States .
Wilson has already apologized for his childish outburst , but what he really should have apologized for is lying .
In the end , Joe Wilson is an irrelevant gnat .
As Meteor Blades wrote last night , his sense of decorum wo n't matter once his fifteen minutes are up .
But unless we fight back against the kinds of lies that Joe Wilson and his Republican colleagues are spreading , we 'll never get meaningful health care reform .
And that 's what really matters .

When supervolcanoes blow their tops , the world 's climate is altered and life is snuffed out regionally and challenged globally .
Such an event is thought to have occurred 74,000 years ago when the Toba supervolcano erupted in what is now Sumatra with a force estimated to be 1,000 to 10,000 times that of Mount St. Helens .
The timing of Toba 's tempest fits with an interesting bottleneck known to exist in human evolution , as seen in DNA evidence .
The population became very small sometime between 90,000 and 60,000 years ago .
And a new idea floating around suggests that the eruption may have contributed — by necessity — to our supreme intelligence today .
Further , it has been suggested , we may be undergoing the next great leap in smarts right now .
More on all that lower down .
First , some fresh research on the eruption :
Scientists have theorized that Toba triggered plunging global temperatures that caused ice sheets to grow for a thousand years and led to a mass die - off of plants and animals .
Perhaps only a few thousand early humans survived , the thinking goes , and that 's why all human DNA today is so remarkably similar — though we branched off from other primates millions of years ago , we all come from the same few folks who survived Toba , and we 've had only 74,000 years to evolve , an eyeblink in the grand billions - year scheme of evolution .
Neat idea , but climate model simulations of the eruption have been unable to produce the glaciation to the satisfaction of all those who study this stuff , and there are no climate observations to adequately support the volcanic winter .
A new study offers another mechanism to explain the great human bottleneck .
' Devastating consequences '
Alan Robock and Georgiy Stenchikov at Rutgers University and colleagues ran six climate model simulations to include Toba - induced changes in sunlight , plant life and chemical changes in the atmosphere that might all affect how long a global volcanic cloud could last and what would happen .
They assumed a wide range of outputs from 33 to 900 times what Mount Pinatubo spat into the air in 1991 in an event that lowered global temperatures slightly for two year .
None of the models initiated glaciation .
But they did produce a decade of severe volcanic winter , which would likely have had devastating consequences for humanity and global ecosystems , the researchers write in the latest issue of the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres .
" The ' volcanic winter ' following a supervolcano eruption of the size of Toba today would have devastating consequences for humanity and global ecosystems , " they write .
" These simulations support the theory that the Toba eruption indeed may have contributed to a genetic bottleneck . "
All this has interesting implication for our future .
Lurking disasters
It 's not known when the next supervolcano will blow .
But it is presumed one will .
Experts estimate such events occur every 50,000 to 100,000 years ( and an incoming asteroid or comet could do the trick , too ) .
One of the biggest lurking disasters is at Yellowstone National Park , where a supervolcano erupted 620,000 years ago .
It will erupt again , scientists predict , and it could cover half the United States with ash up to 3 feet ( 1 meter ) deep .
What 's really interesting to ponder is the idea that the next great catastrophe wo n't just challenge our existence , but it could make us smarter .
After a disaster like Toba , early humans would have been forced to break generations - long habits and get creative to find food .
Neurophysiologist William Calvin argues that our bright minds — enabling language use and the ability to plan ahead — evolved in response to such catastrophes .
Already happening ?
In The Atlantic this month , Jamais Cascio of the Institute for the Future uses Calvin 's idea as a springboard to propose that current challenges , from global warming to food and fuel shortages , will force us to evolve further .
" But this time we do n’t have to rely on natural evolution to make us smart enough to survive , " Cascio writes .
" We can do it ourselves , right now , by harnessing technology and pharmacology to boost our intelligence . "
In fact , he says , it 's already happening .
Our collective ability to gather , store and build upon knowledge — call it Google et al. — is creating You+ , Cascio reasons .
What we need now are better tools to analyze the information we have , he notes , and then we can move on to that higher primate we 're bound to become .
Heady stuff .
And if we 're lucky , Toba and Yellowstone will hold off until we 're smart enough to figure out how to deal with them .

Arsenal
Strength of team / squad
Thomas Vermaelen , a left - footed centre - half signed from Ajax for £ 10 m , featured in the first four pre-season matches and looked composed , albeit against limited opposition .
He has suffered a slight hamstring injury , however .
Tomas Rosicky made a welcome return against Barnet , playing the first 45 minutes , and has featured at the Emirates Cup against Atlético Madrid and Rangers .
Arsène Wenger will consider the fit-again Rosicky almost as a new signing , together with Eduardo , who has got three pre-season goals to his name .
The big setback has been Samir Nasri breaking a leg in training .
He will be out for three months .
Theo Walcott has not yet played after his England Under - 21 exertions in June .
Wenger remains under pressure to spend , having offloaded Kolo Touré and Emmanuel Adebayor .
Tactics
Wenger has preferred a lone man in attack with two players in support – granted the licence to drift wide or inside – and a solid midfield three .
Cesc Fábregas has been encouraged to break forward from his position within the trio .
Against Hannover and Atlético , Robin van Persie was the focal point of the attack – he was preferred to Nicklas Bendtner , who played in one of the support roles .
Andrey Arshavin , who has had an excellent pre-season , has floated from the left .
One to watch Jack Wilshere
The 17 - year - old midfielder inspired Arsenal to win the FA Youth Cup last season and , having made eight first - team appearances , three of them as a starter in the Carling Cup , has been earmarked by Wenger for further progress .
Small but tough , he fits easily into Arsenal 's fluid attacking style and was man of the match in both the team 's Emirates Cup games , scoring twice against Rangers yesterday .
Manager Arsène Wenger
After 13 seasons at the club , the job does not get any easier .
An often beleaguered figure last term , he is desperate to make a more assured start this time but three of their first four league fixtures are away : Everton , Manchester United and Manchester City .
There is also the small matter of the Champions League qualifying round to negotiate .
Club 's global appeal
Chasing pre-season revenue or cracking the US or Asian markets has never been to Wenger 's taste and , as usual , he retreated to Austria with his squad for an intensive pre-season training camp and a sprinkling of friendlies .
During their time away , the Gunners faced amateurs from the Austrian fourth division , Hungary 's most unpronounceable team and Hannover .
They stepped up their preparations at the Emirates Cup this past weekend and play Valencia away next Saturday .
David Hytner
Chelsea
Strength of team / squad
Despite the lack of a marquee signing Chelsea 's squad retains its depth and class , even with Joe Cole and Michael Ballack undergoing rehabilitation from injury .
Daniel Sturridge and Ross Turnbull are useful additions , the latter a back - up goalkeeper , and Yuri Zhirkov – on the basis of his excellent debut against Milan – will offer balance , defensive surety and spring upfield , whether he is employed at full - back or , more likely , in midfield .
Deco , for now , and Ricardo Carvalho remain at the club , with the centre - half eager to put last season 's toils behind him .
Tactics
Carlo Ancelotti intends to play a diamond in midfield , capped initially by Frank Lampard as the playmaker and with Mikel John Obi likely to be at its base .
There will be a pair of strikers – gone , apparently , are the days of 4–3 –3 with Didier Drogba barging forward with only wide men for company – with the full - backs asked to supply the team 's natural width .
Luiz Felipe Scolari tried something similar but never really struck a balance between rip-roaring attack and defensive industry .
The Italian in Ancelotti will not put up with frailties if the full - backs are caught too often upfield and the channels left exposed .
The team 's play may prove far less direct than in recent seasons , with Ancelotti placing the onus on retaining possession in midfield , all neat triangles and overlaps , rather than seeking out Drogba 's brawn and muscle through the middle .
One to watch Daniel Sturridge
Manchester City may regret letting Daniel Sturridge slip away .
The teenager actually stands more chance of making a mark at first - team level with Chelsea than he did at Eastlands given City 's recent outlay on forwards .
He impressed against Seattle Sounders with a debut goal and assist , unnerved Internazionale at times in California and should have added to his tally against the Mexicans .
Manager Carlo Ancelotti
Ancelotti's English is improving though it remains a work in progress .
There appears to be a real determination about the Italian to expand his vocabulary and first impressions suggest he will not fall into the same trap as Scolari , whose English rather stagnated once competitive games came thick and fast .
Club 's global appeal
The US appears to have taken to Chelsea .
This was the Premier League club 's fourth visit to the country in five years for pre-season and , at last , they have made their mark .
Chelsea shirts littered the considerable crowds in Seattle , Pasadena , Baltimore and Arlington , where the team played .
Attendances were magnificent .
The club is making an impression in those parts .
Dominic Fifield
Liverpool
Strength of team / squad
It was hard to read too much into either game of Liverpool 's Asian tour – Rafael Benítez used 26 players against Thailand and 24 against Singapore .
The late return of the Spanish contingent after the Confederations Cup limited them to cameo roles and Steven Gerrard missed the trip due to his court appearance .
Liverpool 's only major new recruit , Glen Johnson , showed signs of attacking nous but the right - back suffered an achilles injury against Thailand and missed the match in Singapore .
The striker Andriy Voronin featured following a year on loan at Hertha Berlin but despite scoring , he failed to shine and does not look capable of easing the burden on Fernando Torres .
Another option is desperately needed and with Martin Skrtel injured and Sami Hyypia gone , defensive cover is also vital .
Lucas and Ryan Babel impressed , giving fans hope they are finally ready to repay the faith shown in them by the manager .
The expected departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid will leave a major gap in midfield and Benítez will need an adequate replacement .
Tactics
Benítez played with two up front in Asia but when the serious action begins he is unlikely to deviate from the system that worked so well last season , with Gerrard playing just behind a lone striker , Torres .
The acquisition of Johnson highlights the manager 's desire to play with attacking full - backs next season in a bid to avoid another string of frustrating home draws .
One to watch Krisztian Nemeth
The Hungarian striker was one of the stars of the reserves ' title triumph in 2007 - 08 but his progress last season was wrecked by injury .
Now fit , the 20 - year - old displayed his finishing ability with two goals against Singapore .
Manager Rafael Benítez
The Spaniard is determined to kick on from last season 's second - place finish , with the Premier League arguably the priority for most at Anfield .
Benítez grew increasingly frustrated in Asia at the constant questioning about Alonso 's future but remained bullish about his club 's title chances , saying the heat and humidity were ideal for knocking his players into shape .
Club 's global appeal
Fears about the travelling were eased as the week - long tour proved a success both on and off the pitch .
As well as playing two matches , they trained twice a day and packed in a host of public appearances .
The players ' every move created a frenzy , emphasising the commercial opportunities for the club in this part of the world .
The remarkable passion for Liverpool in Asia will have been greatly strengthened by the trip .

Strength of team / squad
The frustration for Mark Hughes is that two of his six summer signings , Roque Santa Cruz and Carlos Tevez , have not had a minute of action in pre-season so far , but the manager is entitled to think that it has been an " exceptional " summer – the one downside being John Terry 's apparent change of heart about leaving Chelsea and the inability , as yet , to sign Joleon Lescott from Everton .
On the plus side , Gareth Barry has impressed on the club's three - match tour to South Africa and Hughes now has at least two accomplished players for every position in midfield and attack .
Tactics
Hughes favoured a 4 – 2 – 3 – 1 system last season , occasionally switching to a more defence - minded 4–3 – 2 – 1 when the team were playing away from home against strong opposition .
This season he has a far more talented squad and may alter his formation accordingly .
The side now have a target man , meaning they should be better at holding up the ball in attacking positions .
Expect to see experiments with 4 – 1 –3 –2 and also a more orthodox 4 –4–2 .
One to watch Carlos Tevez
" Stupid " is the word that one senior Manchester United official has used to describe the striker 's defection to a club that are not even involved in the Europa League .
Tevez certainly has a point to prove and his other role , as a symbol of City 's ambition , seems to have increased since the provocative Welcome to Manchester billboard that led Sir Alex Ferguson to describe City as being guilty of " arrogance " and being a " small club with a small mentality " .
Manager Mark Hughes
Hughes has been bristling with confidence on the back of the summer spending as well as the departure of so many unneeded squad players .
The word at City now is that the atmosphere in training is as good as it has ever been under the current management .
Hughes has handled Ferguson 's criticisms impeccably and he has also broken up the Brazilian quartet that was considered too cliquish by the club 's management , with Jo joining Everton on a season 's loan and Elano going to the Turkish club Galatasaray .
Club 's global appeal
The tournament in South Africa was not the most prestigious event and there was none of the hysteria that accompanies United 's visits to south - east Asia , for example .
But City are clearly proving to be a draw these days .
The club still have to play Rangers at Ibrox , as well as hosting Celtic , and they have also been invited to play Barcelona at Camp Nou on their first blank Wednesday of the new season .

Manchester United
Strength of team / squad
Without Cristiano Ronaldo , United occasionally lacked a bit of star quality on a tour to the Far East and Germany , particularly when the standard rose in the Audi Cup in Munich .
The mantra is that United will be " difficult to beat " and they retain a formidable first - choice defence , not least in the centre , with Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic .
Michael
Owen showed with four goals in four games on the Asian tour that he is less of a gamble than some imagine and the most expensive summer signing , Antonio Valencia , made a positive impression with a goal on his debut , against Boca Juniors .
Covering the loss of Ronaldo 's goals and assists will be key .
Tactics
The Ronaldo years came to be dominated by a 4 - 3 - 3 formation but on tour United reverted to 4 - 4 - 2 .
Ferguson was adamant that this season Dimitar Berbatov and Wayne Rooney would be used as out and out centre - forwards , although he said this about Rooney a year ago .
Interestingly , given how they were once a fixture for England , Rooney and Owen did not play together in any of United 's six games .
One to watch Ben Foster
Twenty - six is rather late to be breaking through , but Foster has done a lot of waiting .
Ferguson seems convinced by his quality and has said he is " miles ahead " of any other English goalkeeper .
However , if Foster is the best keeper in England , then Edwin van der Sar remains one of the best in the world .
Granting Foster games in the Carling Cup is one thing , playing him in the closing weeks of a season quite another .
Manager Sir Alex Ferguson
Ferguson has joined Geoffrey Boycott , Tony Benn and Alan Bennett as a national treasure .
He travelled around the Far East and Germany saying exactly what he thought of Real Madrid , Manchester City and Rafael Benítez .
If some people found this unsettling , then it should be remembered that Ferguson is usually right .
This time last year in South Africa , Ferguson highlighted Chelsea 's ageing squad .
That seemed ridiculous when they raced into an early lead , but not when they collapsed in mid-season .
Club 's global appeal
Despite the loss of Ronaldo , United 's greatest marketing vehicle since David Beckham , the club 's appeal shows no sign of slowing .
Had the bombing of the team hotel in Jakarta not forced the cancellation of their trip to Indonesia , United would have played in front of more than 400,000 people .
As it was , they managed to sell 30,000 tickets in Kuala Lumpur in two days and Rooney duly replaced Ronaldo as the most sought - after player .

When we extend our Google Wave preview next week , we will encourage users of Internet Explorer to install Google Chrome Frame , an open source plug - in that brings HTML5 and other open web technologies to Internet Explorer .
On first login to Google Wave , Internet Explorer 6 , 7 , and 8 users will see this message :
A few clicks later , the user will be running Google Wave in Internet Explorer , but it will be every bit as fast as in Google Chrome !
Google
Wave depends on strong JS and DOM rendering performance to provide a desktop - like experience in the browser .
HTML5 's offline storage and web workers will enable us to add great features without having to compromise on performance .
Unfortunately , Internet Explorer , still used by the majority of the Web 's users , has not kept up with such fairly recent developments in Web technology .
Compared with other browsers , the JavaScript performance is many times slower and HTML5 support is still far behind .
Likewise , the many different versions of IE still in use -- each with its own set of CSS quirks and layout limitations -- further complicates building rich Web applications .
In the past , the Google Wave team has spent countless hours solely on improving the experience of running Google Wave in Internet Explorer .
We could continue in this fashion , but using Google Chrome Frame instead lets us invest all that engineering time in more features for all our users , without leaving Internet Explorer users behind .
It is remarkable how quickly the browser landscape has changed since Lars and his brother Jens wrote the first prototype of Google Maps back in early 2004 .
Back then , Internet Explorer was their browser of choice .
These are exciting times indeed to be developing for the Web !
Happy waving !

Nearly 100 university staff have been made redundant this year as funding per student drops for the first time in six years .
Union leaders and vice - chancellors say universities have reached a tipping point where further restructuring and cost - cutting will significantly impact on the quality of education .
An Official Information
Act request sent to New Zealand 's eight universities reveals there have been 30 forced redundancies , 46 voluntary redundancies and 19 non -defined redundancies this year .
The highest number of forced redundancies was at Auckland University , which had 12 , while Massey had 19 redundancies in total , but it did not define whether they were forced or voluntary .
In the South Island , Otago University had seven redundancies while Canterbury and Lincoln universities had three and four , respectively .
Treasury figures show tertiary spending on a per-student basis has dropped below $ 10,000 this year the first decrease since 2003 and is expected to drop again next year .
Tertiary Education Union president Tom Ryan said the job losses were significant and the situation was " very worrying " .
" The way things are heading , it will get significantly worse over the coming months and beyond . "
In the May Budget , funding for the university tripartite agreement which guaranteed salary increases for academics was cut , with expected savings of more than $ 55 million by 2013 .
Ryan said this would push academic salaries further behind Australia , making it difficult to recruit top people in a tough international environment .
A recent Government report revealed almost 40 per cent of tertiary teachers were aged over 50 a 15 per cent increase over the past 15 years .
Ryan described this as a " demographic time - bomb " which , combined with higher salaries overseas , was exacerbating a dangerous situation .
" This is the only Government that we are aware of anywhere that 's actively disinvesting in education .
" Potentially , the university system will lose its credibility and that would be tragic . "
New Zealand Vice - Chancellors '
Committee chairman Professor Roger Field said universities were at a " critical stage " facing rising enrolments and falling revenue .
" There 's genuine concern about the impact on the quality of what universities can provide with the current level of funding . "
I ’ve just finished Hunter Lewis ’ new book Where Keynes Went Wrong : And Why World Governments Keep Creating Inflation , Bubbles and Busts link here ( scroll down to bottom ) .
The biggest surprise of the book is that it is thoroughly Austrian .
The author draws upon Mises , Hayek , Rothbard , Resiman , Hutt , Rueff , and other thinkers in this tradition who have been most critical of Keynes .
Lewis says that he set out to write the book that Hazlitt had planned to write , which resulted in The Failure of the New Economics .
While Hazlitt had intended to produce a popular book , as he delved more deeply into his task he produced something closer to an academic treatise .
Lewis ’ book is accessible to anyone who has had a macro course or even to the general reader of business media .
The first section , What Keynes Really Said , consists of short excerpts from Keynes ’ own writing , mostly The General Theory .
Lewis tries to provide the reader with a fair and unbiased understanding of Keynes ’ views .
Going back to the source is a worthwhile endeavor because most people know what they know through a macro textbook using a second or third - generation graphical synthesis of Keynes ’ idea , or through media buzzwords such as “ stimulus ” and “ consumer confidence ” .
The second section , Why Keynes Was Wrong , mirrors the structure of the first section .
In the table of contents , the two sections are lined up side - by - side in columns .
For example , a section in the first part called Spend More , Save Less , and Grow Wealthy is lined up against a section in the second part called Spend More , Save Less , and Grow Poorer .
There are several main themes in book .
One is that most of Keynes key doctrines are paradoxical .
The most well - known example is the paradox of thrift : saving is good for the individual but if everyone tries to save , then it drives the economy downwards into a bust .
Another example of paradox is “ unemployment equilibrium ” .
In each case , Lewis provides simple , logical arguments against Keynes ’s paradoxes .
The book could be characterized as a defense of common sense against obscurantism and muddle - headedness .
Keynes ’ reliance on paradox brings to mind what philosopher Michael Levin calls “ the skim milk fallacy ” :
According to this paradigm , science always shows that things are the reverse of how they seem .
Deep scrutiny of virtually any phenomenon will reveal that everyday convictions about it are wrong .
In fact , taking things at face value betrays naiveté , while readiness to debunk is the mark of the sophisticate , what David Riesman called an “ inside dopester . ”
Another theme is Keynes ’ reliance on his own opinion without any supporting facts .
Lewis gives many examples of how Keynes moves through a point in his reasoning that cannot be decided on purely theoretical grounds by recourse to pure opinion without any empirical support .
Lewis has located empirical studies from the subsequent years suggesting the opposite of Keynes ’ opinions ( and in other cases , Lewis provides a common sense argument against Keynes ’ opinion ) .
Where some empirical work existed at the time , Keynes would dismiss with no supporting evidence if he needed things to go in the opposite direction in order to arrive at the result he wanted .
This book fills a missing niche in the literature : a debunking of Keynes for the general reader .
I believe that this book would also be useful as a supplement in a macro course .
But its most important contribution in my view is that it demystifies Keynes .
The ideas in The General Theory form the foundation of modern macro-economics , which is the basis for the modern practice of central banking and pretty much all monetary policy around the world .
What I mean by the mystification of Keynes is that , because his theories are so long - established and deeply embedded in academic economics , government , and the public consciousness , it is difficult not to think that there must be something really deep and profound there .
Upon reading Lewis ’ book , it is somewhat shocking to see how weak his arguments are and how poorly they stand up to any kind of logical examination .
I wanted to contribute to the design of daily domestic noises .
alarms , mobile phones , a doorbell ; he is of the opinion that not enough thought has been given to the noises they produce .

The Obama administration called Thursday for a comprehensive national system for regulating the use of federal waters along the nation ’s marine and Great Lakes shores , now administered by a hodgepodge of federal , state or other agencies with often - conflicting goals .
The recommendation , outlined in an interim report by a panel appointed in June by President Obama , said regulators should consider marine regions as a whole when issuing rules rather than , say , regulating fishing one species at a time .
It also said they should keep the health of marine ecosystems in mind when allocating particular activities in particular places , like fishing , shipping or energy .
The report says this planning would be the major focus of its final report , due in December .
The panel comprises representatives of environmental , transportation and other agencies .
A controversial tribunal decision that some company practices can discriminate against employees with strongly held views on climate change will be challenged in the courts .
Senior executive Tim Nicholson claimed he was unfairly dismissed by a property investment company because his views on the environment conflicted with other managers ' " contempt for the need to cut carbon emissions " .
In the first case of its kind , an employment tribunal decided that Nicholson , 41 , had views amounting to a " philosophical belief in climate change " , allowing him the same legal protection against discrimination as religious beliefs .
Nicholson , the former head of sustainability at Newcastle - based Grainger plc , says he was dismissed after disagreeing with practices including an instance where an IT worker was flown from London to Ireland to collect his BlackBerry , and another where Nicholson 's attempts to obtain data to develop a carbon management strategy were blocked .
Despite having written policies on the environment , Grainger executives attended meetings in " some of the most highly polluting cars on the road " , Nicholson claimed .
" [ My belief ] affects how I live my life including my choice of home , how I travel , what I buy , what I eat and drink , what I do with my waste , and my hopes and fears , " he said .
" For example , I no longer travel by plane , I have eco-renovated my home , I compost my food waste and encourage others to reduce their carbon emissions . "
Judge David Sneath said at the employment tribunal : " [ Nicholson ] has certain views about climate change and acts upon those views in the way in which he leads his life .
In my judgment his belief goes beyond a mere opinion . "
The decision , which is being challenged by the company , comes two years after the law on religious discrimination was changed so that beliefs no longer had to be " similar " to religious faith to receive protection in the workplace .
Under the new law " philosophical belief " is protected by the law alongside religious belief if it passes a legal test requiring it to be cogent , serious and " worthy of respect in a democratic society " .
The case has attracted criticism from some , however , who argue that the removal of the requirement that beliefs are " similar " to religious faith will create a potential minefield for employers .
Caroline Doran , employment partner at London solicitors Sprecher Grier Halberstam , said : " The removal of the word similar has [ also ] led to a range of employment litigation to determine whether patriotism or loyalty to a flag or support for the British National party are covered as suitable beliefs .
" This … may create an abundance of litigation in the future as the tribunals will have to weigh an individual 's belief against the yardstick of current popular thinking . "
Nicholson 's lawyer said that the case reflected a necessary clarification of the law that would affect large numbers of employees .
" This is a case that will clarify the law for the ever - increasing numbers of people who take a philosophical stance on the environment and climate change , and who lead their lives according to those principles " , said Shah Qureshi , head of employment law at solicitors Bindmans .
" These are often deeply held views based on the premise that without change humanity will suffer … people should be able to express such views without fear of retribution or discrimination . "
On Sept. 14 , 2001 , the U.S. House of Representatives considered House Joint Resolution 64 , “ To authorize the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the United States . ”
The wounds of 9/11 were raw , and the lust for vengeance seemed universal .
The House vote was remarkable , relative to the extreme partisanship now in evidence in Congress , since 420 House members voted in favor of the resolution .
More remarkable , though , was the one lone vote in opposition , cast by Barbara Lee of San Francisco .
Lee opened her statement on the resolution , “ I rise today with a heavy heart , one that is filled with sorrow for the families and loved ones who were killed and injured in New York , Virginia and Pennsylvania . ”
Her emotions were palpable as she spoke from the House floor .
“ September 11 changed the world .
Our deepest fears now haunt us .
Yet I am convinced that military action will not prevent further acts of international terrorism against the United States . …
We must not rush to judgment .
Far too many innocent people have already died .
Our country is in mourning .
If we rush to launch a counterattack , we run too great a risk that women , children and other noncombatants will be caught in the crossfire . ”
The Senate also passed the resolution , 98 - 0 , and sent it on to President George W. Bush .
What he did with the authorization , and the Iraq War authorization a year later , has become , arguably , the greatest foreign policy catastrophe in United States history .
What President Barack Obama will do with Afghanistan is the question now .
On Oct. 7 , the U.S. enters its ninth year of occupation of Afghanistan — equal to the time the United States was involved in World War I , World War II and the Korean War combined .
Obama campaigned on his opposition to the war in Iraq , but pledged at the same time to escalate the war in Afghanistan .
On his first Friday in office , Commander in Chief Obama ’s military fired three Hellfire missiles from an unmanned drone into Pakistan , reportedly killing 22 people , mostly civilians , including women and children .
He has increased U.S. troops in Afghanistan by more than 20,000 , to a total numbering 61,000 .
This does not count the private contractors in Afghanistan , who now outnumber the troops .
The new U.S. military commander in Afghanistan , Gen. Stanley McChrystal , is expected to ask for even more troops .
This past August was the deadliest month yet for U.S. troops in Afghanistan , with 51 killed , and 2009 is by far the deadliest year , with 200 U.S. troops killed so far .
These statistics do n’t count the soldiers who commit suicide after returning home , nor those injured , and certainly do n’t include the number of Afghans killed .
The attacks also are increasing in sophistication , according to recent reports .
So it may be no surprise that more comparisons are now being made between Afghanistan and Vietnam .
When asked about the comparison , Obama recently told The New York Times : “ You have to learn lessons from history .
On the other hand , each historical moment is different .
You never step into the same river twice .
And so Afghanistan is not Vietnam . …
The dangers of overreach and not having clear goals and not having strong support from the American people , those are all issues that I think about all the time . ”
According to a recent CNN / Opinion Research poll , 57 percent of those asked oppose the U.S. war in Afghanistan , reportedly the highest level of opposition since the war began in 2001 .
Among those polled , 75 percent of Democrats opposed the war , which might explain statements recently from key congressional Democrats against sending more troops to Afghanistan .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last Thursday , “ I do n’t think there ’s a great deal of support for sending more troops to Afghanistan in the country or in the Congress , ” echoing Sen .
Russ Feingold , D - Wis. , and Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Obama said in his health care speech before the joint session of Congress , “ The plan I ’m proposing will cost around $ 900 billion over 10 years — less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . ”
President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam and ultimately decided not to run for re-election .
But he also passed Medicare , the revered , single - payer health insurance program for seniors .
Barbara
Lee presciently compared the invasion of Afghanistan to Vietnam in her speech back in 2001 and closed by quoting the Rev. Nathan Baxter , dean of the National Cathedral : “ As we act , let us not become the evil that we deplore . ”

Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett told the county commissioners Tuesday the state ’s medical marijuana laws need clarification because of discrepancies between what medical marijuana laws allow and other drug laws ban .
He said : Whether dispensaries are even legal remains unclear .
Most dispensaries would not meet the definition of primary caregiver , but patients who are prescribed marijuana need to buy it somewhere if they do n’t want to grow their own .
Commercial growing operations probably are not legal , but if there are dispensaries , it makes sense to have growers to supply them .
Land - use regulations likely will be the next battleground , as some municipalities move to ban dispensaries within their boundaries and others try to regulate where they can locate .
Liquor licensing rules may provide a model for regulating dispensaries .
It ’s legal to sell alcohol , but local zoning and the liquor board regulate who can sell alcohol , where liquor stores and bars may locate and what rules govern each .
Probation rules must accommodate probationers ’ rights to use marijuana for medical reasons .
Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said Tuesday that the state ’s medical marijuana laws desperately need more clarity , and he ’s not interested in prosecuting cases that fall in the gray areas between legalization and prohibition of the drug .
Enforcing marijuana laws is his office ’s lowest priority , Garnett told the Boulder County commissioners .
“ I want to spend as little of my office ’s resources as possible prosecuting marijuana cases , ” he said .
“ I want to be practical and helpful to the medical marijuana community .
I also want to be realistic about what the law is . ”
The commissioners asked Garnett to address the enforcement around medical marijuana after Superior and Broomfield moved to ban medical marijuana dispensaries and comments Garnett made questioning whether dispensaries are legal caused on uproar within the medical marijuana community .
In response to the controversy , a group of dispensary owners will meet Wednesday in Longmont to discuss forming a trade association to self - regulate the industry .
They hope to forestall harsher regulations at the state or local level .
Mark Rose , owner of Grateful Meds in Nederland , said in a phone interview that dispensary owners need to be mindful of their impact on the community and remember that not everyone is comfortable with marijuana use .
“ The people and the voters of Colorado have given us a great opportunity to do something really great for people , ” he said .
“ What really gets me is the people pushing the limits and putting a stick in the eye of the people who did n’t vote for this .
If you push it too far , the backlash is going to be way worse than what we have now . ”
In Longmont , a grower tried to lease warehouse space across from a middle school , but the landlord backed out in the face of public outcry , Garnett said .
Some people want to see commercial growing operations that supply dispensaries .
He heard of another dispensary owner who wanted to put in Fussball tables , a non-medical touch for a supposedly medical dispensary .
Garnett said there should be regulations around these issues , similar to the way liquor stores and bars are regulated .
But as the law stands , he said , it ’s not clear whether dispensaries are even allowed by the state constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana .
That amendment allows “ caregivers ” to possess marijuana to give to patients .
Garnett said he is convinced by arguments in favor of dispensaries and understands the logic of allowing commercial growing operations to supply them .
He also thinks there are strong arguments the state constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana does not allow for dispensaries .
He does not believe the law allows for commercial growing operations .
Garnett said without either self - regulation or state intervention , more towns may try to ban dispensaries , while others will use zoning to severely limit where they can operate .
Garnett said the Legislature should provide more clarity ; his job is to decide which cases to prosecute .
“ Trials should be about the facts , not the law , ” he said .
“ Cases should not be prosecuted when there is real doubt about what the law is . ”

Dust storms are again moving across parts of New South Wales from South Australia , as Sydney residents are warned they may face more storms later today .
Parts of western New South Wales are experiencing dust storms , which are expected to reach the coast early this morning .
Dust is moving through the Riverina in southern New South Wales .
BJ Wyse from
Young says he can taste the dust in his house .
" Standing outside my place now looking at the clock tower , it 's about half a kilometre away , " he said .
" You can just see it with the thickness of it , you can just see the town lights it 's just like a red glow .
" I just talked to a friend of mine in Cootamundra and it's going through there as well , so yep it 's back again . "
Massive clouds of dust are now blowing eastward through the state , where some regions are reporting visibility has dropped below 300 metres .
Barry Hanstrum from the Bureau of Meteorology says it is too early to predict exactly which areas will be affected , but he says it will not be as windy or as dusty as Wednesday .
" Wednesday morning 's dust storm was an extraordinary event , " he said .
" The winds we 're seeing today are n't as strong as we saw on Tuesday and the area covered by these winds is n't as large .
" So while there 's a reasonable likelihood of dust being in the Sydney area [ on Saturday ] , it 's unlikely to be as bad as what we saw on Wednesday . "
Dr Wayne Smith from New South Wales
Health says the department will issue health alerts if necessary .
" We 're encouraging people to really check the weather reports on the radio and on the television , " he said .
" Check the environment and climate change website for health warnings from particles .
If they are clear on those then it should be safe for children to have outdoor activity . "
On Wednesday , Sydney awoke to an eerie red dawn after strong north - westerly winds dumped thousands of tonnes of dust on the harbour city , the Hunter Valley , Wollongong and the state 's west .
Hours later the dust cleared from Sydney and arrived in Brisbane , hampering firefighting efforts in southern Queensland by temporarily grounding water bombing helicopters .
The poor visibility hampered transport across the affected regions , slowed traffic and caused long delays at airports .
Emergency services received hundreds of phone calls from people with breathing difficulties .
For many , the clean - up continues .
Radioactive dust ?
It is this type of weather event that award - winning documentary - maker David Bradbury claims could pose enormous health and environmental risks to a large proportion of the population , unless BHP Billiton contains radioactive dust from the planned expansion of its Olympic Dam mine .
" Given the dust storms of this week , which ABC TV news said originated from Woomera , which is right next door to Olympic dam Roxby , they could blow those tailings across the face of Australia , " he said .
" The prevailing winds traditionally go east and , as we saw dramatically this week , [ they ] dump on our dense population centres .
" It will have much more major impacts than the James Hardie asbestos fallout that we 've had over the last 40 or 50 years . "
But a leading environmental toxicologist believes Bradbury 's concerns are misplaced .
Associate Professor Barry Noller , from the University of Queensland 's Centre of Mineland Rehabilitation , says that dust from metal and uranium mine sites is too large to be carried by the wind over long distances .
" In a big dust storm like we saw during the week , the dust is not going to come from one isolated site - it 's going to be mixed in with dust from a whole huge area and diluted considerably , " he said .
A spokesman for BHP Billiton says while the company is not prepared to debate the issue of dust , BHP Billiton does manage dust at its other Australian mine sites through extensive monitoring programs .
Ubuntu is n't the only Linux operating system , but it's where the dream of a usable , completely free desktop is closest to reality .
If every Ubuntu developer were assembled at one place , here are five things we'd ask them to accomplish .
Advertisement
Image by Andrew Mason .
Ubuntu's not a single service or application developed by one team , so our wish list is a bit broader than just asking for five new features or improvements .
Ubuntu is an open - source distribution of Linux , developed and fixed by thousands of developers around the world .
It incorporates the efforts of many of the projects it relies on , like the GNOME desktop , open - source drivers , apps like Firefox and Pidgin , and many more .
Advertisement
But let 's pretend there happened to be a worldwide summit on how Linux could become a viable , convenient desktop for more people , and let 's pretend I had a panel approved at said summit at which I could present to all the interested parties .
I would n't argue about hardware compatibility , or pretend that high - end games are an ultimate issue .
I 'd confess that I 'm biased toward thinking about Apple computers more than Windows , because Apple has gained ground with a surprisingly similar product , and because some corporate , locked - down environments will never switch from Windows .
Then I 'd ask for these five things :
An App Store better than Apple's
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
One of Linux 's most touted advantages over Windows and Mac systems is that , on distributed systems like Ubuntu , you can install thousands of applications right from your system , without having to Google , download , double - click , and Next , Next , Next through installation screens .
That advantage is lost if you put all your applications in a big pile of searchable stuff labeled " Graphics " or " Sound & Video " — or , even worse , ask users to copy - paste repository sources and installation commands into text files and terminals .
Those are great backup and uber - geek solutions , but terribly off - putting to those just trying to get a system up and working .
New users are coming to Linux looking for their Windows or Mac equivalents —
Photoshop , iTunes , Winamp , AIM — and they 're wondering what other users like them recommend in very particular areas .
They 're in a position similar to that of a new iPhone owner when it comes to software .
Only certain applications will work on this very particular software setup , and they must be sought out .
Apple 's iPhone App Store is an utter mess when it comes to organization , search , and layout , but even its simple Top 10 Paid and Top 10 Free are more guidance than what Ubuntu users are being offered .
The default , installed Ubuntu applications are okay , maybe a little esoteric in spots , but Ubuntu 's builders and coders should n't be the taste makers .

Create a clean , tagged , search - friendly database of everything that runs on a standard Ubuntu desktop .
Offer wiki - style , group - edited write - ups , reviews , and ( maybe ) ratings of what the applications do and what non-Linux apps they are similar to , and put it all on the freely accessible web .
This kind of thing is already possible with Ubuntu 's apt - url handler — all that 's missing is the common URL .

Integrate dual - booting and virtualization
Advertisement
Show up fresh - faced at an Apple Store and ask how your copy of WordPerfect would run on a Mac , and a T - shirted Genius will gradually guide you into Parallels or VMWare Fusion , or possibly suggest using Boot Camp to occasionally run Windows when needed .
Ubuntu is n't really any different .
If Ubuntu wants to reach beyond the technical - minded , it should eliminate the need to learn about partition tables to fit a Windows installation next to Linux .
Create something less imposing and more visually appealing than the default GRUB menu .
Keep improving on the Ubuntu installer to better explain what one 's multi-system installation options are .
Do your best to make something like installing and running VirtualBox easy for a beginner , or break apart its open - source guts and integrate it so tightly into Ubuntu that an " Open in Windows 7 " right - click command is n't some laughable dream .

A wave of right - brain rethinking

The achievements of a network of left - brain - oriented , technical - minded developers in creating a Unix - based system that installs on just about anything with a processor can never be truly appreciated .
Apple created a Unix - based OS that installs on a smaller subset of computer hardware , but has a history and tradition of investing a whole lot of right - brain thought into making technically advanced features look clean and simple .
Projects like Mac4LIn are mimicry at its finest , and interfaces like GNOME - Do Docky theme bring both Quicksilver and Dock functionality to Linux .
What Linux and Ubuntu really need now , though , is something new .

Pre smartphone received generally rave reviews for its " deck of cards " interface , which was actually new and not hard to get used to .
While it does n't seem to be winning a sales war against the iPhone , Ubuntu has a distinct advantage — it 's free .
Something free and designed to look kinda - sorta like XP out of the box once did wo n't win hearts and minds .
Something with a useful but new look , with advantages in speed , openness , and hardware support , will get notice .
To paraphrase what Mac guy John Gruber said about the Android opportunity — set your goals such that you can claim victory with just a fraction of Windows and Apple 's installation base .
Awesome cloud - based backup

When the Linux - based Chrome OS drops , one thing we know it 's going to try for is starting up in " a few seconds . "
Ubuntu 's next release , meanwhile , is aiming for 10 seconds .
Unless they 're both pitched primarily for mayflies , that 's not an insurmountable difference , but Chrome OS will also offer no -worry backup of all of a user 's documents , emails , SMS messages , and whatever other webapps , because it all gets done through a web browser , or , more likely , a browser running inside a stand - alone application shell .

There are a significant number of folks who are n't cool with having everything they do in the cloud , and might want hard copies of everything .
More likely , it 's probably wise not to use Google as the linchpin of one 's entire productive life , because account lock - outs and password hacks do happen .
Backup , however , is one of those things that 's more powerful when there 's a copy far away from your system .
Ubuntu already has Ubuntu One , but right now it 's a less convenient Dropbox look - alike , because it 's accessible only through Ubuntu or the web .
It 's open source , so Windows and Mac synchronization tools may eventually show up , designed by committee .
But if a backup service is getting accolades from true geeks for being paradigm - shifting and mind - freeing , you 'd do well to learn its lessons , or potentially open talks in the interest of open - sourcing it .

Good video editing software

This one 's a bit more fiddly , but definitely worth mentioning .
Trying to edit a video so that continuous sound played over different clips , two Lifehacker editors found themselves amazed at how difficult , or at least hard to find out , iMovie '09 had made such a task on a Mac .
On Windows , there 's the free Windows Movie Maker , which has actually lost features since the XP version , and then professional packages starting at $ 450 dollars .
In Linux , there are a range of options , almost none of them with a finished feel , and all of them front - loaded with codec , dependency , and interface headaches galore .
OpenShot seems like a step in the right direction .
While Ubuntu is n't in the video software business , the many folks who contribute time , thought , and sometimes money to the project could consider this a serious missing link in the Linux application space .

This morning I was aimlessly clicking my way around the BBC news site – which has become one of my favourite things in the world since I discovered just how much its very existence annoys James Murdoch – reading about the burial of Michael Jackson and the like , when my eye was drawn to an alarming headline .
" Galaxy 's ' cannibalism ' revealed , " it read .
This led to a story in the science section which calmly explained that a group of astronomers has decided that the Andromeda galaxy is expanding by " eating " stars from neighbouring galaxies .
Having studied Andromeda 's outskirts in great detail , they discovered the fringes contained " remnants of dwarf galaxies " .
It took me a couple of reads to establish that Andromeda was n't literally chewing its way through the universe like a giant intergalactic Pac - Man , and that the " remnants of dwarf galaxies " were living stars , not the immense galactic stools I 'd envisaged .
That was what had really frightened me : the notion that our entire solar system might be nothing more than a chunk of undigested sweetcorn in some turgid celestial bowel movement ; that maybe black holes are actually almighty cosmological sphincters , squeezing solid waste into our dimension .
What if the entire universe as we know it is essentially one big festival toilet ?
That 'd be a pretty good social leveller , come to think of it .
So there , James Murdoch .
You might well walk around thinking , " Ooh , hooray for me , I 'm the chairman and CEO of News Corporation Europe and Asia , not to mention chairman of SKY Italia and STAR TV , the non- executive chairman of British Sky Broadcasting , and a non-executive director of GlaxoSmith - Kline " , but at the end of the day you 're just one of 900 trillion insignificant molecules in an all - encompassing turdiverse .
And your glasses are rubbish .
Anyway , the astronomers who made the discovery about Andromeda deserve our awe and respect , because their everyday job consists of dealing with concepts so intense and overwhelming that it's a wonder their skulls do n't implode through sheer vertigo .
Generally speaking , it 's best not to contemplate the full scope of the universe on a day - to - day basis because it makes a mockery of basic chores .
It 's Tuesday night and the rubbish van comes first thing Wednesday morning , so you really ought to put the bin bags out , but hey – if our sun were the size of a grain of sand , the stars in our galaxy would fill an Olympic - sized swimming pool , and if our entire galaxy were a grain of sand , the galaxies in our universe would fill several Olympic - sized swimming pools .
You and your bin bags .
Pfff !
The human brain is n't equipped to house thoughts of this humbling enormity .
Whenever I read a science article that nonchalantly describes the big bang , or some similarly dizzying reference to the staggering size and age and unknowable magnitude of everything , I feel like a sprite in an outdated platform game desperately straining to comprehend the machine code that put me there , even though that is n't my job : my job is to jump between two moving clouds and land feet - first on a mushroom without ever questioning why .
Perhaps astrophysics stories should come with a little warning .
Just as graphically violent news reports tend to be preceded by a quick disclaimer advising squeamish viewers that the following footage contains shots of protesters hurling their own severed kneecaps at riot police – or whatever – maybe brain - mangling science reports likely to leave you nursing an unpleasant existential bruise for several hours should be flagged as equally hazardous .
How can I flip channels and enjoy Midsomer Murders once I 've been reminded of the crushing futility of everything ?

It 's all just atoms in an unfathomable vortex .
Not that the few scientists I know seem to suffer .
In fact , they 're unrelentingly calm and upbeat , like they 've stumbled across a cosmic secret but are n't telling .
One of my friends is married to a quantum physicist who , sickeningly , manages to combine an immense brain with a relaxed , down - to - earth , amused attitude to everything .
He once tried to explain the characteristics of different theoretical dimensions to me .
Dimensions one to four I could just about cope with .
The fifth made vague sense at a push .
But the rest collapsed into terrifying babble .
There was no foothold .
I swear , at one point he casually claimed the seventh dimension measured about half a metre in diameter and was shaped like a doughnut .
That can't be right : either I 've misremembered it because my brain deleted the explanation as it was going in , chewing it up and spitting it out before it could do damage , or – and this is just a wild theory – I 'm too stupid to understand much in the realm of science beyond the difference between up and down , and the seventh dimension is beyond me .
It might 've been part of string theory ( I like string theory , because I can at least hazily picture the strings ) .
But this seventh dimension stuff was just gibberish .
God knows what the eighth dimension consists of .
Probably two chalk moths and a puddle .
Whatever it is , and wherever it lives , do n't tell me .

TEGUCIGALPA ( Reuters ) - Ousted President Manuel Zelaya sneaked back into Honduras on Monday almost three months after he was toppled in a coup , and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy to avoid arrest by the de facto government .

Zelaya ’s ouster on June 28 in a dispute over presidential term limits plunged Honduras into its worst political conflict in decades , and was condemned by U.S. President Barack Obama , the European Union and Latin American governments .
Zelaya had been in exile mostly in Nicaragua while a de facto government that backed the coup against him became more entrenched in office , defying international calls to allow the leftist president to return .
But his sudden appearance in Honduras on Monday increased pressure on the country ’s ruler Roberto Micheletti to cede power and increased the chance of violent protests or a standoff at the embassy .
“ I am the legitimate president chosen by the people and that is why I came here , ” Zelaya told Reuters by telephone from inside the Brazilian embassy .
Zelaya told reporters he had braved many obstacles , crossing over mountains and through valleys to avoid military checkpoints .
He did not reveal which country he arrived in Honduras from .
“ I was traveling for around 15 hours using different routes and different methods of transport to arrive here and call for dialogue , which is my role as the elected president of Honduras , ” Zelaya told Reuters by telephone from inside the Brazilian embassy .
Several thousand Zelaya supporters gathered outside while a military helicopter clattered overhead and a small group of police stood some 100 yards ( meters ) away .
The United States called for restraint in Honduras , one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere and a staunch U.S. ally during Cold War conflicts in Central America .
Micheletti , a conservative , wants Zelaya arrested on charges of corruption and trying to change the constitution , but the president was defiant .
“ I still have n’t known fear in my 57 years , ” he said .
Soldiers toppled Zelaya at gunpoint and sent him into exile in his pajamas after he upset Congress , the military and conservative opponents , who accused him of wanting to change the constitution to allow presidents to seek reelection .
Honduran business leaders also distrusted his alliance with Venezuela ’s socialist president , Hugo Chavez .
Zelaya was due to leave office in January after elections in November but denied he was seeking to extend his rule .
U.S. URGES RESTRAINT
Obama has cut U.S. aid to Honduras since the coup and pushed for Zelaya ’s return but refused his demands for tougher sanctions against the coup leaders .
His administration called on all sides to remain calm following Zelaya ’s return .
“ At this point , all I can say is reiterate our almost daily call on both sides to exercise restraint and refrain from ... any activities that could provoke violence , ” said State Department spokesman Ian Kelly .
Latin American leftist governments have accused the Obama administration of not doing enough to force Zelaya ’s return to power .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Micheletti , whose government is not recognized internationally , earlier on Monday vowed to have Zelaya detained .
“ The moment that we know he has entered the country we are going to go ahead with his arrest .
We have search and capture teams to carry out his arrest , ” Micheletti told Reuters before news broke that Zelaya had taken refuge in the embassy .
His government later imposed a night - time curfew across the country “ to conserve calm ” .
Honduras is a major coffee producer but exports so far have not been affected by the crisis .
Brazil , Latin America ’s economic powerhouse which is seeking more political and diplomatic weight , has been thrown into the center of the Honduras conflict with Zelaya ’s decision to take refuge in its Tegucigalpa embassy .
In New York , Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said he was hopeful Zelaya ’s return could start a new stage in negotiations to end the Honduran crisis and said his country was happy to play a role in any future settlement .
The head of the Organization of American States , Jose Miguel Insulza , said Honduras ’ de facto rulers “ should be responsible for the safety of President Zelaya and the Brazilian embassy . ”
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A U.S. court judge threw out an insider trading case against Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner Mark Cuban on Friday , but gave the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a month to file an amended lawsuit .
Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban ( C ) jokes with reporters as he leaves the Earle Cabell Federal Court building after attending a hearing held to address the insider trading suit filed against him by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Dallas , Texas May 26 , 2009 .

Cuban , one of the 400 richest Americans , faced civil charges that he acted on nonpublic information when he sold his stake in Internet search engine company Mamma.com to avoid more than $ 750,000 in losses .
The SEC failed to allege that Cuban undertook a duty to refrain from trading information on a public stock offering that Mamma.com had planned , U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater wrote in his ruling .
“ Cuban can not be held liable under the misappropriation theory of insider trading liability , even accepting all the well - pleaded facts as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the SEC , ” Fitzwater wrote .
He gave the SEC 30 days to file an amended complaint , “ if the SEC can allege that Cuban undertook a duty , expressly or implicitly , not to trade or other otherwise use material , nonpublic information . ”
Paul Coggins , a lawyer at Fish & Richardson who represented Cuban , said he would be surprised if the SEC refiled .
“ Frankly I think the government can’t prove the facts that they put in the first round , so I would be surprised if they re-plead here , ” said Coggins .
“ I think they threw everything they had and more into this . ”
Cuban , who is worth $ 2.6 billion according to Forbes magazine , did not respond to an email seeking comment .
He is an avid blogger at website blogmaverick.com , but it had no update on Friday morning .
He also has a Twitter account .
" Its been a great day so far , and its only going to get better !
Back to Dallas to see the ( family ) , " he posted on the account around noon ET ( 1600 GMT ) .
“ As far as media , im not going to be commenting at all , but thx for asking , ” he later wrote on Twitter .
The SEC declined to say if it would file an amended case .
“ We are reviewing the court ’s ruling and weighing our options , ” said Scott Friestad , associate director of the SEC ’s Division of Enforcement .
Cuban has a range of business interests and other activities .
His hot temper when arguing with referees during Mavericks games has earned him almost $ 1.7 million in fines .
His dancing skills landed him on the television show “ Dancing With the Stars . ”
Cuban also owns HDNet , a national high - definition television network , and Landmark Theatres .
Magnolia Pictures , the theatrical and home entertainment distribution company that he co-owns through the company 2929 Entertainment , released the documentary “ Enron : Smartest Guys in the Room . ”
He also is the majority partner in ShareSleuth.com , a site that reports on “ securities fraud and corporate chicanery , ” according to its website .
According to the SEC ’s original complaint from last November , Quebec - based Mamma.com invited Cuban in June 2004 to participate in a private placement offering after he agreed to keep the information confidential .
When Cuban found out the offering would dilute the holdings of existing shareholders and be sold at a discount to the market price , he became “ angry and upset , ” the SEC said .
At the end of a call with Mamma.com ’s CEO , Cuban said : “ Well , now I ’m screwed .
I ca n’t sell , ” according to the SEC ’s complaint .
Later , he told his broker , “ Sell what you can tonight and just get me out the next day , ” the SEC alleged .
During after - hours trading on June 28 , 2004 , Cuban sold 10,000 of his 600,000 shares and the following morning sold his remaining stake .
After markets closed , Mamma.com announced its offering .
When markets reopened the following day , the company ’s stock fell 9.3 percent at $ 11.89 .
According to the complaint , Cuban later publicly said he sold his stake because the company was conducting a private investment in public equity ( PIPE ) , which issued shares at a discount to the market and would have diluted his stake .
The complaint alleged Cuban never disclosed to Mamma.com he was going to sell shares before the company ’s announcement .
Mamma.com has since changed its name to Copernic Inc .
Its shares were down 3.8 percent at 25 cents on the Nasdaq on Friday .
The SEC filed its civil case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas .
The case number is 3:08 - CV-2050 -D.

Many epidemiologists have pointed out that , in reality , millions of people have had swine flu , usually in mild form , so the numbers of laboratory - confirmed cases were actually meaningless .
And performing the tests has overwhelmed many national laboratories .
But the cases  and , more to the point , the deaths  have been closely watched by the media and flu experts , even those who knew they were undercounts , as a crude measure of how the epidemic spread around the globe .
Such figures can also , in theory , be useful to public health officials .
For example , knowing that Chile has had far fewer deaths than Argentina even though their outbreaks began almost simultaneously could be useful to other countries who might want to imitate Chile ’s response .
The briefing note said countries would still be asked to report their first few confirmed cases .
It also said countries should watch for clusters of fatalities , which could indicate the virus had mutated to a more lethal form .
Other “ signals to be vigilant for , ” it said , were spikes in school absenteeism and surges in hospital visits .
Wealthy countries routinely collect such data , and also do blood tests to see what percentage of a population has flu antibodies , indicating they were infected but recovered .
However , poor countries do not .
Dr. Joseph S. Bresee , chief of epidemiology for the C.D.C. ’s flu division , said he agreed with the W.H.O. premise that case counts were just too inaccurate to keep using .

this is an old story and it's about as true as romantic yarns about relationships between sailors and mermaids .
but as the saying goes : the difference between a fable and sea story is simple : one begins " Once upon a time " the other leads with : " No Shit , " -- jmf !
The U. S. S. Constitution ( Old Ironsides ) , as a combat vessel , carried 48,600 gallons of fresh water for her crew of 475 officers and men .
This was sufficient to last six months of sustained operations at sea .
She carried no evaporators ( i.e. fresh water distillers ) .
However , let it be noted that according to her ship 's log , " On July 27 , 1798 , the U.S.S.
Constitution sailed from Boston with a full complement of 475 officers and men , 48,600 gallons of fresh water , 7,400 cannon shot , 11,600 pounds of black powder and 79,400 gallons of rum .
" Her mission : " To destroy and harass English shipping .
" Making Jamaica on 6 October , she took on 826 pounds of flour and 68,300 gallons of rum .
Then she headed for the Azores , arriving there 12 November .
She provisioned with 550 pounds of beef and 64,300 gallons of Portuguese wine .
On 18 November , she set sail for England .
In the ensuing days she defeated five British men- of - war and captured and scuttled 12 English merchant ships , salvaging only the rum aboard each .
By 26 January , her powder and shot were exhausted .
Nevertheless , although unarmed she made a night raid up the Firth of Clyde in Scotland .
Her landing party captured a whisky distillery and transferred 40,000 gallons of single malt Scotch aboard by dawn .
Then she headed home .
The U. S. S. Constitution arrived in Boston on 20 February 1799 , with no cannon shot , no food , no powder , no rum , no wine , no whisky , and 38,600 gallons of water .
In case you ’re wondering : that ’s 126,230 gallons of distilled spirits and 64,300 gallons of wine .
Makes you wonder if the Constitution ’s ship ’s company was in the mood for strong drink when she birthed in Boston .
This also serves to define the phrase “ drunk as a sailor ”

Realizing Sudoku is incredibly boring , Swedish hacker Hans Andersson created a robot from a Lego Mindstorms NXT kit to solve the number puzzles for him .
As you can see in the video at right , the robot uses an optical scanner and character recognition software to scan the entire puzzle before crunching the numbers in its superior robo - brain and filling in the remaining blank squares with a pen .
Given that this is really just a writing implement built around a calculator we do n't expect this lil ' guy to go nuts and start lopping off heads or ejecting its pen into people 's eyes .

An expert witness on the lawfulness of war in Afghanistan could be called to give evidence at the court martial of a soldier who refused to fight .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lance Corporal Joe Glenton , 27 , from the Royal Logistic Corps , faces one charge of desertion for refusing to return to Afghanistan .
He appeared for a preliminary hearing at a military court in Bulford Camp , Salisbury , Wiltshire .
Although he did not enter a formal plea , defence counsel Hugh O'Donoghue indicated he would deny the charge .
Mr O'Donoghue told the court that he may also call an expert witness to give evidence on the lawfulness of service and the current operations in Afghanistan .
Military prosecutor Captain Gemma Sayer said they were considering an additional charge connected to the alleged desertion .
She said L / Cpl Glenton would be interviewed by military police .
She also said she would be calling witnesses , mostly sergeants , who are currently serving in Afghanistan and Kuwait .
Medical evidence will also be heard at the court martial .
Judge Advocate Alastair McGrigor adjourned the case for another preliminary hearing to take place on September 4 at 10 am .
L/ Cpl Glenton , who was wearing military fatigues , did not make a comment as he was escorted to and from the court .
He will now return to normal duties with his regiment at his base in Abingdon , Oxfordshire .
Having joined the Army in 2004 , he went Awol in 2007 before handing himself in after two years and six days .
He has been on leave until today when he returned to his regiment .

L/ Cpl Glenton , who is a member of the Stop the War Coalition , said the Nimrod crash in 2006 was a key event which left him disillusioned with the war during his first tour of Afghanistan .
His letter to Mr Brown , which was handed in on Thursday , said : " It is my primary concern that the courage and tenacity of my fellow soldiers has become a tool of American foreign policy .
" I believe that , when British military personnel submit themselves to the service of the nation and put their bodies into harm 's way , the Government that sends them into battle is obliged to ensure that the cause is just and right . "
“ I finally concluded , ” Mr. Borgese said , “ that Amazon knew the device was being used and preferred to sell content to anyone who possessed the device , rather than assist in returning it to its rightful owner . ”
Drew Herdener , an Amazon spokesman , said only that the company acted in accordance with the law and cooperated with law enforcement officials .
“ Beyond that , we are n’t going to speculate on hypotheticals , ” he wrote in an e-mail message .
The complaints have left Amazon with a new public relations dilemma .
In July , when Amazon remotely deleted titles from Kindles , citing copyright reasons , it was accused of heavy - handedness .
If the company were to shut down a Kindle that had been erroneously reported as stolen , it might be accused of playing cop , judge and jury .
Then again , it is also possible that Amazon is simply avoiding the financial burden of adjudicating claims .
Whatever the reasoning , Amazon ’s policy is hardly unique .
Sirius XM
Radio also says it needs to see a subpoena from a police officer before it will deactivate or hand over information about missing radios .
Patrick Reilly , a company spokesman , said the goal was “ to protect the original subscriber who has lost the radio , but also not to incriminate someone who legitimately comes in possession of a radio . ”
Radios that have been reported stolen , he added , are reactivated only after someone provides a “ proof of purchase , ” like a receipt from eBay .
But former customers who have inquired about the fate of their stolen radios have been dismayed at how little company representatives are willing to help .
“ I still do n’t understand why they could n’t just notify the police department and tell them who has my radio , ” said Dolly Richards of Kennewick , Wash. , whose Sirius radio was plucked from a Chevy Blazer one recent Sunday morning .
“ I mean , there ’s a whole police report about this break - in .
They ca n’t call and say , ‘ So and so just registered that radio ’ ” ?
Today 's Music News PiL reforms John Lydon reunites Public Image Ltd for a five - date tour in December 07 September 2009 - Public Image Ltd , the band Sex Pistol John Lydon started after the break up of the seminal punk outfit , are reuniting for a UK tour in December .
Lydon revealed the decision stemmed from the passing of his father in 2008 and his brother 's battle with cancer .
" It was a very harsh time for me emotionally and I started paying attention to Death Disco , the record I wrote about my mother dying , " he said .
" There 's a whole wash of new material that I have n't used yet but I will be doing some kindly drop-ins to some Pil anthems . "
John Lydon
The tour marks the 30th anniversary of their second album , Metal Box .
Lydon is the only permanent fixture of PiL , which formed in 1978 and has been on hiatus since 1992 .
" I 've always been wrapped around some sort of emotional tragedy through PiL but also great joy , " said Lydon to BBC 6 Music News .
" It 's a chance to express every single human emotion possible .
" Although the [ Sex ] Pistols is a most fantastic band to be a member of , there 's more going on in me than that . "
As for why Lydon started the collective , from the ashes of Sex Pistols which he quit after a turbulent US tour in 1978 , he said laughingly : " I had more to say , so I said it . "
New material live
The tour kicks off in Birmingham on December 15 with further dates lined - up for Leeds ( 16 ) , Glasgow ( 18 ) , Manchester ( 19 ) and London ( 21 ) .
As for a set - list Lydon assured us he plans to mess with fans pre-conceptions and perform new songs .
" Anyone who 's ever been to a PiL gig knows that there wo n't be anything that you 're familiar with .
It just is n't like that .
" There 's a whole wash of new material that I have n't used yet but I will be doing some kindly drop-ins to some PiL anthems , " he revealed .
The line - up
Lydon says there are two people in particular he wants to tour with , former Slits drummer Bruce Smith and The Damned guitarist Lu Edmonds .
" They 're vastly different people from each other , " he explained .
" Do n't even like each other , but gosh do we work well together . "
Speaking about their talents , Lydon said : " Lu can play every whacky instrument that 's come out of the middle east .
I see him as somewhat of a musical genius .
" Bruce is everything from jazz to soul , to R 'N ' B to hard rock , the full rounder , not the hardest of hitters but absolutely rhythmically perfect . "
The reformed act does not feature the former Pil bassist Jah Wobble , real name John Wardle .
As for why , Lydon said : " Joh n 's a great mate of mine but we see different paths for each other . "
" I found it very difficult working again with the Pistols to write new material and I think it was because I was kind of viewing it as imitating the past somehow and I did not want that to be going on in PiL , " he admitted .
Lydon will also be joined by bassist Scott Firth , who has worked with John Martyn and Elvis Costello in the past .

16 September - A senior United Nations adviser has called on world governments to reduce population growth and work together to keep climate change from causing an immense human catastrophe , starkly warning : “ We 're on a trajectory that is absolutely unsustainable and profoundly dangerous . ”
Columbia University Professor Jeffrey Sachs , Special Adviser to Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon on the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) that seek to slash a host of social ills by 2015 , said the rich world should pay for much of the necessary mitigating steps .
“ We 're in the age of this planet where human activity dominates the earth 's processes .
Humanity has become so large in absolute number and in economic activity that we have overtaken earth processes in vital ways to the point of changing the climate , the hydrologic cycle , ” he told the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in Geneva yesterday .
Mr. Sachs was giving the 14th annual Prebisch lecture , named after Raul Prebisch , the first Secretary - General of UNCTAD , which was established in 1964 to promote the development - friendly integration of developing countries into the world economy .
Current international attempts to respond are off track , he said .
“ We do n't need global negotiations right now as much as we need global brainstorming , global problem solving , ” according to Mr. Sachs , who likened the approach to a high - stakes poker game in which negotiators hold their cards close to their chests .
“ The climate change problem is not a trade negotiation .
It is simply the most complex engineering , economic , and social problem humanity has ever faced . ”
He called for a massive , coordinated public - private effort with a great deal of input by experts to determine what can be done to allow substantial economic growth to raise living standards for hundreds of millions of poor while coping with environmental problems that already are unsustainable , highlighted by but not limited to climate change .
“ We do n't necessarily need diplomats around the table .
We need engineers around the table , scientists around the table .
We need to put the cards down and have a new kind of process , ” he said .
On the current state of climate negotiations he said the issue of whether a national goal is binding or not is one of the least interesting questions .
“ What 's binding if you can't achieve it ? ” he asked .
“ It 's silly .
We should be talking about what can we do , not what 's binding – what can we do now , in five years , 10 years .
Once we analyze those options we can talk about what to do …
“ And no doubt the rich world can and should pay for much of the response , ” he added , warning that the immense progress required , especially in terms of energy use , will not be achieved by free markets alone .
No private company “ will profitably develop these technologies on their own .
Large scale technical systems require clever policies and public - private partnerships , ” he said .
“ Over time , there are so many wonderful things we can do .
We can achieve economic growth at much lower impact if we think clearly , systematically , in systems terms , with a new kind of public - private approach based on shared global goals . ”

My web site has been going up and down over the night .
I 've intentionally been trying to elicit reddit traffic so I can test different parameters for apache server optimization , to handle high traffic over slow connections .
A netbook can be ideal for a home web server .
They are cheap , and use less power than a CFL light bulb .
The only trade - off is that it wo n't reboot on a power failure .
Fortunately , the built in UPS will sustain it through all but the longest power outages .
My Via Artigo died several weeks ago while I was using it .
I have no air conditioner , so it must have been about 30 degrees which may have contributed to its demise .
I took it apart and poked at it , but the monitor and disk light would n't light up .
So ended up getting a $ 179 refurbished Acer Aspire One , which is now happily serving up this web site .
Specs
1.6 GHz Atom processor ( with hyperthreading )
512 MB memory
8 GB SSD
Wifi , ethernet , VGA ports
3 USB ports and 2 SD card slots ( ?!)
Initial experiences
I turned it on briefly and it had a linux based OS on it that boots up in a less than 5 seconds and looks confusingly like Windows XP .
Enough about that .
Because I only install Ubuntu on USB keys , I was able to plug it in , boot up , and my web site was up and running in only minutes .
The fan is the quietest I have ever heard on any laptop .
It makes almost no sound at all .
Lousy performance as a desktop system
My old Artigo had a Via 1 GHz CPU and 1 GB of memory , and it could be used as a desktop system .
Not so with the Acer .
Even with the increased processor power , the decrease in RAM eats up all the benefit .
After installing Xubuntu , the system is too sluggish to handle common desktop tasks .
It badly needs a RAM upgrade , but this requires you to completely disassemble it ..
The tiny speakers are junk .
Imagine listening to a movie through ear - buds one metre away .
That 's how bad it is .
But it does n't matter , because it 's a server .
Handling Server Load
With Ubuntu 9.04 , after a day of serving up moderate web activity , the Linux Atheros Wifi driver was stuck in a bad state so it was offline .
I switched it to a plug - in cable and have n't had any more issues .
The system went non-responsive an hour after I posted my last comic strip .
It had a blank screen and needed rebooting .
However , I had n't optimized apach e2 yet .
Using the approriate settings , I believe that it can handle about between 30 and 40 visits / minute , or anything reddit and ycombinator can throw at it .
I 'm still tweaking with the apache parameters , and I 'll post something about them soon .
Things to watch out for when running a home web server
Upon closer inspection , Microsoft 's browser ballot proposal for the EU is much more drastic than one would expect .
Users will choose from up to 10 different browsers .
And it wo n't be limited to Windows 7 users ; the ballot screen will be pushed as an update to current Windows XP and Windows Vista users .
PC manufacturers will also have the option of shipping one or more third - party browsers in place of IE8 without fear of retaliation from Microsoft .
It 's a big change for a company that just last month wanted Windows 7 to be shipped in Europe without Internet Explorer 8 so as to avoid a ballot screen in the first place .
The balloting process will last for five years from the date the European Commission agrees to it , which pushes it into Windows 8 territory .
So let 's look at the nitty gritty of the browser ballot announced late last week .
The browser ballot screen
As you can see above ( the final design may change ) , the ballot screen will give users who have IE set as the default the opportunity to choose an additional browser to install .
Windows users will also be informed that they can turn IE off altogether .
The ballot screen will reside on a Microsoft - maintained website which will be updated monthly .
Each column will show the browser 's icon , description , and a URL .
For each browser , there will be an " Install " link that will download it from the vendor 's server .
A " Tell me more " link will also send the user offsite to a product page .
Downloading and installing a browser from the ballot screen will work the same as any other manual download .
Microsoft says it will distribute the ballot screen software via Windows Update to XP and Vista users within the EU .
Those with Windows Update switched off wo n't encounter the ballot screen .
Conversely , the update will be installed automatically for users who have opted into Automatic Updates .
It will be rated as " High Priority " for Windows XP users and as " Important " for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users .
After the update is downloaded , users who have IE set as the default browser will see the ballot screen the next time they log in .
They 'll have the option of downloading and switching immediately , sticking with IE , or postponing the decision indefinitely .
According to Microsoft , the update will be sent out three to six months after the adoption of the European Commission 's decision .
Windows 7 users will get the ballot screen update by October 22 , the day of Windows 7 's General Availability , or within two weeks of the EC 's decision , whichever comes later .
In the proposal , Microsoft said it may offer tools to volume license users that prevent the ballot screen update from being installed on all computers covered by the license .
Users will still be able to manually install browsers in the same way that other software is installed on Windows .
What browsers will be included ?
The ballot screen will include the most widely used Windows browsers with a usage share of at least 0.5 percent in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) , based on average monthly browser usage share data updated .
In order to appear on the ballot screen , Microsoft will require that vendors not install any additional software with the browsers .
Software that keeps the browser up - to - date is the only exception .
No more than one browser can be listed per vendor , no more than 10 individual browsers will be included , and only browsers actively offered by their vendor will be included .
The ballot screen wo n't contain any third - party browser using Internet Explorer 's rendering engine ( sorry Maxthon users ) or that is funded at least in some form by Microsoft .
Beyond the ballot screen
Users will also be able to remove IE8 in the final version of Windows 7 ( the beta did not allow this but the RC did ) , along with many other Windows components .
In its proposal , Microsoft points out that this feature is available within the EEA for OEMs to use .
Microsoft also promises that if Internet Explorer is turned off , then its user interface cannot be called upon by applications .
There will be no icons , links , or shortcuts left , nor will there be any other way to start an installation of Internet Explorer aside from downloading it .
For Windows Vista and successors , Microsoft says it will ensure that the Windows Update online service is not dependent on the Internet Explorer user interface .
Furthermore , the company notes it will not use Windows Update to offer any new version of a Microsoft browser to users within the EEA unless Internet Explorer is turned on .
The exception to this rule , Microsoft outlined , was that it can use Windows Update to update those portions of Internet Explorer " other than the browser frame window and menus . "
This appears to apply primarily to security updates , but also allows for updates to the rendering engine .
The software giant is quite clearly bending over backwards to please European regulators and avoid further billion - dollar antitrust fines .
Windows 7 E , which is still on the table if the proposal does n't go through , is likely to be a much more expensive endeavor than the ballot screen .
Microsoft 's browser - ballot proposal appears reasonable and thorough , so it's no wonder that the EU seems to be at least initially satisfied with it .
Like every complex network , Facebook offers unlimited possibilities of visual representation of the various connections between its users .
We 've chosen six beautiful visualizations that will awaken the ( visual ) geek within you .
You do n't have to stop at merely watching .
Some of the visualizations on the list come with tools that you can use to create beautiful Facebook visualizations of your own with very little effort .
Enjoy !
Know of a beautiful Facebook visualization ?
Let us know in the comments !
This project visualizes all the data Facebook receives , on a global scale .
See the Facebook infoverse as it flies around the planet !
Unfortunately , it 's not freely available for everyone to play with , but the video above is visually stunning enough to make your mouth water .
This wonderful illustration , created by Lee Byron from the Facebook data team , shows how Facebook has evolved from being a social network for universities to the global social networking powerhouse it is today , with over 200 million users .
Friend
Wheel is a simple Facebook application that creates a radial graph out of all your Facebook friends .
Nexus can do the same thing , but Friend Wheel 's results are a tad more colorful .
The application also exists for Twitter .
Check the FAQ to read about its limitations and instructions on how to update the Wheel to display new friends .
This Java based application lets you see the connections between your Facebook friends , with emphasis on photos ; i.e. , you can see which friends have taken photos together .
This makes this tool actually useful , in addition to being visually appealing .
There 's another cool feature : interactive tags .
Your friend 's names in the photos are clickable ; click on a friend 's name to see them in another photograph .
Still images really do n't do justice to this one .
It 's a Flash web application ( it requires access to your Facebook account , but it opens right there on the author 's site ) which creates a graph of mutual friends between you and one of your Facebook friends .
The graph is constantly being updated as new data flows in , and it has a cute wobbly effect while it does it - pure eye candy .
The colors on the graph are n't meaningless , either : red means female , blue is male , and green is unknown .
This Facebook add - on used to let you easily create 3D graphical representations of the connections in your Facebook network , with the ability to create various graphs , zoom and pan your graph , and choose between a light and a dark theme .
Unfortunately , the plugin is no longer maintained ; the official site lists several possible replacements , though .
We published the Ultimate Guide for Everything Twitter at just at the right time when everyone wanted to know about this Twitter thing , how to start using it , and how to sleeve it into their websites and blogs .
The guide is still being tweeted at the rate of a few tweets per day , which is remarkable considering that it was published a few months ago .
We ’d like to thank everyone for the excellent reception of that post and we will continue to report on Twitter as it evolves .
We ’ve also incorporated all of your suggestions in the comments on the guide into this update post .
As usual , we encourage you to submit more news about Twitter in the comments ’ area so that we can include them in this post or in future ones .
Since its introduction , Twitter has evolved from being “ the new fad ” to a fundamental part of the online life of the people who use it .
New items were actually a bit hard to pick out as every day there is another story or post on Twitter on most of the major tech and news websites , so we just stuck to the really relevant stuff .
There are still a few holdouts that claim that Twitter is a passing fad , but their voices are being submerged permanently by the surging political use of Twitter in the Iranian election dispute and the growing number of people who are getting on Twitter every day .
The only real obstacle to Twitter ’s growth is Twitter itself with its lack of a business model and constantly crashing servers , but most users could n’t care less and just enjoy tweeting .

News
#iranelection
By far the biggest piece of news since our Ultimate Guide was published is how Twitter has become the instrument for political dissent despite government crackdowns on the rest of the Internet .
Millions of sympathizers changed their avatars to green in support of the Iran anti-government protesters .
Twitter was humbled by the use of its service to overcome government censorship , and published this statement on its blog in which the founders declare that :
“ It ’s humbling to think that our two - year old company could be playing such a globally meaningful role that state officials find their way toward highlighting our significance .
However , it ’s important to note that the State Department does not have access to our decision making process .
Nevertheless , we can both agree that the open exchange of information is a positive force in the world . ”
It is possible for protesters to get around internet protocols through updating Twitter via cellphone and online , despite the fact that the government has warned of “ strict penalties ” for anyone who attempts to do so .
Scores of people in Iran are not heeding these warnings and continue to get footage out on Twitter despite the government ’s efforts to slow down internet and wireless networks throughout Iran .
Tools such as Psiphon have allowed Twitter users to remain anonymous to government eyes and ears while Twittering about the Iranian election .
@Replies and how they ’ve Been Changed into Mentions
Twitter ruffled some feathers when they changed their system so that people not involved in a conversation could not see replies .
The furor over this was huge and Twitter listened , softening the new rules slightly .
In order to see @replies , you should first check and make sure that your default settings are set to broadcast @replies .
They may not be if you opened a Twitter account in the last month .
When replying to a user , type it out rather than hitting the reply button either on the Twitter site or on your Twitter client ( Tweet Deck , etc . ) .
If you hit the reply button it will hide it from your followers .
For more details , see this helpful article from ReadWriteWeb .
In a more recent update at the beginning of July 2009 , @replies seem to have been changed to @mentions in the Twitter terminology .
The new buttons implemented around this time list the @ symbol as being representative of a “ Mention ” rather than a “ Reply ” .
This will probably confuse Twitter users for some time to come .
10 % of Users Generate 90 % of Content on Twitter
A study from Harvard has turned up that 10 % of users on Twitter generate 90 % of the content .
The study was headed by Mikolaj Jan Piskorski , an associate professor at the Harvard Business School .
Men are also more popular , with other men being twice as likely to follow men and women being 25 % more likely to follow a man than a woman .
Other social media networks , by contrast , have 30 % of the users generating most of the content .
This is probably a direct result of the “ celebrity ” culture on Twitter .
Most people who subscribe to Twitter are just interested in following other people , not in creating content .
This is to be expected as there are more commenters on blogs than there are people who write them .
Twitter is , at its heart , a blogging tool , and some just prefer not to share .
Others overshare , and they put the fun in Twitter .
One of the comments on our Ultimate Guide piece was how some Tweeters got famous by tweeting “ NSFW ” content , and that is legitimate .

The Spymaster Debacle
A few months ago , a private beta for a small game named “ Spymaster ” was released .
Many of the Twitterati , including Kevin Rose of Digg fame , tweeted about how cool it was .
Then , when the beta was opened up a bit more , people became annoyed with the “ spam ” in their Twitter streams and the backlash hit pretty hard , to the point that one of the co-founders of Digg unfollowed his business partner because of it .
The anti-spymaster camp is determined to keep their streams free of spammy Facebook - like games , and the pro-spymaster camp wants to see what kinds of games will become popular on Twitter .
List of Bugs and Fixes
This article by Ted Landau at MacWorld details some of the things that Twitter is working on , including profile images , number of requests to their server allowed per hour , and what “ from web ” means .
Hacker Sends Hundreds of Confidential Twitter Documents to TechCrunch
TechCrunch received hundreds of confidential documents from Twitter from a hacker and declined to post some of the more confidential items that would hurt people , such as passcodes to the Twitter offices and names of people who have interviewed for senior positions at Twitter .
Reaction to the move was mixed , with a lot of their readers coming down on the side of not publishing the information .
They began with publishing the Twitter reality TV show pitch and more will be coming in the future , including financial projections and other interesting documents .

The existence of a supernatural being in the form of a god who can dish out punishment in the afterlife may have been an important force in the past that helped to keep societies together as co-operative entities – but not so in the future .
Lord May of Oxford , the president of the British Science Festival , said that although religion may have once helped to stabilise human societies , the rise in fundamentalism could make it more difficult to bring about the sort of high - level co-operation needed to tackle the global problems of climate change and a growing human population .
The former chief scientific adviser to the government warned that the rise of fundamentalist religions in both the east and west will have a detrimental impact on the ability of the world to cope with the problems of the 21st Century .

Lord May , a mathematical biologist , said in his presidential address to the conference , that co-operation between people globally will be needed more than ever in the coming decades but added he feared that to make sure it worked there had to be some kind of mechanism that punished those who cheated others .
In the past , the ultimate punisher was God .
He said that punishment was much more effective if it came from " some all - seeing , all - knowing , all - powerful deity that controls the world " , rather than from an individual person .
" In such systems , there is unquestioning respect for authority .
Faith trumps evidence .
But if indeed this is broadly the explanation for how co-operative behaviour has evolved and been maintained in human societies , it could be very bad news .
Because although such authoritarian systems seem to be good at preserving social coherence and an orderly society , they are , by the same token , not good at adapting to change . "
The rise of fundamentalism , not just in the Muslim world but in the United States , and within the Catholic church , could actually make global co-operation more difficult at a time when an unprecedented level of teamwork was needed , Lord May said .
" If you take the view that in times of stress , authoritarian hierarchies tend to resist change , what the history of religion has been has been towards a softening , less dogmatic values , but under stress you simplify complex problems to simple mantras , " he said .
Linux is fantastic , do n't get us wrong , but Apple 's kit can also be appealing – especially its range of Apple laptops .
But if the thought of getting to know OS X puts you off , fear not : there 's a lot of common ground between Mac and Linux that is n't immediately obvious .
For starters , you may already know that under the hood Mac OS X is BSD Unix - based .
This means you can fire up a terminal window and get your fingers into the operating system via the command line in much the same way that you can with Linux .
There 's also an increasing amount of Linux software ported to Mac .
We 've taken a look into some of the similarities and differences between Macs and Linux to help if you 're thinking of becoming a multi-OS household .
Getting started with OS X
Fire up a Mac OS X machine , take a look at the desktop and , aside from the layer of gloss , the first differences you 're likely to notice coming from a Linux environment are the Dock and the menu bar .
Let 's deal with the latter first – you see , instead of the OS having a menu bar for system tasks and each application having its own individual bar within its window , in OS X there 's a single menu bar at the top of the screen that alternates between the two .
The right - hand side of the bar contains the date , information on your battery ( where applicable ) , a wireless button , and various other configurable options .
Meanwhile , the left - hand side holds the application menu of whichever program has your focus , or Finder if none has .
As you move between programs , this menu bar will change accordingly .
The Apple menu , accessed via the little Apple logo on the far left , has a basic list of system operations and information .
For more of these options , you need to open Finder , which enables you to navigate through files and your computer .
Great minds think alike
The Spotlight tool on the far - right – the magnifying glass icon – enables you to search both filenames and the contents of files for anything you want , which makes it roughly equivalent to Beagle on Linux .
Finally , there 's the Dock at the bottom ( by default ) , where you can shove a selection of frequently used apps , files and directories for easy access .
You can also set it to hide itself automatically so it's not in the way , which is particularly useful if you 're on a laptop with more limited screen space .
FINDER : The Mac desktop with a Finder window open , the Dock at the bottom and the all - purpose menu bar at the top of the screen
If you try this out and like it , or like the idea and want to give it a go on Linux , there are a few Dock - a - likes available .
Avant Window Navigator is probably the most popular , but there are other options available as well .
Applications
Applications in OS X are handled pretty differently to Linux
By default , they 're kept in the / Applications directory , but you can place them anywhere you like , because each application is an appname .app directory that masquerades as a single file in Finder .
If you want to look inside that directory , you 'll need to go to the Terminal , type cd/ Applications / appname.app and take it from there .
WEBKIT : Apple 's Safari browser uses WebKit , a HTML engine based on the KDE project 's own KHTML
The idea is that OS X applications should all be self - contained : all the application data is kept in that one file , rather than being scattered in various places about the system .
However , there is some app - related data that 's kept elsewhere : there 's / Library / for system - wide information and / Library for individual data .
In essence , if it 's something that a user might want to change – themes , plugins and so on – then you 'll find it in one of the Library locations .
You can also get at the contents of the app folder using the Show Package Contents option in the right - click ( or Ctrl+click if you 're using a single - button mouse ) context menu .
Starting up daemons is no more complicated than it is in Linux , but the process is slightly different .
Some can be started from the appropriate System Preferences tab , or alternatively there 's StartupItems and launchd .
Most Unixlike daemons can be run via one of these , but they work differently , so you 'll need to rewrite ( or find ) appropriate start scripts .
In theory , you should use StartupItems in OS X 10.3 or earlier and launchd for 10.4 onwards , but launchd can be fussy , so you might have to mix the two .
If you 're running Fink or MacPorts , your downloaded apps and packages live in either / sw or / opt / local , respectively .
The setup process for each should add the appropriate bin directories to your $ PATH , and this all works much the same as in Linux .
Check your $ PATH setup with the command echo $ PATH if you have trouble using any Fink or MacPorts apps .

Dell introduced the Latitude Z business laptop , which includes a new wireless charging technology that could eventually find its way into other Dell systems , the company said on Tuesday .
The Latitude Z can be placed on a special stand that generates an electromagnetic field to recharge laptop batteries wirelessly .
The technology , which Dell calls inductive charging , takes the same amount of time to recharge laptop batteries as an AC adapter , said Steve Belt [ CQ ] , vice president of business client engineering at Dell .
" There 's a coil in the bottom of the notebook and then there 's a matching coil in the stand .
You set them next to each other and it generates a current that flows and charges the battery , " Belt said .
This is the first time Dell has included wireless recharging in its laptops .
The recharging stand must be purchased separately , however , as an optional extra .
The technology could help reduce the dependency on power adapters traditionally used to recharge laptops .
Dell is also adding new hardware that will allow the laptop to boot quickly while giving it " always - on " capabilities similar to those in a smartphone .
The laptop includes an Arm processor -- a type of chip more often found in smartphones -- to boot a laptop quickly for fast access to commonly used Web applications like e-mail and a Web browser .
The processor is included alongside an Intel processor , which is used to run the Windows OS .
The laptop is a vehicle to demonstrate some of the latest mobility features
Dell could ultimately put in more of its business laptops , Belt said .
Inclusion of some of those features in further laptops will depend on how the market responds to the technologies , Belt said .
Wireless charging is already being used in some consumer electronics like mobile phones .
For example , Palm sells a kit to recharge its Palm Pre smartphone using inductive charging , also known as inductive coupling .
Similar technology is being used to recharge electronic toothbrushes and even power tools .
The quick - boot environment , called Latitude On , boots the laptop in a few seconds , after which users have access to applications include e-mail , contacts , calendar and the Web .
Based on a lightweight version of Linux , the environment reduces the need to fully boot into Windows to run certain applications .
Dell adopted the Arm chip for the quick - boot environment as it morphs the laptop into a smartphone - like device , Belt said .
" Because it does n't run Intel and it does n't run [ Windows ] , it get gobs of battery life .
It 's like taking a big battery and strapping it to my Blackberry . "
Belt said .
The quick - boot battery life could range from 12 hours up to two days if the laptop is often in sleep mode , Belt said .
The laptop can also connect to an optional wireless dock via ultrawideband technology , allowing users to move around the room with the laptop without being tethered by wires .
The dock , in turn , connects to peripherals using wires .
It has a DVI ( digital visual interface ) port to connect to a monitor , and USB ports to connect to peripherals like keyboards , printers and mice .
The Latitude Z has a 16 - inch screen , weighs 4.5 pounds ( 2 kilograms ) and measures one inch at its thinnest point .
It runs on Intel 's Core 2 Duo low - voltage dual - core chips at speeds of 1.4GHz to 1.6GHz .
The laptop supports up to 4GB of RAM and 512GB of storage through two solid - state drives .
Dell offers multiple wireless options including Wi - Fi 802.11 a /g/n and mobile broadband connectivity through 3G or WiMax networks .
The laptop starts at US $ 1,999 and is available in the U.S. , Canada and certain countries in Europe and Asia , Dell said .
U.S. officials are planning to add as many as 14,000 combat troops to the American force in Afghanistan by sending home support units and replacing them with “ trigger - pullers , ” Defense officials say .
The move would beef up the combat force in the country without increasing the overall number of U.S. troops , a contentious issue as public support for the war slips .
But many of the noncombat jobs are likely be filled by private contractors , who have proved to be a source of controversy in Iraq and a growing issue in Afghanistan .
The plan represents a key step in the Obama administration ’s drive to counter Taliban gains and demonstrate progress in the war nearly eight years after it began .
Forces that could be swapped out include units assigned to noncombat duty , such as guards or lookouts , or those on clerical and support squads .

“ It makes sense to get rid of the clerks and replace them with trigger - pullers , ” said one Pentagon official , speaking on condition of anonymity because the plans have not been announced .
Officials have spoken in recent days about aspects of the plan .
The changes will not offset the potential need for additional troops in the future , but could reduce the size of any request from Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , the top U.S. and allied commander , officials said .
McChrystal submitted a broad assessment of the Afghanistan war effort this week , calling the situation there “ serious . ”
Details of the assessment remain secret , but officials said it did not contain a request for more troops .
Such a request could be submitted in coming weeks .

The planned changes in the U.S. troop mix are part of what military officials call a “ force optimization ” review , a critical middle step between the assessment and a request for additional troops , designed to ensure that the existing force is operating as efficiently as possible .
The plan reflects the view that much of the military bureaucracy that has built up in Afghanistan no longer serves a useful purpose .
Services performed by troops that are no longer considered crucial could be outsourced to contractors or eliminated , officials said .
Defense officials said they would not know how many positions and jobs might be eliminated until the McChrystal review was completed .
But two officials estimated the total could be 6,000 to 14,000 troops .
The review will scour the U.S. roster for situations in which several people perform the same job or for service members considered less than fully utilized , for example , working just a six - hour shift .

Army Col. Wayne M. Shanks , a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan , said that some people may no longer be needed and can be “ streamlined . ”
“ We have asked all commands to take a hard look to reduce redundancy , eliminate any excess and generally look for efficiencies in all our structures , ” Shanks said .
He declined to outline any specific groups of soldiers or Marines that were no longer needed , but said the command would not “ compromise the welfare of the troops . ”
Raising the overall number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan is a controversial issue .

President Obama has ordered an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan to bring the U.S. force to about 68,000 .
About 38,000 non-U.S. troops with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are also deployed in the country .
Top Obama administration officials have sent mixed signals about whether they would approve more troops .
Complicating any decision to approve more troops is declining public support for the Afghanistan war as the number of casualties climbs , with August the deadliest month for U.S. troops there since the war began .
According to a CNN poll , 57 % of Americans oppose the war , up from 46 % at the end of last year .
But advisors to the military command believe that McChrystal needs a larger force to carry out his counterinsurgency strategy , perhaps as many as 20,000 additional troops .
Culling unneeded units would allow McChrystal to increase U.S. combat power without running afoul of political sensitivities at home .
Advertisement
One Defense official said the effort was n’t designed primarily to reduce the size of any potential troop increases , but to ensure that everyone being deployed was in a “ mission critical ” job .
“ If he is asking for more , he certainly wants to ensure we are maximizing the use of everyone that is here now , ” said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Most of the dozens of combat outposts and outlying bases in Afghanistan have soldiers or Marines assigned to gates or guard towers .
But the Pentagon official said those troops could be shifted to more valuable duty .
“ They just stare out from the tower .
So let ’s bring in contractors , ” the Pentagon official said .
“ Now you can have a thousand more troops in the field . ”
Advertisement
Any needed job left vacant could be filled by hiring Afghans or using military contractors , officials said .
But contractors serving in some capacities , notably as security guards in Iraq , have been accused of excessive violence and wrongdoing .
In Afghanistan , a government watchdog group said Tuesday that many of the 450 private guards employed by a subsidiary of U.S. - based Wackenhut Services Inc. have engaged in lewd and drunken behavior in a “ Lord of the Flies ” environment .
The workers guard the U.S. Embassy in Kabul , the capital , under a $ 189 - million contract .
State Department officials said they are investigating .
Advertisement
Critics have charged that the military has relied too heavily on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan , handing over too many crucial responsibilities to outsiders .
A recent Congressional Research Service found that there were more contractors than military personnel serving in Afghanistan .
The report was based on figures gathered in March , before additional troops ordered by Obama began arriving .

I was just forwarded a message that Peter Landin passed away yesterday .
From : Edmund Robinson
Date : 4 June 2009 09:10:11 GMT + 00:00
Subject : Peter Landin
I am very sorry to inform you that Peter Landin died yesterday of natural causes .
For those members who are several generations away from Peter 's early contributions , he was one of the major figures in the UK at the time that Computer Science was beginning to establish itself as a discipline .
Some of his papers from 40 years ago are essential reading for any serious student of programming languages as still the simplest and clearest exposition of ideas that remain fundamental .
The ideas in his papers were truly original and beautiful , but Peter never had a simplistic approach to scientific progress , and would scoff at the idea of individual personal contribution .
Some of his own greatest ontribution to the field was as part of a golden nexus of work on programming languages in the UK in the late 60's and early 70's , containing Dana Scott and Christopher Strachey and others as well as Peter .
The ideas they developed through their discussions truly lifted the study of programming languages to another level , and are now part of the bedrock of the subject .
" We have all been moved away from the building and we are waiting for the fire brigade to tell us when we can go back in . "

OSLO  Norwegian voters appear to have returned their Labor - dominated government to office , narrowly endorsing Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg ’s pursuit of expanded public services and rejecting angry demands by some of his opponents to crack down harshly on immigration .
According to official results with 99 percent of the votes counted early Tuesday , Mr. Stoltenberg ’s three - party left - wing coalition won 86 seats in the 169 - seat Parliament .
That would give it just enough margin to continue as the only left - of - center government in Scandinavia and one of the few remaining in western Europe .
Though Mr. Stoltenberg declined to claim victory early Tuesday , he sounded optimistic , saying voters showed a clear desire “ to renew , strengthen and improve the Norwegian social welfare . ”
A short time later , he told reporters , “ I ’m going home to bed . ”
All major news media organizations called the election in his favor .
“ The prime minister can take this as a personal victory and a victory for the Labor Party , ” said Harald Stanghelle , political editor of the newspaper Aftenposten .
Just as biological systems exhibit tipping points which once passed catalyze irreversible and often unpredictable patterns of change , so do civilizations and social structures .
In past civilizational collapses , these tipping points were generally catalyzed by soil depletion , resource shortages , environmental degradation , and social upheaval .
The Earth Policy Institute ’s Lester Brown identifies many global factors which may be pushing industrial civilization beyond a tipping point of irreversible change and collapse .
Overharvesting of marine fisheries , loss of biodiversity , increased population growth , poor food and water management , the peaking of oil production , social conflict , and climate change are among the pressures breaking down civil social structures .
Peat forest conversion in Kalimantan , Indonesian Borneo .
The rapid and recent increase in weakening and failing nation - states is another significant harbinger of widespread , global catastrophe .
Brown explains that the sum of the environmental and geopolitical forces has the potential to end civilization on a global scale , stating .
“ The risk is that these accumulating problems and their consequences will overwhelm more and more governments , leading to widespread state failure and eventually the failure of civilization .
The countries that top the list of failing states are not particularly surprising .
They include , for example , Iraq , Sudan , Somalia , Chad , Afghanistan , the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and Haiti .
And the list grows longer each year , raising a disturbing question :
How many failing states will it take before civilization itself fails ?
No one knows the answer , but it is a question we must ask . ”

Yesterday on Hardball , Chris Matthews had on John Velleco , who 's listed as the " Director of Federal Affairs " for the Gun Owners of America , a gun-rights group that makes the NRA look relatively sane in comparison .
( That 's probably the reason for their existence . )
And Velleco , of course , does not disappoint .
Matthews hammers him for about four minutes , trying to get him to answer a simple question :
If you were a Secret Service officer , would you let everyone carry a gun into a presidential event ?
It seems like an absurd question , but Velleco actually answers it affirmatively .
But then , that should n't be terribly surprising .
As hate - group expert Brian Levin , the second guest , tries to explain , the GOA has a long history of right - wing extremism , dating back to the days in the 1980s when it was part of Willis Carto 's white - nationalist operation .
The main figure in all this was GOA 's longtime and current leader , Larry Pratt .
Moreover , as the ADL explains , Pratt actually played a critical role in the formation of the militia movement in the 1990s :
In 1992 , Larry Pratt , leader of a radical gun- rights group [ the GOA ] and an advocate of the formation of militias , issued a statement in the wake of the Rodney King riots urging the Los Angeles Police Department to " take advantage of what the Founding Fathers called the unorganized militia " in order to forestall further unrest .
Many people initially joined the fledgling militia movement largely as a way to protect more aggressively their right to bear arms ; even today , gun-related issues dominate many of the newsletters published by militia groups .
The SPLC has more on Pratt :

I 'm gradually drawing the strands together .
Over the past few months I 've been lucky enough to meet a handful of travellers who have been on the road for a long time , and who have managed to cope with the return home ; from these conversations I have managed to formulate a few theories about long - term travel .
There seem to be a number of phases that travellers go through when embarking on a long journey ( I 'll take as my example a lone male traveller for grammatical simplicity , though the balance of sexes on the road seems fairly even ) .
The first phase , obviously , involves planning the trip at home , but this is n't travel so much as preparation , and life continues fairly normally until our man quits his job and buys his tickets .
The First Year
When our lone traveller actually embarks on his journey , the most common feelings are of disorientation and slow acclimatisation , which go on for a few weeks after leaving home .
Symptoms of this stage include a propensity to pinch himself and get sudden thrills at the fact that he is abroad .
Everything is refreshing , from money to food , and he will gradually get more comfortable with his surroundings , the most important aspect of which is the well - organised backpack .
This is when he realises that those collapsing glasses and pack liners , which looked so useful in the shop , are practically useless , and slowly the crud gets discarded .
After about a month or so , our traveller is settled in and the phone calls to the parents lose that slight edge of panic .
This is when the everyday aspects of travel – organisation , planning and finances – become easier and less of a chore , and more of a background noise .
Plans fall into place , cars or coach tickets get bought , and our traveller can delight in saying he has been on the road for ' a couple of months now ' : the time is long enough that he can start to be vague .
He begins to think of himself as a traveller rather than a tourist , even though he has a long way to go before becoming a real traveller ; he might have the machinery in place , but the fun is only just beginning .
Six months into the journey and life on the road is becoming normality .
There have been enough plans dashed and resurrected for our traveller to understand the Buddhist nature of travel , that of impermanence ruling the roost , and old habits , ingrained by years of western living , are beginning to crumble .
The addiction to television and social media has been eradicated from a lack of exposure ; the regularity of pub sessions and weekend trips has been replaced by an awareness of budgeting and a realisation that , on the road at least , every day is like Sunday ; even dress sense , such an important part of fitting smoothly into the well - oiled western machine , has been dulled , and clothes become dusty and worn but above all practical ; even the accent might start to change , if our traveller is in a country where he is surrounded by people speaking his language with a local lilt .
Changes are starting to happen , but take him from the travelling environment and put him back in his home environment , and he will adapt quickly to being back home , whatever he believes when he's in the desert .
The first year is a milestone : at last our man can say he has been on the road for a whole twelve months ( though when asked he 'll probably say something like : ' Well , I left back in October 1995 ' or something even more impressive ) .
Here comes the first big break : most people go home after a year , that being the time span of round - the - world air tickets , and in this case they will find home a surprise , but will fit in quickly enough .
They will almost certainly want more time on the road and will be sorry to have to go home , but normally a job awaits , or a lack of funds makes the return obligatory , so these travel dreams are banished until the next time ... if there is one .
The Second Year
The next few months prove interesting , because our man has moved into the category of the ' long - term traveller ' .
He now becomes more of a centre of attention at traveller meets , is asked to recount stories to those still green on the trail , and begins to forget about home .
Homesickness , which affects most people at some time during the first year , is but a past memory ( unless illness strikes , when homesickness is just a symptom of the ailment ) , and by this stage the traveller is obsessed with lengthening his trip , trying to extend his reach for as long as possible : by now it 's highly unlikely he will have a job to go back to , and going home is n't much of an attraction any more .
He is probably forming opinions about people back home being stuck in the western rat race , is beginning to read books on philosophy and religion , and might even start to grow his hair a little .
Travelling is becoming a way of life rather than a temporary break from society .
The two - year barrier is a big one .
There 's almost a sense of having achieved rather than the previous sense of being about to achieve , and it's at this juncture that our man will start to look at his new way of life and to make some real plans about the future .
The return might still be some way off , but having survived on the road for two years , the concept of living on the road for a hell of a long time – ten years , say – becomes an alluring possibility .
Travelling poses few logistical challenges and the main limitations are finances and a desire to see one 's family and friends again .
But the trip is far from over , and the thought of all those countries yet to visit keeps him going .
The Third Year
The first few months of the third year get tough .
Travelling seems to lose a little of its sparkle because it takes a considerable amount to surprise our man , he 's seen so much .
By now the everyday aspects of travel – money , accommodation , finding places to eat , planning and so on – are just that , everyday aspects , and there 's an ease with the environment and lifestyle that can only appear after a long time perfecting the method : the difference in attitude and maturity between the seasoned traveller and the eager backpacker is easy to spot .
And so he starts to wonder if it would be a good idea to return home for a while in order to get jaded and depressed once more by the rat race , after which he will be raring to hit the road again and continue his travels .
But the thought of returning home is tinged by a new fear : time is marching on , he 's getting older , and returning might be permanent , especially if a relationship appears ( assuming our man has n't lost his genetic desire to procreate ) .
A return date is often projected during this stage , an attempt to fix the time on the road so finances and planning are facilitated , and the desire to return is placated .
It 's a half measure .
And this is why , towards the end of the third year , home becomes a reality and a desire .
Because he knows when he is returning home , he plans round this , gets into the idea of going home , and barely spots the slight fear that creeps up on him as the months slip by .
He wants to return home , but does n't know quite what to expect : after one year , things have changed ; after two , more differences will be apparent ; but what about after three ?
Home will be another world .
Coming Home
Or will it ?
This is where the theorising breaks into a number of strands .
Conventional travellers ' wisdom says that home will be exactly the same as when you left it , but you will have changed , and this theory is certainly fine if you have been away for a year or so .
But the long - termers I have talked to say that after three years , plenty has changed , even though it might not look like it on the surface .
Marriages have been performed , children sired and houses bought ; jobs have been changed , though the nine - to - five mentality still pervades all ; and on top of this , after three years any traveller will be a totally different person , not just slightly altered .
Integration is a challenge , probably the first real challenge for some time .
Some people return only to opt out again : Howard , whom I met in India , had spent two years as a train driver after his first three - year trip , and I met him just as he was hitting the road for a second dose ; and my friend Nick spent three years studying so he could make a career of being abroad ( he now runs a charity in Africa ) .
Some never really return : Bob had been travelling for 13 years when I met him in Nepal , with only one year back at home in the USA in that time , but he 's now settled down in Germany with a son .
Some reintegrate painlessly , and I 'm lucky enough to be one of them ... though I have n't managed to shake off the strange longing I get when I look at a map of the world , and I still intend to travel again .
Another interesting point concerns friends back home .
Even with letters galore the average long - term traveller will have lost touch with most of his friends , if the experience of other travellers is anything to go by , it 's a distinct possibility that he will be so different as to no longer really like some of his friends .
Others have found that whereas they have their friends when they return , they cannot communicate to them the nature of their trip , with the result that our prodigal son seeks out new friends , mainly those who have also travelled .
Whatever the results of returning home , I know this : as with other long - termers I learned enough about myself and the world to be able to rise to any challenge , be it reintegration or emigration , and I learned enough about people to be able to handle anything and anybody .
And that is probably something we all strive for whether travelling or not : for me it took nearly three years on the road to discover myself , but that might not be everyone 's ideal solution .
BEYOND THE PLACEBO EFFECT
Counterclockwise : Mindful Health and the Power of Possibility
by Ellen J. Langer .
Random House , 2009 ( $ 25 )
When she was in her 20s , Harvard University psychologist Ellen J. Langer fainted occasionally , and doctors have epilepsy .
She decided to take the matter into her own hands , mentally “ catching ” herself sooner and sooner when she felt faint , until the fainting disappeared .
That empowering experience set the tone for her remarkable 30 - year career , much of which she has spent fi guring out how to help people take almost miraculous control over their lives .
Her 1989 book Mindfulness , summarizing a decade of ingenious experiments , became an instant classic .
Now , in her new book , Counterclockwise , with more of those experiments under her belt , she presents a more thoughtful and thorough look at the power of mindful thinking : “ the simple process of actively drawing distinctions . ”
Langer says by changing the way we observe and label our experience — specifically , by becoming more aware of the variability we often mindlessly ignore — we can improve our health and quite possibly prolong our lives .
In a recent study that makes the point , Langer and a Harvard colleague , psychologist Alia Crum , told cleaning personnel in Boston hotels that the considerable exercise they got every day in their job satisfi ed government guidelines for living an active lifestyle .
Their activity levels did not change , but their perspective did , and they soon lost more weight and body fat than control subjects did .
Langer attributes outcomes such as this one to the placebo effect : when people are persuaded to think mindfully about what they are doing , they adopt more positive and empowering beliefs about themselves , and they feel and perform better .
The book ’s title refers to a study conducted in 1979 in which two small groups of elderly men were housed for a week in quarters simulating the world of 1959 .
Members of one group were told to imagine themselves living in that time and that “ you will feel as well as you did in 1959 . ”
The other group was told merely to talk about that year and that “ you may feel as well as you did . ”
Signs of aging decreased in both groups , with greater gains for the experimental subjects — an effect , perhaps , of the difference in the instructions they received .
Subjects in both groups also gained weight ( a desirable outcome ) , with the experimental subjects gaining more .
This change makes the study results difficult to interpret , however , because weight gain alone makes elderly people appear more youthful .
That said , Counterclockwise succeeds in presenting powerful ideas about largely untapped human abilities , grounded in a body of fi endishly intriguing research .
INFANT INTELLIGENCE
The Philosophical Baby : What Children ’s Minds Tell Us about Truth , Love , and the Meaning of Life
by Alison Gopnik .
Farrar , Straus and Giroux , 2009 ( $ 25 )
Most parents want to believe their children are brilliant .
But how much do babies really understand about the world around them ?
In her provocative new book The Philosophical Baby , Alison Gopnik , a developmental psychologist at the University of California , Berkeley , asserts that babies and young children are in some ways “ actually smarter , more imaginative , more caring , and even more conscious than adults are . ”
These claims are bold , but Gopnik backs them up with dozens of empirical studies , many conducted in her own lab .
At the heart of her argument is that children have evolved to be the “ R&D department of the human species . ”
While adults are kept busy seeking food and avoiding danger , children are free to let their minds wander in the “ useful uselessness of immaturity . ”
They can ask questions their parents would not conceive of , occasionally stumbling on solutions no adult could have taught them .
In this way , Gopnik claims , babies behave like little scientists .
Toddlers build theories about the people and things around them not just by observation and imitation but also by running “ experiments ” on their surroundings — experiments their parents might not always appreciate , as they may be messy or disruptive .
Comparing young children with researchers is a suggestive analogy , although one that does n’t seem to capture the scope of childish curiosity .
So what is it like to be a baby ?
Gopnik ventures a guess .
If adult attention is like a spotlight that can be directed at will , baby consciousness is more like a lantern beaming in all directions .
She cites the work of psychologist John Hagen of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor , who found that younger children were better than older children at recalling playing cards they had been instructed to ignore .
Adults who want a taste of this kind of open - ended awareness , Gopnik suggests , should try travel or meditation .
It may not seem intuitive that a three - year - old playing with her imaginary friend is “ exercising some of the most sophisticated and philosophically profound capacities of human nature , ” as Gopnik proposes .
But even when Gopnik ventures to the limits of what can be inferred from behavioral research — taking on the human predilections for love , imagination and awe — she remains both credible and accessible .
In the end one does n’t need to know much about cognitive science to grasp the essence of her argument : if we could only get inside our children ’s heads , we would learn something deep about ourselves .

Adrian Sutil will be able to go one lap longer than Lewis Hamilton at the start of the Italian Grand Prix .
But Heikki Kovalainen could be the man to watch as he ’s fuelled to make his pit stop much later than the three drivers in front of him .
Here ’s the fuel weights in full .
Italian Grand Prix fuel weights and pit stop predictions
Grid Name Weight Fuel ( kg ) First stint ( laps ) 1 Lewis Hamilton 653.5 48.5 17 2 Adrian Sutil 655 50 18 3 Kimi Raikkonen 662 57 21 4 Heikki Kovalainen 683 78 29 5 Rubens Barrichello 688.5 83.5 32 6 Jenson Button 687 82 31 7 Vitantonio Liuzzi 679.5 74.5 28 8 Fernando Alonso 677.5 72.5 27 9 Sebastian Vettel 682 77 29 10 Mark Webber 683 78 29 11 Jarno Trulli 703 98 37 12 Romain Grosjean 699.8 94.8 36 13 Robert Kubica 697.5 92.5 35 14 Giancarlo Fisichella 690 85 32 15 Nick Heidfeld 697.5 92.5 35 16 Timo Glock 709.8 104.8 40 17 Kazuki Nakajima 706.2 101.2 39 18 Nico Rosberg 708.6 103.6 40 19 Sebastien Burmi 706 101 39 20 Jaime Alguersuari 706 101 39
The start
First - lap collisions and penalties are highly likely at Monza ’s tight first corner .
The new kerbs at the Rettifilio have been lowered , but drivers are still going to want to steer clear of them .
Anyone who arrives at the first corner too quickly and cuts it will have to give back any places they ’ve gained .
Second on the grid with a pair of KERS cars behind him , Sutil is a sitting duck .
There ’s little chance of him keeping Kimi Raikkonen and Kovalainen behind at the start .
This also means Hamilton ’s chances of losing the lead at the start are pretty slim , unless Raikkonen makes a particularly good getaway .
Fernando Alonso and Romain Grosjean also have KERS at their disposal at the start and lts of non-KERS cars in front of them to pick off .
Each could threaten the championship contenders – Alonso the Brawns , and Grosjean the Red Bulls .
As at Spa two weeks ago , this could easily get very messy .
Another word on those chicanes – during the GP2 race drivers who cut them three times were automatically given drive - through penalties .
We could see more of the same tomorrow , particularly if it rains …
Weather
After qualifying , the clouds arrived and transformed Monza back into the dark , drenched spectacle we remember from last year .
The GP2 feature race was delayed for 40 minutes and was started behind the safety car .
The rainfall radar shows a chance of further rain , potentially quite heavy , around 2 pm local time tomorrow .
We could yet get another wet Italian Grand Prix , made all the more difficult by the fact the F1 cars have n’t had any wet running at the track yet this year .
If the rain arrives we can throw most of our assumptions about the race out the window .
A rolling start behind the safety car would help Hamilton keep his lead and guarantee him a clear view of the track ahead .
But it might also play into the hands of those with more fuel on on board , who could stop later .
Even without the rain , we ’ve got a good chance of an excellent race tomorrow .
Who ’s your tip for the win ?
Italian Grand Prix
In 1996 I rode the circus train to Mexico City where I lived for a month , pretending to be someone ’s husband .
( Do n’t even ask . )
I remember my time there as we remember most of our travels — vivid and thrilling , everything new and strange .
My ex-fake - wife Carolyn and I often reminisce nostalgically about our honeymoon there : ordering un balde hielo from room service to cool our Coronas every afternoon , the black - velvet painting of the devil on the toilet that she made me buy , our shared hilarious terror of kidnapping and murder , the giant pork rind I wrangled through customs .
Which is funny , since , if I think back honestly , while I was actually there I did not feel “ happy . ”
In fact , as mi esposa did not hesitate to point out to me at the time , I griped incessantly about the noise and stink of the city — the car horns playing shrill , uptempo versions of the theme from “ The Godfather ” or “ La Cucaracha ” every second , the noxious mix of diesel fumes and urine , the air so filthy we ’d been there a week before I learned we had a view of the mountains .
The fresh heartbreak was , in a sense , like being in a foreign country ; everything seemed alien , brilliant and glinting .
It was as if I ’d been flayed , so that even the air hurt .
I was similarly miserable throughout the happiest summer I ever spent in New York City .
I was recovering from an affair that had ended badly , and during my convalescence I was subletting a cool , airy apartment a block from Tompkins Square Park , with a kitchen window that looked out on a community garden .
A theater troupe was rehearsing a production of “ The Tempest ” out there , and I got used to the warped rattling crash of sheet - metal thunder in the evenings .
I happened to catch “ The Passion of St. Joan of Arc ” on cable for the first time late one night , a film I knew nothing about — it was grotesque and beautiful , astonishing .
One of the happiest memories of my life is of sitting on top of the little knoll in the park with my friend Ellen , eating a sweet Hawaiian pizza and waiting to see what movie would play on the outdoor screen that was being inflated in front of us .
( It turned out to be “ Raiders of the Lost Ark . ” )
Even though this whole time I was preoccupied with thoughts of the woman I ’d lost and torturing myself with jealousy and insane fantasies of vengeance , in retrospect it ’s obvious now that the main thing I was doing that summer was falling in love .
I wonder , sometimes , whether it is a perversity peculiar to my own mind or just the common lot of humanity to experience happiness mainly in retrospect .
I have of course considered the theory that I am an idiot who fails to appreciate anything when he actually has it and only loves what he ’s lost .
Or perhaps this is all just what Michael Chabon called “ the ruinous work of nostalgia , which obliterates the past . ”
But I think I recall that summer with such clarity and affection for much the same reason that I remember my month in Mexico City so fondly .
The fresh heartbreak was , in a sense , like being in a foreign country ; everything seemed alien , brilliant and glinting .
It was as if I ’d been flayed , so that even the air hurt .
When you ’re that unhappy , any glimmer of beauty or consolation feels like running into an old friend abroad , or seeing mountaintops through smog .
Maybe we mistakenly think we want “ happiness , ” which we tend to picture in very vague , soft - focus terms , when what we really crave is the harder - edged intensity of experience .
We do each have a handful of those moments , the ones we only take out to treasure rarely , like jewels , when we looked up from our lives and realized : “ I ’m happy . ”
One of the last times this happened to me , inexplicably , I was driving on Maryland ’s unsublime Route 40 with the window down , looking at a peeling Burger King billboard while Van Halen played on the radio .
But this kind of intense and present happiness is heartbreakingly ephemeral ; as soon as you notice it you dispel it , like blocking yourself from remembering a word by trying too hard to retrieve it .
And our attempts to contrive this feeling through any kind of replicable method — with drinking or drugs or sexual seduction , buying new stuff , listening to the same old songs that reliably give us shivers — never quite recapture the spontaneous , profligate joy of the real thing .
In other words be advised that Burger King billboards and Van Halen are not a sure - fire combination , any more than are scotch and cigars .
There is something inherently misguided and self - defeating and hopeless about any deliberate campaign to achieve happiness .
I did n’t always enjoy being a cartoonist .
During the 12 years of my career , if I can call it that , I bored my friends and colleagues by complaining bitterly about the insulting pay , the lack of recognition , the short half - life of political cartoons as art .
And yet , if I ’m allowed any final accounting of my days , I may find , to my surprise , that I reckon those Fridays when I woke up without an idea in my head and only started drawing around noon , calling friends at work for emergency humor consultations , doing frantic Google image searches for “ Scott McClellan ” or “ chacmool , ” eating whatever crud was in the fridge , laughing out loud at my own jokes , and somehow ended up getting a finished cartoon in by deadline , feeling like an evil genius , to have been among my best .
But during the time I was actually focused on drawing — whipping out a perfect line , spontaneous but precise , or gauging the exact cant of an eyelid to evoke an expression , or immersed in the microscopic universe of cross- hatching — I was n’t conscious of feeling “ happy , ” or of feeling anything at all .
I was in the closest approximation to happiness that we can consistently achieve by any kind of deliberate effort : the condition of absorption .
My senses were so integrated that , on those occasions when I had to re-draw something entirely , I often found that I would spontaneously recall the same measure of music or line of dialog I ’d been listening to when I ’d drawn it the first time ; the memory had become inextricably encoded in the line .
It is this state that rock - climbers and pinball players and libertines are all seeking : an absorption in the immediate so intense and complete that the idiot chatter of your brain shuts up for once and you temporarily lose yourself , to your relief .
I suspect there is something inherently misguided and self - defeating and hopeless about any deliberate campaign to achieve happiness .
Perhaps the reason we so often experience happiness only in hindsight , and that chasing it is such a fool ’s errand , is that happiness is n’t a goal in itself but is only an aftereffect .
It ’s the consequence of having lived in the way that we ’re supposed to — by which I do n’t mean ethically correctly so much as just consciously , fully engaged in the business of living .
In this respect it resembles averted vision , a phenomena familiar to backyard astronomers whereby , in order to pick out a very faint star , you have to let your gaze drift casually to the space just next to it ; if you look directly at it , it vanishes .
And it ’s also true , come to think of it , that the only stars we ever see are not the “ real ” stars , those cataclysms taking place in the present , but always only the light of the untouchable past .

DURHAM —
An intoxicated University of New Hampshire student was rescued early Friday morning after she became stuck in waist deep mud near Oyster River High School , marking the second such incident in the town in as many weeks .
Assistant Fire Chief Jason Cleary said rescue officials were called at about 3:30 a.m. by a neighbor near the swampy area of Coe Drive who heard screams for help coming from a nearby wooded area .
Police officers , who arrived first on scene , almost immediately established voice contact with 19 - year - old Christina Nichols , of Beverly , Mass. , who was stuck in a swampy embankment about 100 yards from Coe Drive , Deputy Police Chief Rene Kelley said .
A few minutes later , fire officials climbed down the embankment into 8 - foot - high marsh grass and rescued the woman using water rescue suits and search and rescue ropes .
Nichols was conscious and alert when she was rescued and she was able to walk away , but Cleary said she was suffering from possible hypothermia .
She was cared for on scene by McGregor Memorial EMS personnel and was transported to Wentworth - Douglass Hospital .
Cleary said he was unsure exactly why Nichols walked into the embankment , but added that the area is very dark at night and she indicated that she became lost trying to find her way back to campus .
" It was definitely off the beaten path , " Cleary said .
" I do n't know how you would get that far into it unless you got turned around or you were n't sure where you were to begin with . "
Kelley said Nichols was released from Wentworth - Douglass early Friday morning and was then charged with internal possession of alcohol by a minor .
This is the second time town rescue officials have performed water rescues for underaged intoxicated university students since students returned to campus at the end of August .
On Aug. 29 , move - in weekend , police responded to a call from 19 - year - old Isaiah Martin , who was stuck in a marsh near Young Drive .
Kelley said Martin called emergency dispatch at about 3:45 a.m. while he was stuck in the marsh and said he did not know where he was located , prompting dispatchers to use the GPS on Martin 's cell phone to find his location .
" He was unable to give us a plausible explanation as to how he ended up there , " Kelley said .
" He indicated he had no memory of how he arrived there , he just recalls waking up in the marsh .
He was obviously panic stricken and contacted 911 . "
Kelley said Martin , who is also a UNH football player , was " heavily intoxicated " when police helped him out of the marsh .
" This is alarming , " Kelley said .
" Here are two young people , both underaged and both extremely intoxicated , who find themselves in very potentially life - threatening situations .
That 's exactly why we emphasize heavy enforcement of alcohol violations and expend the resources to try to combat it . "
Like Nichols , Martin was also charged with internal possession of alcohol .
Mayawati is accused of self - glorification by her critics
The chief minister of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has warned of violence if statues of her and her mentors are demolished .
Mayawati said opposition parties would be held " responsible " for attempts at destroying the statues .
Last week , India 's Supreme Court ordered her government to stop building the statues .
Ms Mayawati , a low - caste Dalit - formerly " untouchable " - is an icon for India 's 160 million low - caste Hindus .
She is accused of self - glorification by her critics .
But she accuses her opponents of conspiring against her .
Ms Mayawati said the Congress party was " anti Dalits " and that the party had spent a lot of money building memorials in the name of its Nehru - Gandhi leaders .
She accused the Congress and the main opposition Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh ( UP ) of indulging in " malicious and mischievous propaganda . "
Uttar Pradesh is one of India 's most deprived states , with a high crime rate and poor health services .
Ms Mayawati 's spending on statues and memorials has been described as " shameful " by India 's Home Minister P Chidambaram .
In May she unveiled 15 new memorials , including two of herself .
Statues of political leaders are generally put up posthumously , but Ms Mayawati says that belief is outdated .
The controversial chief minister received a setback on Friday when the Allahabad High Court quashed her efforts to ban a book written by a senior civil servant which she argues contains objectionable references about her and other low caste leaders .
Author Laxmi Kant Shukla says he has been victimised by the state government because of the publication of his work .
He says that it has not paid his salary for 18 months .
The court ruled that the UP government 's reasons for banning his book did not satisfactorily state why it was in violation of the law .
It said that banning a book " was not a routine act to be executed with unconcern or indifference " .
It ruled that the state government had not adequately specified which citizens , castes and communities would be offended by it .
The government argued in May that the book would " create ill - will and bitterness within society " .

London - based Maplecroft , the risk advisory business , has rated India with “ high risk ” in its newly developed food security index , ranking 25 out of 148 listed countries due to unsustainable water use and an expanding population .
Maplecroft found that the US has the most stable food supplies according to the Food Security Risk Index .
Angola is at extreme risk , along with Haiti , Mozambique , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zimbabwe .
The rating assumes significance as the availability of almost all foodgrains , pulses and sugar has become scarce despite adequate domestic production resulting into abnormal price increase across all sectors .
Over 65 per cent increase in “ kitchen expenses ” has threatened the magnitude of consumption of absolutely necessary commodities for normal health .
The Food Security Risk Index ( FSRI ) measures the availability , stability and access to basic food stocks , as well as the impacts on nutrition and health that result from food insecurity .
To provide an accurate picture of global food security , Maplecroft has rated each country based on performance across 19 key indicators .
These include : imports , exports and production of cereals , food production per capita , rate of undernourishment per capita , water resources , GDP per capita and global aid shipments .
The US performs particularly well due to its massive ratio of cereal exports compared to imports and , despite the economic downturn , its continuing buying power .
The next best placed countries are France ( 147 ) , Canada ( 146 ) and Germany ( 145 ) .
India may be one of the world ’s key emerging economies , but it is finding itself under increasing pressure from food security issues .
As much as two - thirds of the country ’s 1.1 billion inhabitants rely on farming as their main source of income , but 21 per cent less land is under cultivation in August 2009 , than during the same period in August 2008 .
This is due to a reduction in the availability of national water resources for agricultural purposes , deforestation and an uneven monsoon in July 2009 , which caused widespread flooding and droughts .
The resulting reduction in crop yields is likely to inject inflationary pressure into the economy , placing further strain on large sections of the populace .
China ( 107 ) is better placed to cope with the risk of food security than India .
Food self sufficiency and avoiding shocks in supply and price have long been national security and stability targets and it has been buying large tranches of arable land in Africa to secure future sources .
Food security became a critical issue for many countries after the rises in food commodity prices in 2007 and 2008 sparked rioting in more than 30 countries .
The World Bank estimates that about 100 million people are facing deeper poverty due to higher food prices .
Food security is a complex issue affected by a range of factors , including agricultural development and capacity , international trade flows , poverty and income distribution , foreign aid , as well as macroeconomic policies and government programmes on nutrition and food fortification .
Added to these are the impacts of global population growth and climate change .
Both the public and private sectors will increasingly be called upon to mitigate risk from food security , in order to maintain a stable societal context conducive to development .
Tornado and Grand Central Dispatch : a quick look

Two traditionally proprietary companies made open source releases recently : Facebook released a Python - based web server and application framework called Tornado , and Apple released a thread - pool management system called Grand Central Dispatch .
It is not the first open source code release for either company , but both projects are worth examining .
Tornado is designed to suit specific types of web applications and is reportedly very fast , while Grand Central Dispatch may cause some developers to re-think task - parallelism .
This Tornado serves you
Tornado is actually a product of FriendFeed , the social - networking - aggregator acquired by Facebook in August .
It consists of a web server and surrounding framework ( all written in Python ) , tailored to handle a very large number of established , open connections .
The web server component ( tornado.web ) is " non blocking " — meaning that it is event - driven , designed around the Linux kernel 's epoll facility , and can thus maintain large numbers of open TCP sockets without tying up excessive memory and without large numbers of threads .
Event - driven
Web servers like Tornado are single - threaded ; each thread can manage potentially thousands of open connections as long as the application does not block while it waits for data from the socket — the thread simply polls them each in turn .
Additional connections can be handled by running multiple server processes on SMP systems .
In contrast , traditional web servers are blocked from handling additional connections while they wait for I/O , or must spawn additional threads to handle additional connections at the cost of context - switching and increased memory use .
In addition to the web server itself , the Tornado release includes a suite of modules used to build web applications , including XHTML , JSON , and URL decoding , a MySQL database wrapper , a localization and translation module , a Python templating engine , an HTTP client , and an authentication engine .
The latter supports third - party schemes such as OAuth and OpenID , plus site - specific schemes used by Facebook , Yahoo , and Twitter .
The Tornado code is hosted on GitHub and is available under the Apache 2.0 license .
Tornado works with Python 2.5 and 2.6 , and requires PycURL and a working JSON library .
Documentation is available on tornadoweb.org , and a live demo " chat " application is running on http://chan.friendfeed.com:8888/.
FriendFeed 's Bret Taylor announced the release on his blog , comparing Tornado to web.py and Google webapp .
He claims that in Apache Benchmark tests , Tornado was able to handle four times the number of requests per second ( or more ) of competing frameworks , including web.py , Django , and CherryPy .
Taylor 's post , and the subsequent discussion , sparked some controversy among users and developers of the Twisted framework , who objected to disparaging comments about Twisted 's code maturity and suitability .
Twisted founder Glyph Lefkowitz posted a lengthy response responding to the claims made about Twisted , but , overall , approving of the Tornado release itself .
Matt Heitzenroder posted his own head - to - head performance tests that show Tornado beating Twisted . web , but not dramatically .
Aside from performance numbers , many in the open source community seemed impressed by what Tornado offers — a simple framework for building " long polling " web applications , including support for everything from templating to cookie management to localization in a single package .
Since Tornado has proven itself viable as the framework underlying FriendFeed , it is likely to pick up a significant following as an open source project .
Invisible threads
Apple 's Grand Central Dispatch ( GCD ) is an operating system - level feature that debuted in the recent release of OS X 10.6 ( " Snow Leopard " ) .
GCD is essentially a mechanism to allow application developers to parallelize their code , but let the OS worry about intelligently managing the threads .
GCD determines the maximum number of concurrent threads for the system and manages the queues for all running applications .
Thus the application developer only needs to write GCD - capable code , and trusts the OS to take optimal advantage of multiple cores and multiple processors .
Apple 's source code release consists of the Apache - licensed user space API library libdispatch and changes to the XNU kernel , Apple 's open source Mach - based kernel common to OS X and Darwin .
The XNU changes reportedly improve performance of the event notification interface Kqueue .
GCD also relies on a non-standard extension to C , C++ , and Objective - C known as " blocks , " however , so blocks support in the compiler is a prerequisite for application developers wishing to take advantage of GCD .
Blocks are supported for the LLVM compiler through the compiler - rt project .
Because GCD abstracts thread creation from the application developer , it is most similar to OpenMP or Intel 's Threading Building Blocks ( TBB ) .
All three allow the developer to designate portions of code as " tasks " to be parallelized in some fashion .
GCD is different in that it leverages a language feature ( blocks ) rather than the preprocessor directives of OpenMP or templates of TBB .
In addition , TBB is limited to C++ , though OpenMP is available for C , C++ , and Fortran .
Blocks are essentially inline - defined , anonymous functions .
They are designated by a caret ( ^ ) in place of a function name , take arguments like any function , and can optionally return a value .
Blocks are different in that they have read - only access to variables from their parent scope ( a feature similar to " closures " in languages such as Ruby ) .
Consequently , in replacing a for loop with GCD 's parallel equivalent , dispatch_apply , the developer can write a block containing the loop 's contents without the hassle of passing extra arguments to it just to access variables that were available to the loop .
From Apple 's Concurrency Programming Guide , the following example loop iterates count times :
for ( i = 0 ; i < count ; i++) { printf ( " %u
" , i ) ; }
dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT , 0 ) ; dispatch_apply ( count , queue , ^( size_t i ) { printf ( " %u
" , i ) ; } ) ;
which could be expressed as a block ready for GCD as follows :
When executed , GCD creates count tasks , one for each iteration of the block , placing them on a task queue .
GCD makes a default queue available through dispatch_get_global_queue ( ) , but developers can create private queues if they wish ; to serialize access to a shared data structure , for example .
In the traditional parallelizing - a - for - loop example , tasks are queued asynchronously , but GCD provides several mechanisms for monitoring completion of tasks , such as callbacks and semaphores .
Apple provides a basic introduction to GCD and programming with blocks on its developers ' site .
In addition , the OS X scientific research community at MacResearch.org has a detailed tutorial complete with GCD examples and the equivalent code written for OpenMP .
MacResearch.org has basic performance numbers posted for its tutorial code , and Apple has posted a benchmarking sample that compares GCD against serialized code and native POSIX threads .
So far , GCD is only implemented for Mac OS X , but reaction from the developer community has been positive .
Having the operating system worry about the details of thread pool management seems like a winning idea ; most of the discussion on Mac forums has revolved around the wisdom of relying on a language extension such as blocks .
Ars Technica commented on places where Linux could benefit from a native GCD implementation , such as in higher - level frameworks like QtConcurrent , but notes that use of the Apache license limits integration to projects using GPL version 3 and later .
Impact
Apple and Facebook have a history of making periodic releases of code projects under open source terms , even though both enjoy a reputation for maintaining " walled gardens " around their core products .
As is predictable when large proprietary companies release open source code , considerable energy has been expended on the web speculating as to what each company hoped to " gain " from the release .
A leading theory for GCD is that Apple hopes to further the adoption of blocks into standard C and C++ , but no consensus has yet emerged for why Tornado was released .
In fact , neither Tornado nor GCD has made major waves in the open source community , but if the initial reaction is a good indicator , both are solid and valuable products .
GCD is the likelier of the two to stir up passionate debate going forward , as fully assimilating it into mainstream Linux would require touching not one but two of the fundamental pillars of the community : the kernel and the compiler .
Although LLVM has its fans , the Linux community is still predominantly a GCC ecosystem .
Pushing Apple code into the Linux kernel and into GCC wo n't happen lightly .

Being at an age where I ’m just beginning to carve my path in the real world , I tend to have many peers and co-workers who constantly think about making an income besides sitting in front of the computer eight to ten hours a day in a windowless room .
by Andrea Mercado
I ’ve had thousands of conversations about initiating startup companies , selling IT products or services online , creating profit - generating web applications ( like a derivative facebook site ) , and putting up blogs .
Eventually , I began to see characteristics that I feel are needed in order for your own project to succeed , and I present them here .
Do n’t be afraid to commit .
If you ’re comfortable with your current salary and you need the promise of eating at least one meal a day ( sans ramen noodles ) , why change it ?
If you ca n’t commit whole - heartedly to your endeavor , things wo n’t happen , and you ’ll constantly put your project second on your to - do list ( i.e. right below playing “ teh gamez ” ) .
In addition , when you have other obligations that take up the majority of your day , you wo n’t be able to commit the time and resources needed to get things rolling .
Who wants to sit in front of their computer after work to design the UI interface of your application or draft a business proposal to pitch to a small - business venture investor when you ’ve already used most of your thinking and creative energy at something else ?
While talking to a friend of mine who ’s in the midst of developing a startup company , I heard the ultimate startup killer , “ I think I ’m gonna try and get a part - time job somewhere , just to help pay the bills ” .
To which I responded with , “ There is n’t a better motivation then ‘ hungry ’ ” .
Put yourself in the situation where there ’s no other alternative to success .
You can ask anyone who knows me , one of my most - used phrases is a rip - off from Nike , “ Just do it ” .
Take a leap of faith in your ability to succeed and overcome the obstacles of your projects .
I ’m not asking you to quit your day job ( that would be hypocritical of me ) , but you may have to consider ( a ) scaling down your project to something you can manage on a part - time basis , ( b ) adjusting your commitment to other duties and responsibilities , or ( c ) coming up with something else that you ’re equally passionate about , but can manage do to in your spare time .
Before doing anything , set your goals and develop your idea in a presentable way .
Right on the onset of your project , there should first be a clear definition of goals and what it is , exactly , you ’re peddling .
When you ’re asked about your idea , you should be able to respond in a concise , clear , and marketable way .
If it takes more than five minutes to describe your idea , it says that the concept is either ( a ) too complex — so you should consider simplifying , ( b ) you ’re clueless as to what needs to happen — so you should develop your ideas further , or ( c ) a combination of both .
Whether you ’re talking to an acquaintance about your idea ( i.e. a random person you met at the bars ) or pitching it to a potential investor , you should always be prepared to cover these questions :
How do you describe your project in two to three sentences ?
Who are you selling to and what ’s your plan - of - attack to reach and market to them ?
Why would people attain services or products from you , or how are you different from what ’s already out there ?
Who are you working with , and how does it compliment your skill set ?
In other words , do you have the right people to make it happen ?
Besides helping you conceptualize your idea in a more graspable way , these points give your audience the basics of what you ’re trying to accomplish , and allows them to comment / suggest things constructively .
Avoid going solo .
There are several reasons why a single founder is bound to fail .
For one , hard decisions are going to be tough to settle without another person ( or two ) calling the shots .
Things wo n’t happen and there will always be impasse ’s between you and yourself .
Also , there wo n’t be enough diversity in generating ideas and problem - solving processes .
If decisions were made in a group , person A’s idea of “ let ’s make a myspace derivative … only we give the user even more freedom to customize their page ” might be swayed by person B ’s more even - keeled reasoning .
Additionally , with a partner , you can motivate each other to keep things going , akin to having a workout buddy to force yourself to go to the gym .
But there ’s the other extreme , and it ’s the “ too many cooks / chiefs / shot - caller ” team .
This runs into the problem of things being argued constantly , a lot of profanity - slinging , and important decisions not being made in time .
A good - sized decision - making team ( drawn from observation and experience ) is two to threediverse ( but like - minded in the end result ) individuals .
Personally , I believe a three - person team is the way to go because there wo n’t be any ties when issues are being decided upon .
For example , I , being technical , simplistic , and lacking business / marketing sense , would choose a more open - minded , “ full - of - big - ideas ” , business - savvy peer to be in a startup with .
Then , I ’d pick someone that falls in the middle , someone I ’d dub “ the mediator ” , the person who ’s in between the two extreme personalities .
We will all have varying skill sets and personalities that compliments each other , and we each “ fill in the blanks ” , so to speak , of what the other partners lack .
Hire ( and pay ) well .
When your startup relies on other people ( programmers , graphics designers , business school MBA grads ) , you have to pick the right people , and once you do , you have to keep them on the payroll .
Being a cheapskate when it comes to human resources will cost you a lot in the long run .
How would you expect employees to commit to developing your idea when you wo n’t commit to keeping them on board ?
When your employees jump ship , you ’ll be stuck in the water .
Your success hinges on the people working with and for you .
Do n’t make money your sole goal .
You have to be passionate ( borderline obsessive ) about your idea .
You ca n’t be in it just to make a boatload of cash .
Look at profit as just one of the benefits of accomplishing your project .
If you ’re not passionate about your plan , come up with something else , because this shows your lack of interest ( and most probably your lack of expertise ) in your chosen area .
For example , I ’ve been trying ( for almost two months ) to launch a blog that my brother and I co-founded ( about consumer - related topics such as mobile phones , PDA ’s , cars , etc ) .
Although these are things I ’m knowledgeable and deeply involved in , I lack neither the extreme fervor to get it up and running , nor the expertise that , say , a professional consumer technology editor working for a magazine , has .
With Six Revisions , it took me two days to launch , design , set - up , and start publishing stories .
When you follow your passion instead of chasing after the dollar bills , things happen quickly and successfully .
Be confident and unyielding , but listen to what other people are trying to say .
You have to believe in your idea , you should have the mindset of proving your naysayers wrong … but always listen to what your peers have to say .
Believe it or not , other people are smart , reasonable , and experienced too .
Do n’t miss out on an angle that you failed to see , or make a mistake that your super - PHP - expert friend warned you from the start about SQL injections — listen keenly and avoid the temptation to shut them out just because they ’re not saying what you want to hear .
If you feel their criticisms or suggestions are wrong or wo n’t work in your case , simply say , “ Thanks for the input , but I think I got it ” .
This says that even though you ’re not going with their idea or suggestion — it still indicates that you appreciate their input and that you ’re always open to any ideas they may have in the future .
If you shut out these valuable resources , in the end , you ’ll have no one to else to blame but yourself .
All in all , I think these are things you should keep in mind and try to have when you ’re thinking of that next big project that will oust digg.com ’s spot in the social bookmarking arena .
My biggest suggestion is to believe in yourself and do n’t doubt your abilities … if you do n’t think it ’ll work , I can almost guarantee that you ’ve killed your idea right there .
I ’d like to hear your thoughts about the subject .
What are the other ingredients for succeeding in your projects ?

Jewish Opposition to Zionism
All across Canada and in the United States , there is an organized campaign to suppress criticism of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians .
The campaign is especially strong on university campuses where many voices have been raised in support of human rights for the Palestinians .
One such example is the attempt to suppress the Public Interest Research Group , founded by Ralph Nader , at the University of Ottawa for their support for Palestinian human rights .
Similar anti-Palestinian campaigns have occurred at many universities in Canada including the University of Toronto , the University of Western Ontario and York University .
An attack against a student group that was sympathetic to the Palestinians occurred at the University of Western Ontario in 1982 .
The student group was refused official recognition because of its support for the Palestinians and for sponsoring Palestinian and Arab speakers .
After this refusal a complaint was made to the Ontario Human Rights Commission .
After a long battle , and with the support of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and its General Counsel Alan Borovoy , and a supportive editorial in The Globe & Mail , the Ontario Human Rights Commission compelled the University Students Council at the University of Western Ontario to issue a statement of regret and to ratify the student group .
The refusal was deemed discriminatory against Palestinians and persons associated with Palestinians .
Despite this successful legal precedent at Western Ontario there have been many attacks against individuals and groups across Canada and the United States because of their support for human rights for Palestinians .
Over the last few years there is a concerted attempt to suppress discussion of the Palestinian issue in North America .
There also is a campaign to punish those individuals who have spoken out in support of the Palestinians by cutting funding and by denying them tenure and even getting them terminated from their positions of employment .
Two well - known examples of firings are the campaigns that targeted Jewish professors ’
Norman Finkelstein ( author of many books on Israel and Zionism including Image and Reality of the Israel - Palestinian Conflict ( Verso Press , New York , 1995 ) and Joel Kovel ( author of Overcoming Zionism : Creating a Single Democratic State in Israel / Palestine ( Pluto Press : London , 2007 ) ) for their attacks on Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians .
Another tactic is to smear such individuals who have supported the Palestinians with allegations of anti-Semitism .
One such individual was Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu .
A few complaints from the Jewish community led to the Noble Prize winner being banned from speaking on campus by the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota .
Tutu was attacked because of statements he made criticizing Israeli policy toward the Palestinians that some Jewish individuals said were “ anti Semitic . ”
Marv Davidov , an adjunct professor with the Justice and Peace Studies program at the University of St. Thomas said :
As a Jew who experienced real anti-Semitism as a child , I ’m deeply disturbed that a man like Tutu could be labeled anti-Semitic and silenced like this , … I deeply resent the Israeli lobby trying to silence any criticism of its policy .
It does a great disservice to Israel and to all Jews .
After provoking a strong backlash against the decision , and a campaign lead by Jewish Voice for Peace in support of the Arch Bishop which produced more than 6,000 letters of protest , the University rescinded the ban .
Professor Bill Robinson was also a target of a similar campaign about alleged anti Semitism to get him fired at the University of California Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) .
Ultimately the University administration defended Robinson ’s academic freedom and the right to express his opinions in his global politics class .
Robinson , who is Jewish , distributed an email prepared by a pro-Palestinian Jewish activist that compared the Israeli attack on Gaza to the Nazi attack on the Warsaw Ghetto .
In response to this attack on Professor Robinson , more than 100 UCSB faculty members signed a petition asking the university to dismiss the charges against him .
In addition , 16 university department chairs wrote letters to the University authorities asking them to dismiss the case against Robinson .
Sir Gerald Kaufman , one of the founders of Independent Jewish Voices in Britain , also used his position as a Member of Parliament in London , England to criticize Israeli policy toward the Palestinians .
Members of Kaufman ’s family perished at the hands of the Nazis and in the Holocaust .
As one of the U.K. ’s harshest critics of Israeli policies , Kaufman routinely compared the Jewish state ’s treatment of Palestinians to Nazi Germany ’s treatment of Jews .
This campaign to silence critics of Israel and to demonize supporters of the Palestinians is most disturbing and a violation of free speech , academic freedom and violation of Palestinian human rights .
It is also a violation of basic democratic rights when a government does it .
For example , the recent cuts to the Canadian Arab Federation ’s funding by Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney .
The punitive action taken by Minister Kenney is a denial of the fundamental freedoms and rights which are guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
The Charter guarantees the right of free speech and freedom of conscience and protects the individual and organizations from government sanction .
This campaign is also an attack on the numerous dissenting Jews who support human rights for the Palestinians .
Canadian Jewish groups like Not in Our Name ( NION ) and Jewish Independent Voices ( Canada ) and their support for the Palestinians and their criticism of the “ Jewish State ” are simply ignored .
For political purposes , they simply do not exist .
The mainstream media also rarely covers these alternative Jewish perspectives .
However , there are rare exceptions and sometimes views critical of Zionism are published in the mainstream North American press .
Here is one notable example :
“ It ’s hard to imagine now , but in 1944 , six years after Kristallnacht , Lessing J. Rosenwald , president of the American Council for Judaism , felt comfortable equating the Zionist ideal of Jewish statehood with “ the concept of a racial state — the Hitlerian concept . ”
For most of the last century , a principled opposition to Zionism was a mainstream stance within American Judaism .
Even after the foundation of Israel , anti-Zionism was not a particularly heretical position .
Assimilated Reform Jews like Rosenwald believed that Judaism should remain a matter of religious rather than political allegiance ; the ultra-Orthodox saw Jewish statehood as an impious attempt to “ push the hand of God ” ; and Marxist Jews — my grandparents among them — tended to see Zionism , and all nationalisms , as a distraction from the more essential struggle between classes .
To be Jewish , I was raised to believe , meant understanding oneself as a member of a tribe that over and over had been cast out , mistreated , slaughtered .
Millenniums of oppression that preceded it did not entitle us to a homeland or a right to self - defense that superseded anyone else ’s .
If they offered us anything exceptional , it was a perspective on oppression and an obligation born of the prophetic tradition : to act on behalf of the oppressed and to cry out at the oppressor .
For the last several decades , though , it has been all but impossible to cry out against the Israeli state without being smeared as an anti-Semite , or worse .
To question not just Israel ’s actions , but the Zionist tenets on which the state is founded , has for too long been regarded an almost unspeakable blasphemy .
Yet it is no longer possible to believe with an honest conscience that the deplorable conditions in which Palestinians live and die in Gaza and the West Bank come as the result of specific policies , leaders or parties on either side of the impasse .
The problem is fundamental : Founding a modern state on a single ethnic or religious identity in a territory that is ethnically and religiously diverse leads inexorably either to politics of exclusion ( think of the 139 - square - mile prison camp that Gaza has become ) or to wholesale ethnic cleansing .
Put simply , the problem is Zionism . ” )
Most of the rest of the World has a much more critical view of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and supports the right of Palestinians to self determination .
For example in one vote at the United Nations , held on December 19 , 2006 on the Israeli Palestinian issue , the tally was 176 to five in favor of the Palestinians .
The countries that supported Israel were the United States , the Marshall Islands , Palau and Micronesia .
Five countries abstained .
They were : Australia , Canada , Central African Republic , Nauru and Vanuatu .
The entire rest of the World voted in favor of the right of Palestinians to self - determination .
However , to read the mainstream North American press you almost never hear of these one - sided votes .
All human beings are entitled to basic human rights .
However , the well documented human rights violations of the Palestinians at the hands of the Israelis , by respected organizations such as Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , The International Red Cross , the United Nations , and even by Israeli organizations such as B’Tselem , Rabbis for Human Rights and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel and by many Israeli journalists , are attacked and buried under a barrage of criticism that they are biased , are unfair for singling out the Jewish State or are even anti-Semitic .
My own record as a lawyer representing refugee claims for Palestinians from the Occupied Territories made against Israel , is 28 positives to one negative or a 96.5 % success rate .
However , in the eyes of the supporters of Israel this does not mean that there are serious human rights problems in the Occupied Territories .
Israel can do no wrong .
It is the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada that is “ anti-Semitic ” and the Jewish members of the IRB who rendered positive decisions on Palestinian refugee claims made against Israel are “ self - hating Jews . ”
A Palestinian is simply an inhabitant or citizen of Palestine .
There are Jewish , Christian , Muslim and non-believers who are Palestinian .
The indigenous Palestinian Jews were opposed to the European Jewish settlers who were flooding into Palestine with the support of Great Britain .
A Palestinian is simply a national designation like that of being Canadian or American .
There is no racial , ethnic or religious criteria for being a Palestinian .
Only by right of birth , naturalization and descent that one becomes a Palestinian , just like in most other countries .
The Jewish State ’s citizenship and Immigration process are unique in the World .
To qualify as a “ Jew ” in “ the Jewish state ” one must meet a racial or ethnic criteria or in the alternative , a religious criterion .
The Jewish Law of Return grants almost immediate citizenship rights to Jews from anywhere in the World .
Palestinians who were born in the country and forcibly expelled are , for the most part , forbidden to return .
The Zionist state of Israel defines itself as “ Jewish ” and structures itself to advance the interests of Jews at the expense of non-Jews and especially against the indigenous Christian and Muslim Palestinian population .
In March 1919 United States Congressman Julius Kahn presented an anti-Zionist petition to President Woodrow Wilson as he was departing for the Paris Peace Conference .
The petition was signed by 31 prominent American Jews .
The signatories included Henry Morgenthau , Sr. , ex-ambassador to Turkey ; Simon W. Rosendale , ex-attorney general of New York ; Mayor L. H. Kampner of Galveston , Texas ; E. M. Baker , from Cleveland and president of the Stock Exchange ; R. H. Macy ’s Jesse I. Straus ; New York Times publisher Adolph S. Ochs ; and Judge M. C. Sloss of San Francisco .
Part of the petition read :
… we protest against the political segregation of the Jews and the re-establishment in Palestine of a distinctively Jewish State as utterly opposed to the principles of democracy which it is the avowed purpose of the World ’s Peace Conference to establish .
Whether the Jews be regarded as a “ race ” or as a “ religion , ” it is contrary to the democratic principles for which the world war was waged to found a nation on either or both of these bases .
There is much controversy over what is Zionism and how to define the “ Jewish State . ”
As Akiva Orr writes ,
The Zionist movement and its State - ISRAEL , do not represent the Jewish people .
They never did .
They represent a particular trend within the Jewish people , namely - the nationalist trend .
To find out whether Israel is a Jewish State or a Zionist State one need only ask any religious Orthodox Jew anywhere .
His answer will be unambiguous : a Jewish State must be ruled by Jewish religious law- “ Halakha ” .
Israel is not ruled by “ Halakha ” laws , but by secular laws .
Therefore Israel is not a Jewish State .
The fact that it provides refuge to Jews does not make it a Jewish State . . . Zionism and Judaism are different entities .
They have contradictory qualities .
The argument is often made that criticism of Israel , or more appropriately the self described “ Jewish State , ” the meaning of which is not defined , is anti-Semitic .
The fact that many Jews have criticized Israel and Zionism is deemed irrelevant .
These Jewish critics are attacked as “ self - hating Jews . ”
There is no rational basis for the argument that criticism of the State of Israel and the political ideology of Zionism is anti-Semitic .
The logic for this view is obviously flawed .
For example it makes no sense to accuse an individual who criticizes Apartheid South Africa ’s racist policies toward the blacks as evidence of racism toward Whites .
Or that criticism of the Nazi policy toward the Jews should not be allowed because it is evidence of racism against Germans .
Similarly , if you criticize American policy toward the Iraq war and torture at Abu Ghraib Prison or the Jim Crow laws that institutionalized discrimination against blacks in the southern states , then you are racist against Americans .
This argument is obviously absurd and should not even need a response .
To quote one American Jewish academic on the comparison of Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians to the racist Jim Crow laws in the United States : “ I grew up as a white girl in the Jim Crow South and I have spent my adult life in the study of racism ; what I see when I go to Palestine is Jim Crow on steroids . ”
It is a basic right to evaluate and to criticize a political ideology or political movement and to review and even criticize a state ’s policies .
The argument should be evaluated on the merits and the truthfulness of the facts presented .
It is also a right to present alternative facts and to have a debate .
However , when one side wants to avoid debate , divert the discussion or suppress the topic and launches personal attacks against their opponents , it is almost a certain proof that they are hiding some uncomfortable truths .
Dr. Joel Beinin in an article , “ Silencing critics not way to Middle East peace , ” published in the San Francisco Chronicle , on February 4 , 2007 , discussed the campaign to silence critics of Israeli policy .
Beinin is a professor of History at Stanford University and is Jewish .
He is active with Jewish Voice for Peace .
Here is what Beinin had to say about the campaign to attack critics of Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians .
“ Why discredit , defame and silence those with opposing viewpoints ?
I believe it is because the Zionist lobby knows it cannot win based on facts .
An honest discussion can only lead to one conclusion :
The status quo in which Israel declares it alone has rights and intends to impose its will on the weaker Palestinians , stripping them permanently of their land , resources and rights , cannot lead to a lasting peace .
We need an open debate and the freedom to discuss uncomfortable facts and explore the full range of policy options .
Only then can we adopt a foreign policy that serves American interests and one that could actually bring a just peace to Palestinians and Israelis . ”
The ethnic cleansing of Palestinians , as well as the massacres , rapes and illegal confiscation of Palestinian property , is well documented by Israeli historians .
These include Simcha Flapan , The Birth of Israel : Myths and Realities ( New York : Pantheon Books , 1987 ) ; Benny Morris ,
The birth of the Palestinian refugee problem 1947 - 1949 , ( Cambridge University Press : New York , 1987 ) ; Nur Masalha , Expulsion of the Palestinians ( Washington D.C. : Institute for Palestine Studies , 1992 ) ; Benjamin Beit - Hallahmi , Original Sins , ( Olive Branch Press : New York , 1993 ) ; and Ilan Pappe , The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine , ( Oneworld Publications : Oxford , 2006 ) .
There are many more Israeli authorities that confirm the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in 1947 - 1949 and again in 1967 .
In fact it is still going on today in what some Israelis call the “ slow motion ethnic cleansing ” of the Palestinians .
If the Palestinians , or their supporters , complain about the well - documented facts surrounding the ethnic cleansing of Palestine , losing their property to which they had legal title to , losing their personal belongings and even their bank accounts , having 531 villages destroyed , losing their country and their right to a citizenship , and then not being allowed to return to their homes in contravention of international law ; or complain about discriminatory policies of the Jewish National Fund or the discrimination involved in the Jewish Law of Return ; or complain about the house demolitions , the more than 600 Israeli military check points in the West Bank , the 42 years of military Occupation of Gaza and the West Bank , the program of targeted assassinations , the well - documented cases of torture ; and the imprisonment of more than 11,000 Palestinians including women and children , many held without charge under what is called Administrative Detention , or the recent slaughter in Gaza , that these complaints and to expose these facts is anti-Semitic !
The view that it is anti-Semitic to criticize Israel , or its actions , is pure and simple racism against Palestinians .
The Palestinians , Arabs and Muslims have many legitimate reasons to criticize the policies and actions of “ the Jewish State . ”
A state that aggressively , and repeatedly , attacks its neighbours and is slowly but systematically ethnically cleansing its non-Jewish population is not above criticism .
No state is above criticism .
You should be very afraid of a political ideology that you must accept without question .
There is also much to criticize in the Arab world but it would be absurd to say that one cannot criticize the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its treatment of women or its human rights record , because it is racist against Arabs or is anti-Muslim .
A person who made such an argument would be laughed at .
No one would take them or the argument seriously .
Yet this allegation of anti-Semitism is a frequent smear tactic that has been used against individuals who have publicly supported Palestinian human rights .
These individuals include former US President Jimmy Carter , Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu , Nelson Mandela , Bertrand Russell , Mahatma Gandhi , Arnold Toynbee , George Orwell and many , many others who have expressed public support for the Palestinians .
Most of the strongest critics of Zionism and Israel ’s policies are Jewish .
The only Jewish member of Lloyd George ’s cabinet when Great Britain first threw its weight behind Zionism in 1917 , Sir Edwin Montagu , was adamantly opposed to the creation of a Jewish state .
He attacked the Balfour Declaration and Zionism because he believed they were anti-Semitic .
Montagu argued that Zionism and anti-Semitism were based on the same premise , namely that Jews and non-Jews could not co-exist .
Ironically , people like me who want Jews to remain in our society , be an important part of our community and be safe from discrimination and racism are diametrically opposed to the Zionist goal of ingathering all of the Jews to Palestine .
Zionists want to “ save the Jews ” because they are not safe in the diaspora and face the threat of persecution due to the intractable anti-Semitism that exists in non-Jewish societies .
To quote one Zionist commentator ,
The Law [ of Return ] and the Clause and , for that matter Zionism and the Jewish State are necessary so long as the threat to our people continues ; so long , in other words , as Diaspora exists ….. So the Law of Return continues to be necessary for Jewish survival , to serve its essential function in Zionist theory and practice .
The Law defines Israel ’s Zionist mission , our state as protector and refuge for threatened Diaspora Jewry .
Without the history of Christian anti-Semitism that has existed in Europe and the centuries of persecution of the European Jewish community political Zionism would be considered a deranged and absurd political philosophy .
Without anti-Semitism , Zionism has no legitimacy .
Sir Edwin Montagu was also afraid that a Jewish state would undermine the safety of Jews in other countries .
It appears that this fear was realized in that the safety of the Arab Jewish community was undermined , to a large extent deliberately , so that they would be forced to immigrate to Palestine to strengthen the Jewish presence there .
Montagu ’s opposition to Zionism and the Balfour Declaration was supported by the leading representative bodies of Anglo - Jewry at the time , the Board of Deputies and the Anglo - Jewish Association , and in particular , by three prominent British Jews Claude Montefiore , David Alexander and Lucien Wolf .
Many Jews are anti-Zionist and opposed the settlement of Jews in Palestine .
In fact , historically Zionism was not supported by the majority of Jews .
In the process of creating the state of Israel the political Zionists destroyed Palestine and ethnically cleansed more than 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and villages in order to create a demographic Jewish majority in their newly created “ Jewish state . ”
There is a very respected and honored Jewish tradition of opposition to injustice and human rights violations .
There is no monolithic position for Jews when it comes to Israel and the Palestinian issue .
My article “ Jewish Criticism of Zionism ” which lists more than 160 Jewish critics of Zionism .
This article lists many prominent Jewish intellectuals that are extremely critical of Israel ’s policies towards Palestinians .
There is a long distinguished line of Jewish critics of Zionism and Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians .
This list includes Albert Einstein , Sigmund Freud , Hannah Arendt , Franz Kafka , Isaac Asimov , I.F. Stone , Norton Mezvinsky , Alfred Lilienthal , Silvain Levi , Eric Rouleau , Tony Judt , Sara Roy , Ronnie Kasrils , Eric Hobsbawn , Saul Landau , Noam Chomsky , Hans Kohen , Eric Fromm , Bruno Kreisky , Pierre Mendes France , Richard Falk , Harold Pinter ( the Nobel prize winner for Literature ) , Philip Roth , Michael Selzer , Don Peretz , Immanuel Wallerstein , Rabbi Michael Lerner , actor Ed Asner and many other leading Jewish intellectuals and religious figures .
Isaac Asimov was one of the greatest writers of the Twentieth Century and wrote on many topics .
He expressed his views about Zionism in a number of pieces .
One example is found in the second volume of his autobiography In Joy Still Felt .
There he tells of having dinner in 1959 with some friends and his wife .
Asimov wrote :
As usual , I found myself in the odd position of not being a Zionist and of not particularly valuing my Jewish heritage … .
I just think it is more important to be human and to have a human heritage ; and I think it is wrong for anyone to feel that there is anything special about any one heritage of whatever kind .
It is delightful to have the human heritage exist in a thousand varieties , for it makes for greater interest , but as soon as one variety is thought to be more important than another , the groundwork is laid for destroying them all .
Asimov also commented on Zionism in a chapter titled “ Anti-Semitism ” in I. Asimov , his third autobiographical volume .
There , Asimov discussed how he was distressed by the capability of the historically oppressed ( such as the Jews ) to in turn become oppressors if given the chance .
Asimov wrote : “ Right now , there is an influx of Soviet Jews into Israel .
They are fleeing because they expect religious persecution .
Yet at the instant their feet touched Israeli soil , they became extreme Israeli nationalists with no pity for the Palestinians .
From persecuted to persecutors in the blinking of an eye . ”
Tens of thousands of religious Jews today are adamantly opposed to Zionism including the orthodox Neturei Karta and the Satmar sects .
Rabbi Yisroel Weiss is the international spokesman for Neturei Karta .
Hundreds of thousands of religious Jews in Israel reject the secular political movement of Zionism which created “ the Jewish State . ”
There is an important book written by Dr. Yakov M. Rabkin , a professor of History at the University of Montreal .
It is titled A Threat from Within : A Century of Jewish Opposition to Zionism , ( Zed Books : London , 2006 ) .
This book examines Jewish religious opposition to Zionism and details the long history of religious opposition to Zionism as a political movement to establish a Jewish state in Palestine .
Rabkin describes present day Jewish religious anti-Zionism as follows :
… the rejection of Zionism in the name of the Torah , in the name of Jewish tradition .
Such rejection is all the more significant in that it can in no way be described as anti-Semitic , recent attempts to conflate any expression of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism notwithstanding .
At first glance this seems to be a paradox .
After all , the public almost automatically associates Jews and Israel .
The press continues to refer to “ the Jewish State . ”
Israeli politicians often speak “ in the name of the Jewish people . ”
Yet the Zionist movement and the creation of the State of Israel has caused one of the greatest schisms in Jewish history .
An overwhelming majority of those who defend and interpret the traditions of Judaism have , from the beginning , opposed what was to become a vision for a new society , a new concept of being Jewish , a program of massive immigration to the Holy land and the use of force to establish political hegemony there .
Israel ’s founders were in fact atheists who wanted to transform Judaism from being a religion into a secular national movement based on race or ethnicity .
This explains why Jewish religious leaders were strongly opposed to secular Zionism .
Theodore Herzl was seen as an anti-Semite due to his hostility to religious Jews .
In 1943 , a group of 92 Reform rabbis , and many other prominent American Jews , created the American Council for Judaism with the express intent of combating Zionism .
Included in the Council ’s leadership were Rabbi Morris S. Lazaron of Baltimore ; Lessing J. Rosenwald , the former chairman of the Sears , Roebuck & Company , who became president of the Council ; Rabbi Elmer Berger who became its executive director ; Arthur Hays Sulzberger , publisher of The New York Times ; and Sidney Wallach of the American Jewish Committee .
An example of their views on Zionism is Palestine , a pamphlet published by the American Council for Judaism , 1944 , p.7 [ American Council for Judaism Records ( 1942-1968 ) , American Jewish Archives .
Cincinnati , OH ] which stated as follows : “… the concept of a theocratic state is long past .
It is an anachronism .
The concept of a racial state — the Hitlerian concept — is repugnant to the civilized world , as witness the fearful global war in which we are involved . ”
The American Council for Judaism was founded to expressly oppose Zionism .
It was created in response to a 1942 Zionist Conference in the US , which proposed the formation of a Jewish army in Palestine before the state was founded .
The Council send letters to various governments and officials expressing their objection to such a notion as a ‘ religious ’ state , especially since they believed that : “ that Jewish nationalism tends to confuse our fellowman about our place and function in society and diverts our own attention from our historic role to live as a religious community wherever we may dwell . ”
Membership in the Council grew to more than 15,000 .
Its members were highly articulate and greatly angered the Zionist leadership , who wanted the American Jewish community to present a united front on the Palestine question .
The book Jews Against Zionism : The American Council for Judaism 1942 - 1948 , by Thomas A. Kolsky , ( Temple University Press , Philadelphia , 1990 ) is a history of the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism during the period just before the creation of the “ Jewish State . ”
After Israel ’s spectacular success in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war , however , a change in the policy towards Zionism occurred in the American Council for Judaism .
Anti-Zionist Jewish author Alfred Lilienthal has suggested that “ Zionist infiltration ” succeeded in “ neutralizing ” the Council .
A separate organization was subsequently established in 1969 called American Jewish Alternatives to Zionism ( AJAZ ) .
The new group , which was based in New York , continued the original anti-Zionist tradition of the American Council for Judaism .
Rabbi Elmer Berger served as president of AJAZ and also editor of its publication the AJAZ Report until shortly before his death in 1996 .
The American Council for Judaism is still in existence but has softened its strict anti-Zionist position but today it is non-Zionist and highly critical of the “ Jewish State ’s ” policies toward the Palestinians .
Their publications frequently carry anti-Zionist Jewish criticism .
Allan C. Brownfeld is the Editor of Issues , their quarterly newsletter and also editor of their Special Interest Report .
Stephen L. Naman is President of the Council .
Adam Shatz , the literary editor of The Nation magazine , has edited a book titled Prophet ’s Outcast .
The book contains essays written by 24 prominent Jewish scholars and intellectuals which are very critical of Zionism and Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians .
Another important book is The Other Israel : Voices of Refusal and Dissent , edited by Roane Carey and Jonathan Shainin .
It contains articles very critical of Israel ’s policies , written by 27 prominent Israelis .
The Forward was written by a prominent Israeli author and journalist Tom Segev .
The Introduction is written by Anthony Lewis , the two - time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist , who worked at The New York Times between 1969 and 2001 .
Lewis is now the James Madison Visiting Professor at Columbia University .
There are many Israeli critics of Zionism and anti-Zionist Jews in Israel where the conflict with the Palestinians is most apparent .
These include Avraham Burg , former head of the World Jewish Agency and former Speaker of the Knesset ; Shulamit Aloni , a former Minister of Education ; Yossi Sarid a former Knesset member and past leader of Meretz ; Uri Avnery former Knesset member and leader of Gush Shalom ; the late Israel Shahak former Chair of the Israeli League for Human and Civil Rights ; former General and Knessett Member Mattityahu Peled ; Meron Benvenisti , former Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem ; Jeff Halper head of Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions ; Felica Langer , a well known human rights lawyer ; Michael Warschawski , co-founder of the Alternative Information Center ; University of Oxford historian Avi Shalim ; Eitan Bronstein Chair of Zochrot , which means “ Remember , ” and works to remind Israelis about the Nakba or Palestinian catastrophe ; the late linguist and journalist Tanya Reinhart ; New Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe ; Uri Davis , author of Israel : An Apartheid State ( London : Zed Books , 1987 ) ; Tikva Honig - Parnass , editor of Between the Lines ; and journalists Gideon Levy , Amira Hass , A.B. Yehoshua , Yitzhak Laor , Akiva Eldar , Meron Rapoport , B. Michael , and Gideon Spiro to name only a few of the many Israelis who are anti-Zionist , non-Zionist or extremely critical of Zionism and Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians .
There was an interesting book review published in Haaretz , on February 29 , 2008 , written by Tom Segev .
It was a review of a book titled , When and How Was the Jewish People Invented ?
( published by Resling in Hebrew ) .
It is authored by Israeli historian Shlomo Zand ( also spelled Sand ) .
Prof. Zand teaches history at Tel Aviv University .
The book became a best seller in Israel .
Segev writes :
… in one of the most fascinating and challenging books published here in a long time .
There never was a Jewish people , only a Jewish religion , and the exile also never happened — hence there was no return .
Zand rejects most of the stories of national - identity formation in the Bible , including the exodus from Egypt and , most satisfactorily , the horrors of the conquest under Joshua .
It ’s all fiction and myth that served as an excuse for the establishment of the State of Israel , he asserts .
This information and arguments have been around for a long time but it is interesting to see them published in one of Israel ’s leading daily newspapers and presented in a book written by an Israeli historian .
Here is how Segev summarizes the arguments in Zand ’s book :
According to Zand , the Romans did not generally exile whole nations , and most of the Jews were permitted to remain in the country .
The number of those exiled was at most tens of thousands .
When the country was conquered by the Arabs , many of the Jews converted to Islam and were assimilated among the conquerors .
It follows that the progenitors of the Palestinian Arabs were Jews .
Zand did not invent this thesis ; 30 years before the Declaration of Independence , it was espoused by David Ben-Gurion , Yitzhak Ben - Zvi and others .
If the majority of the Jews were not exiled , how is it that so many of them reached almost every country on earth ?
Zand says they emigrated of their own volition or , if they were among those exiled to Babylon , remained there because they chose to .
Contrary to conventional belief , the Jewish religion tried to induce members of other faiths to become Jews , which explains how there came to be millions of Jews in the world .
As the Book of Esther , for example , notes , “ And many of the people of the land became Jews ; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them . ”
Zand quotes from many existing studies , some of which were written in Israel but shunted out of the central discourse .
He also describes at length the Jewish kingdom of Himyar in the southern Arabian Peninsula and the Jewish Berbers in North Africa .
The community of Jews in Spain sprang from Arabs who became Jews and arrived with the forces that captured Spain from the Christians , and from European - born individuals who had also become Jews .
The first Jews of Ashkenaz ( Germany ) did not come from the Land of Israel and did not reach Eastern Europe from Germany , but became Jews in the Khazar Kingdom in the Caucasus .
Zand explains the origins of Yiddish culture : it was not a Jewish import from Germany , but the result of the connection between the offspring of the Kuzari and Germans who traveled to the East , some of them as merchants .
We find , then , that the members of a variety of peoples and races , blond and black , brown and yellow , became Jews in large numbers .
According to Zand , the Zionist need to devise for them a shared ethnicity and historical continuity produced a long series of inventions and fictions , along with an invocation of racist theses .
Some were concocted in the minds of those who conceived the Zionist movement , while others were offered as the findings of genetic studies conducted in Israel .
It is somewhat ironic that issues and subjects that relate to the Palestinians and Zionism that are virtually taboo in North America are openly discussed in Israel .
These same subjects are much more openly discussed in Europe and in the rest of the World .
Here is what noted financier , George Soros , writing in the New York Review of Books , on April 12 , 2007 , had to say on this the lack of debate in the United States on the Palestinian issue :
The current policy is not even questioned in the United States .
While other problem areas of the Middle East are freely discussed , criticism of our policies toward Israel is very muted indeed .
The debate in Israel about Israeli policy is much more open and vigorous than in the United States .
This is all the more remarkable because Palestine is the issue that more than any other currently divides the United States from Europe .
The Jerusalem Post wrote :
… For an example of the type of discussion that goes on in Israel is the following statement made by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert : “ For sixty years there has been discrimination against Arabs in Israel .
This discrimination is deep - seated and intolerable . ”
Olmert made this statement while addressing a meeting of the Knesset committee that was investigating the lack of integration of Arab citizens in public service .
Another example is the current Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin ( from the right - wing Likud Party ) who called for a fundamental change in relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel .
He urged the founding of a “ true partnership ” between the two sectors , based on mutual respect , absolute equality and the addressing of “ the special needs and unique character of each of the sides . ”
The Speaker was reported to say all this in an address to be delivered at the president ’s residence in Jerusalem on August 3rd , 2009 .
Quoting from Rivlin ’s prepared speech which was released to the media :
The establishment of Israel was accompanied by much pain and suffering and a real trauma for the Palestinians ( in large part due to the shortsightedness of the Palestinian leadership ) .
Many of Israel ’s Arabs , which see themselves as part of the Palestinian population , feel the pain of their brothers across the green line – a pain they feel the state of Israel is responsible for .
Many of them , ” Rivlin says , “ encounter racism and arrogance from Israel ’s Jews ; the inequality in the allocation of state funds also does not contribute to any extra love .
Can you ever imagine a top American or Canadian politician making statements like these , or a leading Canadian or American newspaper publishing an article like this one ?
If they did make statements like these what would be the reaction ?
However , Rivlin still tried to focus the blame on the Palestinian leadership for the problems and does not fully acknowledge Israel ’s part in the expulsions .
These expulsions and massacres started before the official declaration of Israel ’s Independence on May 14 , 1948 .
According to Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe , there were expulsions of the Palestinians from 30 villages after the War had ended in 1949 .
Rivlin also does not address the land seizures from Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes but remained in Israel .
These individuals were considered Israeli citizens , but still lost all of their property .
These individuals are called “ present Absentees , ” an Orwellian phrase if there ever was one .
Here is how one Israeli academic , Gabriel Piterberg , describes the phrase and how it relates to Israel : “ How the founding myths of Israel dictated conceptual removal of Palestinians , during and after physical removal .
The invention of ‘ retroactive transfer ’ and ‘ present absentees ’ as the glacial euphemisms of ethnic cleansing . ”
Nor does Rivlin acknowledge that most of the Zionist leadership wanted all of Palestine without its Arab population and this wish “ miraculously ” came true .
Palestinian leadership , inept as it was , can not be blamed for everything .
Another important book on this topic is Reframing Anti-Semitism : Alternative Jewish Perspectives published by the Jewish Voice for Peace .
It contains articles written by eight Jewish American writers .
One of the articles is written by Judith Butler , the Maxine Elliot Professor in Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkley .
Her article is on the question of whether criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic .
Her answer and article is titled : “ No , Its Not Anti-Semitic . ”
Another book that examines Jewish criticism of Zionism and Israel ’s policies is Wrestling with Zion : Progressive Jewish - American Responses to the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict , edited by Tony Kushner and Alisa Solomon ( Grove Press : New York , 2003 ) .
Kushner is an award winning playwright and Solomon a staff writer at The Village Voice and a professor at Baruch College - City of New York .
This book contains a collection of 53 prominent American Jewish writers ’ critical analysis of Zionism and Israel ’s policies .
This list includes such distinguished writers as Arthur Miller , Susan Sontag , Marc Ellis , Naomi Klein ( actually a Canadian ) and Rabbi Arthur Waskow among many others .
Another important book on Jewish criticism of Zionism and Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians is A Time to Speak Out : Independent Jewish Voices on Israel , Zionism and Jewish Identity ( Verso : London , 2008 ) .
It is edited by four prominent British academics , Anne Karpf , Brian Klug , Jacqueline Rose and Barbara Rosenbaum .
This book contains the highly critical writings of 27 Jewish academics and thinkers on the issues of the Occupation , Israel and Zionism .
There are a number of other anthologies and collections of writings from anti-Zionist Jews .
These include Zionism Reconsidered , edited by Michael Selzer , ( The MacMillian Company : London , 1970 ) ; Zionism :
The dream and the reality : A Jewish Critique , Gary V. Smith ed. ( Barnes & Noble Books : New York , 1974 ) ; Jewish Critics of Zionism and The Stifling and Smearing of a Dissenter , by Moshe Menuhin , ( Association of Arab University Graduates , 1976 ) ; Judaism or Zionism , EAFORD & AJAZ ( American Jewish Alternatives to Zionism ) eds. , ( Zed Books : London , 1986 ) ; The End of Zionism and the Liberation of the Jewish People , Eibie Weizfeld ed. ( Clarity Press : Atlanta , 1989 ) ; Radicals , Rabbis , and Peacemakers : Conversations with Jews against the occupation , edited by Seth Faber ( Common Courage Press , Monroe ME , 2005 ) .
Faber ’s book contains a series of interviews with leading American dissident Jews ’ Noam Chomsky , Steve Quester , Joel Kovel , Norton Mezvinsky , Ora Wise , Norman Finkelstein , Phyllis Bennis , Adam Shapiro , Daniel Boyarin , Rabbi David Weiss , and includes a speech and an essay by Marc Ellis .
Mordecai Richler , the late esteemed Canadian author , wrote an article entitled “ Israel marks 50th anniversary out of favor with many Jews , ” Toronto Star , February 15 , 1998 .
Many other Canadian Jews are opposed to Zionism or are critical of Israel ’s treatment of the Palestinians .
Many Canadian Jews were against the war on Gaza .
These dissenters include academics and writers Judy Rebick , Naomi Klein , Avi Lewis , Rick Salutin , Bernard Avishai , Howard Skutel , Yakov Rabkin , Klaus Herrmann , Janet Weinroth , Judith Weisman , Michael Neumann , Alan Sears , Gabor Mate , Judy and Larry Haiven , Michael Mandel , Ursula Franklin , Abbie Bakan , Mordecai Briemberg , Eibie Weizfeld , Zalman Amit , Rabbi Reuben Slonim , pianist Anton Kuerti , Ralph Benmergui broadcaster and producer and Judy Deutsch head of Science for Peace to name but a few .
The Jewish Outlook Society , headquartered in Vancouver , Canada , publishes Outlook .
They describe their magazine as , “ An Independent , secular Jewish publication with a socialist - humanist perspective . ”
Carl Rosenberg is the Editor and Sylvia Friedman is the Managing Editor .
Harold Berson is in charge of circulation .
They have over 40 Jewish individuals , primarily living in Canada , who serve in various capacities with the organization and their publication .
Outlook takes a critical view of Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians and frequently publishes Jewish anti-Zionist perspectives .
Independent Jewish Voices ( IJV ) ( Canada ) currently has more than 100 members .
Dylan Penner , Sid Shniad and Diana Ralph serves as coordinators for IJV .
The Steering Committee is composed of 24 Canadian Jewish activists including Fabienne Presentey , Sandra Ruch , Andy Leher and Harry Shannon .
The IJV is a member - led organization , with chapters in Vancouver , Winnipeg , Toronto , Hamilton , Ottawa , Montreal , and Halifax .
Here is what Independent Jewish Voices ( Canada ) said , in their February 19 , 2009 Press Release , about Stephen Harper Conservative government ’s position on the Israeli / Palestinian conflict and Minister Jason Kenney ’s cutting off funding for English Second Language training programs run by the Canadian Arab Federation :
We believe that Mr. Kenny [ sic ] and his Conservative government is threatening CAF ’s funding because CAF stands for justice for Palestinian people and because it expresses principled criticism of oppressive Israeli policies .
As Jews , we affirm that criticizing Israeli policies is NOT anti-Semitic .
Anti-Semitism refers to hostility and / or prejudice against Jews .
Like any other government , Israel has obligations under international law .
To responsibly raise critical concerns about the discriminatory , illegal , and brutal policies of another government is an ethical imperative , which our government should support .
However , the Conservative government has gone further than any previous Canadian administration in endorsing illegal and brutal Israeli assaults on Palestinian and Lebanese people .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper has pledged complete allegiance with Israel and labels as “ anti-Semitic ” any criticism of Israeli actions ( including the Gaza massacre , house demolitions , use of illegal phosphorous and DIME weapons against civilians , etc. ) .
As Jews , we believe this is a dishonest smoke - screen , a ploy to discredit principled calls for humanity , justice , and compliance with international law .
There are hundreds , and probably thousands , of Jewish critics of Zionism and of Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians who have published articles or written books on the subject .
Yet many Zionists , and their supporters , claim that there is a monolithic Jewish position in support of Zionism , Israel and the occupation of Palestinian land .
This claim of near universal Jewish support for the Zionist state and its actions toward the Palestinians is so far from the truth that it is laughable .
One has only to open your eyes and review the written record to see that there is no Jewish consensus on these issues and a great deal of criticism and outright opposition to Zionism exists in Jewish intellectual and religious circles , both in the past and today .
Israel ’s supporters shamelessly use the argument that to criticize Israel is anti-Semitic no matter what Israel does .
This argument is almost entirely false and politically motivated .
Not to tell the truth , or to suppress discussion , about what is going on in Palestine is racist and a crime against the Palestinian people and a crime of silence and indifference not unlike the one committed against Jews in the Second World War .
To quote George Soros on the use of anti-Semitism , a tactic he described “ the most insidious argument , ” to silence the political debate on Israel ’s policies toward the Palestinians .
… Any politician who dares to expose AIPAC ’s influence would incur its wrath ; so very few can be expected to do so .
It is up to the American Jewish community itself to rein in the organization that claims to represent it .
But this is not possible without first disposing of the most insidious argument put forward by the defenders of the current policies : that the critics of Israel ’s policies of occupation , control , and repression on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem and Gaza engender anti-Semitism .
The opposite is the case .
One of the myths propagated by the enemies of Israel is that there is an all - powerful Zionist conspiracy .
That is a false accusation .
Nevertheless , that AIPAC has been so successful in suppressing criticism has lent some credence to such false beliefs .
Demolishing the wall of silence that has protected AIPAC would help lay them to rest .
A debate within the Jewish community , instead of fomenting anti-Semitism , would only help diminish it .
Billionaire George Soros can hardly be considered a leftist .
He is also Jewish .
Here is what Ben Ehrenreich , the author of the novel The Suitors , wrote in the Los Angeles Times on the issue of criticism of Zionism being anti-Semitic .
Meanwhile , the characterization of anti-Zionism as an “ epidemic ” more dangerous than anti-Semitism reveals only the unsustainability of the position into which Israel ’s apologists have been forced .
Faced with international condemnation , they seek to limit the discourse , to erect walls that delineate what can and ca n’t be said .
It ’s not working .
Opposing Zionism is neither anti-Semitic nor particularly radical .
It requires only that we take our own values seriously and no longer , as the book of Amos has it , “ turn justice into wormwood and hurl righteousness to the ground .
Establishing a secular , pluralist , democratic government in Israel and Palestine would of course mean the abandonment of the Zionist dream .
It might also mean the only salvation for the Jewish ideals of justice that date back to Jeremiah . ”
There is clearly a wide range of opinion on Zionism that exists within the Jewish community .
This fact needs to be recognized .
We also need to reject specious arguments and reject false allegations of racism and anti-Semitism .
We need to fight for freedom of speech , academic freedom , critical inquiry and democratic debate , at all universities and colleges , in the media , in the halls of political power and all across North America .
Individuals should be allowed to decide for themselves questions about Zionism and the Palestinians based on open debate , the facts and informed opinion not on suppression of debate , intimidation and censorship .

Researchers are typically confronted with big problems that they have no idea how to solve .
In trying to come up with a solution , a natural approach is to decompose the big problem into a set of subproblems whose solution yields a solution to the larger problem .
This approach can go wrong in several ways .
Decomposition failure .
The solution to the decomposition does not in fact yield a solution to the overall problem .
Artificial hardness .
The subproblems created are sufficient if solved to solve the overall problem , but they are harder than necessary .
As you can see , computational complexity forms a relatively new ( in research - history ) razor by which to judge an approach sufficient but not necessary .
In my experience , the artificial hardness problem is very common .
Many researchers abdicate the responsibility of choosing a problem to work on to other people .
This process starts very naturally as a graduate student , when an incoming student might have relatively little idea about how to do research , so they naturally abdicate the problem choice to an advisor .
As an inexperienced graduate student , it ’s difficult to avoid this , because an advisor often really does know much better about what is easy , what is hard , and how to decompose a complex problem into solvable subproblems .
Nevertheless , if your plan in life is to do substantial research , it ’s essential even then to question research directions carefully .
In contrast to sufficient subgoals of a greater goal , there are also necessary subgoals .
A necessary subgoal is one which must be solved to solve the greater goal .
One of the reasons why the artificial hardness problem is so common is that the sufficient subgoals are commonly confused with necessary subgoals .
The essential test for a necessary subgoal is whether or not a solution to the global problem can be used as a solution to the subgoal .
My personal greater goal is creating a master machine learning algorithm that can solve any reasonable learning problem where “ reasonable ” includes at least the set that humans can solve .
Relative to this greater goal , many existing research programs do not appear necessary .
The short form of my second comment on Marcus ’s post is that I see the sufficiency but not the necessity of competing with all Turing machines .
The necessity of several statistical modeling approaches appears unclear to me , because they often encounter severe computational problems .
Perhaps this is an example of creating an artificially hard problem , as empirical experiences with Searn suggest .
What is necessary ?
Large data .
It is clear that humans solving learning problems have access to large amounts of information which they employ to solve these problems .
While we do n’t stick children into a sensory deprivation tank to see how much it retards their ability to solve problems when grown , some experiments along these lines have been done with animals yielding obvious ability deficiency .
Online learning .
The ability to learn in an online environment with relatively little processing per bit of input is clearly a sufficient approach to solve many problems .
We can also argue that it is a computational necessity , as retraining based upon all past information appears computationally infeasible , or at least deeply wasteful .
Interactive learning .
It ’s clear that many animals use an interactive process to learn about the world .
This form of learning is also necessary , because it provides the ability to answer unanticipated questions .
We can further argue the necessity by pointing out that interactive proofs appear much more powerful in computational complexity theory than noninteractive proofs .
For example , viewed from a learning perspective , much of science is about interactive learning .
Compositional Design of a learning system .
The necessity of compositional design in machine learning is not entirely clear .
For example , we could imagine that it ’s possible to design good learning systems using an evolutionary approach .
Nevertheless , since our basic goal in research is a much more efficient and faster design , it seems that the decision to take a research - based approach implies that compositional design is necessary .
Restated : we should be able to design the system to learn in components which compose to form an overall solution .
Large contexts .
It ’s necessary that a learning algorithm be able to use a relatively large number of bits when making a decision .
For example , people working on vision have cool examples where people manage to use many different cues to predict what an object is .
Nonlinearity .
People can clearly solve learning problems for which no linear representation ( of input information ) is capable of achieving good performance .
Some of these are criticizable as perhaps unnecessary , and I can easily imagine missing others .
If you have other arguments for what is or is not necessary for this greater goal , please speak up .
There are two other categories of subgoal research we could consider .
There are subgoals which are necessary and sufficient ( in combination ) to solve the greater goal .
I do n’t know of any such arguments for my greater goal .
The fourth category is subgoals which are neither necessary nor sufficient for a greater goal .
In my experience such papers are quite common at conferences with types that include :
Work on speeding up a slow algorithm leaving it slower than the state of the art , Otherwise improving an algorithm which is suboptimal while leaving it suboptimal .
The nitty - gritty of these questions come at review time .
Which papers should be accepted ?
In general , decision making is pretty terrible because greater goals are rarely stated , perhaps as a form of strategic ambiguity .
After all , the set of people attending a conference have multiple greater goals .
Nevertheless , my personal ordering is :
Necessary and sufficient research directions .
An emptyset in my experience .
Necessary research directions .
This is typically a small fraction .
Sufficient research directions .
This is a greater fraction .
Neither .
This is often the majority .
Wrong .
Must be rejected .
So the question to periodically ask yourself as a researcher is :
What is the greater goal ?
Is this subgoal necessary ?
Sufficient ?
Something else ?
Such a rich store pf myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib , the Mentat Emperor , and his sister , Alia , it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils .
But there were , after all , a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia .
Their flesh was subject to space and time .
And even though their oracular powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space , they came from human stock .
They experienced real events which left traces upon a real universe .
To understand them , it must be seen that their catastrophe of all mankind .
This work is dedicated , then , not to Muad 'dib or his sister , but to thier heirs - to all of us .

President Obama promised he would win America friends where , under George W. Bush , it had antagonists .
The reality is that the U.S. is working hard to create antagonists where it previously had friends .
That 's one conclusion to draw from President Obama 's decision yesterday to scrap a missile - defense agreement the Bush Administration negotiated with Poland and the Czech Republic .
Both governments took huge political risks — including the ire of their former Russian overlords — in order to accommodate the U.S. , which wanted the system to defend against a possible Iranian missile attack .
Do n't expect either government to follow America 's lead anytime soon .
" If the Administration approaches us in the future with any request , I would be strongly against it , " Jan Vidim , a conservative Czech lawmaker who voted for the system , told the Associated Press .
The White House justifies its decision by claiming to have new intelligence showing that Iran 's long - range missile capabilities are not as advanced as previously believed .
Instead , it intends to upgrade and deploy currently available missile interceptors that are useful mainly for intercepting short - and medium - range missiles , where , it says , Iranian capability " is developing more rapidly than previously projected . "
We 're all for deploying interceptors to stop Iranian missiles of every range .
But the Administration 's argument is difficult to credit , not least because our sources told us as early as February that the Administration was prepared to abandon those sites — which is to say , well before the allegedly new intelligence became available .
In Muslim nations and regions around the globe , this is the first week of the holy month of Ramadan , a time for followers to abstain from eating , drinking , smoking and sexual activity during the day , breaking their fast each sunset , with traditional meals and sweets .
During this time , Muslims are also encouraged to read the entire Quran , to give freely to those in need , and strengthen their ties to God through prayer .
The goal of the fast is to teach humility , patience and sacrifice , and to ask forgiveness , practice self - restraint , and pray for guidance in the future .
This year , Ramadan will continue until Saturday , September 19th .

I think that Paul Krugman is one of those absurd guys that has no idea what in the hell he is talking about and who owes his undeserved prominence to being a real butt - kissing sucker - upper to Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve , and now he ’s doing the same thing to the laughable Ben Bernanke and his disastrous Federal Reserve , although I will admit that I do n’t know why anybody listens to this guy .
I say this with such obvious disrespect because Mr. Krugman is on record has having advised the Bank of Japan to purposely cause inflation , as ,  The way to make monetary policy effective is for the central bank to credibly promise to be irresponsible — to make a persuasive case that it will permit inflation to occur , thereby producing the negative real interest rates the economy needs ,  although he never actually says where he is going to find guys stupid enough to loan money at negative interest rates , or in what bizarre alternate universe he lives where high inflation in consumer prices , particularly sustained high inflation , is anything other than a total disaster , which is why most of economics is concerned with the problem of preventing inflation while fostering growth !
In fact , he thinks that a central bank trying to reflate a collapsing economy should announce a deliberate plan to raise the level of prices ( such as the Consumer Price Index ) from current low levels to some dramatically higher value ( a so - called  price - level gap ) that it would have theoretically reached if a moderate and constant amount of inflation in prices had , in fact , occurred !
Gaaahhhh !
To make it more Theater of the Absurd , he then says to keep creating more inflation in prices !
Gaaahhhh !
This is insane !
This is beyond insane !

This would be bad enough coming from just another egghead academic dork from Princeton , but a terrifying quote from Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Federal Reserve , shows that he agrees with this with nonsense !
In fact , Bernanke said ,  A successful effort to eliminate the price - level gap would proceed , roughly , in two stages .
During the first stage , the inflation rate would exceed the long - term desired inflation rate , as the price - level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone .
Call this the reflationary phase of policy .
Second , once the price - level target was reached , or nearly so , the objective for policy would become a conventional inflation target or a price - level target that increases over time at the average desired rate of inflation . 
This is so dangerously preposterous that one ’s hands shake in fear and paranoia at the calamity that awaits a nation that takes such ridiculous advice , and there is nothing to be done except to buy more gold , silver and oil , as the last 4,500 years of history have proven that these are the things that have lasting value , unlike the bitter disappointment and dismay of paper money and true love . 
Obviously , people do not have to be around me very long before they learn that I am perpetually scared , to one degree or another , of inflation in prices , such as the other day , for example , when I had saved up enough money to have dinner alone at a restaurant so that I could eat one lousy meal without the wife and kids all the time whining and complaining about how they need more money , and want more money , and how they want me to give it to them , and how I am a terrible person for not giving them more money , how I am too stupid to get a better job to make more money and how I am too lazy to get a second job with which to earn more money .

Rich , flakey lobster to dip into real melted butter so wickedly delicious that you can actually hear your arteries hardening from just looking at it ; but I ca n’t order lobster because inflation in prices caused by the Federal Reserve creating so much money and credit all these years has resulted in the ugly news that they now charge too much for lobster , and inflation is so bad that some crappy , weak iced tea is almost two bucks a lousy glassful , most of which is ice ! 
Out of the corner of my eye , I can see the other people in the restaurant have stopped eating and they are all looking at me .
Figuring that they want me to further enlighten them , I go on ,  So do n’t you ask to me about how I like my steak , when you should be asking me how I like inflation in prices , which I do n’t !
Not one little bit !
And if you were n’t so stupid , you would realize that inflation in prices is the worst thing that can happen to us , and which is exactly what is going to happen to us because the damnable Federal Reserve is creating unbelievable , staggering amounts of money and credit so that the federal government can borrow and spend it in an orgy of deficit - spending that will end badly ! 
Well , pretty soon the manager comes over and tries to censor the Heroic And Brave Mogambo ( HABM ) by telling me to shut up and sit down , although he might have been interested in the actual inflation figures , which are pretty bad !
For instance , producer price inflation shot up 1.8 % in June , and it seems especially interesting that the Labor Department figures that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.7 % in June , and although 0.7 % does not seem like that much in one month , it adds up to a lot over the course of time ; like for instance , in a year , when this 0.7 % per month inflation compounds to 8.7 % per year inflation !
Yow !
The Best of Richard Daughty
The Pirates vs. Ninja discussion goes back many years in the Geek community .
It may not be a hardcore geek debate , but there has been plenty of discourse .
The devoted Pirates have always had a long time rivalry with the equally devoted Ninja .
Pirates hate Ninja , Ninja hate Pirates .
This is not a clash that is without rhetorical bloodshed .
Recently I was listening to a podcast at Hipsterplease.com and discovered there is even a Nerdcore Pirates vs. Ninja rivalry .
That was enough evidence for me .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Since it ’s pretty evident to most that Ninja would easily defeat Pirates in a one on one battle to the severe and brutal but quick death , I decided to take the debate to a higher level .
I ’ll be considering other overall factors than just the ability to kill in battle .
Oh , and Ninja is the correct plural form of Ninja , according to the Japanese – where Ninja originated .
History
The Ninja prominently emerged in the 15th century .
They served mostly as mercenary agents of espionage and as spies .
Side jobs included those of assassin and terrorist .
General sabotage and misdirection during battle were also telltale signs that a Ninja was nearby .
However , their history of origin is very murky .
There are early signs of Ninja activity in the 5th and 6th centuries with the less than oft recorded assassination .
Ninjas were mostly recruited from the ditch , that is – poor people .
In those days , not much ink was wasted telling tales of the poor , hence , little actual or factual history .
However , this lack of data allows for the history of the Ninja to be appropriately shrouded in mystery .
The secret assassin , appearing from the shadows and disappearing just as quickly – nary a wisp of air to know the Ninja was there .
Yes , I ’m aware that rhymes .
On the other sword , Pirates have a great and storied history with many fantastical tales and stories surrounding the scurvy raiders of the sea .
If a pirate enters a room , you ’ll know it .
No mystery surrounding that stench .
Piracy has been going on for centuries .
There are written accounts going back as far as 1350 BC in ancient Egypt describing ships with no flags attacking other ships and plundering their goods .
The Romans and Greeks faced piracy as well .
The Vikings were essentially Pirates , except much larger and with better armor .
The Ming Dynasty was a very busy time for Chinese pirates , with much history and lore being written about them .
However , the era you are probably most familiar with ( and the era that most movies have been born out of ) is referred to as the Golden Age of Pirates .
This Golden Age ran from the late 1600 ’s to the mid 1700’s .
We all can recount many events in history during this time that took place on the ocean , ships were sailing , and so was the Jolly Roger .
The line is still blurred though when it comes to myth and facts .
Where we know Blackbeard and Barbarossa ( the real one , not to be confused with Disney named mutation Barbossa ) were real based on documents and what passed for photos back then ( paintings , ) we ca n’t be sure about other stories that have come from the time of Pirates .
Was Yellowbeard real or just a wacky creation of Monty Python ?
Hard to say .
Well , not really .
Regardless , Pirates have a much more storied and colorful history than Ninja .
Ninja history is shrouded in the darkness .
This category goes to the Pirates .
Pirate + 1
Training
Ninja training was n’t easy .
Ninja training was more than just physical training , it was psychophysical .
They had to train their minds as well as their bodies , if not more .
Using methods of concentration such as Zen-Buddhism , Ninja were experts in concentration and perception .
The Ninja had to redefine logic and conventional thinking .
Training was intense and put the Ninja into direct conflict orientated situations .
There were no practice rounds .
It was all training from day one .
This was continuity , every day – training .
Moderation was also a key point to the Ninja training , they were not allowed anything that would deter from their training , including sex & alcohol .
That ’s just the mental training .
The physical training was a different kind of intensity .
The Ninja has to be in top physical form at all time , including a master of balance , stealth and all that flipping and jumping around .
The Ninja had to be a master of stress and conditioning , as well as being able to stand still for long periods of time without doing anything to give away his position .
Not to mention the level of respect and discipline involved between a Ninja and his master .
The Pirate training manual ?
I ’m guessing looks something like this :
1 . Show up .
2 . Grab sword .
3 . Drink , rape , pillage & plunder .
4 . Pass out .
While there was a hierarchy and level of respect demanded by the Captain of a ship , there was no formal training to be a pirate .
If you do a Google search for “ Pirate Training ” you ’ll find a ton of games .
Do a search for “ Ninja Training ” and you ’ll find Ninja Training .
Because it exists .
Pirate training did n’t exist .
Besides training their livers to consume copious amounts of rum .
Ninja easily takes this category .
Ninja + 1
Weaponry & Killing Style
Ninja were not short on weapons .
Besides their hands and feet being deadly weapons , the Ninja had a virtual laundry list of other fun and sharp pointy things to choose from to kill someone with .
From swords , foot & knuckle spikes , throwing stars , iron whips , smoke bombs , batons , Kamas , Sais , spikes , nunchucks and even utility belts .
The Ninja was trained on the full and deadly usage of every single one of these weapons .
Not to mention their stealthy and stain resistant Ninja garb .
Usually black , but always loose and comfortable clothing that moved with the Ninja as stealth and camouflage was always a priority .
The Ninja was always ready for battle and his senses were honed to handle any situation with the right weapon , even considering the mind as a weapon .
The Ninja killed with stealth and effective precision .
If you were in a fight with a Ninja , in most cases you would n’t know it until you were tasting your own blood as it bubbled up from the gaping hole in your throat .
Unless a Ninja was facing another Ninja or an army of Samurai , or Zombies , it was rare for the Ninja to engage in a bar room type brawl .
The Ninja was a silent killer , a formidable enemy and that is why they were such effective killers .
If you were in a fight with a pirate , you ’d know it .
There ’d be more than one of them , swords would be swinging around with reckless abandon and the smell of gunpowder would be in the air .
The slight advantage that Pirates have over Ninja comes in the form of the flint lock powder rifle or pistol .
When gunpowder was invented for all purpose use , like in guns , the Pirate ’s ability to become effective killers multiplied tenfold .
That went right back down when you took into account things like lack of training and sobriety .
However , many pirates did train in swordplay and firing weapons , so they were n’t incompetent .
Not to mention pirates had the advantage of being on a moving ship , most kills came from cannon fire at the other ship and merciless killing after surrender .
Pirates fought dirty , that fact is well known .
There was no code of ethics when it came to engaging the enemy and killing them .
You ’d much rather die at the hands of a Ninja than at the grubby hands of a Pirate .
However , as one of my friends mentioned , “ Pirates , they have guns , and they ’re on a boat , bitch . ”
This category goes to the Ninja as the Ninja was a more effective killer , and even if faced against a Pirate ship full of sailors , cannons and guns , one Ninja would kill them all while they slept .
Ninja + 2
Pop Culture
How many Ninja movies have you watched lately ?
While there are plenty of Ninja movies that have been released over the years , such as Zombie vs. Ninja , the Samurai have gotten the red carpet treatment as far as mainstream movies .
The Ninja have made their way into the mainstream consciousness though when it comes to games and toys , just as much as Pirates .
As far as film though , the discussion ends with the recent Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy .
Pirates have shown up in musicals , not much to sing about Ninjas .
In other media , certain Ninja have made for one of the best comics on the web , and Pirates have made for great subject material when it comes to the literary world .
Not to mention Talk Like a Pirate Day .
When it comes down to it though , I have to go with the LEGO factor being the final word .
Pirates have been a staple of the LEGO universe for years and being a geek , LEGO easily outweighs Snake Eyes as being high on the list of pop culture items in the geek universe .
Pirates take this category .
Pirate + 1
Conclusion
Well , final tally is Pirate + 2 , Ninja +
3 . Ninja is the clear winner .
While this may come as no surprise to some , I was pretty sure I would be able to find a way to make the Pirate the winner .
Frankly , as I came to the end here I could see that the Ninja was and is a much superior agent of chaos .
While the Pirate focuses on the never ending search for treasure and wealth , the Ninja handles each mission as its own and then silently moves onto the next with nary a thought to anything beyond .
Ninja have been rumored throughout history as having taken down rulers with espionage and spying , while Pirates have been known throughout history for wreaking havoc and terror on the seas .
It was a close one folks , I can say that .
Clearly , a lot was left out ( like Captain Morgan rum , Pirate Lexicon , wenches & Killer Coding Ninja Monkeys to name a few ) to keep this post within blogging guidelines and out of the thesis category , so do me a favor and fill up the comments with whatever you think I missed or who you think should have won .
Well , you can vote for that .
Stay tuned for more Great Geek Debates !
Network Resources for Coloring a Graph
Last Update : October 26 , 1994
Introduction
A ( vertex ) coloring of an undirected graph is an assignment of a label to each node .
It is required that the labels on the pair of nodes incident to any edge be different .
A minimum coloring of a graph is a coloring that uses as few different labels as possible .
Clique and coloring problems are very closely related .
It is straightforward to see that the size of the maximum clique is a lower bound on the minimum number of labels needed to color a graph .
Many problems of practical interest can be modeled as clique and coloring problems .
The general form of these applications involves forming a graph with nodes representing items of interest .
An edge connects two ``incompatible '' items .
The maximum clique problem is then to find as large a set of pairwise incompatible items as possible .
The minimum coloring problem is to assign a color to each item so that every incompatible pair is assigned different colors .
This document tries to bring together the various resources that are available on the Internet to help in formulating and solving coloring problems .
This work began with the Second DIMACS Challenge , and many of the items in this report were first collected there .
The purpose of this report is to expand on those items and provide a mechanism for further additions to that work .
A Brief Survey of Applications and Algorithms
Last revision : November 3 , 1994
This a work in progress , intended as a quick introduction to the clique and coloring problems , not an exhaustive survey .
( More complete surveys and bibliographies are listed in the references , some of them available via anonymous FTP from dimacs.rutgers.edu .)
Here we restrict our attention to key references ( the set of which may change as the document evolves ) .
Feel free to send me any suggested additions or clarifications , or additional project suggestions .
The email address for suggestions is trick+@cmu.edu .
The Postscript form is also available .
Bibliographies
This is the Bibtex format annotated bibliography for cliques and coloring .
Joe Culberson has put together a very extensive bibliography for graph coloring .
Solution Codes
I have put together a simple version of a code similar to DSATUR .
Here is source code .
While probably not the fastest code , it provides a reasonable benchmark .
This is a picture of how the algorithm works .

Red meat from T - Paw
Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty offered up his own round of sharp - edged zingers in remarks to the College Republican National Committee Friday night , POLITICO 's Zack Abrahamson reports .
“ The only thing growing faster than the federal government ’s deficit is Chris Matthews ’ man-crush on Barack Obama , ” he said .
Pawlenty had earlier stopped short of ruling out a run for the nomination , telling reporters “ I ’m not trying to be cute , but just to tell you genuinely , I do n’t know what I ’m going to be doing three years from now . ”
“ I could be running a nonprofit or a charity , ” Pawlenty said Friday .
“ I could be working in the private sector , I could be still in public service in some capacity , I genuinely and honestly just do n’t know . ”
In remarks to the College Republican National Committee Friday night , Pawlenty characterized the Obama administration as a “ tyranny ” responsible for “ nationalizing ” the mortgage , banking and automobile industries .
Australia is a country with strong cultural pressures to conform ; Aussies are rewarded for fitting in rather than standing out in all areas except for athletics .
It ’s known as the tall poppy syndrome , as in the tall poppy gets mowed down .
In the USA , there ’s a different saying , one about squeaky wheels , and I ’m glad to say that desis in Australia seem to be following the American model .
This weekend , at least 2,000 Indians protested in Melbourne , blocking traffic on a busy street for almost 20 hours to protest the large number of crimes and assaults against Indians in the last year and the lack of police interest or response .
The demonstrations started at Royal Melbourne Hospital where Sravan Kumar Theerthala was lying comotose after having been stabbed with a screwdriver at a party .
Latest available police figures say 1,447 people of Indian origin were robbed or assaulted in Victoria state in 2007 - 2008 , although students from the country say they have risen since then .
Many of the most serious cases occurred in the western suburbs of the state capital Melbourne , where police estimate Indians account for about 30 percent of all robbery and assault victims .
[ link ]
Police have denied any racial motivation , saying the students were in the wrong place at the wrong time .
They have said the crimes were “ opportunistic ” , with Indian students seen as “ soft targets ” .
[ link ]
<
p> In addition to the protests in Melbourne , there was a strong diplomatic response .
Manmohan Singh has called the Australian PM , and the Indian and Australian Foreign Ministers are holding talks on the matter .
The diplomatic engagement was accompanied by a vigorous thapad by BigB who turned down a honorary doctorate offered by the Queensland University of Technology , saying “ Under the prevailing circumstances I find it inappropriate at this juncture , to accept this decoration . ”
This is a serious issue for Australia because it makes $ 15 billion ( AU ) from foreign students , 40 % of whom come from India and China ( 90,000 Indian students and 130,000 Chinese students ) .
Foreign students are the third largest export earner behind coal and iron ore .
Right now , news of these attacks has widespread coverage in India and both governments are threatening to discourage future students from coming to Australia .
This is a credible threat , a few years ago the New Zealand government failed to take racist violence against Chinese students seriously and they lost all their Chinese students as a consequence .
<
p>As a result of this escalation the Australian authorities have changed their tune considerably , and they are now bringing in the PM ’s national security advisor to formulate policy :
Australia said Tuesday the former head of its elite Special Air Service ( SAS ) regiment will lead a task force examining attacks on Indian students … Duncan Lewis , now the government ’s national security adviser , chaired the task force ’s first meeting Tuesday and would coordinate Australia ’s response to the assaults .
[ link ]
<
p> The government is also considering enacting hate crime legislation that would consider prejudicial motivation as a factor in sentencing .
I think it ’s pretty sad that it took this much diplomatic pressure , and some outright hysteria by the Indian media , before the Australian authorities would take the issue seriously .
That said , based on my experience with hate crimes in the USA , the copycat attacks ( including vandalism of a Gurdwara on Monday and a slashing yesterday ) should die down as soon as perpetrators realize that the government will be enforcing the law vigorously .
I ’ve got family in Australia , I ’d like to feel that they ’re safe .
If we 've learned one thing over the years , it 's that you can't predict the behavior of someone who has gone unequivocally insane -- whether it's an athlete , a celebrity , a dog with rabies , a female who has passed two or more babies out of her body or , yes , an entire National Football League season .
Once upon a time , I dubbed this phenomenon " The Tyson Zone , " after reaching a point at which I would have believed any story about Mike Tyson ( real or made up ) .
Over the past few years , a few other celebrities ( Ron Artest , Britney Spears , Michael Jackson , Dennis Rodman , O.J. Simpson , Courtney Love , R. Kelly , Lindsay Lohan , Roger Clemens ) have received a Tyson Zone stamp from me .
But never an entire professional sports season .
Until now .
For eight solid months , we have been planting the seeds for the loopiest football season ever played .
Those seeds bloomed this past weekend with something seemingly spawned from NFL Mad Libs : " Shawne Merriman , " " Tila Tequila , " " 3:45 a.m. choking " and ... go !
The ensuing fallout led to nearly 500,000 " Did he perform the Lights Out dance afterward ? " tweets , Tequila brazenly attacking Merriman through Twitter , me referring to a human being as " Tequila " in print and Merriman 's steadfast denial that he did anything wrong .
Merriman said he was preventing his " intoxicated " friend from driving home , with the underlying point being , " In case you did n't notice , she has ' Tequila ' in her last name and she became famous as a bisexual MTV serial dater . "
One of the better legal defenses ever .
On the other hand , Merriman 's arrest fits right in with every other weird thing that has happened this offseason .
Here are 20 more examples :
1 . An NFL superstar turned ex-con ( Michael Vick ) spent 18 months in prison for running a dogfighting ring , went bankrupt , was released from prison , seemed sufficiently contrite , renounced his old friends , found Tony Dungy as a mentor and then was signed as a backup by the Eagles , whose fans gave him a standing O during his first exhibition appearance .
Weird and continues to be weird .
( Important note : My wife and I had so many arguments about the previous paragraph -- I think Vick deserves a second chance , and she thinks Vick should have to wear an electric collar during games and an electric fence should be set up in the end zone so he gets jolted every time he crosses the goal line , just so he remembers exactly what he did .
I can honestly say it 's the biggest disagreement we 've ever had .
It even surpassed the time we went to a wedding and she drunkenly accused me of flirting with the bride .
Anyway , thank you for making history with my marriage , Michael Vick . )
2 . Our winning Super Bowl quarterback ( Ben Roethlisberger ) was accused of sexually assaulting a Lake Tahoe casino hostess ... who , of course , waited more than a year to make the claim .
Creepy weird .
3 . The Jaguars quit on coach Jack Del Rio so emphatically last season that it seemed inconceivable he could win them back .
How did the team handle it ?
By keeping Del Rio but introducing new uniforms , new colors and a new logo in April .
Did the Jaguars think the new look would confuse the players into thinking they were playing for a new team ?
Why not take it further and have Del Rio dye his hair , gain 50 pounds and grow one of those 1780s mutton - chop mustaches ?
4 . The following coaches are now out of the NFL : Tony Dungy , Mike Shanahan , Bill Cowher , Mike Holmgren and Marty Schottenheimer .
Combined record : 4,512-175 ( approximate ) .
Meanwhile , the following coaches are still in the NFL : Dick Jauron , Brad Childress , Tom Cable , Wade Phillips .
Combined record : 109-978 ( approximate ) .
5. Tony Romo dumped Jessica Simpson for either partying too much ( the rumored reason ) or gaining too much weight ( the real reason , or at least the one I 'd wager on in Vegas ) , followed by Simpson partying even more and gaining even more weight .
We might have a new Kirstie Alley on our hands ; poor Jess suddenly is built like Kirby Puckett with breasts .
( Not that this is a bad thing .
I 'm actually attracted to Zaftig Clingy No Self - Esteem Jess , my single strangest celebrity attraction since Renee Zellweger put on her Bridget Jones weight . )
Did you ever think an NFL offseason could shape about 20 future Us Weekly covers ?
It 's happened , my friends .
Sneaky weird .
6. Terrell Owens now resides in Buffalo .
It 's true .
And weird .
7. John Madden now is just a retired ( and really , really super - wealthy ) old guy with long eyebrows .
Also true .
The last time we had a Madden - less NFL season , I wore glasses and braces .
Weird .
But here 's my question :
What happened to the Madden Cruiser ?
Did he sell it ?
Is it parked in his driveway ?
Is it going on eBay ?
Would he rent it out for a month for my book tour ?
I spent 35 minutes online searching for any of these answers ( and failing ) .
Just because we lost Madden does n't mean we should lose the Madden Cruiser .
8. Matt Millen and Herm Edwards finally found their professional destiny : TV .
Why did it take an entire decade ?
I do n't know .
9 . The trend of rolling the dice with young and barely qualified coaches spiraled out of control when two 33 - year - olds were hired by the Broncos and Bucs : Josh McDaniels ( New England 's offensive coordinator for two years ) and Raheem Morris ( Kansas State 's defensive coordinator for two years , as well as Tampa Bay 's defensive coordinator for the last four weeks of 2008 ... and , um ... well , that 's it ) .
This is turning into Usain Bolt 's sprinting records ; how much lower and less qualified can we go ?
In particular , Morris ' hiring was perplexing .
Imagine ESPN announcing that a 28 - year - old former intern who worked on our poker site for two years and edited our NBA page for four months was named the new editor in chief .
To nobody 's surprise , both struggled out of the gate .
Morris fired his offensive coordinator ( someone HE hired ) less than two weeks before the season .
And thanks to McDaniels ' indiscreetly sniffing out Jay Cutler 's trade value , the Broncos became the first team in NFL history to willingly trade an under - 26 stud QB , settling for a textbook " three quarters for a dollar " trade over just letting his pouting session run its course .
The end result ?
The Chicago Bears -- the Chicago Bears !!! -- have a talented , cannon - armed quarterback for the first time since 1842 .
Weird weird weird .
All of it .
10 . A Raiders assistant suffered a broken jaw after reportedly being jumped by head coach Tom Cable during a staff meeting , followed by a clumsy cover - up that had more leaks than a senior golf tournament , raising the question , " How much would you pay for ' Hard Knocks ' to do the Raiders every year ? "
I 'm in for $ 300 .
Screw it , $ 400 .
Let 's start a fund .
11 . Former Titans star Steve McNair was killed by his 20 - year - old mistress ( who then killed herself ) , then mourned as everyone tried to ignore the elephant in the room : McNair , a married guy with four kids , was a beloved person and a transcendent teammate by all accounts ... so we should n't dwell on the fact that he reportedly had multiple girlfriends and a bachelor pad two miles from his house .
Actually , this was n't weird .
It was just depressing .
12 . In April 2008 , Marvin Harrison was accused of shooting a man outside Playmakers , a Philly nightclub Harrison owns .
The bullets were fired from a Belgian handgun registered to Harrison .
Witnesses refused to come forward .
The investigation stalled .
The man decided to file a civil suit against Harrison .
( So did another victim who was struck by a stray bullet . )
In July 2009 , while sitting in his car , the first accuser was shot seven times and eventually died this week , but not before telling police he believed Harrison hired the gunman .
We still do n't know who was responsible for either shooting .
All we know is :
A . There 's a chance the " classiest " ( at least on the field ) receiver of his generation leads a double life as a gun-toting nightclub owner in a rough section of Philadelphia .
B . This summer , 32 NFL teams told the agent of one of the most prolific receivers ever ( and someone who wanted to keep playing ) , " No thanks , we 're good . "
( You have to admit ... pretty weird . )
13 . Brett Favre changed his mind about playing so many times that when ESPN filmed a " This is ' SportsCenter ' " commercial about people in the newsroom passing along the " definitive " word on his latest decision , it had to film two versions -- one in which he came back and one in which he did n't come back -- in case he changed his mind again , and of course , the day the commercial was filmed , news broke that Favre was coming back .
Favre signed with the Vikings , a heated NFC North rival of the Packers , trashing his relationship with the state of Wisconsin in the process .
I can't think of a single parallel in sports history .
We 've seen players willingly tarnish their careers to hold on for a couple of extra paychecks , but never at the expense of demigod status in a specific region .
Weird .
All of it .
14 . Unable to accept Favre 's waffling anymore , SI 's Peter King finally lambasted him in print for " waffling . "
More stunning than weird .
This was like watching the Olsen twins turn on cigarettes .
15 . Cincy spent a top - 6 pick on an offensive lineman whose breasts jiggled so profanely at the draft combine that it triggered childhood memories of the " Three 's Company " producers figuring out convoluted reasons for Chrissy Snow to jump up and down , followed by my trying to throw hydrogen peroxide in my own eyes to unsee the clip .
Needless to say , he held out for most of training camp , then broke a bone in his foot two days after reporting .
The lesson , as always :
There 's a reason the Bengals are the Bengals .
16 . Former Giants receiver Plaxico Burress ( who accidentally shot himself in the leg while illegally carrying a handgun in public ) was given a prison sentence 30 times longer than that of Browns receiver Donte ' Stallworth ( who killed a pedestrian while driving drunk and high ) .
Not only weird , but perplexing .
17 .
Three NFL teams fired their offensive coordinators : Buffalo , Kansas City and Tampa Bay .
I know , not a big deal .
Until you remember that it happened last week .
Triple weird .
18 . The Cowboys built a mammoth new stadium in which an overwhelmingly gigantic , state - of - the - art television hangs over the field like the UFO in " Close Encounters " ... only it hangs close enough that punters can routinely kick balls into the scoreboard ... only Dallas owner Jerry Jones refuses to lift it ... which means we might have a game this season in which a road team getting blown out tells its punter to repeatedly kick the ball into the scoreboard 90 to 100 times hoping for a Cowboys forfeit .
This will definitely be weird .
19 . NFL players became so addicted to Twitter that Roger Goodell was forced to release an anti-Twitter policy for game days .
Did you ever think NFL players would have to be DISCOURAGED from writing ?
What planet am I on right now ?
20 .
Days before the start of another putrid Raiders season , Al Davis mixed things up by trading his 2011 No. 1 pick for New England 's Richard Seymour , then pooping in the fridge and eating a whole wheel of cheese .
The Raiders ' fans were n't even mad ; they thought it was amazing .
And that was just the OFFseason .
How will this ongoing weirdness manifest itself once the real season starts ?
I 'm frightened .
How can you predict an entire league that 's in The Tyson Zone ?
You can't .
Hence , I am making 10 small predictions and 10 only .
And I 'm putting them in Roman numerals so they look weightier .
Prediction I : The Buffalo Bills will finish with the worst record in football , allowing T.O. to star in the worst NFL season and second worst reality show in the same year .
I would have given T.O. 's show " worst reality show " status , but you can't top " Megan Wants A Millionaire " going off the air because one of Megan 's bachelors allegedly killed his wife and tried to get rid of her by cramming her into a suitcase .
I mean , when VH1 pulls a show because something bad happened , you KNOW something bad happened .
Prediction II : The Patriots will become the first NFL team to crack 900 - plus combined points for and against in one season .
I have one word for this Pats season : " Over . "
Prediction III : A promising Minnesota start ( 3 - 0 ) will unhinge thanks to a fatal Molotov cocktail : an aging / reckless / washed - up QB who fades in November / December ( Favre ) , a shaky coach ( Brad Childress ) and the pressure of unrealistic expectations .
I see Favre retiring ( again ) , and Childress getting fired and realizing his true destiny -- playing the villain in various " Dateline NBC " and NatGeo crime shows in which they use re-enactments to break down seedy Middle America crimes that have n't been solved yet .
Brad , we 're going to need you on the set tomorrow at 8 a.m. , and we need you to be wearing a wife - beater and a beard .
Thanks .
Prediction IV : The Super Bowl Loser Curse will continue with a 5 - 11 Cards season .
We have n't even hit Week 1 , and the Cardinals already are searching for answers after a " lethargic " preseason .
I am writing them off faster than I wrote off the " Melrose Place " remake Tuesday night ... and I did n't last 10 minutes with the " Melrose " remake .
How dare they kill off Sidney the Whore .
Unacceptable .
Prediction V : Comeback years for LaDainian Tomlinson , Brian Urlacher , Kurt Warner jokes , Roy Williams , the " Da Bears " guys , the Seahawks , the Chaz Cinco / Carson Palmer hookup , Dom Capers , Ryan Grant , T.J. Houshmandzadeh and kids Karl Malone had out of wedlock .
Fall - off years for the Dolphins and Falcons , Brian Westbrook , DirecTV ads , Emmitt Smith quote pages , the Wildcat offense , NFL players getting into trouble , dogfighting rings , Donovan McNabb and Steve Smith inexplicably punching out teammates .
Breakout years for Aaron Rodgers jerseys , running backs named " Knowshon , " tight ends named " Jermichael , " Mike Lombardi , Rex Ryan , the Redskins ' defense , giant video screens that look like UFOs and interfere with games , Detroit 's Kevin Smith and " Drew Brees is a superduperstar " conversations .
Prediction VI : Blackouts of home games will become the signature media story of the 2009 season .
You 'll hear way too much about it .
Here 's my take :
This is n't about the economy .
It 's about the fact that it 's more fun to stay home and watch football than it is to sit in crappy seats to watch any team ranging from " lousy " to " mediocre . "
It just is .
For many fan bases , here are the two choices every Sunday :
Door No. 1 ( more expensive ) : Traffic , parking , long walk to stadium , lousy seats , lifeless state - of - the - art arena , TV timeouts , dead crowds , drunk / bitter fans , more TV timeouts , hiked - up concession prices , PDAs with jammed signals as you 're searching for scores , even more TV timeouts , long walk to car , even more traffic .
Door No. 2 ( less expensive ) : Sofa , NFL package , HD , fantasy scores online , remote control toggling , gambling , access to scores , seven straight hours of football , cell phone calls , beer and food in fridge , no traffic .
I can see going through Door No. 1 once a year just to remind yourself that going to an NFL game sucks .
But eight times a year ?
Unless you had good seats , or unless this was your only excuse to get out of your house and get plastered , why would you ?
It 's a blue - collar sport with white - collar ticket prices .
This blackout trend would have happened whether the economy was suffering or not .
Prediction No. VII : I have a rare talent for sniffing out the Bandwagon Sleeper That 's Not Actually a Sleeper .
But sniffing it out nine months before Week 1 ?
Impressive even for me .
In December , I wrote that " the Texans are headed for a respectable 9 - 7 finish , followed by seven months of building excitement about 2009 , then an onslaught of ' I 'll tell ya who I like as a sleeper -- the Texans ! ' media picks ... and they 'll immediately crumble under the weight of those expectations and finish 5 - 11 next season .
It 's rare to find our Winston Wolf Memorial Popsicle Team for the next season when the current season has n't ended yet .
Ca n't remember that happening before . "
( Put it this way : We are right on schedule .
Beware of the Texans .
They stink of popsicle juice . )
Prediction No. VIII : As we all know ( or should know ) , a true sleeper pick can only be a team that : ( A ) flagrantly sucked last season ; and ( B ) generated little buzz heading into this one .
That rules out Houston ( too much buzz ) , Green Bay ( ditto ) , the Jets ( 9 - 7 last season ) and Bucs ( 9 - 7 last season ) .
You have to pick someone from this group : the Bills , Browns , Raiders , Broncos , Chiefs , Lions , Rams , Bengals and Niners .
You need the " Nobody believed in us ! " factor .
You need a team that nailed its April draft and is blessed by a bad division and / or an easy schedule .
You need an easy September for momentum .
You need a franchise with fans who lost hope and will lose their collective crap if anything good happens .
And you need to feel like you want to throw up even as you 're anointing the team your sleeper .
My pick ?
The Broncos .
Nobody believes in them because they lost Shanahan ( 24 - 24 since 2006 ) and Cutler ( 17 - 20 career record ) .
Was that REALLY a disaster ?
They hired the architect of New England 's record - setting 2007 offense ( McDaniels ) and traded for a QB with a 21 - 12 career record as a starter ( Kyle Orton ) .
( I know , I 'm pushing it with the facts .
But those ARE facts . )
They crushed the draft : two first - rounders ( including running back Knowshon Moreno , who could light it up right away ) and five of the top 64 picks .
They play in a division with two awful teams ( Kansas City and Oakland ) .
They easily could start 4 - 0 ( at Cincy , home for Cleveland , at Oakland , home for Dallas ) .
And the city of Denver has lost all hope .
Also , I want to throw up and you are shaking your head right now .
In other words , the Broncos fit the bill .
Ten and six , I say .
Prediction IX : I 'd love to see the McNabb - Vick experiment mirror the " American Idol " Paula Abdul - Kara DioGuardi experiment , with everyone playing nice and saying the right things for a couple of months -- as fans of the show start picking sides -- and then McNabb slowly wearing down , looking over his shoulder , losing his confidence and eventually announcing on Twitter that he is leaving the Eagles .
But it 's not realistic .
See , Vick spent too much time in the joint .
The food stinks in the joint .
You sleep terribly in the joint .
You can't condition properly in the joint .
You age in dog years in the joint .
Remember what happened to Jamal Lewis ?
Vick spent three times as long in the joint .
If he ever gets " it " back , it wo n't be until 2010 .
Prediction X : The six best teams this season will be New England , Pittsburgh , San Diego , Green Bay , the Giants ... and New Orleans .
( That 's right , New Orleans .
You heard me . )
The other six playoff teams will be Indianapolis , Seattle , Chicago , Baltimore , Denver and Washington .
In the Super Bowl , Green Bay will defeat Pittsburgh to cap off the first Eff You season devoted to a specific player .
That player would be you , Brett Favre .
And on that note , it 's time for my Week 1 picks .
FYI : Three new wrinkles this season .
First , we 're incorporating something called " The Miller Lite Great Call of the Week . "
Second , I 'm picking an underdog that 's +200 or more to win outright every week in the " We Could n't Get This Sponsored Underdog Lock of the Week . "
And third , I will be operating under the house rule of " home - field advantage is basically dead , so when in doubt , take the road team . "
Got it ?
Got it .
Home teams in caps
STEELERS ( - 6 ) over Titans
It 's too bad we can't parlay things like " there 's no way Kerry Collins is having that year again " with " there 's no way Kurt Warner is having that year again . "
Broncos ( +4 ) over BENGALS
This line shifted seven points in Cincy 's favor since it opened in Vegas this past spring ... and if that 's not enough , Gus Johnson is announcing the game .
You know what that means .
In other news , it 's time for Abe Lincoln and Stephen Douglas to make room for Chad Ochocinco and Skip Bayless , who made history by having an actual " why I hate you / why you should n't hate me " debate on ESPN 's " First Take . "
The good news :
At least we finally have an explanation for the girl who cries blood .
Jets ( + 4.5 ) over TEXANS
The Jets ' defense is frisky enough to make this my " We Could n't Get This Sponsored Underdog Lock of the Week " : Jets 16 , Texans 13 .
You 're damn right I just took Mark Sanchez on the road .
Let 's turn it over to the guys from Generic Studio Analyst Theater :
Generic Studio Analyst 1 : " Lemme tell you something right now .
The New York Jets do n't need Mark Sanchez to win football games for them .
They need him to manage the game .
That 's it .
Manage the game .
Generic Studio Analyst 2 : " That 's exactly right .
And if Mark Sanchez is put in a position where he has to WIN games for this football team ?
The New York Jets will NOT go very far in the National Football League .
At least this season , guys .
They will NOT go very far in the National Football League .
Generic Studio Analyst 3 : " They might go far in the draft though ! "
( Everyone laughs uproariously . )
Vikings ( - 4 ) over BROWNS
When Eric Mangini took over the Browns , he banned cell phones and music in the locker room , made players run laps after mistakes and made a stink about running a tight ship .
My question is this :
When you 're taking over for Romeo Crennel , do you really need to do anything dramatic to get the attention of your players ?
What about calling a team meeting and just saying , " Hi , I 'm Eric Mangini .
I 'm your new coach .
You 'll be happy to know I have a pulse . "
Lions ( +13 ) over SAINTS
Good God , it 's hailing fantasy points !!!
They 're hitting us in the head like pieces of ice !
Run !
Run for your life !
Jaguars ( +7 ) over COLTS
Jags dominate time of possession , Colts win but do n't cover , Indy crowd seems bored most of the time .
We 've been here before .
By the way , did you see NBC hired Tony Dungy as a studio analyst ?
At first I was confused , but when you remember that he 'll never yuk it up or say outlandish things just to say them , I mean ... maybe this will be a nice change of pace for a studio show .
Or , it will lead to a lot of nodding and maybe even a halftime prayer group .
Either way , it will be different .
If Tiki Barber was still alive , I think he would have enjoyed being involved .
RAVENS ( - 13 ) over Chiefs
Cowboys ( - 6 ) over BUCS
PATS ( - 10.5 ) over Bills
In Week 1 , you always go against a team that fired its offensive coordinator within the past 10 days .
It 's just the rule .
Eagles ( - 2 ) over PANTHERS
Early Wednesday afternoon , I was working when my cell phone rang .
It was my daughter 's preschool .
They never call me unless something bad happened .
Forty - five horrible things raced through my mind in 1.7 seconds .
She was kidnapped .
She fell off the monkey bars .
Another kid blinded her with a Lego .
I answered the phone with a giant pit in my stomach .
Turned out she was just sick and threw up in class .
Phew .
What does that have to do with the Panthers ?
Every big moment with Jake Delhomme is like that random preschool phone call for Panthers fans .
They see him in the caller ID and think , " Uh-oh ... . "
If they get out of it with a simple puking in class , they will take it .
Anything better is a bonus .
I would not have brought him back .
Redskins ( +6.5 ) over GIANTS
Bernard Pollard : waived .
David Tyree : waived .
Did this make me feel even remotely better ?
No .
SEAHAWKS ( - 8.5 ) over Rams
I hate the NFC West .
Enough already .
PACKERS ( - 3.5 ) over Bears
Chicago fans have been wondering why I dumped them and adopted the Packers as my NFC North team and Super Bowl pick du jour .
It came down to one thing : I did n't want to root for Jay Cutler .
Has he had a likable moment yet ?
This year will be his coming - out party as the most despised player in football .
Every time they show him on the sidelines , he looks like a pissed - off trust - fund kid who can't believe the valet scratched his Escalade hybrid .
And you know what ?
He makes the league more fun .
I like rooting against him the same way I liked rooting against Rick Barry , Bill Laimbeer and the Iron Sheik .
We need more Jay Cutlers in sports .
Not everyone was meant to be liked .
Dolphins ( +4 ) over FALCONS
It 's the Which One Of Us Was a Bigger 2008 Fluke Bowl !
I vote for Atlanta .
Chargers ( - 9 ) over RAIDERS
OK , so the Seymour trade spawned " Should Al Davis be allowed to trade anymore ? " and " Even if you 're a lifelong Raiders fan , is it OK to just break up with the Raiders and pick another team ? " conversations .
Let 's take them one at a time .
" Even if you 're a lifelong Raiders fan , is it OK to just break up with the Raiders and pick another team ? "
I covered this dilemma in a 2002 column ( scroll down to No. 19 ) .
Yes , if the owner has treated you THAT badly , you can either pick another team or choose to become an NFL widow until he dies .
Since Al Davis ' mom lived to 103 , I would strongly suggest the " pick a new team " choice .
" Should Al Davis be allowed to trade anymore ? "
For comedy 's sake ?
Yes .
For the Patriots ' sake ?
Yes .
For the competitiveness of the league ?
No .
In the past two years , the Patriots have turned Richard Seymour , a No. 4 and a No. 2 into Randy Moss , Derrick Burgess and a 2011 No. 1 pick thanks to Al ... and even I do n't think Al should be allowed to trade or sign players .
It 's just wrong .
There is a professional sports precedent : Former Cavs owner Ted Stepien made so many awful trades that David Stern created " The Stepien Rule , " which prevented teams from trading No. 1s in consecutive years .
Well , Al Davis is " Dead Stepien . "
So something needs to happen .
Soon .
For the love of God .

MUCH has been made of the precipitous decline of America 's newspapers .
According to one much - cited calculation , the country 's last printed newspaper will land on a doorstep sometime in the first quarter of 2043 .
That is a positively healthy outlook , however , compared with another staple of American life : the home telephone .
Telecoms operators are seeing customers abandon landlines at a rate of 700,000 per month .
Some analysts now estimate that 25 % of households in America rely entirely on mobile phones ( or cellphones , as Americans call them ) — a share that could double within the next three years .
If the decline of the landline continues at its current rate , the last cord will be cut sometime in 2025 .
The impact of this trend will be greater than most people realise .
It will make life increasingly difficult for telecoms firms , naturally .
But it will also hurt all business that require landlines , as bills rise and business models are disrupted .
No less seriously , the withering fixed - line network threatens the work of the emergency services , such as the police and fire brigade .
The decline in landline use , which has been under way for several years , has picked up speed in recent months .
In the first half of 2005 only 7.3 % of households were mobile - only , according to America 's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , which collects such data because it uses landlines for health surveys .
By the end of last year the proportion had reached 20.2 % — increasing by 2.7 percentage points in the second half of last year alone , the biggest - ever increase ( see chart ) .
The recession has accelerated cord-cutting , explains Stéphane Téral , an analyst at Infonetics Research , since people want to save money and are readier to sacrifice their landlines than their mobiles .
But the problem is particularly acute in America because of the vastness of the country , which makes fixed - line networks expensive to run or improve .
That , along with upheaval in the telecoms industry in recent years , has made internet access over landlines in America annoyingly slow , even in the cities , leaving landlines much more dispensable than they are in Europe .
All this would not matter much , were it not for the fact that many businesses depend on landlines .
First to suffer are telemarketers , though they cannot expect much sympathy .
Mobile numbers are harder to get hold of , and in most cases it is also against the law for telemarketers to call them ( although many still do ) , since mobile users in America are charged for receiving calls as well as making them .
The growing ranks of people who only use mobiles are also causing trouble for polling firms .
Most pollsters ignored them until early last year .
But then the Pew Research Centre for the People and the Press , an outfit that studies public opinion , demonstrated that by shunning “ cellphone - onlys ” ( CPOs ) , pollsters would understate Barack Obama 's margin over John McCain in the presidential election by two to three percentage points .
CPOs are twice as expensive to reach , not least because outfits like Pew offer payments to those surveyed by mobile phone to compensate for the associated call charges .
Worse , pollsters do not know much about them .
They are typically in their early 30s , earn less than $ 50,000 annually , are unmarried and move more often than the norm .
But even controlling for these factors , they still had distinctive voting preferences , says Brian Schaffner , a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst .
According to his calculations , 49 % of landline respondents leant towards Mr Obama in June 2008 , but the figure was 65 % among CPOs .
Perhaps , he speculates , CPOs are “ more willing to venture into something new ” .
And then there are the telecoms operators themselves .
Surprisingly , the industry 's heavyweights do not seem to be too worried about losing landlines , whether to mobile operators or cable companies , which now have 20 % of the landline market .
Their spokesmen argue that they have seen the trend coming and have invested in new businesses .
Verizon , for instance , serves nearly 20 m landline customers in America 's north - east , but is also the country 's biggest mobile operator with 87.7 m subscribers and is investing billions in a new fibre - optic network which reaches 2.5 m homes .
Verizon has sold bits of its landline businesses in three states and is negotiating to do the same elsewhere .
Nonetheless Verizon and AT&T , its main competitor , are still mostly “ wireline ” , says Craig Moffett , an analyst with Bernstein Research .
According to his calculations , both firms ' landline businesses generate more than 50 % of revenues , and an even higher share of costs .
The two firms and Qwest , America 's third - biggest landline operator , have already shed thousands of jobs and announced further lay - offs to cut costs .
But the accelerating loss of landlines will put increasing pressure on profit margins , argues Mr Moffett , as the high fixed cost of running the network is spread over an ever smaller number of customers .
It is also likely to lead to higher bills for captive customers such as businesses with switchboards , which cannot do away with their landlines so easily .
Even if Verizon and AT&T can overcome their “ wireline problem ” , says Mr Moffett , it will not go away .
Most telecoms operators do not have a mobile business to fall back on .
Fairpoint , a firm which took over some of Verizon 's landline business , is struggling .
Hawaiian Telcom filed for bankruptcy in December , not least because it was losing landline customers at a rapid clip .
Such a fate raises the question of what will happen to the industry 's huge unfunded pension liabilities .
Taken together , the future obligations of AT&T and Verizon are as big as those of General Motors before its recent bankruptcy .
Regulators will not just have to decide whether to subsidise or bail out landline firms .
They will also have to make sure that public goods delivered via the old telephone network continue to be provided .
The call - tracing software used by firefighters , ambulance services and many other “ first responders ” only works on landlines .
And the government - imposed cross-subsidy scheme to ensure that anyone who wants a telephone line can have one is primarily geared towards landlines .
As the number of lines goes down , the subsidy required to provide lines to remote locations and poor customers will have to rise .
The danger , says Mr Moffett , is that regulators will introduce new taxes on wireless and broadband services .
Revenues from new services would then be used to keep an obsolete infrastructure alive — a recipe for lower growth .
At that point , he says , the “ wireline problem ” really will be everyone 's problem .
The drag queen singer known as “ Big Mama Capretta ” has outed himself as a practicing gay Catholic priest from Colomnbus , Ohio .
Vincent Capretta , known to his flock has “ Father Anthony ” said in a statement that “ It ’s Big Mama , y’all !
And I am no longer afraid to come out of the closet as a gay Catholic priest !
I am enjoying my life being who I am and who God intended me to be !
Now let ’s dance , y’all ! ”
Big Mama may not be a household name yet , but he / she currently has the number 25 spot on the U.S. Billboard Club Play dance chart .
Here ’s Big Mama ’s latest song .

America is effortlessly spending " colossal " amounts of money to assemble a robot army , said Fidel Castro in Cuba 's Granma , so it can work toward " domination over the rest of the world , " while President Obama is " sweating blood " to pass a " simple bill " to expand health insurance to tens of millions of poor people .
" What hope can that society offer the world ? "
And why stop with " robots in the hands of the transnationals " replacing America ’s " imperial soldiers in wars of conquest , " or inundating the workplace with robots who will displace millions of workers ?
If scientists can " design robots capable of governing , " they will no doubt do a better job than the current U.S. government , and " do it better and more cheaply . "

Abstract
This document describes HTCPCP , a protocol for controlling , monitoring , and diagnosing coffee pots .
1 . Rationale and Scope COKE ] .
One of the first remotely _operated_ machine to be hooked up to the Internet , the Internet Toaster , ( controlled via SNMP ) was debuted in 1990 [ RFC2235 ] .
The demand for ubiquitous appliance connectivity that is causing the consumption of the IP v4 address space .
Consumers want remote control of devices such as coffee pots so that they may wake up to freshly brewed coffee , or cause coffee to be prepared at a precise time after the completion of dinner preparations .

The web is world - wide .
HTCPCP is based on HTTP .
This is because HTTP is everywhere .
It could not be so pervasive without being good .
Therefore , HTTP is good .
If you want good coffee , HTCPCP needs to be good .
To make HTCPCP good , it is good to base HTCPCP on HTTP .
Future versions of this protocol may include extensions for espresso machines and similar devices .

The " safe " response header field .
SAFE ] defines a HTTP response header field , " Safe " , which can be used to indicate that repeating a HTTP request is safe .
The inclusion of a " Safe : Yes " header field allows a client to repeat a previous request if the result of the request might be repeated .
The actual safety of devices for brewing coffee varies widely , and may depend , in fact , on conditions in the client rather than just in the server .
Thus , this protocol includes an extension to the " Safe " response header : Safe = " Safe " " : " safe - nature safe - nature = " yes " | " no " | conditionally - safe conditionally - safe = " if - " safe - condition safe - condition = " user - awake " | token indication will allow user agents to handle retries of some safe requests , in particular safe POST requests , in a more user - friendly way .

The traditional technique [ CAM ] was to attach a frame - grabber to a video camera , and feed the images to a web server .

However , being highly dedicated and hard - working academics , we got through a lot of coffee , and when a fresh pot was brewed , it often did n't last long .
This service was created as the first application to use a new RPC mechanism designed in the Cambridge Computer Laboratory - MSRPC2 .

WASHINGTON – Liberal Democrats failed Tuesday to inject a government - run insurance option into sweeping health care legislation taking shape in the Senate Finance Committee , despite widespread accusations that private insurers routinely deny coverage in pursuit of higher profits .
The 15 - 8 rejection marked a victory for Sen. Max Baucus , D - Mont. , the committee chairman , who is hoping to push his middle - of - the - road measure through the panel by week ’s end .
It also kept alive the possibility that at least one Republican may yet swing behind the bill , a key goal of both Baucus and the White House .

( Notes Firedoglake : All ten Republicans on the committee voted against the amendment .
Five Democrats ( Kent Conrad , Max Baucus , Blanche Lincoln , Bill Nelson , Thomas Carper ) also voted against the amendment .
Eight Democrats ( Jay Rockefeller , Jeff Bingaman , John Kerry , Ron Wyden , Charles Schumer , Debbie Stabenow , Maria Cantwell , Robert Menendez ) vote in support of Rockefeller ’s amendments . )
“ My job is to put together a bill that gets to 60 votes ” in the full Senate , the Montana Democrat said shortly before he joined a majority on the committee in opposing the provision .
“ No one shows me how to get to 60 votes with a public option , ” the term used to describe a new government role in health care .
It takes 60 votes to overcome delaying actions that Republicans may attempt on the Senate floor .
The maneuvering occurred as the committee plunged into a second week of public debate on legislation that generally adheres to conditions that President Barack Obama has called for .
The bill includes numerous new consumer protections , including a ban on companies denying insurance on the basis of pre-existing conditions .
At the same time it provides government subsidies to help lower - income Americans afford insurance that is currently beyond their means .
It also includes steps that supporters say will begin to slow the rate of growth in health care costs nationwide .
After weeks of delay , both the House and Senate appear on track to vote on different versions of health care legislation in October .
Passage in both houses would set the stage for a compromise to be passed deeper into the fall .

THE great cities of Russia are still strange to Baimurat Allaberiyev , who as a younger man herded sheep in his native Tajikistan for a salary of one lamb per month .
Two years after moving here , he still wonders aloud where the apples in the market come from , since he can not see apple trees anywhere .
For this reason , his manager has assigned an assistant , 22 - year - old Natalya Glazova , to look after Mr. Allaberiyev as he pursues his career in show business .
Ms. Glazova quickly developed a fondness for the new client , and her heart flipped over with pity when on their first meeting , she realized that the things he was carrying  a change of clothes in a nylon sports bag  were everything he owned .
The rise of Mr. Allaberiyev , widely known as Tajik Jimmy , a migrant worker in a provincial Russian stockroom who delivers astonishing renditions of Bollywood musical numbers , is one more testament to the strange power of the Internet .
A little more than a year after one of his performances was filmed by a co-worker with a cellphone and posted online , Mr. Allaberiyev cannot walk through a crowd in the Russian capital without being stopped by fans .
This is especially remarkable given the place that Central Asian migrants occupy in Russian society : members of a vast and nearly invisible work force , targets of derision and occasional violence .
This summer , Mr. Allaberiyev quit his job loading boxes and decided to move to St. Petersburg to pursue fame .
The transition has not been entirely smooth ; after one of his first bookings , at a hip Moscow nightclub , he was so desperate for a place to stay that he asked journalists if they could take him home for the night .
During an interview with The New York Times he asked for money to replace three teeth that were knocked out in April , when he was attacked by thugs on his way home from work .
It 's a very simple plan .
Here it is .
The Republican health care plan for America : Do n't get sick .
That 's right , do n't get sick .
If you have insurance , do n't get sick .
If you do n't have insurance , do n't get sick .
If you 're sick , do n't get sick .
... but it 's not quite a foolproof plan so the backup plan in case you do get sick
If you get sick America , the Republican health care plan is this : die quickly .
That 's right .
The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick .
Naturally Republicans like the noxious Marsha Blackburn ( R - TN ) took exception to these type of tactics being employed against Republicans , the same over - the - top kind of stuff they employ on a daily basis , calling on Grayson to apologize .
Unlike many other Democrats he has not .
Good for him .
UPDATE : The wingnuts are furious at Grayson for these remarks , and are already ginning up a campaign to target him for electoral defeat .
Patrick McHenry tweets : " Will Pelosi hold vote to reprimand # Grayson ? "
UPDATE :
Alan Grayson is also part of Blue America 's " No Means No ! Afghanistan project ao please --- throw him some jack .
UPDATE II
Leibovitz is also being sued for $ 24 m by an art financing company Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz is being sued by an Italian photographer who says she used his pictures without permission .
Paolo Pizzetti claims
Ms Leibovitz used photos he took in Venice and Rome , and passed them off as her own in a 2009 calendar for a coffee company .
He is seeking a court order to stop the images from being used and $ 300,000 ( £ 183,000 ) for copyright infringement .
A spokesperson for Ms Leibovitz declined to comment .
According to legal papers filed at a New York federal court , Mr Pizzetti said Ms Leibovitz , 59 , hired him to scout locations in Italy for an advertising campaign for Lavazza coffee in April 2008 .
He said he photographed the Trevi Fountain in Rome and the Piazza San Marco in Venice as well as other images which he sent to her digitally , but was later informed Ms Leibovitz would not be travelling to Italy for the photo shoot .
' Same bird '
Mr Pizzetti said that in October , when the calendar was released , he noticed two of his photographs had been used , with models superimposed on it .
A comparison of the Piazza San Marco photo shows " the same wet weather conditions , cloud formation and the same bird in the upper left portion of the photograph , " Mr Pizzetti said in the complaint .
Leibovitz is in danger of losing her New York homes if she fails to pay the loan " It is clear that the Leibovitz defendants copied the Piazza work authored by Pizzetti and edited it , " he said .
He added that Ms Leibovitz at no point told him she planned on using his photographs in the calendar , nor requested his permission to do so .
Mr Pizzetti is also seeking other unspecified damages as well as requesting the photographs to be destroyed .
The legal case is the latest to hit Ms Leibovitz , who is also currently being sued for defaulting on a $ 24 m ( £ 14.6 m ) loan secured against the rights to her entire collection .
If she does not pay back the loan to the Art Capital Group by 8 September , she is in danger of losing the copyright to the thousands of her negatives it has in storage , as well as her three properties in New York .

NoSQL A Relational Database Management System NoSQL is a fast , portable , relational database management system without arbitrary limits , ( other than memory and processor speed ) that runs under , and interacts with , the UNIX1 Operating System .
It uses the " Operator - Stream Paradigm " described in " Unix Review " , March , 1991 , page 24 , entitled " A 4GL Language " .
There are a number of " operators " that each perform a unique function on the data .
The " stream " is supplied by the UNIX Input / Output redirection mechanism .
Therefore each operator processes some data and then passes it along to the next operator via the UNIX pipe function .
This is very efficient as UNIX pipes are implemented in memory .
NoSQL is compliant with the " Relational Model " .
What is NoSQL NoSQL , which I personally like to pronounce as noseequel2 , is a derivative of the RDB database system .
The latter was developed at RAND Organization by Walter W. Hobbs .
The few Perl scripts included with NoSQL are still very close to the original RDB ones , so a good share of the credit for them goes to the original author .
Other major contributors to the original RDB system , besides Walter Hobbs , are : Chuck Bush
Don Emerson
Judy Lender
Roy Gates
Rae Starr People who helped with turning RDB into NoSQL : Vincenzo ( Vicky ) Belloli
David Frey
Giuseppe Paternò
Maurizio ( Masar ) Sartori
Paul Lussier

The NoSQL logo was kindly provided by Kyle Hart .
As its name implies , NoSQL is not an SQL database but rather a shell - level tool , as explained in Philosophy of NoSQL .
NoSQL data is contained in regular UNIX ASCII files , and so can be manipulated by regular UNIX utilities , e.g. ls , wc , mv , cp , cat , head , more , less , editors like ' vi , ' etc. , as well as by powerful versioning systems , such as RCS and CVS .
The form of each file of data is that of a relation , or table , with rows and columns of information .
To extract information , a file of data is fed to one or more " operators " via the UNIX Input / Output redirection mechanism .
There are also programs to generate , modify , and validate the data .
A more thorough discussion of why this type of relational database structure makes sense is found in the book , " UNIX Relational Database Management " , in the " References " section below .
It is assumed that the reader has at least a basic familiarity with the UNIX Operating System , including knowledge of Input / Output redirection ( e.g. , STDIN , STDOUT , pipes ) .
NoSQL tends to be biased in favor of Linux .
This means that , wherever it matters , NoSQL makes use of the GNU version of the various UNIX commands , as those are the ones normally found on Linux .
NoSQL is Free Software , released under the terms of the GNU General Public License .
As such , it fully qualifies also as Open Source Software .
What NoSQL is not NoSQL has been around since 1998 and it has nothing to do with the newborn NoSQL Movement , which has been receiving much hype lately .
While the former is a well - defined software package , is a relational database to all effects and just it intentionally does not use SQL as a query language , the newcomer is mostly a concept ( and by no means a novel one either ) , which departs from the relational model altogether and it should therefore have been called more appropriately " NoREL " , or something to that effect , since its not being SQL - based is just an obvious consequence of not being relational , and not the other way around .
How to get NoSQL NoSQL can be freely downloaded from this link .
Make sure you get also any patches to the base code , for the version that you download .
Versions of NoSQL from 4.1.0 to 4.1.6 depend on the Shell - Ware Utilities ( SWU ) package , which can be downloaded from http://www.strozzi.it/shared/swu/ .
Since only a small portion of SWU is actually required for NoSQL to work , starting from version 4.1.7
I have removed such dependency by including a minimal , stripped - down version of SWU with NoSQL itself .
If you have already installed the full - blown SWU , NoSQL will use that one instead .
Support
There is a mailing list for discussions related to NoSQL .
The address is noseequel@strozzi.it .
To subscribe simply send a message to noseequel-request@strozzi.it with the phrase " subscribe noseequel " ( without the quotes ) in the subject of the message .
Please send bug reports ( fixes are most welcome ) to the same list noseequel@strozzi.it .
Always include as much information as possible , especially the content of file nosql.version , which is created in the NoSQL installation directory during install .
By " bug reports " I mean not just errors in the code , but also grammatical mistakes , typos , and bad English constructions in the documentation , as English is n't my native language .

An alternative pronunciation is no-squeal , proposed by Cosmo Freund Lee , who writes : " I agree with the philosophy followed by NoSQL .
I do n't like having to loose the power of Unix and being cornered into the limitations of SQL .

I pronounce SQL as squeal , because when I 'm forced into the confines of this limited , single - purpose language , I want to squeal like a tied - up pig ! "

Stormy Daniels , an adult film star with designs on running for Louisiana Senator next year , was arrested Saturday on misdemeanor battery charges in Tampa , Florida , and now , RadarOnline.com can show you her mug shot and you can read the official police report .

Daniels ’ husband , Michael Mosny , said she threw a potted plant in his direction and hit him in the head because she was upset with his laundry - washing skills and found some unpaid bills .
The adult film star — who was nominated for an AVN ( the equivalent of the “ Porn Oscars ” ) award three years ago for her riveting work in the film , Space Nuts — reportedly lied about the reason she cancelled the appearance , claiming a minor car accident prevented her from showing up .
Suffering spouses , fits of rage and BS cover stories ?
She sounds like a natural for politics already !
Yesterday , I posted my initial impressions of “ Baucus / Gang of Six ” version of the Health Care Reform Bill .
It appears … that my impressions were shared by others :
- Almost nobody seems to think that a plan that forces people to buy policies from private insurers is a better alternative to offering people the choice of not buying insurance , buying private insurance , or buying a new public insurance plan .
- Almost nobody seems to think that a plan that helps the poor buy insurance … but then fines them if they still ca n’t afford it , is a very good idea .
- Almost nobody seems to think that “ co-ops ” are really a solution to ANYTHING , much less a way to provide “ competition ” against the private insurers .
Of course , RNC chair Michael Steele agrees … but for the wrong reason : he thinks that co-ops are some sort of “ back door ” to creating a public option .
This theory , besides utilizing the worn out “ slippery slope ” fallacy , has absolutely no merit , and only displays that Steele ( like most people ) has no idea what a co-op really is .
Here it folks … and it ’s not very complicated : a co-op is just a large group of people joining together , so that they can go to the insurance companies and say , “ Hey , we ’ve got a WHOLE bunch of potential customers for you …how about giving us a nice , bulk discount ? “
That ’s it .
It does n’t provide ANY competition for private insurers and has NO resemblance to a “ government - run insurance program . “
NONE .
- Almost nobody seems to think that paying for the plan with a 13 % tax taken directly out of the paychecks of middle - class Americans is good way to make the bill “ deficit neutral . ”
In fact …what should give us pause , is the few people who are actually in favor of this plan :
- INVESTORS : Upon news that there was a new bill that would FORCE everyone to buy private health insurance , while doing little to curtail the unethical practices that private insurers use to raise profits ( examples here and here ) … health insurance stocks SOARED .
Think Progress reports : “ Following Baucus ’ announcement , HealthNet shares increased by 3 % , United Health Group Inc shares rose by 2.7 % , Humana Inc. grew by 2.6 % , Wellpoint stock gained 1.7 % and Aetna Inc rose 1.6 % . “
- HEALTH CARE LOBBYISTS :
It ’s amazing what putting a few million dollars in the pockets of the right Republican and Democratic senators ( especially the ones sitting on the Senate Finance Committee ) can do for your industry ’s bottom line .
Teddy Partridge at Campaign Silo sums it all up nicely : “ Health insurance executives who have poured money into the campaign coffers of Blue Dogs , Max Baucus , Chuck Grassley , Kent Conrad , Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins ( as well as their political action committees ) likely made all their money back in the one day rise in stock prices .
The companies themselves , which hold huge amounts of their own stock , surely recouped all of their PAC investments on Tuesday alone . ”
- HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES :
Time for a kegger … stocks are up , the bill would force millions of new people to become their customers , and all they have to do is accept people with pre-existing conditions .
All that ’s left is to kill is the excise tax on their most expensive policies for the wealthiest Americans , and the proposed fees the bill would force them to pay .
But even if they ca n’t get out of these taxes / fees , it ’s no big deal … they ’ve already said they ’ll just pass these costs onto all their customers ( it ’s not like they ’re going to pay them out of their profits ! ) .
Of course , the media is n’t helping Americans to realize how truly ridiculous this bill is …CNN , AP , and others published news items shortly after the bill ’s release that claimed the bill represented the “ majority of what Obama wanted . “
Why did they print this ?
Just because Senator Baucus SAID the bill was the majority of what Obama asked for .
In truth , the bill is everything the Republicans and the Health Care industry asked for …and almost NOTHING that Obama and the Democrats insisted was necessary .
Almost ridiculously , the bill features the GOP ’s two biggest talking points ( no policies for illegals , no federal money for abortions ) when these issues are ALREADY addressed in our laws , and no further mention is necessary unless the bill included a public option … which it DOES NOT .
I ’ll leave you today with three items for your entertainment and personal edification .
The first is a link to Matt Taibbi ’s excellent article , “ Sick and Wrong , ” from the last issue of Rolling Stone .
In his usual , inimitable style , Taibbi outlines how truly AWFUL our current system is …and why our elected officials may be the absolutely wrong people to count on in terms of fixing it , unless American citizens REALLY put the pressure on them .
The second item , is an article from this month ’s Newsweek titled , “ No Country For Sick Men . ”
It should upset us …that we are the ONLY industrialized , democratic nation that does not openly propose that ALL of our citizens have a right to health care .
It should upset us …that we are the ONLY industrialized , democratic nation that has “ medical bankruptcies ” and that these make up 68 % of our total bankruptcies .
It should upset us …that we are the ONLY industrialized , democratic nation that allows tens of thousands of people to die each year because they do n’t have access to health care .
The author , in examining our system and those of others clearly asks : what exactly do these facts say about us AS A PEOPLE AND A NATION ?
And lastly , Rachel Maddow discusses the Senate Health Care bill with…yes , the bill itself :
In a week in which the Vatican made its peace with that dangerous consorter with witches Harry Potter , the Holy See has also revealed an unexpected soft spot for Oscar Wilde .
Earlier this week the Vatican 's official newspaper L'Osservatore Romano , which had previously described JK Rowling 's books as presenting a " vision of the world and the human being full of deep mistakes and dangerous suggestions " , praised the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince for making it clear that good must overcome evil " and that sometimes this requires costs and sacrifice " .
Despite the Catholic Church 's condemnation of practising homosexuality , the newspaper has now run a glowing review of a new book about the famously doomed lover of Lord Alfred Douglas .
Wilde was " one of the personalities of the 19th century who most lucidly analysed the modern world in its disturbing as well as its positive aspects " , wrote author Andrea Monda in a piece about Italian author Paolo Gulisano 's The Portrait of Oscar Wilde .
In an article headlined " When Oscar Wilde met Pius IX " , Monda wrote that Wilde was not " just a non-conformist who loved to shock the conservative society of Victorian England " ; rather he was " a man who behind a mask of amorality asked himself what was just and what was mistaken , what was true and what was false " .
" Wilde was a man of great , intense feelings , who behind the lightness of his writing , behind a mask of frivolity or cynicism , hid a deep knowledge of the mysterious value of life , " he said .
The Holy See started its unlikely love affair with the Irish playwright and author two years ago when it published a collection of his quips in the book Provocations : Aphorisms for an Anti-conformist Christianity .
Wilde 's famous comments " I can resist everything except temptation " , and " the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it " were included in the book , edited by Father Leonardo Sapienza .
Wilde was baptised into the Catholic Church shortly before he died .
L'Osservatore Romano said that the " existential path " which the author trod " can also be seen as a long and difficult path toward that Promised Land which gives us the reason for existence , a path which led him to his conversion to Catholicism , a religion which , as he remarked in one of his more acute and paradoxical aphorisms , was ' for saints and sinners alone – for respectable people , the Anglican Church will do ' .

US President Barack Obama has warned bankers against complacency , saying that some in the industry are ignoring the lessons of the financial crisis .
" We will not go back to the days of reckless behaviour and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis , " he said .
He called on Wall Street to support " the most ambitious overhaul of the financial system since the Great Depression " .
The financial system was returning to normal but had not recovered , he added .
" There are some in the financial industry who are misreading this moment , " said President Obama in a speech to mark one year since the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank .
" Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering , they are choosing to ignore them .
They do so not just at their own peril , but at our nation's . "
OBAMA'S AUTUMN CHALLENGE
Financial regulation : Mr Obama wants to tighten the rules governing the banking system , but his reforms could face opposition on Wall Street , and when bankers complain , lawmakers listen .
Healthcare : Will enough senators vote through Mr Obama 's ambitious health bill - and will it include a publicly - run insurance scheme ?
Climate change : A bill establishing a " cap- and - trade " scheme for carbon emissions has passed through the House of Representatives , but senators from coal - producing states threaten to derail its passage through the upper chamber .
Obama 's Congress battles
Is financial overhaul necessary ?
He told Wall Street that it could not resume taking risks without regard for consequences and said they should not expect US taxpayers to bail them out again .
The speech came as UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that he was " appalled " that some financial firms had been continuing or even extending their bonus culture .
In a BBC interview , Mr Brown said he was determined that world leaders meeting in Pittsburgh next week would " complete the unfinished business " of cleaning up banks - including establishing rules on bonuses .
New powers
President Obama said his administration was working on an " ambitious " overhaul of the regulatory system .
Under the proposed regulation , the White House would give the central bank , the Federal Reserve , new powers over huge financial firms and the ability to seize banks whose collapse could threaten the economy .
He also wants a new watchdog , the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , to oversee products such as mortgages , car loans and credit cards .
The Federal Trade Commission would also be given new powers to protect consumers .
" It is incumbent on us to put in place those reforms that will prevent this crisis from ever happening again , " President Obama said .
The proposals have faced opposition from the banking industry and been tied up in Congress , which has been bogged down with the administration 's healthcare reform proposals .
Storms breaking
Mr Obama said that his recovery was bearing fruit and had " prevented layoffs of tens of thousands of teachers , police officers and other essential public servants " .
" Although I will never be satisfied while people are out of work and our financial system is weakened , we can be confident that the storms of the past two years are beginning to break , " he added .
He denied that his plans to force greater transparency in financial products would lead to a reduction in competition .
He said that in the past competition had been about who could hide the true costs of their products the best by offering teaser rates on credit cards and mortgages .
" By setting ground rules , we 'll increase the kind of competition that actually provides people better and greater choices , as companies compete to offer the best product , not the one that 's most complex or confusing , " he said .
US MEDIA REACTION TO OBAMA'S SPEECH
Robert Reich , writing at the Huffington Post , thinks Mr Obama has waited too long to introduce his reforms .
Robert Wenzel mistrusts Mr Obama 's proposals .
The Washington Post 's Ezra Klein concludes that popular anger has dissipated .
The New Republic 's Noam Scheiber thinks Mr Obama is wise to tackle Wall Street regulation before climate change legislation .
Time 's Justin
Fox is willing to bet that Mr Obama will struggle to get his reforms through congress .
No matter what kind of ride you roll in , you gots to pimp that shiznit … yeah even if it ’s a bicycle .
Do n’t think it can be done ?
Then check these 14 Pimped out Bikes .
Pimp My Ride
Truly inspired by Pimp My Ride , this bike is complete with a tv screen and radio mounted to the handle bars .
The frame is bright blue with painted white flames and the back features purple and white crushed velvet that no pimp can do without .
Couch Bike
There may not be any fancy bling or velvet , but you have to admit that the couch bike is pretty pimp .
Just sit back and find some ladies to pedal you around town while you just chill .
West Side Pimpmobile
There ’s no doubt as to where your alliance falls with the West Side Pimpmobile .
The bold WS lettering on the front and blue and silver details would make you look pretty tough if it were n’t for the fact that you ’re ten .
The Soul Cycle
Two long years and $ 6000 can get you a pretty pimp bicycle — just ask Paul Freedman , the designer of the Soul Cycle .
The bike shows off custom a fiberglass sub woofer and speaker cabinet with controls on the front that let you control your tracks , volume and lighting .
The elaborate bike even includes a passenger seat and a wireless bike so you can ride around with your very own freestylin ’ MC .
Swarovski-Studded Low Rider
You might think a cool paint job and some nice rims will make your bike look hot , but you ’d be quite mistaken .
The Swarovski-Studded Low Rider is the most bling ’d out bicycle ever made with almost 110,000 swarovski crystals covering every inch of the frame and wheels .
Barrio Dreams Custom Low Rider Bike
If a bike had teeth this one ’s would be all gold .
The 24 kt gold plated rims and gold seat contrast the bright blue jewel encrusted frame .
You really have to try to make something this tacky and over the top .
Basszilla
You can pretty much rule out going green with a bike that has to have it ’s own battery — not to make it go , but the power the giant speaker system stuck to it .
The Basszilla features an 8 speaker set up and a DVD touch screen control up front .
This bike takes the idea of spending more on your speaker system than your vehicle to a new low .
Cash Money
It really begs the question if you ’re spending too much on your bike .
The Cash Money Bike features so much money imagery with large green dollar signs and lots of gold accents that would bring a hoe to her knees at the sight of it ( so to speak ) .
Dragon Bike
This giant metal monster just barely fits into the category of bicycle .
As far as we can tell it ’s got 2 wheels and runs off of human power so we think it counts .
We ca n’t imagine how many geeks sacrificed LARP and World of Warcraft time in order to make this , but it seems it was worth the effort to create this bad - ass Dragon Bike .
Motorcycled Inspired Bicycle
At first glance the body and details on this bike makes it look more like a motorcycle than an ordinary bicycle , but looks can be deceiving .
The painted flames and chrome handlebars really add to the illusion , but you ’re not gonna fool anyone with a top speed of 20 mph .
Straight Clowning Low Rider
You can tell from the attention to detail in the Straight Clowning Low Rider that the designer of the bike was dead serious when they built the bike .
The engraved rims with twisted spokes , purple velor banana seat , spotless white tires and detailed airbrush job come together to create one of the most detailed and intricate custom bikes ever made .
Pulse Jet Powered Bike
When you add a pulse jet to your bike , can you really even call it a bike any more ?
Robert Maddux breaks all the rules by sticking a kerosene fueled engine to his bike and topping off at 75 mph .
If you need to get somewhere fast and do n’t need your ear drums any more than this is obviously the best way to travel .
Pimp My Bike
You can almost smell money when you spot this green and gold pimped out bike .
The seat is covered with a matching green zebra print that just oozes pimp juice .
The white sided tires instill imagines of black and white wing tipped shoes the guy who would ride this bike must wear .
Spinning Wheel Lowriders
Just like Riley on the Boondocks , you too can have spinning rims on your bicycle , of course making it seem like it ’s going faster .
We ’ve seen this feature on low - rider cars for years , so why not right ?

I have played one or two of these versions now and they are always fun medals are nice and sometimes can be hard but the top view of this game are great the shop is nice to have and some goo reaction from game play so a nice game indeed , maybe change it up from a midevil style to a more high teck one that might be an idea .
so I really liked this game , it was amusing and had some differant styles of fun added to it so the extra effort does show , and I also like the creativity here it shows how the game plays and plays to the end giving some replay value , I hope to see some changes for the better and even see this get even more popular then it already is , I Enjoyed your presentation and look for more of your work soon .
And once again great job on the effort here .
~~THINGS TO IMPROVE ON ~ ~
maybe change it up from a midevil style to a more high teck one .

How can policymakers be so certain that financial catastrophe wo n’t soon recur when they seemed to have no idea that a crisis would erupt in the first place ?
The answer is not very reassuring , because there is still a risk that the financial crisis is simply hibernating as it slowly morphs into a government debt crisis .

It is with sadness that we report that Pimpie , the administrator of long - standing private BitTorrent tracker PiSEXY , has passed away suddenly after suffering an aneurysm .
Despite the pain felt by his spouse , friends , family and the community , everyone is pulling together .
The site will go on in his memory .
PiSEXY is a fairly compact private tracker with a membership fluctuating between 10,000 and 20,000 members .
Having begun life as ABC Torrents way back in 2003 ( you can see the ABC in their current logo ) , the site now tracks around 10,000 torrents of all varieties and has an enthusiastic userbase .
Last week the community was shocked by the sudden passing away of its founder , Robert – known to his members as Pimpie .
Just 34 years old , Pimpie passed away on August 26th having suffered an aneurysm and will be sorely missed by his spouse , family and friends – both on and offline .
Gozirra , a moderator on the site , told TorrentFreak that PiSexy ’s members are understandably deeply affected by Pimpie ’s passing .
But with great spirit , Leona , Pimpie ’s spouse , has said that she will keep the site going with the help and support of the staff .
“ He planned to live 100 years , ” said Gozirra .
“ His passing on August 26th has devastated those of us who called him ‘ friend ’ .
He was ‘ Teh Man From Amsterdam ’ – he never could spell ‘ the’ : ) ”
Although he did n’t know they would be his last , here are Pimpie ’s parting words with the community ;
“ Every time you think something or someone is stupid , it just means there is another thing in this world you do n’t understand . ”
In memory of Robert , 1975 - 2009
Tuesday night we made what has now become an annual pilgrimage to Chapman Elementary School in NW Portland to witness the spectacle of thousands of tiny birds swirling and diving and peppering the sky before shooting into a giant chimney on top of the school as the sun sets .
Several of our friends , all Vaux ’s Swifts virgins , joined us .
As the crowd gathered on the south lawn we speculated on why the heck these birds would choose a chimney for their roost ( according to the Audubon Society of Portland they ’ve been roosting at Chapman since the late 80s ) , and whether or not they were a native species , and whether or not we were being pooped on as the birds swarmed overhead .
When I got home I googled the shit out of the Vaux ’s Swifts and found some answers .
Vaux ’s Swifts used to roost in the hollows of huge dead old growth trees , but as we all know there are far fewer of these than there used to be .
Chimneys work pretty well .

Vaux ’s Swifts are a native species , unique to western North America .

Since Vaux ’s Swifts forage , drink , court , collect nesting materials and copulate all in flight , I ’m assuming they also poop in flight .

The Portland Audubon Society ‘s Swift Watch is a good place to start learning about the swifts .
And the Vaux ’s Happening site has more information about the swifts throughout the Northwest .
As the swifts gathered and swirled , a small falcon arrived to cull the herd .
He perched atop the chimney all innocently .
Last year we also saw a couple falcons , but I do n’t recall them having any luck on our watch .
This year , however , we saw at least one swift swooped upon and snagged .
Impressive , but thoroughly booed by the crowd !
Eventually , and surprisingly suddenly , the birds collectively decide it ’s time to enter the chimney .
They form a huge swirling , shifting vortex above the chimney and start diving in .
Here ’s a video , filmed by Heather !

Considering their numbers , the denouement does n’t take very long .
The crowd gathers up blankets and departs .
We were treated to a lovely sunset over the West Hills as we prepared to leave .
If you have n’t yet seen the swifts this year , you probably have another week or so before they head further south .
Bring a blanket to spread out on the ground , or one of those short - legged concert chairs .
We ’ll be back next year !

Allies ignored extermination of the Jews , claims Vatican
The Vatican has accused Britain and the U.S. of complicity in the Nazi extermination of Jews .
It claims the Allies deliberately did nothing to either rescue Jews or destroy the death camps .
An article in L'Osservatore Romano , the official Vatican newspaper , says Allied governments knew the Nazis were planning to exterminate the Jews as early as 1942 .
But instead of bombing the concentration camps and the railways supplying them , they reacted by first suppressing eye - witness reports and then claiming they were exaggerated .
Scenes after the liberation of Belsen in April 1945 : The Vatican claims the Allies deliberately did nothing to either rescue Jews or destroy the death camps
Britain opposed offering sanctuary to Jewish refugees , said the article , which will be seen as having the support of the highest Vatican figures .
L'Osservatore Romano draws on the diaries of former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau , who said his country 's officials ' dodged their grim responsibility , procrastinated when concrete rescue schemes were placed before them , and even suppressed information about atrocities ' .
Mr Morgenthau claimed that when the U.S. began to rescue Jews the project met resistance from British officials .
The Foreign Office warned of ' the difficulties of disposing of any considerable number of Jews should they be rescued ' .
Mr Morgenthau called this 'a satanic combination of British chill and diplomatic doubletalk , cold and correct and adding up to a sentence of death ' .
The article will be seen as part of the Vatican 's drive to restore the reputation of the wartime Pope , Pius XII .
The Federal Government has delivered sweeping changes to the regulation of Australian telecommunications , with market incumbent Telstra being asked to structurally separate or have a form of separation imposed upon it by law .
IN BRIEF : REGULATORY REFORMS
Telstra asked to structurally separate or have strict regulation imposed upon it .
Telstra banned from future wireless spectrum auctions should it not separate or sell off its HFC cable network or its interest in Foxtel .
ACCC given new powers to regulate wholesale access to Telstra 's network and hand out competition notices without prior consultation .
Minister Conroy given an exclusive power to change the requirements of the Universal Service Obligation ( USO ) , with a capacity to fine Telstra up to $ 10 million for not meeting such conditions .
ACCC given capacity to issue on - the - spot fines for breaches of ' consumer safeguards ' .
Carrier licenses no longer required for operators with revenue less than $ 25 million per annum .
In legislation due to be debated in parliament within weeks , the Federal Government proposes that Telstra " voluntarily submit to an enforceable undertaking " to structurally separate .
Structural separation would see Telstra split into two distinct wholesale and retail entities .
The Government has developed a plan that will force Telstra to accept this arrangement .
If the company does not structurally separate , the Government will impose a " strong functional separation framework on Telstra . "
Under this arrangement , Telstra would be forced to keep its wholesale and network operations at arms length and provide price equivalence to access seekers .
But more importantly , Telstra would be barred from acquiring additional mobile spectrum for the next generation of wireless broadband while ever the company remains vertically integrated , owns a HFC cable network or an interest in Foxtel .
The mobile spectrum specified by the legislation - anywhere between 520 MHz and 820 MHz or between 2.5 GHz and 2.69 GHz - is commonly viewed as the two sweet spots for future rollouts of LTE ( long term evolution ) services , otherwise known as 4G .
The Government said these requirements - none of which Telstra is likely to accept - will be scrapped should Telstra undertake structural separation .
Senator Conroy , facing questions from the press today , denied the Federal Government was forcing Telstra into a corner .
" We are not actually requiring Telstra to make a choice to structurally separate , " he said .
" It 's a voluntary situation where they get to choose how they want to go forward .
" We are offering them a choice .
If they want to purchase the new spectrum that will be necessary for the future wireless technologies , then they need to divest a number of other platforms . "
New powers for the competition watchdog
The legislation also arms the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with a swathe of new powers around the regulation of the provision of wholesale services , plus the ability to hand out competition notices without prior consultation to affected parties .
The legislation also allows the ACCC to impose on - the - spot fines to any telecommunications carrier found to have not met consumer safeguard standards .
" For years industry has been calling for fundamental and historic micro-economic reform in telecommunications .
Today we are delivering this outcome in Australia 's long term national interest , " Senator Conroy said whilst announcing the reforms .
" The reforms address the structure of the telecommunications market and provide Telstra with the flexibility to choose its future path .
It is the Government 's clear desire for Telstra to structurally separate , on a voluntary and cooperative basis . "
The legislation should be put before the House of Reps and Senate in the October / November session .
If passed , Telstra will be given 90 days to submit to the Government a separation plan - whether it be a structural ( self - imposed ) one or a functional ( Government regulated ) one .
Conroy told journalists today that Telstra would have seen the changes coming .
" I think it would be fair to say Telstra have been preparing for today for a considerable period of time .
I think since the change of leadership at Telstra , they put an enormous amount of work , very constructive work , into being prepared .
So without revealing the extent of the negotiations and discussions , they were very well prepared already when we had our first meeting . "
Conroy defended accusations the Government was out to kill a business it had sold to shareholders , saying that Telstra needed to make a choice in any case .
" The CAN or Copper Access Network is literally collapsing in the ground , " he said .
" Every time there is a flood , every time that there is heavy rain in New South Wales , Northern New South Wales , Queensland , there is a further degradation of some part of Telstra 's copper network .
There 's an enormous maintenance requirement every year to continue to just try and keep it where it 's at . "

Conditional Love : FOREACH Redux
Summary Plowing through some devilish details of template argument deduction , the conditional operator and the macro preprocessor , Eric develops a robust FOR_EACH iterator .
Whether you 're using arrays , strings , or containers , this one does it all .
Plowing through some devilish details of template argument deduction , the conditional operator and the macro preprocessor , Eric develops a robust FOR_EACH iterator .
Whether you 're using arrays , strings , or containers , this one does it all .
My CS201 " Software Development Methods " professor taught that all anyone would ever need to know about C++'s ternary conditional operator ( ? : ) was that it was poorly understood and best avoided .
He was right about one thing : the conditional operator is poorly understood , by me at least .
Ten years later , I 've only begun to appreciate the subtlety and the power of the conditional operator .
But contrary to what my professor would have me believe , it is a unique and indispensable tool .
In fact , the lowly conditional operator is the magic ingredient in BOOST_FOREACH , a macro that makes it simple to loop over STL collections , arrays , null - terminated strings , and iterator ranges , among other things .
In this article , I 'll zoom in on this operator and discover its unique properties .
Using the conditional operator , you will see how to encode the type of an expression without evaluating it and how to detect whether an expression is an lvalue or an rvalue .
Thus armed , I 'll take aim at a very vexing problem : how to write a " safe " macro that does not reevaluate its arguments .
Along the way , I will implement a toy FOREACH macro that allows iteration over any STL container .
This article takes a very close look at a very small part of the language — the conditional operator .
I make occasional reference to the standard , and the analysis gets fairly technical .
Consider yourself warned .
Ugly Macros
In the November 2003 issue of the C/C++ Users ' Journal , Anson Tsao and I published an article entitled " FOREACH and LOCK " in which we described how to bring the functionality of C# 's foreach and lock keywords to C ++.
The FOREACH macro lets you iterate over STL containers with syntax like this :
vector < string > vect_str ( /* ... */ ) ; FOREACH ( string str , vect_str ) { cout << str << '
'; }
Why would you want to do such a thing ?
It is more concise and less error - prone than using iterators directly , certainly , but would n't it be better to use the std :: for_each algorithm ?
It depends .
std:: for_each is a good idea , but in practice it is often a clumsy tool .
If C++ had native support for lambda expressions , std :: for_each would make sense , but in the language we have today std :: for_each forces you to move your loop body into a function ( or function object ) at namespace scope , far from where it will be used .
Code that uses std:: for_each extensively is littered with these small , one - off functions that make little sense in isolation .
Also , you can't use break or continue once you are committed to using std:: for_each .
By comparison , FOREACH clearly expresses the programmer 's intent , is easy to use correctly , and lets you put your loop body where it makes sense .
If you think that macros are ugly , you 'll get no argument from me .
A foreach keyword and lambda functions sure would be nice , but that 's not the language we have to work with , unfortunately .
And as we 'll see , the conditional operator is just the tool we need to teach those evil , unruly macros some manners .
Listing 1 in file broken_foreach.cpp shows a bare - bones , stripped down version of the FOREACH macro as it was implemented at the time .
Do n't sweat the details yet ; we 'll get to them in short order .
This version has problems — it evaluates the container expression multiple times , and it does n't work if the container is an unnamed temporary object .
The following code illustrates the reevaluation problem .
It uses FOREACH to loop over a container of doubles , but the container expression , get_vect_dbl ( ) , is a function , which leads to some surprising behavior .
vector < double > vect_dbl( 3 , 1.0 ) ; vector < double > const & get_vect_dbl ( ) { cout << " here !
" ; return vect_dbl ; } // elsewhere .... FOREACH ( double d , get_vect_dbl ( ) ) { cout << d << '
'; }
here !
here !
here !
here !
1 here !
here !
here !
1 here !
here !
here !
1 here ! here !
get_vect_dbl ( )

FOREACH
How It Works , And Why It Does n't Quite
You might expect to see " here ! " displayed only once , but what you actually see is :
This is becauseis being evaluated multiple times by themacro .
Surprise !
This is a typical macro bug - a - boo , and one of the reasons why macros have such a bad reputation .
Squashing this bug is our first order of business , but first we 'll need to understand a bit about what themacro is doing , and why .
Imagine that it is your job to implement the FOREACH macro .
" Well , I 'll probably need some iterators , " you think to yourself , and you write something like this :
# define FOREACH ( item , container ) \ ??? iter = ( container ) .begin( ) ;
Now you 're stuck .
What type do you use to declare your iterator ?
You do n't know the type of the container , and you certainly do n't know the type of its iterators .
Somehow you must be able to declare variables for the iterators without knowing the iterators ' type !
It 's not impossible , but it is n't obvious , either .
Let 's see how .
First , we use the ScopeGuard trick [ 1 ] : temporary objects of derived type can have their lifetime extended by binding them to a const reference to the base type .
This is a magic property of const references and temporary objects .
If you 're surprised , do n't worry — it surprises everyone at first .
The following code illustrates the trick .
It defines an empty base class , a derived class which wraps some piece of data , and a function which returns an iterator , suitably wrapped .
struct auto_any_base {} ; template < class T > struct auto_any : auto_any_base { auto_any ( T const & t ) : item ( t ) {} mutable T item ; } ; template < class Container > auto_any < typename Container :: const_iterator > begin( Container const & c ) { return c.begin( ) ; }
FOREACH
# define BOOST_FOREACH ( item , container ) \ auto_any_base const & iter = begin ( container ) ; \ ...
begin ( container )
auto_any
iter
auto_any_base
auto_any
Now , in ourmacro we can say : returns the begin iterator , wrapped in antemporary object .
That temporary object gets bound to , which is a const reference to , the empty base class .
This gives the temporary object a reprieve of sorts — its lifetime is extended , along with the iterator stored inside . [
2 ]
As the name " " suggests , this is a general mechanism for putting an object of unknown type in automatic storage ( i.e. it is not dynamically allocated using new ) .
We have succeeded in storing an iterator , but we have lost its type information .
iter is a const reference to an auto_any_base — that tells us nothing about what is actually stored in there .
It could be a vector iterator , or it could be your Auntie May 's Christmas fruit cake .
If we want to be able to increment the iterator , for instance , we need to recover the lost type information .
next ( )
// extract a reference to the internally stored item template < class T > T & auto_any_cast ( auto_any_base const & base ) { return static_cast < auto_any < T > const & >( base ) .item ; } // infer the type of the iterator template < class Container > void next ( auto_any_base const & iter , Container const& ) { ++auto_any_cast < typename Container::const_iterator >( iter ) ; }
auto_any_cast ( )
auto_any_base
static_cast
static_cast
next ( )
auto_any_cast ( )
next ( )
iter
next ( )
begin ( )

next ( )
# define FOREACH ( item , container ) \ auto_any_base const & iter = begin ( container ) ; \ ... \ next ( iter , container ) ; \ ...
vector
container
container
next ( )
Night of the Living Dead Code
Keep in mind that we 're writing a macro , so we are free to reuse any of the macro arguments as many times as we like .
In particular , we can reuse the container expression to infer the type of the iterator .
The functionbelow does just that .
The functiontakes a const reference to anand casts it to the requested derived type .
It uses afor this ; this is kosher because we are allowed tofrom a base to a derived type .
It returns a reference to the contained piece of data .
The functionusesto access the iterator and increment it .
We useby passing it bothand the container , so thatcan deduce the type of the container and infer the type of the iterator .
If you recall , thefunction defined above puts ainto the .
The functionmust follow suit by casting back to a .
Notice that the container is not actually used byfor anything besides template argument deduction .
The snippet below shows how this all hangs together .
This works very well as long as container is something simple , like a variable of type .
But imagine what happens ifis a function call .
Sinceappears twice , it will get called twice .
And if the function has side - effects , all heck breaks loose .
This is the crux of the problem .
It is especially galling considering that in the call to , we do n't even need the container ; we just need its type .
There 's gotta be a better way !
If only there were a way to get the type of an expression without evaluating the expression .
There is !
The unique properties of the conditional operator allow us to sidestep the issue entirely .
The ENCODED_TYPEOF macro defined below encodes the type of an expression without evaluating it .
Read on to see how it works .
// a simple type wrapper template < class T > struct type2type {} ; // convert an expression of type T to an // expression of type type2type < T > template < class T > type2type< T > encode_type ( T const & t ) { return type2type< T >( ) ; } // convertible to type2type <T > for any T struct any_type { template < class T > operator type2type< T > ( ) const { return type2type< T >( ) ; } } ; // convert an expression of type T to an // expression of type type2type < T > without // evaluating the expression # define ENCODED_TYPEOF ( container ) \ ( true ? any_type( ) : encode_type ( container ) )
expr

ENCODED_TYPEOF ( expr )
type2type<Expr >
expr
ENCODED_TYPEOF
For any expressionof typeevaluates to , and ( here 's the important part ) the expressionis not evaluated !
There is some subtlety in , so it is worth a few words to describe what 's going on .
At the heart of ENCODED_TYPEOF is the conditional operator .
As you probably know , the conditional operator behaves like an if / else statement .
It takes three operands : ( 1 ) a Boolean condition , ( 2 ) an expression to evaluate if the condition is true , and ( 3 ) an expression to evaluate if the condition is false .
The most familiar use of the conditional operator is to implement the infamous min/max macros :
# define min( a , b) ( ( a ) < ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) ) # define max ( a , b ) ( ( a ) > ( b ) ? ( a ) : ( b ) )
Looks simple , right ?
Do n't be fooled , there 's more going on here than meets the eye .
A conditional expression is just that — an expression .
As such , it must have a type .
The type of a conditional expression depends on the types of both its second and third operands — the two branches of the condition .
Figuring out what the resulting type of a conditional expression is from the types of its two branches is enough to give even the most seasoned compiler writer a splitting headache .
Glossing over some complications which become important later , it works as follows : for a conditional expression ( b ? x : y ) where x is an expression of type X and y is an expression of type Y where X and Y are different , and one is a class type , the compiler checks to see if X can be converted to Y and if Y can be converted to X .
If only one , unambiguous conversion is found , that is the one that gets used .
Things get more complicated still , but this is enough to understand ENCODED_TYPEOF .
If you recall , ENCODED_TYPEOF ( container ) expands to ( true ? any_type ( ) : encode_type(container ) ) .
So X is any_type and Y is type2type< Container > .
Now we try the conversions .
type2type<Container > cannot be converted to any_type , but any_type can be converted to type2type< Container > because it defines the appropriate conversion operator .
We have found one , unambiguous conversion , so we 're done .
The type of ENCODED_TYPEOF ( container ) is type2type< Container > .
You may be thinking this is needlessly convoluted .
After all , could n't we just use encode_type( container ) without the conditional operator and get the same result ?
No , because that would have caused container to be evaluated .
With the conditional operator , only one branch of the condition is ever executed .
In this case , since the condition is always true , the first branch will always be taken .
The second branch is " dead code " — it will never execute — yet it extends a ghostly finger into the land of the living and exerts its influence on the conditional expression 's type .
Spooky !
By using ENCODED_TYPEOF in our FOREACH macro , we can avoid reevaluating the container expression needlessly .
All we have to do is change our function templates to take type2type< Container > instead of Container const & , as follows :
template < class Container > void next ( auto_any_base const & iter , type2type< Container > ) { ++auto_any_cast < typename Container::const_iterator >( iter ) ; } // elsewhere ... # define FOREACH ( item , container ) \ auto_any_base const & iter = begin ( container ) ; \ ... \ next ( iter , ENCODED_TYPEOF ( container ) ) ; \ ...
begin ( )
container.begin ( )
next ( )
Evil Dead Code II
The call toabove evaluates container and returns .
It gets bound to the const reference a - la the ScopeGuard trick .
And then the call toincrements the iterator without reevaluating container .
Perfect !
Now that we have a way of ensuring that the container expression only gets evaluated once , we can tackle the other problem with the FOREACH macro : making it work with rvalue container expressions .
First , some terminology .
The C++ standard uses the terms lvalue and rvalue to discriminate between objects that have names ( lvalues ) and those that do n't ( rvalues ) [ 3 ] .
Every variable you explicitly declare is an lvalue .
rvalues are more elusive ; they are the unnamed temporary objects that flit into and out of existence as a result of operations , conversions and function calls .
Consider the following invocation of FOREACH :
FOREACH ( char ch , string ( " Hello " ) ) { cout << ch ; }
string
cout
string ( " Hello " )
auto_any_base const & iter = begin( string ( " Hello " ) ) ; ...
begin ( )
string
auto_any
auto_any_base
FOREACH
FOREACH
This should write every character in theto , but making it do that is no mean trick .
The problem is thatis a temporary object - an rvalue .
It winks out of existence before we have a chance to iterate over it , unless we pin it down .
The problem is obvious once we expand the macro a bit :
Here , we see thatis going to return an iterator to a temporaryobject that is going to die at the semicolon .
An iterator into a deceased container is n't very useful , so clearly something must be done .
Let 's make a copy of the container and iterate over that !
We need to store the copy somewhere , but we do n't know the container 's type ( in general ) .
But hey , we already know how to solve this problem !
Just wrap the copy in anand bind it to a const reference to .
That will ensure that the container sticks around long enough to iterate over it .
Of course , making a copy of an STL container is an expensive proposition , and we do n't want to have to pay that price when we do n't have to .
If the container is an lvalue ( that is , a named object ) , we do n't have to make a copy because it is not in danger of going out of scope while we iterate over it .
Only when the container is an rvalue doesactually need to make a copy .
should automatically detect whether the container is an lvalue or an rvalue , and store a copy only if it is needed .
When mathematicians have a problem , they sometimes start by assuming the solution .
It has always seemed like cheating to me , but let 's use the same trick here .
Let 's assume ( for now ) that we can detect the lvalue - ness or rvalue - ness of an expression and write the result into a Boolean flag called is_rvalue .
Then , we could pass the container and is_rvalue to a helper function , which returned either a pointer to the container ( for lvalues ) or a copy ( for rvalues ) .
Since we need to return a thingy or a pointer - to - thingy , we need something like a union for the return type .
boost :: variant [ 4 ] is a perfect fit .
The helper function looks like this :
// contain ( ) - returns a Container or a Container * template < class Container > auto_any < boost :: variant < Container const*, Container > > contain ( Container const & t , bool const & is_rvalue ) { //
Return either a Container or a Container * depending on whether // the container is an rvalue or not .
typedef boost :: variant < Container const*, Container > variant_t ; return is_rvalue ?
variant_t(t ) : variant_t ( &t ) ; }
contain ( )
is_rvalue
variant
auto_any
begin ( )
begin ( )
is_rvalue
// begin ( ) - returns the begin iterator template < class Container > auto_any < typename Container : : const_iterator > begin ( auto_any_base const & container , bool is_rvalue , type2type< Container > ) { typedef boost :: variant < Container const*, Container > variant_t ; variant_t & var = auto_any_cast < variant_t >( container ) ; // Extract either a Container or a Container * depending on whether // the container is an rvalue or not .
Container const & c = is_rvalue ?
boost :: get < Container >( var ) : * boost :: get < Container const *>( var ) ; return c.begin( ) ; }
EVAL

( In case you are wondering whytakesby reference - to - const instead of by value , the reason becomes clear later . )
Now that the container is wrapped in a , which is wrapped in an , we need to make ourfunction privy to this subterfuge .
will take the container all wrapped up , the Booleanflag , and the encoded type of the container , and it will return the container 's begin iterator , like this :
We 've assumed that there is some way to detect the lvalue - ness or rvalue - ness of an expression .
Let 's call itand further assume that it is a macro that takes an expression and a Boolean flag .
It evaluates the expression and returns it .
As a side - effect , it writes into the flag whether the expression is an rvalue or not .
Using the hypotheticalmacro , we can makework with rvalues like this :
The functiontakes two arguments : and .
The first argument writes toas a side - effect , and the second argument passesto .
If this strikes you as dodgy , you 're right .
In C++ , argument evaluation order is unspecified .
What if the second argument ( ) is evaluated before the first argument writes to it ?
Will thefunction see garbage for the value of ?
No , and this is whytakesby reference - to - const instead of by value .
Since we are passing a reference , the value ofis not read until we are inside thefunction , at which point all of its function arguments have been evaluated and all their side - effects are visible .
Had we just passedby value , all bets would be off .
The moral is : do n't rely on the evaluation order of function arguments !
If we merely assume the existence of EVAL , our C++ compiler will complain .
( Assumed solutions are good enough for mathematicians , but not C++ compilers . )
We need to be more explicit , but detecting whether an expression is an lvalue or an rvalue presents a challenge reminiscent of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle — the act of measuring it tends to change the very property you are trying to measure [ 5 ] .
Once again , the lowly conditional operator saves the day .
The following code illustrates the principle by defining a macro RVALUE_TEST that displays " rvalue " for rvalue expressions , and " lvalue " for lvalue expressions .
We 'll get to the details in a minute .
struct rvalue_probe { template < class R > operator R ( ) { throw " rvalue " ; } template < class L > operator L & ( ) const { throw " lvalue " ; } } ; # define RVALUE_TEST ( container ) \ try { ( true ? rvalue_probe( ) : ( container ) ) ; } \ catch ( char const * result ) { cout << result << '
'; }
RVALUE_TEST ( expression )
RVALUE_TEST ( cout )
RVALUE_TEST ( make_pair ( 1,2 ) )
5.16/3 ... if the second and third operand have different types , and either has ( possibly cv-qualified ) class type , an attempt is made to convert each of those operands to the type of the other .
The process for determining whether an operand expression E1 of type T1 can be converted to match an operand expression E2 of type T2 is defined as follows :
If E2 is an lvalue : E1 can be converted to match E2 if E1 can be implicitly converted ( clause 4 ) to the type " reference to T2 " ... ... if the second and third operand have different types , and either has ( possibly cv-qualified ) class type , an attempt is made to convert each of those operands to the type of the other .
The process for determining whether an operand expression E1 of type T1 can be converted to match an operand expression E2 of type T2 is defined as follows :
Now you can useto test the rvalue - ness or lvalue - ness of an expression .
For instance , will display " lvalue " since cout is a named object .
Butwill display " rvalue " .
It 's not immediately obvious how this works [ 6 ] , so we 'll need to consult the Good Book ( the C++ standard ) to make sense of it .
According to section 5.16/3 :
This section is describing the case of RVALUE_TEST ( cout ) .
Since cout is an lvalue of type ostream , the compiler first tries to convert the expression rvalue_probe ( ) to type " reference to ostream " .
This succeeds , because rvalue_probe defines a conversion operator to L & for any L .
This conversion operator gets called , and it throws the string " lvalue " , which gets caught and printed .
The other case is more interesting .
If we read further in the standard , it says ( deep breath ) :
5.16/3 ( continued )
If E2 is an rvalue , or if the conversion above cannot be done : ... Otherwise ( i.e. , if E1 or E2 has a nonclass type , or if they both have class types but the underlying classes are not either the same or one a base class of the other ) : E1 can be converted to match E2 if E1 can be implicitly converted to the type that expression E2 would have if E2 were converted to an rvalue ( or the type it has , if E2 is an rvalue ) .
This is actually much simpler than it sounds .
If the expression is an rvalue of type R , then the compiler will try to convert rvalue_probe ( ) to an rvalue of type R .
But there 's a catch .
( You knew it could n't be that simple , right ? )
There are two ways for this conversion to happen .
The compiler could chose to use rvalue_probe : : operator R( ) and be done , or it could use rvalue_probe : : operator L &( ) const , and then use the standard lvalue - to - rvalue conversion ( 4.1 ) to achieve the same result .
Two possible conversions !
Rather than throw up its hands , the compiler performs overload resolution to pick the best conversion sequence .
Let 's not go into the subtleties of overload resolution ( Heaven help us ! ) , but the end result is that operator R( ) gets picked over operator L & ( ) const .
If you 've made it this far , congratulations !
There 's no doubt that this is arcane stuff , but we are rewarded with a robust way to detect the rvalue - ness and lvalue - ness of any expression .
We can use this technique to finally implement the EVAL macro assumed above .
Just a few small tweaks to the rvalue_probe struct give it the ability to pass an object through unchanged while recording whether it is an rvalue or lvalue .
It is explained in detail below .
struct rvalue_probe { template < class T > rvalue_probe ( T const & t , bool & b ) : ptemp ( const_cast < T * >( &t ) ) , is_rvalue ( b ) {} template < class R > operator R( ) { is_rvalue = true ; return * static_cast < R * >( ptemp ) ; } template < class L > operator L &( ) const { is_rvalue = false ; return * static_cast < L * >( ptemp ) ; } void * ptemp ; bool & is_rvalue ; } ;
# define EVAL ( container , is_rvalue ) \ ( true ? rvalue_probe( ( container ) , is_rvalue ) : ( container ) )
rvalue_probe
rvalue_probe
is_rvalue
FOREACH
Conclusion
And now at last we can define the EVAL macro as : Theobject stores a pointer to the container expression container and a reference to a Boolean flag .
The other operand of the condition operator is container , raw and unadorned .
As before , the second operand is " dead code " that will never execute , but its rvalue - ness or lvalue - ness will influence which conversion operator gets called on theobject .
Both conversion operators do essentially the same thing : dereference the pointer to the container expression and return the result .
As a side - effect , it records in the Boolean flag which conversion operator was called .
The upshot is that theflag can be used by the rest of themacro to either make a copy of the container or not , accordingly .
Listing 2 ( see fixed_foreach.cpp ) uses this trick to improve upon the code in Listing 1 — it does not reevaluate the container expression , and it works with rvalue containers .
You may not have thought much about the conditional operator before now , but you have to admit , there is a lot there to love .
The standard devotes a whole page and a half of dense standardese to this curious little beast , and we have just scratched the surface .
But I think you 'll forgive me if I take my language lawyer hat off now .
I encourage you to download the code for BOOST_FOREACH .
There you will find a version that works with other types of sequences besides STL containers .
BOOST_FOREACH is currently under consideration for inclusion in Boost .
You can find the code in the Boost Sandbox File Vault in the file foreach.zip .

Notes and References
ScopeGuard by Andrei Alexandrescu .
If you look at Listing 1 , you 'll notice that the variables are declared in " if " statements .
Text substitution can be a dangerous thing .
The if / else statements serve to make FOREACH expand to one big statement , which makes it play nicely with any surrounding code .
I leave the if / else statements out here because it would only obscure the point .
The terms originally come from the fact that lvalues can appear on the left side of an assignment , and rvalues can only appear on the right .
boost :: variant is a discriminated union .
It 's not difficult to get the answer right in most cases , but getting it right in all cases is a challenge .
A common trick uses the rules for binding to references .
Ordinarily , rvalues will not bind to references , and this can be detected .
Unfortunately , const - qualified rvalues will bind to references , so the technique is not perfect .
In fact , on many compilers it does n't work , sadly .
It works on Comeau and on gcc 3.3.3 , but not on Visual C++ 7.1 , from my experiments .
The reason is because operator L & ( ) const is const - qualified and operator R ( ) is not .
Since the expression rvalue_probe( ) is not const , in order to call a const - qualified member function , the compiler must add a const qualification to the rvalue_probe object .
This is considered a conversion .
As a result , the conversion sequence using operator R( ) is shorter than the sequence using operator L &( ) const , and hence it is preferred .

A secret NSA surveillance database containing millions of intercepted foreign and domestic e-mails includes the personal correspondence of former President Bill Clinton , according to the New York Times .
An NSA intelligence analyst was apparently investigated after accessing Clinton 's personal correspondence in the database , the paper reports , though it did n't say how many of Clinton 's e-mails were captured or when the interception occurred .
The database , codenamed Pinwale , allows NSA analysts to search through and read large volumes of e-mail messages , including correspondence to and from Americans .
Pinwale is likely the end point for data sucked from internet backbones into NSA - run surveillance rooms at AT&T facilities around the country .
Those rooms were set up by the Bush administration following 9/11 , and were finally legalized last year when Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act .
The law gives the telecoms immunity for cooperating with the administration ; it also opens the way for the NSA to lawfully spy on large groups of phone numbers and e-mail addresses in bulk , instead of having to obtain a warrant for each target .
The NSA can collect the correspondence of Americans with a court order , or without one if the interception occurs incidentally while the agency is targeting people " reasonably believed " to be overseas .
But in 2005 , the agency " routinely examined large volumes of Americans ' e-mail messages without court warrants , " according to the Times , through this loophole .
The paper reports today that the NSA is continuing to over - collect e-mail because of difficulties in filtering and distinguishing between foreign and domestic correspondence .
If an American 's correspondence pops up in search results when analysts sift through the database , the analyst is allowed to read it , provided such messages account for no more than 30 percent of a search result , the paper reported .
The NSA has claimed that the over - collection was inadvertent and corrected it each time the problem was discovered .
But Rep. Rush Holt ( D - New Jersey ) , chairman of the House Select Intelligence Oversight Panel , disputed this .
" Some actions are so flagrant that they ca n’t be accidental , " he told the Times .
Holt and other congressional reps have been holding closed - door meetings on the issue .
Holt 's office said there are no current plans to hold a hearing on the matter , but the investigation is on - going .

Canada has had its very own Pirate Party for a few months now .
The party is currently trying to get federal approval , a goal that should be achieved in the coming week .
In the meantime the party 's members have n't been sitting still and today sees the launch of their very own BitTorrent tracker .
The Canadian Pirate Party is one of the youngest Pirate Parties around but they are not too shy to make a statement .
Today the party has launched a BitTorrent tracker of their own .
By starting a BitTorrent tracker the Pirates hope to show that BitTorrent and filesharing are not a threat , but a great tool for artists to promote their work .
“ We ’re starting a BitTorrent tracker to show artists how to properly use P2P technology in order to gain access to a cheap and efficient marketing and distribution network , ” Pirate Party spokesman Jake Daynes told TorrentFreak .
“ In addition we hope to show the public that P2P is not only for ‘ illegal ’ activity , and that it can be used to allow aspiring artists access to the global stage .
A tracker is the epitome of filesharing , and one of our platform ‘ planks ’ as it were , is about the promotion of filesharing , ” Jake added .
The Canadian Pirate Party is using RivetTracker ‘s tracker software and they will be featuring content from artists who release their work under a Creative Commons license .
In the future the Party hopes to add more content to the tracker though .
“ Right now it is only artists , though we hope to include a lot more CC material .
If an artist would like to submit their work , they can email it to us with their info , and we will host it , ” Jake told Torrent Freak .
Currently there are just a few releases on the tracker , but the Party hopes that this will grow exponentially in the weeks to come .
If you ’re Canadian and you want to support the Pirate Party you can do so by signing up for a free membership .
Using Social Networks to Foster Open Source Projects

The Linux Box 's Elizabeth Ziph Discusses the Convergence of Customers , Contributions and Code
Let 's face it , open source software companies and projects have a wide variety of innovative platforms and methods to drum up awareness , business , and interest in development for the projects they create and support .
The problem is , it 's not always easy to quantify how much interest and awareness ( or ultimately , new contributors , users , or customers ) result from any specific method .
Social networks are a great way to reach out to people with specific interests and start the chain of " word of mouth " recommendation .
But they just are n't the traditional sort of public relations drives or advertising many organizations are used to .
If an organization understands this , there 's a lot to gain from social network outreach -- and open source software , a model that works based on input from the wider community , is in a position to benefit even more .
There 's just that matter of metrics -- will the push yield good results ?
Engine Yard , a Ruby on Rails hosting and services provider , found it 's well worth the effort .
Engine Yard chose to use its
Twitter feed as the vehicle for what it called a " programming contest ... sure to challenge even the most comp - sci heavy engineers . "
While the initial instructions ( to tweet twelve words from a thousand word dictionary that when hashed , is as close as possible bit - wise to the hash of the challenge phrase ) and some interaction appeared on Engine Yard 's blog , contest submissions were collected solely through " @replies " on Twitter .
The three - tiered approach of prizes ( an iPhone 3GS and $ 2,000 worth of Engine Yard 's cloud services ) , company - to - developer interaction , and solving a programming - intense puzzle resulted in over 200 contest entries , a surge in site traffic of 420 % over the same time the previous month , and a 32 % increase in Twitter followers .
The beauty of this is two - fold -- an open source company that specializes in working with Ruby on Rails , as well as making it possible for its developers to simply develop applications , spread the good word about its work and encouraged others to take part .
The model is also extremely adaptable .
Smaller projects are used to the sorts of " word of mouth " transactions that play out on social networks .
Social network outreach can remain a small cost investment , if finances factor in at all ( time might be another matter entirely ) .
Prize incentives are always neat , but do n't need to be extravagant -- it 's amazing what people will do just for the joy in being first to conquer a challenge ( or for a t - shirt ) .
Of course , it 's a great way to pull in new developer , artist , translation or documentation talent .
That 's where a project effectively ( and creatively ! ) using social networks gets its incentive .
A child is born to poor parents .

Such a system is downright evil .
-- SARAH PALIN
Now zoom to the future of that child as an adult .
Tell me what kind of health insurance a mentally disabled person without a wealthy family can afford .
This is not a hypothetical situation in some brave new world of the future , rather it is reality as we speak .
They are out there now .
We call them homeless .
Many were once like Trig , a beautiful innocent child .
But they lacked parents who happened to be governors of states that receive huge per capita government support and now they sleep under highways exposed to crime and the elements .
Yet , a hardcore " work makes right " Republican mentality must ultimately reach the conclusion that such people are of no use to society and thus have no right to its support .
The idea that being worthy of health care is based on one 's level of productivity in society is actually the sort of idea that Ayn Rand ranted about .
It is a conservative ideal .
It is the reality of a profit based health insurance industry .
One gets the kind of health care that one deserves based on one 's financial advantage .
In the world that Sarah Palin would have us live in the children of the poor are condemned to brief painful lives with no purpose and no safety net .
The hypocrisy of her words sickens me .

Questions over conflict of the sexes remain .
Japan Sea stickleback males diverged from their Pacific Ocean - dwelling ancestors due to a new sex chromosome .
Seiichi Mori
Experiments in stickleback fish have shown for the first time that the evolution of new sex chromosomes is the driving force behind the formation of a new vertebrate species .
Up until now , most evidence has shown that new species arise because they have adapted to new environments .
But a study to be published by Nature1 found that the emergence of new sex chromosomes caused a population of threespine stickleback fish in the Japan Sea , to diverge from its Pacific Ocean–dwelling ancestor ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ) — creating a new species .
Jun Kitano , an evolutionary biologist at Tohoku University in Japan , and his team discovered that the Japan Sea stickleback fish had different sex chromosomes compared to their ancestors .
The ancestral Y sex chromosome ( which makes males ) had fused with a non–sex chromosome to create a new sex chromosome in the Japan Sea stickleback fish .
The team also observed that the Japan Sea males exhibited more aggressive mating behaviours than their ancestral populations .
Females from the ancestral population avoid mating with the Japan Sea fish due to their more aggressive behaviour .
And in lab tests , the male progeny of the two populations were sterile .
The study found that the gene responsible for the aggressive mating behaviour of the Japan sea males was on the new Y chromosome .
The new mating behaviours linked to the new sex chromosome stop the two populations from mating , making the Japan Sea population a new species .
" There is a gene on the new sex chromosome that causes differences in mating behaviour in the male stickleback .
This behaviour leads to evolution of a new species of stickleback , " says Catherine Peichel , a molecular biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington , and a member of the research team that published the study .
Battle of the sexes
Ole Seehausen , a fish ecologist and evolutionist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology in Dübendorf , says the study is " remarkable " .
" This is the first study that has shown a direct link between the evolution of sex chromosomes in vertebrates and the evolution of a new species , " he says .

Peichel says that not much is known about what drives the evolution of new sex chromosomes .
Scientists have hypothesized that conflict between the sexes could be behind this .
If species carry genes that could be advantageous to males but detrimental to females , then natural selection will favour that these genes be located in the part of the genome that appears in males but not in females .
" A good place for them to be is right next to the gene that causes sex determination , " says Peichel .
However the study has not yet answered whether conflict between the sexes drives the evolution of new sex chromosomes .
" They do not prove that there is sexual conflict over the trait they study — that is that it is good for males but not females , " Seehausen says .
This year , Kanye West picked the beginning of the Video Music Awards to deliver one of his famous rants .
The rapper stormed the stage just after the first award , for Best Female Video , was presented to Taylor Swift .
He cut the teen singer off , grabbing the mic and protesting in support of Beyoncé .
" I 'm sorry , but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time , " he proclaimed as B looked on from the crowd , stunned .
During the 2007 VMAs in Las Vegas , West delivered another rant and lost his temper after he was displeased with his performance being set inside a hotel suite rather than on the show 's main stage .
' Ye 's rants are usually in support of his own work .
He memorably took the stage at the American Music Awards in 2004 , declaring he was robbed of the Best New Artist nod .
His protest against Swift , however , was not well received .
West stood briefly on the stage after his comments as the crowd was silent .
Audience members then began to clap in support of Swift after West left the stage .
According to reports from inside the house , once cameras cut away from the action , West flipped off the crowd and returned to his seat .
Wale then said to the crowd , " You can't blame a man for speaking his mind . "
His words were met with boos , and Wale then said , " Kanye , I tried . "
During the next commercial break , Pink walked by the rapper and appeared to shake her head in disgust before security escorted her away .
West remained steadfast amidst the commotion as he kissed his girlfriend Amber Rose .

“ Studio ” for many of us means packing musical production tools into a corner of our desk , then being able to fit the whole thing into a backpack and take it with us .
It ’s bringing along your entire production to a cramped rehearsal room and adjusting tracks in a hotel room .
It ’s putting together an assortment of unusual pieces of DIY hardware , mobile game systems and an iPod touch , and composing and performing a live PA set .
So packing in functionality means a lot .
That makes it worth considering a hardware solution like Cakewalk ’s V - Studio 100 in obsessive detail .
Combining an interface with mixing , control , recording , and software functions makes the VS especially relevant to the computer musician .
I was one of the first people outside Cakewalk to lay eyes on the V - Studio 100 .
Part of the initial appeal to me was that it seemed to combine a lot of the tools I wanted into a single package .
Sure , its big brother , the V - Studio 700 , is an impressive unit with loads of onboard options .
But the V - Studio 100 was more my speed : it has that apartment studio , backpack - friendly attitude .
And do n’t let the “ SONAR ” in “ SONAR V - Studio 100 ” fool you , either .
While it ’s great having a free copy of a special edition of SONAR on Windows you can use the VS hardware and even the plug - in bundle that comes with it on any host on either Windows or Mac .
And — oh , yeah – you can also make use of all that audio I/O and mixing to do some crazy stuff with your plugged - in portable game consoles and iPhones and homebrewed electronics .
The real test is whether this one unit can perform the tasks you need .
The V - Studio 100 tries to be a number of different things :
An audio interface ( up to 24 - bit / 96 kHz )
A mixer
A control surface
A wave recorder
A software bundle
Correction :
The street price of the whole package is US$ 699 .
( I had incorrectly put the street at $ 800 instead of $ 700 ! )
Anything that does that much will naturally have to make some compromises .
Some of those compromises I think are rather well - conceived on the VS , while others I hope will evolve over time .
This will be partially a review , but partially a description of what it ’s like using the VS , so if you do have one of these , I can hopefully give you a sense of how to begin using it .
The VS is an impressively compact package , as can be seen when I place my TMobile G1 ( Google Android ) phone on top of it .
What ’s in the Package
The VS - 100 itself is a tidy rectangular box with the main two audio ins on the front , USB , MIDI , and remaining audio I/O on the back , and mixer controls , menu , transport controls , control surface shortcuts , and flying motorized fader on the top .
The unit feels terrifically solid , both in overall feel and the details of all of the controls .
I wish it came with a carry case , but it ’s the right size to fit a lot of generic gear cases out there .
Documentation includes a Getting Started Guide , Hardware Manual , and two discs .
One disc contains the SONAR V - Studio for Windows , a special edition of the SONAR DAW , plus a big bundle of plug-ins that will work with either Windows VST or Mac Audio Unit hosts .
The other disc ships with drivers that work on both Mac and Windows .
( In other words , Mac users miss out only on the free SONAR VS – not a deal - killer since you probably have a copy of GarageBand or another DAW , anyway . )
The whole unit weighs just over four pounds and can easily fit into a compartment in your laptop backpack or larger briefcase .
You do need its power source – because of the pres , motorized fader , and mixer functions , this is just too power thirsty to draw all its electricity from USB – but the 9V power adapter is relatively compact .
Audio Interface
The VS - 100 is a 10 - in , 6 - out interface .
Of course , that ’s actually relatively modest for interfaces of this price range .
At the same time , those interfaces are just interfaces , the quality here I think is really good , and this could be a pretty practical set relative to what many people actually need .
Here ’s the basic configuration :
Inputs 1 - 2 : XLR mic jacks and balanced TRS 1/4 ” jacks .
Input 1 has a Hi -Z ( high impedance ” ) switch that switches to a 500 k ohm impedence for guitars .
There are also mic preamps on both 1 and 2 .
There are also physical knobs on the front of the unit for adjusting input sensitivity of 1 - 2 .
A phantom power switch is located on the back of the unit for mics that need power .
Inputs 3 - 4 : Dedicated mono TRS jacks ( balanced ) .
Inputs 5 - 6 : Stereo phono pair ( unbalanced ) .
Input 7 - 8 : Digital S/ PDIF input on the back .
( Input only ; there are no digital outs . )
Input 9 - 10 : The mixer output can be selected as a separate two ins .
Outputs 1 - 4 : Four channels of balanced TRS 1/4 ” output .
Can you say quad sound , anyone ?
( Hey , it ’s actually the most practical option for live performance . )
Outputs 5 - 6 : Unbalanced stereo output .
You do get 1 - in , 1 - out MIDI , accompanied by Cakewalk / Roland MIDI drivers , which traditionally have given me good results on both Mac and Windows .
The mic pres on inputs one and two sound really transparent , much higher - quality than I would have expected , and the one indication that Cakewalk and Roland are n’t thinking of this as just an entry - level unit .
For the one - man / one - man performer , it ’s a pretty ideal configuration , it ’s great having unbalanced I/O , it sounds good , and you have dedicated level knobs where you need them .
I ’ve played out with the VS , and it ’s an ideal solo computer audio interface .
Even given that , you probably would n’t buy this box for its audio alone .
You could get a MOTU Traveler , for instance , with FireWire audio , lots of additional analog and digital I/O , more pres , and internal mixing capability .
But it ’s the other features that make it a contender .
Mixer Operation , Interface Operation
The VS adds to its interface mixing functions and a built - in set of effects .
And note that on the mixer side , this is n’t a “ software ” mixer as you provided by some of the VS ’ competition .
You get a compact but very functional set of hardware controls that allow the VS to handle mixing functions , even when you ’re also using it as an audio interface , and even when you ’re in cramped spaces .
On the effects side , the VS includes a dedicated compressor and 3 - band EQ for tracks 1 - 6 ( as inserts on 1 , 2 , 3/4 , and 5/6 ) .
Via some cleverly economic menus , you can edit parameters for these settings using the toggle buttons above the mixer knobs , in conjunction with three dedicated encoders and the value knob .
It ’s not hard to get the hang of toggling around , and while you do n’t have dedicated controls as you might on a full - blown mixer , functions are rarely more than a button press or two away .
While it ’s a bit harder to get to , there ’s also a decent - sounding internal reverb included , as well .
It has specific sends for each channel ( 1 , 2 , 3/4 , 5/6 ) and adjustable send level , though you ’re hard - wired to some basic modes ( ECHO , ROOM , SMALL HALL , and LARGE HALL ) .
Quick tip : Hidden in the settings is the ability to route audio to your USB port pre-EQ .
( Look for Menu > Utility > To USB > PreEQ . )
Generally , recording with in - line EQ is a very bad idea , because there ’s no way to go back to the raw audio .
With this setting adjusted , you can use EQ for live performance but without impacting your raw tracks if you want to master , say , a live session later on .
The VS - 100 can operate both as a standalone mixer – something you ’d take to your gig while leaving the laptop at home – and a combination between a mixer and an audio interface .
Because of that , its operation is a little different , so let ’s actually walk through the signal flow itself .
Navigating Signal Flow
Scenario 1 : You ’ve got the VS plugged into your computer .
You might plug a guitar into input 1 , depressing the Hi-Z switch , and a mic into input 2 ..
You can then adjust input level on the “ SENS ” knobs on the front .
There ’s no dedicated LED level meter , but you do get a level meter on the LED screen on the top of the unit .
Monitoring is a little different than on most audio interfaces .
You have two places at which you control the level you hear .
The “ MAIN MIX ” knob controls the level for the mixer – which is also your zero- latency , direct monitor level , the level from your input before it reaches the computer .
For the output from your computer , you would adjust the “ PLAYBACK ” knob .
The advantages of working this way : you can use this as either a traditional interface , or as a mixer – handy with multiple ins plugged in .
And you get dedicated knobs for 1 , 2 , 3/4 , 5/6 , and ( the digital ins ) 7/8 for use in mixer mode .
You can also feed the main mix out to a PA , so for live performance you can keep a mix going to your audience without carrying along a separate mixer .
Embarassing side note :
In my haste , I initially assumed the “ PLAYBACK ” knob controlled only the flash Wave Recorder .
It actually controls playback of your audio interface through the main outs when you ’re in USB mode .
You ’ll , um , want to turn that knob down before you plug in the unit , as the outs are pretty hot .
You can imagine what happened to me .
Happily , my monitors survived .
Oh , PS – Cakewalk actually should have put that in their manual , as there is a prominent warning about the “ MAIN MIX ” knob , but not “ PLAYBACK ” – and this is called SONAR V - Studio , so they should expect people will be connecting it to the computer straight away !
Scenario 2 : You ’ve got the VS operating standalone .
The mixer functions are pretty self - explanatory .
In this mode , the Wave Recorder can record from your main mix , it can play back tracks , and it has loop playback .
The ins and outs work otherwise as they would in DAW mode , and you still get the built - in effects .
The one downside in this mode is that the DAW controls – the shortcut keys , track select buttons , and flying fader – are all basically meaningless .
It ’s too bad that they could n’t do some sort of double duty .
But it ’s still nice to have this box as a mixer and effects unit on the go .
There ’s even a metronome feature , so it could be a decent box to carry around to rehearsal with you , especially with the built - in Wave Recorder , if you do n’t already own such a unit and just want to budget for the VS alone .
Scenario 3 : Disaster strikes .
Here ’s the best thing about having two modes : try yanking out the USB port while the VS is plugged in .
Normally , that ’s a very , very bad idea ( and it ’d be an especially bad idea when using FireWire , as you could theoretically fry your computer or interface ) .
But with the VS , the hardware will automatically switch its routing to the wave recorder , and the mixer will continue operating normally .
In other words , you can have a cable come unplugged or a computer crash and save a gig by keeping sound going on the VS .
With WAV playback on the WAV Recorder , you could even switch over to a flash card for backing tracks .
Disconnect USB , and you ’ll see this notification – but the mixer keeps operating , and you can use the SD card as a backup audio source .
The Control Surface
At its simplest , the control surface gives you just the basics : transport controls , mute / solo , and arm , plus the main feature – a motorized flying fader .
Of course , in a lot of situations , that ’s exactly what you need for basic recording .
In fact , thanks to the fact that the fader is motorized , you may not need other faders , given that most mixing scenarios involve adjusting just one track at a time .
( Riding more than one fader can tend to cause you to overcompensate when fine - tuning levels , a bit like oversteering . )
The track select keys toggle tracks .
( It does n’t matter which track is selected in software , even in SONAR . )
Using the shift key navigates buses ( SONAR only ) .
The value knob can also be used for additional manipulation .
Transport keys can move not only the transport but , using the shift key , from marker to marker .
For those of you who have managed to escape the experience in real production , using motorized faders is a joy .
The fader will near - silently shift to whatever setting you choose .
I remember using Digidesign ’s motorized faders when they first came out and finding the effect almost magical , though in those days the technology was priced as high as a compact car and the faders moved with a little “ thump ” sound .
Happily , technology marches forward .
In ACT ( Active Controller Technology ) mode , Cakewalk maps its own SONAR software more intelligently .
By default , this includes the Value encoder and the three encoders below the LCD , so that if you , say , bring up an instance of one of the included Studio Instruments , software parameters automatically map to those hardware controls .
It does make quickly accessing basic settings a little quicker , though if you ’re a heavy synth user , this functionality is unlikely to compete with similar and more advanced “ automatic map ” controllers and software like Native Instruments ’
Kore , Novation ’s ReMOTE line with Automap , and M - Audio ’s Axiom Pro with HyperControl , or Cakewalk ’s own ACT in combination with a range of hardware .
There just are n’t enough controls on the VS , by contrast .
In a pinch , though , ACT is still useful on the VS , especially if you enable the “ DAW Full Asgn ” setting in the menu .
It automatically maps the mixer knobs for use with ACT , too .
Unlike technologies like HyperControl and Automap , ACT is limited to SONAR , but SONAR users , I think you will find yourself using it at least a little , just because it ’s there .
My one criticism would be that it ’d be great if there were a keyboard shortcut for switching to “ Full Assignment ” mode without digging through menus .
That way , you could easily toggle between using mixer controls for mixing and using them for ACT .
Confused by all these options ?
Given that all these technologies rely on MIDI , anyway , I think we badly need an open spec that allows you to easily support any host with any hardware , without the fuss .
Someone out there adept at Reaper scripting , for instance , I ’d love to hack into this .
What if you do n’t use SONAR ?
Mackie Control Support
You can still get basic control with V - Studio using Mackie Control .
It ’s just as easy to set up : choose Mackie Control as your control surface , then select the V - STUDIO CONTROL port as your input and output .
In software like Ableton Live , Apple Logic , Reaper , and others , the VS will automatically map to basic mixing functions .
Transport controls work perfectly , the motorized fader jumps to the right level , and mute / solo / arm buttons work .
I tried it in a number of apps and had no problem .
There is one catch : because of some of the limitations of Mackie Control , you do n’t get to use those extra knobs .
While Full Assignment mode remaps all the controls to MIDI and should allow you to manually create your own MIDI maps for your favorite software , it also enables ACT mode .
That means that you lose all the functionality of Mackie Control if you turn it on .
You can have one or the other , but not both .
It ’d be nice to see Cakewalk modify the functionality of Full Assignment mode so that it can coexist with Mackie Control .
That way , you could use the rest of the control surface as a MIDI control surface rather than losing the functionality of those controls .
It ’s a subtle point ; as I said , I think people will use the transport and mixer controls far more than synth controls because of their relative convenience .
But it would make a nice firmware upgrade .
Speaking of firmware upgrades , make sure you ’ve upgraded to at least 1.19 firmware before attempting to use Mackie Control .
This release fixed a number of bugs , including one that prevented me from switching to the “ OTHER ” DAW mode ( from SONAR . )
Once I updated , though , this performance was seamless .
The Wave Recorder
One of the reasons you might want to drop the VS in your gig bag is that it combines a mixer with a wave recorder in one box , and can replace a computer or a mixer + recorder combination .
Pop in an SD card or SDHC card – capacities up to 32 GB via SDHC – and you can record the stereo mix of whatever is plugged into the mixer .
The Wave Recorder also supports easily - accessible playback , which could make the VS ideal for backing tracks .
You could , for instance , use it in its computer interface mode in the studio for production , then load all your tracks onto SD and play them back onstage with the VS running as a mixer .
Alternatively , you could record a mixed - down rehearsal or performance and take it home with you .
Like Roland ’s mobile recorders , you also get basic marker and looping functionality , which could help you practice or transcribe a tricky portion of a song or create more sophisticated backing arrangements if you were feeling especially ambitious .
True , you could bring along a mobile wave recorder , but the convenience of combining the recorder with mixing functions makes it ideal in cases when a portable stereo recorder is not .
There ’s one major caveat , however .
Playback from the wave recorder and recording of the stereo mix are both possible when the VS is operating in standalone mode .
But when it ’s connected via USB , each of those functions is defeated – no playback , and no recording .
The transport controls are reassigned to become software control surface functions , and the SD card slot becomes useless .
That ’s too bad , as one of the first things I wanted to do with the VS was to be able to record live sessions without relying on my computer hard disk , recording the same live mix I ’d feed to the PA .
I was able to confirm with Cakewalk that Roland is aware of this limitation and investigating possible solutions ; it may be technically possible to resolve the issue with a future firmware update .
They were not able to confirm at this time when a fix was coming or what form it might take , but I ’ll provide updated information if it becomes available .
In the meantime , it can still be useful to have the VS wave recording function , as it does mean you can leave the laptop at home for various recording and practice scenarios .
Driver Support
As with previous Roland / Cakewalk outings like the SONAR Power Studio , the VS - 100 comes with extensive documentation on how to tweak driver settings under Windows , and you can expect extremely up - to - date and reliable support for Windows technologies , including the WASAPI adjustments made in Windows Vista .
( WASAPI is Windows ’ general audio interface for software ; it ’s supported on the software side by applications like SONAR , but it ’s essential that hardware driver implementation be robust in order to acheive proper support under Windows .
Translation : Cakewalk gets their drivers right , so Windows works properly and you do n’t have to worry about it . )
Installation on Windows winds up being pretty easy .
Install the driver disc to get up and running .
Install a second disc , and you install a huge suite of plug-ins as well as the special edition SONAR VS software .
The bundle installed over my existing Cakewalk SONAR Producer Installation just fine , and then the newly - installed effects became available not only to SONAR VS , but my existing SONAR install , too , as well as all my other VST - compatible DAWs ( like Live and Reaper ) .
The Mac installation winds up being easy , too , however .
The Mac version fully supports Core Audio , and I got excellent performance in Logic Studio 9 .
Logic also mapped easily to Mackie Control .
Bundled Software Gems
The VS Production Pack includes a set of effects and instruments for both Mac and Windows :
VX - 64 Vocal Strip – a combination deesser + “ compander ” ( compressor / expander ) + tube - emulating EQ +
Doubler + synced Delay .
That could have been a bunch of gimmicks .
But it winds up being all awesome .

LE versions of Dimension ( sampler ) , Rapture ( synth )
Studio Instruments Bass , Drums , Electric Piano , Strings : all some very lovely - sounding , lovely - looking instruments
Bundling light - edition software with hardware is a popular choice , but the VX - 64 is the real stand - out .
The set of tools integrate beautifully , there ’s a fantastic live spectrograph tool for a view of what you ’re doing on each of the modules , there ’s a lovely drag - and - drop routing interface , the UI is clear and well laid out , and the whole think sounds utterly wonderful .
I do n’t think it ’d be hyperbolic to say the VX - 64 is the best software plug - in Cakewalk has made yet ; it just packs in all the goodness you might like for vocals in a single window .
There are enough unique capabilities here that , even if you have a collection of plugs or a DAW with lots in it from a rival maker like Ableton ’s Live Suite or Apple ’s Logic Studio , you ’ll find something useful .
The danger to all of this is that there ’s a sort of kitchen sink feel to the suite , and it could well overwhelm beginners , but the VS generally feels better suited to intermediate - to - advanced users , anyway .
SONAR VS
The sleeper hit of the whole package is the VS edition of SONAR .
Usually I like light editions of DAWs about as much as I like diet soda – it ’s just not as sweet as the real thing .
But the VS is a pleasant surprise .
It feels a bit like GarageBand for grown - ups .
One of the complaints about SONAR from non-converts is that its do - everything user interface can feel cluttered , particularly by providing lots of different routes to the same thing .
I think that ’s a fair criticism , even as I respect what SONAR does .
What ’s remarkable about SONAR VS is that it feels like it sacrifices none of the functionality of its big brother , but wraps it into a much cleaner interface .
Channel strip pop-ups on the left allow easy access to every parameter .
A reduced toolbar icon provides essentials without being overwhelming .
There are still some hard - to - read icons , and the software is likely to , again , be a bit complex for beginners .
But for users with some experience , there ’s a real sense that tools and options have been thoughtfully chosen .
All of this may be overkill for those of you loyal to an existing DAW , but it ’s still worth noting the job Cakewalk has done .
Of course , the message to Cakewalk should be clear : SONAR itself needs a window layout that ’s this clear , either as the default or something you can switch on easily .
Note that you actually do n’t need SONAR VS to get any special integration with the V - STUDIO 100 hardware and drivers .
Driver setup is the same for SONAR VS as SONAR ; it takes a few steps but in either tool , you get excellent driver support , and I do n’t think there ’s any question that Cakewalk ’s support on Windows is exceptional – enough so that Windows really is n’t a hassle .
The VS interface from SONAR is actually quite nice , from the accessibility of parameters in the channel strip to thoughtful MIDI editing touches .
Conclusions
The VS hardware brings together something I ’ve been waiting for in hardware for a long time .
It ’s beautifully compact , too – but , naturally , that means it also has to make some trade - offs to put together so many elements in one package .
It ’s simply worth considering if it ’s the right set of trade - offs for you .
The good :
The unit is physically lovely to work with , in terms of its layout and feel .
The pre ’s sound great , and while the audio I / O is n’t as extensive as on some interfaces , it ’s practical for a lot of real - world , one - person , mobile producer situations .
Using the motorized fader is addictive , and works in any Windows / Mac software .
The control layout winds up being very usable , and it ’s nice having compressor / EQ instances within easy reach .
You get rock - solid Roland audio and MIDI drivers ( particularly important on Windows ) .
SONAR VS is actually a great little audio package .
The VX - 64 is a real gem for anyone working with vocals , and overall the software bundle is a terrific value .
The mixed :
The WAV recorder gets defeated when you plug in a USB cable .
The VS would be more useful as a control surface if you could more easily map the rest of the surface to MIDI – without having to use SONAR and without having to defeat Mackie Control .
The ACT controls can be a little confusing on such a compact control surface .
Even with those two great pre’s , the VS probably wo n’t be your first choice if what you really want is just an audio interface .
Despite some weaknesses , though , to me the VS ’ strong points are what can make it a terrific choice .
A remarkably compact mixer combined with the flying fader and transport control and the audio I / O you ’re most likely to need ?
That could be enough to sell you , before you add in additional value from some of the software gems that come with it .
At US$ 699 street , there are cheaper options around , but by the time you add a control surface , a mobile recorder , a mixer , and an audio interface together , it ’s a different picture .
There are also other control surface - mixer - interfaces out there , but some skimp on audio quality while others lack the VS ’ elegant compactness .
The VS still counts as the most control , mixing , and audio functionality I ’ve seen in any backpack - friendly box .
And as such , for the laptop music production warrior wanting to maximize space and power , it ’s part of a handful of essential gear to consider .

Bicycle Lanes vs Wide Outside Lanes
When additional space on collector and arterial roads is deemed beneficial to both bicyclists ( for comfort when motorists are passing ) and motorists ( for ease of passing ) Bike Lanes ( BLs ) and Wide Outside Lanes ( WOLs ) are the two options .
A BL is a striped and signed space exclusively for the use of bicyclists and is typically 4 or 5 feet wide .
A WOL is a shared - use lane that is wider than a standard 12 ft lane ; 15 feet is typically recommended .
A third option , a paved shoulder , is similar to a BL but lacks the formal designation of a bicycling facility .
Following are issues in comparing BLs and WOLs .
They are listed in no particular order , and each item is not necessarily equally important .
1 . Safety .
BLs are typically touted as increasing bicyclist safety .
BLs , and WOLs for that matter , have never been shown to actually increase safety as defined by reduced collisions .
Both simply provide space and thus comfort to bicyclists , and ease of passing for motorists .
BLs , however , give the illusion of safety due to a perceived protective effect from the stripe , but ironically exacerbate certain hazards for the unwary rider , the very rider they are installed to accommodate .
BLs constrain bicyclists in the position where Drive Out , Left Cross , and Right Hook collisions are more likely , and increase the hazard from debris ( see 6 ) .
Two separate bicycle - motor vehicle crash analyses ( Bicycle - Motor Vehicle Crashes in Chapel Hill , 1993 - 1995 and 1996 - 1999 ) spanning 7 years have shown the three most prevalent collisions in Chapel Hill to overwhelmingly be the Drive Out , Left Cross , and Right Hook , crashes that occur at driveway or roadway intersections ( see also 2 ) .
Figure 1 . Drive Out
Figure 2 . Left Cross
Figure 3 . Right Hook Note : the above figures do not reflect BL stripping .
Drive
Out is shown with bicyclist on sidewalk .
The above three types of crashes are partly a result of bicyclists being too close to the edge of the road , and BLs tend to aggravate this problem because of the physical , operational , and visual separation that BLs produce , and the constraining nature of the stripe .
The educational countermeasure for these types of collisions is Use More Lane or Take The Lane .
This message is thwarted by BLs because they restrict bicyclists to be in them .
The two aforementioned studies , which are consistent with nationwide reporting , as well as those undertaken in other communities , have shown the actual risk of bicycle - motor vehicle collision to be very different than the perceived main risk of the bicyclist being struck from behind , known as an Overtaking type crash .
The request for BLs by some bicyclists is a reaction to the perceived risk of an Overtaking collision .
However , this crash is so rare , even in the absence of BLs , as to not warrant attention , especially when one recognizes that the few of these that do occur are typically not preventable with BLs because of the circumstances under which they occur - riding unlit at night or driving with distraction are examples .
Furthermore , the appeal for BLs is fundamentally a desire for additional road space , and most people are unaware of the option of a WOL and its benefits , as well as the little known ( except among " experienced " bicyclists ) but significant dis-benefits of BLs .
2 . Intersections .
The three main adult bicyclist crashes occur at junctions , and a BL adds to complexities at intersections and roads in general .
A 5 - lane road becomes a 7 - lane road when BLs are added .
A WOL does not add to the complexity of the roadway .
With BLs , bicyclists wishing to turn left tend to not merge to the left far enough in advance or at all .
Motorists turning right must turn across the BL .
Drivers may improperly wait to allow bicyclists to overtake on their right , thus obstructing following motor vehicles and creating an ambiguous situation for bicyclists .
A BL encourages bicyclists to overtake motorists on the right side and to go to the front of the queue .
Passing on the right is very risky and leads to many Right Hook collisions .
WOLs enable bicyclist passing on the right , but it is not as formally legitimized as with BLs .
However , BLs can be instructional at intersections with a right - turn - only lane and where a BL through pocket is striped .
3 . Right of Way .
Greater ROW requirements and costs for a standard 12 ' lane with standard 4 ' BL ( 16 ' total feet ) as compared to a 14 ' or 15 ' WOL .
Less total width of a WOL means less impermeable surface to contribute to downstream flooding .
The BLs north of Homestead on Airport road are about 6000 feet long and 5 feet wide , 1 foot wider than is required ( 17 ' of total width including the adjacent lane ) .
Here , 15 ' WOLs would have saved 24,000 ( 2 x 6000 x 2 ) square feet of impermeable surface , and considerable money in ROW acquisition and roadway construction costs .
Furthermore , the excessively wide BLs have predictably become riddled with debris .
4 . Funding .
In NC , special bicycle facilities " raise a red flag " regarding funding .
Money for bicycling requests comes from small dedicated pots , is limited , and thus more difficult to acquire .
A WOL is not an identifiable bicycle facility and thus may be " hidden , " and also funded from a much larger source of money , the STP .
Moreover , funding for BLs from the small pots requires a local match .
This is not the case with WOLs .
WOLs have been the default bicycling " facility " of the NCDOT and the Division of Bicycle and Pedestrian Transportation for more than 20 years for good reason .
5 . Design Standards .
Narrow bicycle facilities have a design standard of 20 mph .
In Chapel Hill , the descents from town center and on other main roads lead bicyclists to routinely achieve speeds of 25 to 40 mph , so BLs are not indicated .
High speed bicycling greatly exacerbates the inherent dangers of curbside riding and BLs in general .
At high speeds , bicyclists should be using the entire lane .
The purpose of a striped - off shoulder is to reduce the risk of run - off - road crashes by motorists , and to provide greater leeway from roadside hazards , not for motor vehicles to drive on .
Why then is it acceptable to ride a bicycle on such a facility ( a BL is essentially a shoulder designated for bicycles ) when there is the risk at high speed ?
BLs must be on both sides of the street , conforming to the " All or None " principle .
Having a BL on one side of the road only , the ascent , is not advised due the even greater possibility of attracting wrong way riders .
WOLs or regular width lanes have no design speed limitations that bicycles typically exceed , and may be on the ascent only , as is the case on parts of Piney Mountain Rd .
Thus , where ROW is at a premium on a hilly road , WOLs can be paired with regular width lanes for even more space and cost savings .
6 . Maintenance and Debris .
BLs collect debris , as do shoulders on any road .
Examination of existing BLs proves this .
The sweeping action of motor vehicles results in the debris being swept into the BL where it stays .
This debris is inconsequential and hardly noticeable to motorists , but is a constant hazard for bicyclists .
Sand , tree debris , and gravel are ubiquitous .
Gravel itself can cause loss of control , but also damages tires , causing sidewall cuts ( which requires costly tire replacement ) resulting in blowouts and possible loss of control .
At the least , debris is an ever present nuisance in BLs .
Thus , BLs require frequent and expensive maintenance , which unfortunately typically does n't happen .
Even if regular maintenance were scheduled , the time between sweepings would still be debris riddled .
WOLs require less , if any , maintenance and cost .
Because WOLs are narrower than a regular lane with BL , and since there is no stripe to keep motorists away from curbside in the absence of bicyclists , the sweeping action of motor vehicles clears debris from WOLs continuously , pushing it closer to the edge and out of bicyclists ' way .
However , there should still be sweeping of WOLs on an as needed basis .
7 . Induced Riding / Perception .
BLs are touted as drawing new , but novice , bicyclists because they " feel " safer .
Is it proper to attract novice riders to potentially dangerous situations because of the perception of safety ?
Novice bicyclists fear getting hit from behind , an unlikely type of collision , and so request BLs , the only on - road accommodation they may know to exist .
They do n't realize the down sides of BLs nor the option of WOLs .
As bicyclists gain knowledge of the actual risks of riding and how to reduce these risks , and become aware of the negative issues surrounding BLs , all of this either by experience or through education , they no longer desire BLs on most roads .
It is argued WOLs serve existing bicyclists well but may do little to encourage would - be bicyclists unless they are " advertised . "
WOLs could be marked with " Share the Road " signs or noted in a brochure or map .
8 . Sociology .
BLs separate and segregate physically , operationally , visually ( left turning drivers do n't readily notice BLs which are much narrower than regular lanes ) , and socially .
§ 20-4.01 ( 49 ) of the NC traffic code says : " ... for the purposes of this Chapter bicycles shall be deemed vehicles and every rider of a bicycle upon a highway shall be subject to the provisions of this Chapter applicable to the driver of a vehicle except those which by their nature can have no application . "
Thus , bicycle riders have equal rights to the road as do other vehicle operators .
A BL has the effect of sending the message to motorists that bicyclists have less right to be out of the BL .
BLs create the expectation in motorists that bicyclists will and must stay " where they belong , " in the BL .
Some motorists make the incorrect assumption that bicyclists should be on the sidewalk .
This can manifest as " Get on the sidewalk ! " yells , honking , or even physical harassment .
When on - road space is specifically outlined for BLs , that assumption is even stronger .
" Get in the Bicycle Lane ! "
Some places have made laws requiring bicyclists to be in BLs unless there is justification to be out of them .
A BL has the effect of teaching novice riders that they must remain in that space , no matter how unsafe it may be .
These riders may then not readily learn vehicular bicycling principles .
New bicyclists more readily learn vehicular bicycling principles in WOLs .
Usually , to the right of the painted line is where a bicyclist would be riding whether there is a stripe or not .
But in the situations where she MUST move out of that space : to make a left turn ( depending on bicyclist speed and traffic conditions , the rider may have to merge out of a BL very far in advance of a turn .
Also , not all left turns are made at intersections .
Many are made into midblock driveways where no break in the BL is provided . ) ; create shy distance from the curb when high speed descending ; avoid illegally parked cars ; peds ; wrong way bicyclists ; debris ; whatever ; a bicyclist may be treated as violating a rule .
" Those &* % $ bicyclists can't even stay in the lanes we gave them ! "
Or worse .
" The accident was her fault .
She was not in the Bicycle Lane where she was supposed to be . "
It is argued that BLs are visible icons to the legitimacy of bicyclists .
But why should bicyclists rely on BLs for legitimacy ?
State law says bicyclists are legitimate on all roads .
Do bicyclists want to be legitimate only on BL roads ?
WOLs or regular width roads can have " Share the Road " or " Bikes Belong " signs if bicyclist legitimacy needs to be affirmed , which it does n't .
A BL tends to restrict bicyclists to a rightmost portion of the road , and this is enforced by some militant drivers .
In a WOL or regular lane , bicyclists are rightly free to ride where they choose .
BLs require no cooperation , and none is manifested .
WOLs require and foster cooperation .
9 . Sidewalk Riding .
BLs and WOLs reduce the incidence of sidewalk riding , which is good , but the strength of the effect of each is unknown and subject to local conditions .
10 . Wrong Way Riding .
BLs more readily enable wrong way riding .
Wrong way riding in BLs is a significant collision threat with motor vehicles , especially those pulling out of side streets and driveways , and also with correct riding bicyclists who are in the same path .
Imagine the hazard to downhill bicyclists on Airport Rd. riding north from Rosemary St. if the bicyclists who currently ride the wrong way on the sidewalk were to ride the wrong way in a newly created BL .
Bicyclists are not as likely ride the wrong way in WOLs , though wrong way riding can and does happen anywhere .
11 . Overtaking Separation Distance .
The separation distance between overtaking motor vehicle and bicycle is slightly less in a BL than in a WOL , even though a WOL is narrower overall .
This is an ironic finding in that a BL is supposed to provide " comfort " to bicyclists from passing motor vehicles , yet drivers pass closer than in a WOL .
The ambiguity in a WOL may cause motorists to move over farther .
With a BL , as long as the bicyclist is in her lane and the motorist in his , there is no need to move over .
Perhaps in a WOL the driver tracks down the left lane line , whereas with a BL the driver centers himself between the two lines or even tracks down the BL .
12 .
Motor vehicle speed .
BLs narrow the motorists ' travel area as compared to a WOL so may have a traffic calming effect .
On the other hand , BLs may result in higher driver speed when overtaking bicyclists than when in a shared WOL .
BLs allow motorists to pass bicyclists without slowing down .
As long as the driver is in his lane and the bicyclist in hers , why slow down ?
The ambiguity of a WOL induces motorist caution , thus slower speed .
This has not been formally studied ( it would be nearly impossible to undertake ) , but it is common anecdotal knowledge among experienced bicyclists .
13 . Motor Vehicle Encroachment .
There is greater uniformity of motor vehicle tracking , and motorists are less likely to encroach on the adjacent travel lane when overtaking a bicyclist in a BL .
However , encroachments are not necessarily a bad thing .
There is no evidence of motorist collisions due to bicyclist induced encroachments .
Moreover , this finding is questionable .
The study has design flaws .
14 . Bicyclist Lateral Position .
Bicyclists are more likely to ride further from the edge of the roadway in a BL than in a WOL .
This has several advantages , but also the disadvantage of being passed closer ( 11 ) .
However , why bicyclists ride further from the roadway edge in a BL is unknown , but could be due to greater bravery on the part of the bicyclist , or more curbside debris in the BL which forces the rider further out .
15 . Buffer Zone .
BLs provide a tangible buffer for pedestrians , especially along roads with no sidewalk setback from the curb .
BLs are also a buffer for drivers pulling out from driveways to enter the roadway .
This is good for drivers , bad for bicyclists who may be obstructed or struck .
WOLs are not a formalized buffer , but provide greater separation distance than a standard width lane .
16 . Permanence .
BLs are politically difficult to remove once in place .
A WOL may be more easily converted to additional travel lanes .
This should not be a problem in Chapel Hill however .
17 . Parking .
It is argued that BLs in urban areas diminish the availability of on - street parking , which , from a cyclist 's viewpoint , is not all that bad .
However , as with BLs , " No Parking " signs can be placed along WOLs .
However , once painted , BLs have ha habbit of staying in place .
In any case , parking is an anathma to bicycling for several operational ( items 1 - 4 ) and philosophical ( item 5 ) reasons :
The space occupied by parked cars is potentially useful for bicycles to travel on .
Parking narrows the available travel corridor , reducing driver overtaking space and causing some bicyclists to feel less comfortable .
Parking turnover , the pulling into and out of spaces , can be a hazard to bicyclists .
The extended door of disembarking drivers is a hazard to bicyclists who , in error , ride within a doors width of the parked cars .
Turning onto a road with on - street parking from side streets is more difficult due to reduced visibility from the parked cars .
Note that motorists also have this problem .
Some bicyclists feel marginalized because the storage of privately owned automobiles on a public right - of - way has superseded their concerns , items 1 - 4 above .
When to use bicycle lanes ( or striped shoulders ) .
BLs are best used , if at all , on higher speed ( 45 speed limit ) roads with few driveways , intersections , and turning movements for both bicyclists and motorists , the lack of high speed bicycle descents , and where commitment is made for regular debris cleanup .
An example is 15 - 501 bypass .
( Here , there are four foot shoulders , and these could have been specified as BLs except that it was easier to fund them as shoulders , and they essentially function like BLs anyway .
But , there is no commitment to debris removal . )
WOLs are appropriate everywhere else .
Airport Rd. and Raleigh Rd. both have 15 ' WOLs from curb face to line .
These function very well for both bicyclists and motorists .
Ideally though , they would be 15 ' from edge of gutter pan to line , providing even more space .
Unfortunately , BLs locally have been placed inappropriately on low speed roads that would be better served with WOLs .
All of the roads with BLs in Carrboro and Chapel Hill would be easy places to ride a bicycle without the stripe given the same or similar total available road space .

Most people got married in June because they took their yearly bath in May , and still smelled pretty good by June .
However , they were starting to smell , so brides carried a bouquet of flowers to hide the body odor .
Hence the custom today of carrying a bouquet when getting married .
Baths consisted of a big tub filled with hot water .
The man of thehouse had the privilege of the nice clean water , then all the other sons and men , then the women and finally the children .
Last of all the babies .
By then the water was so dirty you could actually lose someone in it .
Hence the saying , " Don 'tthrow the baby out with the bath water .
" Houses had thatched roofs - thick straw - piled high , with no wood underneath .
It was the only place for animals to get warm , so all the cats and other small animals ( mice , bugs ) lived in the roof .
When it rained it became slippery and sometimes the animals would slip off the roof .
Hence the saying " It 's raining cats and dogs .
" There was nothing to stop things from falling into the house .
Thisposed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppingscould mess up your nice clean bed .
Hence , a bed with big posts anda sheet hung over the top afforded some protection .
That 's how canopybeds came into existence .
The floor was dirt .
Only the wealthy had something other than dirt .
Hence the saying " dirt poor . "
The wealthy had slate floors that wouldget slippery in the winter when wet , so they spread thresh ( straw ) onfloor to help keep their footing .
As the winter wore on , they adding morethresh until , when you opened the door , it would all start slipping outside .
Apiece of wood was placed in the entranceway .
Hence the saying a " threshhold .
"
In those old days , they cooked in the kitchen with a big kettle thatalways hung over the fire .
Every day they lit the fire and added things to the pot .
They ate mostly vegetables and did not get much meat .
They would eatthe stew for dinner , leaving leftovers in the pot to get cold overnight and thenstart over the next day .
Sometimes stew had food in it that had been there for quite a while .
Hence the rhyme , " Peas porridge hot , peas porridge cold , peas porridge in the pot nine days old .
" Sometimes they could obtain pork , which made them feel quite special .
When visitors came over , they would hang up their bacon to show off .
It was a sign of wealth that a man could " bring home the bacon . "
Theywould cut off a little to share with guests and would all sit around and " chew the fat .
" Those with money had plates made of pewter .
Food with high acid contentcaused some of the lead to leach onto the food , causing lead poisoning death .
This happened most often with tomatoes , so for the next 400 years or so , tomatoes were considered poisonous .
Bread was divided according to status .
Workers got the burnt bottom ofthe loaf , the family got the middle , and guests got the top , or " uppercrust .
" Lead cups were used to drink ale or whisky .
The combination would sometimes knock the imbibers out for a couple of days .
Someonewalking along the road would take them for dead and prepare them forburial .
They were laid out on the kitchen table for a couple of daysand the family would gather around and eat and drink and wait andsee if they would wake up .
Hence the custom of holding a " wake .
" England is old and small and the local folks started running out of places to bury people .
So they would dig up coffins and would take the bones to a " bone - house " and reuse the grave .
When reopening these coffins , 1 outof 25 coffins were found to have scratch marks on the inside and theyrealized they had been burying people alive .
So they would tie a string on the wrist of the corpse , lead it through the coffin and up through the ground and tie it to a bell .
Someone would have to sit out in the graveyard all night ( the " graveyard shift " ) to listen for the bell ; thus , someone could be " saved by the bell " or was considered a " dead ringer . " ( , Fri 18 Mar 2005 , 2:46 , Reply
The Destruction of the US Empire
Edward Gibbon described the happiest age of mankind as the period of the “ five good emperors ” between AD98 and AD180 , when Marcus Aurelius died .
What was America ’s Golden Age ?
It is much too soon to write the history of America ’s decline and fall .
Still , that does n’t stop us from guessing .
We would name the period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of Lehman Bros – a period of only 19 years – as the peak of US power and wealth .
Of course , Americans were dreaming during those years .
The dreams were the usual imperial sort – that the US Empire was such a benefit to the rest of the world that the foreigners would support it indefinitely .
Rome did n’t take any chances ; it forced its conquered nations to render tribute … slaves … gold … and wheat .
The American empire depended on trade … and the dollar .
As long as the United States had a commercial advantage , the empire was profitable .
But as the 20th century aged , so did the US economy .
Its competitors – notably Germany and Japan – had a big advantage .
They had been bombed out in the ’40s .
They could build anew .
America ’s trade advantage slipped away … and then its trade balance went negative in the mid-’80s .
It has been getting more negative almost every year .
The trade losses shrank after the fall of the House of Lehman .
Americans cut back .
But today we get news that the trade deficit has just grown more than in any month in the last 10 years .
Have Americans suddenly become big spenders again ?
Probably not .
But we ’ll have to wait for another explanation ; we do n’t have one .
No account of America ’s glory years – roughly the period between the reign of George Bush I and that of his son , George Bush II – would be complete without mention of the events that happened on this day eight years ago .
A small group of terrorists pulled off an amazing coup – bringing down two of America ’s iconic buildings , right in the heart of New York City … and on primetime TV !
Historians might be tempted to use this event as a milestone , marking the end of the period of maximum happiness in the United States of America .
We caution against it .
It was only later that it became apparent that the US reaction to the terrorist incident was suicidal .
The nation desperately needed to bring its ambitions back in line with its means .
It needed to save and invest in new factories and new infrastructure .
Instead , it wasted trillions fighting phantoms and nobodies .
But as far as anyone knew , US influence , prestige and power remained near its zenith throughout the wars on terror and Iraq .
The fall of Lehman changed things .
Then it was obvious that not only was America vulnerable , she was an enemy to herself .
She had diddle - daddled during the glory years , dawdling with the lion cubs that would grow up and maul her .
Now , in the period we are living through , she attempts to go back to sleep and rerun her balmy dreams .
That is what “ recovery ” is all about – a return to the land of nod and nonsense … in which people think they can actually become wealthier by squandering money they do n’t have on things they do n’t need .
Fortunately , as near as we can tell , most private citizens are now awake .
A report at the beginning of this week showed that they repaid debt at a rate four times faster than economists projected .
Savings rates are rising .
Spending is falling .
People are doing what they should do – they ’re cutting back .
But the feds continue their efforts to sabotage the correction and destroy the empire .
They have already blown - up the budget – with $ 9 trillion in deficits expected over the next 10 years .
Now , they ’re working on the dollar .
Yesterday , the dollar fell to $ 1.45 per euro .
Gold remained just below the $ 1,000 an ounce mark .
And the Dow rose 80 points .
Stock market investors seem to be looking forward to another big bull market .
But with the economy deteriorating , they are probably just dreaming , too .
Median household income fell 3.6 % over the last 12 months .
Of course , that ’s just what you ’d expect in a correction .
But it ’s not what the feds were hoping for .
So , they ’re pulling out all the stops to try to turn it around .
Most important , they ’re pulling out the stop that keeps the dollar from rolling down the hill .
The empire sinks into the mud .
Yes , this is the downhill period … the slide into corruption … the period in which Juvenal complained that Romans were only interested in ‘ bread and circuses . ’
When you are on the board of a decent corporation , for example , if you have a direct financial interest in a matter under consideration you ’re expected to ‘ declare an interest ’ and absent yourself from the vote .
But in a mature democracy , the most self - interested citizens are those most likely to vote .
Currently , about 20 million people work for government .
About 45 million receive Social Security benefits .
About 34 million depend on food stamps .
( People who count on the government to feed them , warned Jefferson , “ will soon want bread . ”
That does n’t seem to worry many people .
But at least the state of Maryland has an Orwellian sense of humor about it .
People who depend on government for food are given “ Independence ” cards . )
That ’s 99 million people who have a direct interest in expanding government outlays … with some overlap , of course .
And it does n’t mean that every person receiving a Social Security check is going to back the feds .
But it does n’t count all the millions more who get subsidies , bailouts , welfare payments ( often masquerading as tax credits ) , government contracts , and so forth , either .
Well , how many people does it take to win a national election ?
Obama won with 63 million votes .
The dollar ’s weakness has n’t been missed by it biggest foreign holder – China .
Reported earlier this week in the Telegraph :
“ ‘ We hope there will be a change in monetary policy as soon as they have positive growth again , ’ said Cheng Siwei…talking about America .
“ ‘ If they keep printing money to buy bonds it will lead to inflation , and after a year or two the dollar will fall hard .
Most of our foreign reserves are in US bonds and this is very difficult to change , so we will diversify incremental reserves into euros , yen , and other currencies , ’ he said .
“ China ’s reserves are more than – $ 2 trillion , the world ’s largest .
“ Mr. Siwei continued : ‘ Gold is definitely an alternative , but when we buy , the price goes up .
We have to do it carefully so as not to stimulate the markets , ’ he added . ”
Then , two days ago , in came a report that China is going to issue bonds of its own – in yuan .
This news is a shot across the bow of America ’s imperial currency .
It signals that China is moving into position to eventually challenge the greenback .
Investors will have another alternative to the dollar … another bond issued by another government and backed by another economy … maybe one that is on the way up , rather than on the way down .
Meanwhile , Americans grow poorer .
Bloomberg reports :
“ ‘ The decline in incomes we ’re seeing certainly has implications for consumer spending , particularly post - housing bubble when families can’t tap into home equity through loans , ’ said Heather Boushey , a senior economist at the Center for American Progress , a research organization headed by John Podesta , a leader of the Obama administration transition team .
“ The poverty rate is likely to keep rising through 2012 , even after the recession ends , adding to pressure on the Obama administration to enact a second economic stimulus package , said Isabel Sawhill , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington , a policy research group .
“ ‘ We will likely have not only a jobless recovery but also a poverty - ridden recovery , ’ Sawhill said .
‘ The stimulus money is going to go away long before the poverty rate peaks . ’ ”
Norway 's data protection department has indicated that ISPs must delete all personal IP address - related data just 3 weeks after collection .
The instruction , initially given to two ISPs but applicable to them all , means that it will be incredibly difficult to take action against file - sharers .
Previously it has n’t been particularly easy for copyright holders to go after alleged infringers in Norway , but just recently the country ’s telecoms regulator said that file - sharers ’ identities can be given to copyright holders , providing a court agrees there is a good reason to hand them over .
This means that these individuals can be pursued through the courts , or through “ pay up or else ” type threats .
However , the authority in charge of data protection in Norway has just made that process much , much harder for the copyright holders , since it has instructed two ISPs – Tele2 and Lyse Tele – to delete all IP address - related personal information they hold on their customers which is more than 3 weeks old .
According to Aftenposten the decision , borne of the Personal Data Act which prohibits the storage of unnecessary data , will apply to all ISPs in Norway such as Canal Digital , NextGenTel , Telenor and others .
The fact that data can only be held for just 21 days will see the immediate deletion of IP information held on around 1.6 million subscribers by these Norwegian ISPs .
However , the decision flies in the face of European Union rules which say that this type of data must be held for at least 6 months – right now in Norway , data retention can be anything from a few days to five months .
The process of monitoring file - sharers , gathering evidence and then collating it all into an acceptable format can be time consuming .
Add this to the time taken to get into the system to obtain a court order from a judge to force the ISPs to hand over data on their customers , and you end up with a period longer than 21 days .
By which time the data has gone and the evidence becomes useless , since it ’s impossible to identity the alleged infringer .
Movie industry lawyer Espen Tondel is n’t going to like this , one little bit .

Any game that you play will more than likely have a Capture - The - Flag mode .
It ’s such a simple concept , yet it never gets old , since it keeps the game so competitive .
After years of “ capturing the flag ” it ’s time we try to get our hands on something else … overweight royalty , perhaps ?
The gameplay of Fat Princess just revolves around a blue team and a red team having to steal their princess back from the castle on the other side of the map .
While some may think “ Capture the flag games get old , quickly Hollowman .
How the hell am I supposed to feel challenged ? ! ”
Well , skeptical ones , ever had the flag get larger and become harder to carry ?
Did n’t think so .
That ’s the premise of this delightful game , while you are trying to retrieve your princess , the enemies will keep stuffing her with cake , making her harder to carry .
This game does n’t bother with complicated mechanics , they just throw you in to the world , and want you to have fun .
The classes are simple ; workers gather resources , mages cast offensive spells , priests can heal , warriors are your muscle , and rangers are used for long - range combat .
To change between classes , is as easy as putting on a hat , which I think anybody with ADD can appreciate .
The simplicity follows through with pretty much everything in the game , it never gets more complicated than just stealing your princess back and protecting her .
I found myself hopping into a few games with people who knew what they were doing , and the matches lasted an extremely long time ; it pretty much just felt like a stalemate .
While some matches dragged on , it was one of the most fun times i’ve had with a PSN title .
They actually added a single player campaign in this mostly - multiplayer affair , but do n’t get too excited , it ’s very short .
How short you ask ?
The story mode has six chapters , which you will probably beat in one sitting .
They really just threw the single player campaign in there to get you acquainted with the mechanics of the game .
For instance , in one Chapter you will have to take over outposts , while in another you are told to only capture the Princess .
Not a very compelling campaign , but I was glad I played through it and thought of some good strategies to use in multiplayer .
What little story there is will probably still make you laugh with its odd humor told by a proper British narrator .
After you finish the story mode , you can try your hand in the Gladiate Arena and see if you can last a number of rounds against waves of enemies .
The arena was kind of nice in between rounds of multiplayer , but nothing really special .
I guess for the most part , the single - player stuff feels kind of tacked on , but you will probably be spending most of your time playing online , anyways .
Besides the cutesy graphics , the most charming aspect of the game has to be the humor .
You can tell the developers at Titan Studios have a great sense of humor that shows even on the very fist menu .
When you boot up the game , you are asked to “ Play with Others ” or “ Play with Yourself ” … juvenile ?
Yes …funny ?
Hell yeah !
I can recall the very first time I walked up to the enemy castle and spotted the princess , a text bubble popped up that said , “ Oh my god , Becky , look at her butt !
She looks like one of those rap guy ’s girlfriends . ”
That ’s not the only Sir - Mix - A - Lot reference , oh no , the credits play the entire song , while you kill the creators of the game …very creative .
I think the reason most people will be drawn towards the game is the art style as well , as the humor .
It reminds me very much of Happy Tree Friends in many ways , seeing a group of tiny soldiers turn into a giant red splotch .
To sum it up , the game feels like Animal Crossing meets Castle Crashers with its perfect blend of cutesy crap and immense pools of blood .
Now , I have raved about how accessible and funny Fat Princess is , but there are some major flaws that not even the trusty , worker class could fix .
A game like this really requires teamwork , without it , you will just spend most of the time running around the map like a chicken with your head cut off .
It ’s a real shame the PS3 is n’t packaged with a microphone , since it makes the game much more enjoyable when you can coordinate a group of guys to raid the enemy castle .
Out of the number of games I hopped in , I found very few people with mics , and the sometimes the ones who did , would n’t even work as a team , it can become very frustrating .
Apart from a few issues with teamwork , I noticed a bit of lag in a few games , as well .
While the lag I encountered was n’t game breaking by any means , it was just a bit annoying .
Fat Princess is a bit pricey , weighing in at fifteen bucks ; a somewhat hefty price for a core- multiplayer game … is it still worth a buy ?
Absolutely !
I have never been a fan of games that were strictly multiplayer , and in fact the first few times I played this game , I really did n’t care for it .
The thing is , the humor , and the ease of which you can just hop in a game and start raiding a castle are what made the game slowly grow on me .
While the game may not be very deep , it really makes up for it with it ’s fun factor .
For those worried about this game dying out sometime soon , fear not , this game is going to stay lively for quite some time .
They have new maps coming in the form of DLC ( New Pork City is the first one coming out ) , and these new maps are going to add more longevity to an already solid experience .
Let your inner chubby chaser out and rescue your Fat Princess .
About
JRX is inspired by the RX tool of ActiveState 's Komodo IDE .
Although RX is more powerful and supports Perl Regular Expressions ( almost ? ) fully , I 've needed an always - accessible and installation - free implementation .
So , here it is : a single , ultra - compact HTML file , without any external file ;)
Save it to your disk if you like , or use online for latest version .
You might also be interested in Ted Mielczarek 's Extension Developer 's Extension , it includes JRX among some other very useful stuff , it 's terrific !
This is not an AJAX application , you can save the page locally and use it off - line .
Compatibility
I 'd tested older versions of JRX with Mozilla 1.3 , IE 6.0 and Opera 7.1 , and JRX worked OK in all of them .
However , IE6 and Opera have had back then some funny bugs with JavaScript and CSS , and I 'm getting tired of IEs inferior CSS / JS - support ( I 'm not sure of IE7 , I do n't have it ) .
Therefore , I was testing the latest versions only with Mozilla Firefox > =v1.5 ; JRX may or may not work in Opera .
I 'd be happy if you can come up with code submissions which fix things with IE / Opera , but most likely I will not do it myself .
I 'm still keeping the latest working version for IE / Opera anyway .
Have fun .
Recent changes
I 've added matched substrings ' starting and ending positions to the results list
Clicking or hovering on the results will highlight matched portion on the target text and double - clicking will jump to the textarea ; unfortunately you cannot scroll the textareas to the selected portion :(
Hovering over the results will show the parenthesized substrings
Target text can be evaluated before the matching is done ( see below for explanation )
RegExp - based replacements ; also if you have parenthesized groups , you can use $ 1 , $ 2 , etc. or $ &
I 've changed the split code , it now does not use String.split ( ) , since String.split ( ) does n't know about matched portions ' positions
Settings are automatically saved via cookies ( yippee ! ) and your last regexp and text will be preserved ; note that cookies will not work if you work locally
work if you work locally
There 's a compact mode now , JRX should easily fit into smallest browser windows ( see the note about this option & re-distribution below )
Number of iterations is hard - limited to 250 , in order to avoid infinite evaluations ( e.g. due to backtracking )
Got rid of " Auto - update " option , " Refresh " & " Clear text " buttons
Changed the accesskeys so that most of them can be accessed with the options ' first letters
Fixed a bug with regexps using * , e.g. /b*/ matched against " Hello world " repeatedly the first empty string ( pos:0 - >0 )
Lots of small changes and some cleanup in code
Unfortunately , I have no time to implement lots lots of workarounds for IE 's bugs , so I will rarely test JRX with IE from now on and write code for IE only if it 's extremely easy !
Unless new bugs are discovered , I 'll add no more features to this beta and release it as final .
To do
I 'm considering to add a few other tools and cosmetic changes , such as :
Regexp examples for common tasks , e.g. matching dates , emails , domain names , etc .
Perl - style extended regular expressions , i.e. with multiple lines , comments , etc , but it 's no top priority at the moment ; contact me if you can help on this
A tabbed interface ( why ?!?)
Real - time JavaScript Evaluator ( why ?!? , there is this awesome JavaScript Shell and another terrific JavaScript Development Environment )
Hexadecimal <-> Decimal converter
Encoder - Decoder using un/escape ( ) , de/encodeURI ( ) , de/encodeURIComponent ( )
( I 'm letting myself go )
The subroutine which will compute the answer to life , the universe and everything
Though these might be useful to do everything on one place , it will also bloat the page , so they might be never implemented .
Mini FAQ
Q . Why are my results shown twice , if I use global and parentheses ?
A. Results always include $ 0 , which means , if you use , e.g. ( ^.*$ ) , $ 0 is implicitly the whole matched string and $ 1 is your backreference !
Now if you pack your whole regexp into parentheses , $ 0 & $ 1 will be naturally the same , therefore shown twice : )
... try the above regexp with multiline ( m ) & global ( g ) , and you 'll see .
Results show only $ 0 now , hover over the results to see the substrings .
Q . What does " Eval target text " do ?
A . It substitutes escaped chars \t \r
\f \v with their respective values , before matching the regexp !
To see this in action enter " foo \t bar " as target text and " ( \S+ ) ( \s + ) ( \S+ ) " as regexp
and try matching with and without this options .
Note that the inline linebreaks in the target are not escaped ; you should use
in that case .
Also note that the highlighting does not function well when this option is active , yet .
Q . Why is text length shown " incorrectly " if use newlines ?
A. ( Firefox ' ) HTML textareas interpret Enter key as ASCII code 0x0A ( aka
) and " a< ENTERKEY > b " returns a length of 3 whereas other editors show a length of 4 using 0x0D+0x0A ( aka \r
) .
So be cautious if text length is extremely important for you and / or if you match / split by
, \s , etc .
Q. How can I backreference inside my regexp ?
A . For example , to match ISO - type dates ( yyyy - mm - dd ) you could use ( \d{4} ) ( [/.-] ) ( \d{2} ) \2( \d{2} ) ( this is a practical example , but not validating ) .
Note the \ 2 it ensures that the same delimiter is used afterwards .
BTW , a complete date - validating regexp is nearly impossible , due to the leap years , but an approximate solution would be : ( \d{4} ) ( [ /.-] ) ( 0\d | 1 [ 0 - 2 ] ) \2( [ 012 ] \d| 3[01 ] ) , though this would match 9876 - 02 - 30 , too , I 'll leave the rest as an exercise .
